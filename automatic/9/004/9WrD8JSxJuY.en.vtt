calm<00:00:04.529> in<00:00:05.460> this<00:00:05.940> video<00:00:06.240> I'll<00:00:06.509> show<00:00:06.839> you<00:00:06.899> the

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
calm in this video I'll show you the

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.280 
calm in this video I'll show you the
nano<00:00:07.740> diffuser<00:00:08.250> that<00:00:08.400> we<00:00:08.610> sell<00:00:09.050> I'm<00:00:10.050> sure

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
nano diffuser that we sell I'm sure

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.650 
nano diffuser that we sell I'm sure
you're<00:00:10.440> familiar<00:00:10.559> with<00:00:10.889> normal<00:00:11.759> air<00:00:12.000> stones

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
you're familiar with normal air stones

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.680 
you're familiar with normal air stones
that<00:00:13.440> are<00:00:13.559> used<00:00:13.710> in<00:00:13.920> fish<00:00:14.070> tanks

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
that are used in fish tanks

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.750 
that are used in fish tanks
well<00:00:15.690> none<00:00:16.109> our<00:00:16.260> diffusers<00:00:16.920> are<00:00:16.949> pretty<00:00:17.520> much

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
well none our diffusers are pretty much

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.090 
well none our diffusers are pretty much
the<00:00:18.090> same<00:00:18.359> in<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:19.980> they<00:00:20.189> also<00:00:20.430> make<00:00:20.939> bubbles

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
the same in that they also make bubbles

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.179 
the same in that they also make bubbles
the<00:00:23.100> difference<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:24.199> the<00:00:25.199> bubbles<00:00:25.500> made<00:00:25.680> by<00:00:25.890> a

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
the difference is the bubbles made by a

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.269 
the difference is the bubbles made by a
nano<00:00:26.490> diffuser<00:00:27.000> are<00:00:27.869> much<00:00:28.050> smaller<00:00:28.380> than<00:00:29.039> ones

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
nano diffuser are much smaller than ones

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.840 
nano diffuser are much smaller than ones
made<00:00:29.609> by<00:00:29.640> normal<00:00:30.510> air<00:00:30.689> stones<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.669> this<00:00:32.669> is

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
made by normal air stones and this is

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.600 
made by normal air stones and this is
important<00:00:33.360> because<00:00:33.920> the<00:00:34.920> whole<00:00:35.100> aim<00:00:35.340> of

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
important because the whole aim of

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.069 
important because the whole aim of
diffusing<00:00:36.239> co2<00:00:36.980> in<00:00:37.980> your<00:00:38.239> water<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.750> get<00:00:39.930> as

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
much of it diffused as you can and a lot

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.639 
much of it diffused as you can and a lot
of<00:00:43.980> small<00:00:44.520> bubbles<00:00:44.989> have<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.170> much<00:00:46.350> larger

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
of small bubbles have a much larger

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.130 
of small bubbles have a much larger
surface<00:00:47.280> area<00:00:47.930> then<00:00:48.930> fewer<00:00:49.530> small<00:00:49.890> bubbles<00:00:51.140> so

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
surface area then fewer small bubbles so

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.189 
surface area then fewer small bubbles so
the<00:00:52.680> absorption<00:00:53.129> rate<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.670> much<00:00:53.850> better<00:00:54.199> using

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
the absorption rate is much better using

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.170 
the absorption rate is much better using
small<00:00:55.500> bubbles<00:00:55.860> than<00:00:56.160> using<00:00:56.520> large<00:00:56.730> bubbles

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
small bubbles than using large bubbles

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.220 
small bubbles than using large bubbles
and<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:58.399> nano<00:00:59.399> diffuser<00:00:59.910> creates<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:00.809> mr.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
and a nano diffuser creates this mr.

bubbles<00:01:01.680> by<00:01:02.520> forcing<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.270> co2<00:01:03.979> through<00:01:04.979> a

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
bubbles by forcing the co2 through a

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.550 
bubbles by forcing the co2 through a
ceramic<00:01:06.060> disc<00:01:06.450> which<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.990> can<00:01:07.140> see<00:01:07.350> here

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
ceramic disc which you can see here

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:15.960 
ceramic disc which you can see here
that's<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.010> white<00:01:08.220> thing

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.970 

one<00:01:16.510> of<00:01:16.630> the<00:01:16.780> things<00:01:17.170> to<00:01:17.380> look<00:01:17.410> for<00:01:17.770> when

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:17.980 
one of the things to look for when

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.060 
one of the things to look for when
you're<00:01:18.490> diffusing<00:01:19.090> co2<00:01:19.480> in<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:19.780> water<00:01:19.900> is<00:01:20.860> how

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
you're diffusing co2 in the water is how

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.400 
you're diffusing co2 in the water is how
much<00:01:21.280> of<00:01:21.550> it<00:01:21.900> bubbles<00:01:22.900> up<00:01:22.990> to<00:01:23.050> the<00:01:23.170> surface<00:01:23.790> and

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
much of it bubbles up to the surface and

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.820 
much of it bubbles up to the surface and
escapes<00:01:26.410> out<00:01:26.680> the<00:01:26.860> top<00:01:27.240> if<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:29.320> see<00:01:29.530> bubbles

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
escapes out the top if you see bubbles

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.210 
escapes out the top if you see bubbles
reaching<00:01:30.460> the<00:01:30.580> surface<00:01:31.110> then<00:01:32.110> that<00:01:32.860> co2

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
reaching the surface then that co2

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.920 
reaching the surface then that co2
hasn't<00:01:34.120> been<00:01:34.780> diffused<00:01:35.380> in<00:01:35.560> the<00:01:35.650> water<00:01:35.860> and

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
hasn't been diffused in the water and

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.210 
hasn't been diffused in the water and
instead<00:01:37.930> you've<00:01:38.260> just<00:01:38.470> pumped<00:01:38.770> it<00:01:38.890> into<00:01:39.100> the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
instead you've just pumped it into the

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.480 
instead you've just pumped it into the
atmosphere<00:01:39.340> and<00:01:39.970> I<00:01:40.000> did<00:01:40.930> a<00:01:40.960> little<00:01:41.440> bit<00:01:41.560> to<00:01:41.920> the

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
atmosphere and I did a little bit to the

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
atmosphere and I did a little bit to the
greenhouse<00:01:42.700> effect

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
greenhouse effect

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.380 
greenhouse effect
which<00:01:43.840> isn't<00:01:44.020> good<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:45.460> so<00:01:45.970> as<00:01:46.120> you<00:01:46.240> can<00:01:46.330> see

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
which isn't good and so as you can see

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.000 
which isn't good and so as you can see
in<00:01:46.660> this<00:01:46.780> case<00:01:47.080> with<00:01:47.320> the<00:01:47.410> Nano<00:01:47.590> diffuser

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
in this case with the Nano diffuser

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.070 
in this case with the Nano diffuser
quite<00:01:48.370> a<00:01:48.400> lot<00:01:48.580> of<00:01:48.640> bubbles<00:01:48.910> are<00:01:49.450> reaching<00:01:49.960> the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
quite a lot of bubbles are reaching the

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.800 
quite a lot of bubbles are reaching the
surface<00:01:50.580> but<00:01:51.580> one<00:01:51.760> way<00:01:51.940> of<00:01:52.090> minimizing<00:01:52.300> that

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
surface but one way of minimizing that

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.360 
surface but one way of minimizing that
is<00:01:53.140> to<00:01:53.800> position<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:55.030> Nano<00:01:55.510> diffuser

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
is to position the Nano diffuser

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.570 
is to position the Nano diffuser
underneath<00:01:57.370> and<00:01:57.760> the<00:01:58.570> your<00:01:58.960> filter<00:01:59.350> or<00:01:59.590> the

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
underneath and the your filter or the

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.200 
underneath and the your filter or the
outlet<00:02:00.820> from<00:02:01.060> your<00:02:01.210> filter<00:02:01.690> which<00:02:02.680> will<00:02:02.860> then

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
outlet from your filter which will then

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.870 
outlet from your filter which will then
then<00:02:04.470> push<00:02:05.470> the<00:02:05.710> bubbles<00:02:05.860> around<00:02:06.280> your<00:02:06.580> tank<00:02:06.760> a

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
then push the bubbles around your tank a

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.850 
then push the bubbles around your tank a
bit<00:02:07.000> more<00:02:07.240> and<00:02:07.540> give<00:02:08.050> the<00:02:08.170> bubbles<00:02:08.440> a<00:02:08.530> bit<00:02:08.679> more

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
bit more and give the bubbles a bit more

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.390 
bit more and give the bubbles a bit more
time<00:02:09.070> to<00:02:09.130> get<00:02:09.429> diffused<00:02:09.760> in<00:02:10.149> your<00:02:10.300> water

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
time to get diffused in your water

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.180 
time to get diffused in your water
so<00:02:12.400> although<00:02:12.760> nano<00:02:13.240> diffusers<00:02:13.980> aren't<00:02:14.980> maybe

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
so although nano diffusers aren't maybe

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.050 
so although nano diffusers aren't maybe
the<00:02:15.370> best<00:02:15.580> diffuser<00:02:17.370> we<00:02:18.370> do<00:02:18.640> rate<00:02:18.850> them

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
the best diffuser we do rate them

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.699 
the best diffuser we do rate them
probably<00:02:19.360> as<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.840> second<00:02:20.260> best<00:02:20.410> type<00:02:20.680> of

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
probably as the second best type of

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.670 
probably as the second best type of
diffuser<00:02:21.280> behind<00:02:22.239> a<00:02:22.390> mixer<00:02:22.810> diffuser<00:02:23.230> or<00:02:23.590> a
