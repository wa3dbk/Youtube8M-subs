00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:06.700
 good for this recipe we will need 

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:11.019
 of ham oaxaca cheese or any prisoner 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.730
 that you can melt 2 eggs oil 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.259
 olive vegetable oil the oil that 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.410
 you usually use for 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:19.090
 cook and bread crushed equal the bread crumbled 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.070
 that is of your preference as they can 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.390
 see are very few ingredients and 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.550
 let's start that for these rolls 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.350
 and we wanted the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.920
 is to spread our slices of ham 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:32.469
 and we are going to put our cheese in the 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.329
 ham we're going to start rolling the 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:36.550
 ham so that the cheese is left 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.680
 inside the ham as easy as that 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.930
 we are simply going to roll up our 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.850
 slices of ham with the cheese inside 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.290
 I know what you want and the ham 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.390
 also that you want the one 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.550
 they usually give to their family is 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.260
 shaman and is that that is perfect and 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.270
 well let's do all of our 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.270
 ham rolls with cheese 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.380
 then on a plate we are going to put 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:13.840
 our two eggs and we're going to 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.479
 stirring with a fork is not necessary 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.520
 mix them for a long time or 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.219
 superior and the only thing we need is 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.719
 Mix well the yolk rinse and 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:24.579
 Mix them for a few seconds 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:27.429
 it's fine tracking partitions 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:29.009
 we also need to mix so much and one 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:30.159
 Once our eggs are there 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.590
 mixed 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.569
 now let's put the ground bread of a 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.179
 side and the eggs that we mix from the other 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:39.189
 side let's move our rolls 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:41.530
 the egg well soaked and egg 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.869
 then we passed them through the ground bread 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.119
 it means that men to bread 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.579
 but first we went through the egg and 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.439
 then we went through the milled metal 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:51.549
 as you can see it's super easy but if 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.189
 you have to try to breed the 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.150
 meringues that stays well attached 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.550
 ground bread 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.020
 in the rolls that we already passed to the disc 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.270
 of the egg because when it comes to rules 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.190
 they can be spread tito palmolive 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.960
 it can not be handled very well then 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.330
 you have to try to empathize the super 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.150
 super good on the pale team you have to 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.470
 have well thought and good cosmetics and that 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.230
 is what we're going to do the same with everyone 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.320
 the rolls that we already made of ham with 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.320
 cheese 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.630
 none of them have also performed 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.480
 it's all their rolls and the only thing 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.400
 we have left is to fry them in a 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.530
 pan let's put to warm a bit 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.209
 oil is already olive oil 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.880
 vegetable the oil that you 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.950
 accustom to use in your kitchen is 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.840
 well we are going to fry and 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.730
 also those to everyone's liking to me 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.370
 the truth is that I love fried 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.930
 and crispy to my family I also 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.240
 they like it like that so you can 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.430
 hairs well to taste you live 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.650
 familiar and already once we finish 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.080
 frei in our rolls we are going to 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.000
 put them on a napkin or on a 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.280
 paper to drain the well and try to 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.110
 Take away the excess oil because 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.640
 Well, it's not the case, really, eating with 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.920
 so much oil so let's try to 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.890
 remove the oil that was left to the 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.870
 rollitos and the richest thing is to go on 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.660
 serve them can accompany them with 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.120
 some vegetable salad is not 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.400
 I know in this case I'm accompanying you 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.650
 with some cucumbers and my daughter 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.570
 love to eat them with mayonnaise and capsa 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.610
 so this recipe is for all the 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.010
 family the truth is that it is delicious 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.350
