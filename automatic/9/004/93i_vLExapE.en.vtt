and your number 10 cans these are all

and your number 10 cans these are all
well<00:00:24.419> and<00:00:24.570> good<00:00:24.659> but<00:00:24.989> the<00:00:25.470> number<00:00:25.769> one<00:00:25.919> mistake

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
well and good but the number one mistake

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.220 
well and good but the number one mistake
that<00:00:26.489> I<00:00:26.550> see<00:00:26.640> people<00:00:26.820> making<00:00:27.300> over<00:00:27.659> and<00:00:27.989> over

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
that I see people making over and over

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.009 
that I see people making over and over
again<00:00:28.319> is<00:00:28.589> that<00:00:28.739> they're<00:00:28.949> storing<00:00:30.019> calories

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
again is that they're storing calories

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.860 
again is that they're storing calories
and<00:00:31.319> not<00:00:31.800> nutrition<00:00:32.550> very<00:00:33.090> important<00:00:33.630> that

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
and not nutrition very important that

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.120 
and not nutrition very important that
they're<00:00:34.050> storing<00:00:34.260> calories<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.040> not

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
they're storing calories and not

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.280 
they're storing calories and not
nutrition<00:00:35.730> our<00:00:36.150> calories<00:00:36.780> King

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
nutrition our calories King

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.510 
nutrition our calories King
yes<00:00:38.130> but<00:00:38.670> nutrition<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.480> Queen<00:00:40.350> yes<00:00:41.100> calories

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
yes but nutrition is Queen yes calories

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.700 
yes but nutrition is Queen yes calories
are<00:00:41.550> king<00:00:41.940> but<00:00:42.210> nutrition<00:00:42.720> is<00:00:42.870> queen<00:00:43.230> the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
are king but nutrition is queen the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.350 
are king but nutrition is queen the
reason<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.220> that<00:00:44.250> if<00:00:44.550> you're<00:00:44.670> only<00:00:44.820> storing

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
reason is that if you're only storing

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.330 
reason is that if you're only storing
calories<00:00:45.780> then<00:00:46.230> you're<00:00:46.410> wearing<00:00:46.740> body<00:00:46.950> armor

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
calories then you're wearing body armor

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.430 
calories then you're wearing body armor
made<00:00:47.490> out<00:00:47.640> Swiss<00:00:47.970> cheese<00:00:48.360> those<00:00:49.110> trace

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
made out Swiss cheese those trace

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.230 
made out Swiss cheese those trace
mineral<00:00:49.920> deficits<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.580> those<00:00:50.730> nutrient

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:51.240 
mineral deficits and those nutrient

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.140 
mineral deficits and those nutrient
deficits<00:00:51.780> those<00:00:52.410> will<00:00:52.770> set<00:00:53.130> you<00:00:53.310> up<00:00:53.370> for<00:00:53.550> being

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
deficits those will set you up for being

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.490 
deficits those will set you up for being
much<00:00:54.480> more<00:00:54.750> at<00:00:54.870> risk<00:00:55.110> for<00:00:55.380> contracting

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
much more at risk for contracting

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.850 
much more at risk for contracting
disease<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.760> disaster<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.990> if<00:00:58.350> you're<00:00:58.560> going

to store food long term make sure that

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.080 
to store food long term make sure that
