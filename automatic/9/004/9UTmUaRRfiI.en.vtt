00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.380
 50 remaining with 39 long endure a lot 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:13.360
 fighting 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:14.950
 so suddenly the water is open 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.770
 outside right and in a good way also 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.010
 from their little crazy no ras 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.010
 any good 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:26.390
 to open against more than 925 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:35.050
 but it is possible to choose any 10 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:37.649
 long pretty frank crossing of 37 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.649
 thoroughly 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:49.180
 quite 20 to 9 with feeling the descent 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.620
 with 10 hours 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.780
 this time that I have 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.000
 but this question is long with faith 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.500
 to hold the sequential raspa 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:09.520
 this repetition of 50 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:12.640
 39 knew well well to hold 9 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.909
 basseterre this with faith 50 going on with 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.710
 it's OK 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.710
 whereas if someone happens with 70 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.760
 Long 5 is ready 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.920
 95 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.160
 it is better to open a bad soon with faith to 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.160
 open 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.520
 and if it is 10 to hold where it stretches 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.520
 the end 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.090
 it can go from 850 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.700
 has nine endured plates a lot with 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.650
 how many out of these seven to anyone 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:09.369
 because he already designs the final 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:12.440
 do not even open it 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.410
 hold on against software hold 25 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.740
 but it will not even be long 10 arquilla 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.740
 50 view 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.680
 teaches of these seven good in the long 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.680
 old and there would be at the end 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:33.050
 I hope that whoever there where knew 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.050
 frequent 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:40.380
 to open the watery eyes 87 good because 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.070

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.290

 in the son walk 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:03:00.660
 always knowing how to resist braking 25 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.660
 to talk about tortilla and at the end 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.670
 in the end 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.939
 you would be left with three open left 10 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.939
 200 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.350
 of these nine long and choose 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.900
