black<00:02:21.299> or<00:02:21.599> dark<00:02:23.629> and<00:02:24.629> so<00:02:27.110> she's<00:02:28.110> like<00:02:28.319> you<00:02:28.470> had

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
black or dark and so she's like you had

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.930 
black or dark and so she's like you had
to<00:02:28.709> combine<00:02:28.920> him<00:02:29.099> with<00:02:29.129> another<00:02:29.340> color<00:02:29.670> it

to combine him with another color it

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.490 
to combine him with another color it
take<00:02:30.209> longer<00:02:30.450> but<00:02:30.750> if<00:02:30.870> I<00:02:30.930> just<00:02:31.170> wanted<00:02:31.409> this

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500
