00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.700
 good afternoon youtube people 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.970
 I'm here today to make a video 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.690
 teaching how to make a proper nest 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:17.460
 for chicken and the exact location of coca is 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:20.670
 here the linen I made this is a link 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.180
 of a stateroom of 50 listener not reading 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.570
 books cut in half where I put 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.039
 a cloth in an old shirt but 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.890
 on top of this when I'm going to 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.829
 rice straw to stay 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.520
 imagine yourself I have three tips 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.800
 very important to give first 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.710
 that your chicken throws into your nest 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.800
 You have to make a large 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.410
 which it still remains among which space 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.390
 she is comfortable because she is uniting 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.480
 it was not big enough 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.920
 the chicken does not vote for this nest now 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.210
 I hope it scared me that my dog 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.989
 arrived here was not not to vote for this 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.989
 nest is 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.960
 Another important thing is the place where 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.460
 nor will it stay the one does not have to stay in a 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.770
 well hidden place so that it 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.830
 feel safe to lay your eggs 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.310
 I always left the hiding place and maybe 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.200
 a tip about this is never if you have 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.229
 more of a chicken like that if you have 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.540
 a breeding with 5 10 20 and 30 chickens 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.299
 The amount that is you should not 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.000
 put juninho near the plate here 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.369
 it's not the case 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.009
 no one here around because because 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.259
 I feel like going to bed 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.600
 she goes as can as soon as you arrive 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.520
 near the hen she gets all 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.079
 reality neither this nor that noise 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.229
 all Brazil and such 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.960
 This makes it difficult for her to do 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.200
 let her break her games by moving 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.689
 inside the nin by being bothered 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.850
 for another chicken so I always put 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.360
 not far from the jar so it does not 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.689
 No win will spin, is it? 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.479
 OK 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.940
 another thing is the game coverage 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.330
 the protection it will take in 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.990
 under the eggs is very important that 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.470
 be 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.480
 soft because few when it wins 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.450
 plays games sometimes without wanting to 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.610
 step on top of these eggs and 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.740
 occurring to break the young then it is 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.370
 good always put a good investment 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:33.090
 Why do not you step on it or smoke it? 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.730
 great to lie on top and such is the soil 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.830
 not break and here my nest is not 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.220
 still fully coated because I go 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:44.070
 put the rice straw but I did the 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.870
 video with this timinho here I will take 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.120
 to a place that I found appropriate here 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.800
 in my backyard that is not too big and 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:56.120
 show here is here is the 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.740
 nest was placed in the corner of the 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.490
 with a screen above it so that it 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.710
 feel protected large river in this 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.470
 They always put 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:10.770
 protected from rain and such because even 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.890
 of the line both on top of the eggs is 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.450
 hinders it from hitting or 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.550
 some states can happen until the 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.700
 chicken leave the nest and abandoned juca 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.860
 let this happen a few times but 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.230
 It's very rare because there's an okay 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:30.020
 abandon hatching is very difficult 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:32.340
 are on site 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.050
 so this is personal 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:39.660
 I will post some other videos yet 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.530
 about other things and please let me 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.460
 liked it 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.990
 any questions leave a comment 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.940
 any questions leave your comment that 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.760
 I promise to answer. 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.460
 Another important thing is also about the 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.350
 rooster wins wins many people 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.710
 Friends, show that I'm going to buy another one. 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:01.080
 Chicken for him is right because the cock 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:04.290
 having another chicken he will not stay 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.330
 type trying man came by chicken 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.130
 because when she had left in the 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.540
 half will be trying to catch her 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.880
 trying to cross with her this is going to be 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.190
 very point for chicken then buy 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.380
 another chicken if you have two in case 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.850
 place a chicken would be inconvenient is 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.600
 What I'm going to save is 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.730
 shocks 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.080
 I already ordered an uncle from Mexico. 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.000
 bring the flour 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.889
 I have already ordered another chicken to 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.490
 When did that bump the cock? 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:32.400
 do not be late she always stays 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.499
 when it comes to vote if he is here the 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.779
 side and such and such because they have another 

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:39.840
 maniche and if he had chu and if she 

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:41.819
 has shocked and she goes out to eat he goes 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.770
 try to catch her then when she has 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:46.409
 with chick the view is very comfortable for 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.379
 chicken then the staff this is my video
