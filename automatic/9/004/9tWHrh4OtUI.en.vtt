00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
roll in some footage of me assembling

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:31.490 
roll in some footage of me assembling
those<00:00:29.119> so<00:00:30.119> these<00:00:30.240> come<00:00:30.420> with<00:00:30.449> nine<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:31.080> put<00:00:31.260> five

in<00:00:31.679> here<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.070> then<00:00:32.160> filled<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.489> rest<00:00:32.610> with

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
in here and then filled the rest with

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.549 
in here and then filled the rest with
wax<00:00:33.030> they<00:00:33.719> probably<00:00:33.989> could<00:00:34.200> have<00:00:34.290> put<00:00:34.410> some

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
wax they probably could have put some

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.990 
wax they probably could have put some
more<00:00:34.710> wax<00:00:34.920> maybe<00:00:35.190> one<00:00:35.370> more<00:00:35.520> pellet<00:00:35.850> in<00:00:35.910> there

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
more wax maybe one more pellet in there

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.549 
more wax maybe one more pellet in there
because<00:00:36.090> looking<00:00:36.390> just<00:00:36.600> kind<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.870> as<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.320> dry

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
because looking just kind of as it dry

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.490

trying to shoot anything special with it

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.010 
trying to shoot anything special with it
we're<00:00:53.699> just<00:00:53.730> gonna<00:00:53.969> see<00:00:54.239> if<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.449> even<00:00:54.570> works

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.250 

yeah

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
yeah

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.420 
yeah
just<00:00:58.440> see<00:00:58.559> if<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.710> doesn't<00:00:58.859> blow<00:00:59.070> up<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.250> gun

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
just see if it doesn't blow up the gun

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.150 
just see if it doesn't blow up the gun
and<00:00:59.579> see<00:00:59.699> if<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.879> works<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:01.050> made<00:01:01.710> four<00:01:02.039> of

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
and see if it works that I made four of

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.310 
and see if it works that I made four of
these<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.489> think<00:01:02.780> so<00:01:03.780> we'll<00:01:03.899> just<00:01:04.019> shoot<00:01:04.229> them

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
these I think so we'll just shoot them

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.700 
these I think so we'll just shoot them
see<00:01:04.830> what<00:01:04.949> happens<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.750> then<00:01:06.750> if<00:01:07.200> it's<00:01:07.500> any

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
see what happens and then if it's any

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.410 
see what happens and then if it's any
good<00:01:07.799> maybe<00:01:08.250> come<00:01:08.520> back<00:01:08.670> with<00:01:08.939> some<00:01:09.090> more<00:01:09.240> and

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
good maybe come back with some more and
