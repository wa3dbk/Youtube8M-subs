00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
time hitting the beat but when they did

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.800 
time hitting the beat but when they did
we<00:02:56.129> found<00:02:56.489> something<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.209> lot<00:02:57.299> of<00:02:57.450> striking

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
maybe the better the babies were able to

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.009 
maybe the better the babies were able to
match<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:01.530> musical<00:03:02.129> timing<00:03:02.700> with<00:03:03.299> their<00:03:03.750> body

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019
