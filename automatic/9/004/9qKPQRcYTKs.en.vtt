00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:08.419 
bike or an ATV grip now my next step

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:11.119 
bike or an ATV grip now my next step
will<00:04:09.419> be<00:04:09.449> and<00:04:09.959> as<00:04:10.290> you<00:04:10.470> can<00:04:10.620> see<00:04:10.650> the<00:04:10.889> grips

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
will be and as you can see the grips

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.360 
will be and as you can see the grips
right<00:04:11.430> here<00:04:11.840> I've<00:04:12.840> taken<00:04:13.229> my<00:04:13.439> little<00:04:13.739> knife

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
a minute that way it will get them the

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.510 
a minute that way it will get them the
rubber<00:04:51.130> will<00:04:51.340> get<00:04:51.490> looser<00:04:51.910> and<00:04:52.949> not<00:04:53.949> so<00:04:54.190> stiff

rubber will get looser and not so stiff

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.370 
rubber will get looser and not so stiff
and<00:04:54.960> then<00:04:55.960> you<00:04:56.110> could<00:04:56.260> put<00:04:56.500> your<00:04:56.770> your<00:04:57.160> grip

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
and then you could put your your grip

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:05.939 
and then you could put your your grip
glue<00:04:59.380> on<00:04:59.710> your<00:05:04.169> throttle<00:05:05.169> assemblies<00:05:05.710> and

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:08.040 
glue on your throttle assemblies and
your<00:05:06.220> handlebar<00:05:06.699> assembly<00:05:06.729> and<00:05:07.389> it<00:05:07.930> will

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
your handlebar assembly and it will

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.439 
your handlebar assembly and it will
slide<00:05:08.320> right<00:05:08.350> on<00:05:08.650> and<00:05:09.160> I'm<00:05:09.550> not<00:05:09.760> sure<00:05:09.789> exactly

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:10.449 
slide right on and I'm not sure exactly

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:12.840 
slide right on and I'm not sure exactly
how<00:05:10.660> these<00:05:10.840> go<00:05:11.220> because<00:05:12.220> they<00:05:12.370> just<00:05:12.550> have<00:05:12.699> this

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
how these go because they just have this

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.839 
how these go because they just have this
ribbing<00:05:13.240> on<00:05:13.360> one<00:05:14.169> edge<00:05:14.470> but<00:05:15.370> what<00:05:15.610> I'm<00:05:15.699> going

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849 
ribbing on one edge but what I'm going

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:18.500 
ribbing on one edge but what I'm going
to<00:05:15.880> do<00:05:15.970> is<00:05:16.090> put<00:05:16.270> the<00:05:16.389> ribbing<00:05:16.810> right<00:05:17.620> where<00:05:17.800> my

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
to do is put the ribbing right where my

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:24.330 
to do is put the ribbing right where my
fingers<00:05:19.510> grip<00:05:20.400> and<00:05:21.400> I<00:05:21.520> hope<00:05:22.030> that's<00:05:22.240> the<00:05:23.340> the

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
fingers grip and I hope that's the the

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.379 
fingers grip and I hope that's the the
right<00:05:24.550> way<00:05:24.729> of<00:05:24.759> doing<00:05:24.910> it<00:05:25.270> but<00:05:26.610> that's<00:05:27.610> my

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 
right way of doing it but that's my

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:30.900 
right way of doing it but that's my
latest<00:05:28.750> project<00:05:28.960> and<00:05:29.560> I've<00:05:30.280> got<00:05:30.550> to<00:05:30.669> get<00:05:30.789> this

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
latest project and I've got to get this

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.680 
latest project and I've got to get this
radiator<00:05:31.449> to<00:05:32.199> work<00:05:32.639> i'm<00:05:33.639> going<00:05:33.880> to<00:05:33.940> i<00:05:34.000> found<00:05:34.539> a

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
radiator to work i'm going to i found a

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.320 
radiator to work i'm going to i found a
new<00:05:34.810> way<00:05:34.840> to<00:05:34.990> mount<00:05:35.410> it<00:05:35.590> i<00:05:35.710> think<00:05:36.060> i'm<00:05:37.060> going<00:05:37.270> to

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
new way to mount it i think i'm going to

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.740 
new way to mount it i think i'm going to
mount<00:05:37.539> it<00:05:37.750> up<00:05:37.919> on<00:05:38.919> this<00:05:39.250> top<00:05:39.580> bolt<00:05:40.389> right<00:05:40.720> here

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
mount it up on this top bolt right here

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:47.730 
mount it up on this top bolt right here
or<00:05:41.320> edge<00:05:42.010> and<00:05:42.880> i'll<00:05:43.120> make<00:05:43.300> a<00:05:46.110> bracket<00:05:47.110> down

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
or edge and i'll make a bracket down

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.510 
or edge and i'll make a bracket down
here<00:05:48.039> i<00:05:48.070> might<00:05:48.340> go<00:05:48.550> wood<00:05:49.349> to<00:05:50.349> put<00:05:50.830> it<00:05:51.250> in<00:05:51.370> there

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
here i might go wood to put it in there

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.969 
here i might go wood to put it in there
but<00:05:51.669> i<00:05:51.729> have<00:05:51.909> a<00:05:51.940> little<00:05:52.090> problem<00:05:52.650> having<00:05:53.650> to

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:53.979 
but i have a little problem having to

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:57.600 
but i have a little problem having to
have<00:05:54.280> this<00:05:54.520> clear<00:05:54.909> the<00:05:55.260> electrical<00:05:56.260> gauge<00:05:56.610> but

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
have this clear the electrical gauge but

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.780 
have this clear the electrical gauge but
that's<00:05:57.820> where<00:05:58.030> we're<00:05:58.210> at<00:05:58.270> so<00:05:58.330> far
