00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.710 

seems<00:00:02.280> to<00:00:02.370> be<00:00:02.460> moving<00:00:02.610> his<00:00:02.850> feet<00:00:03.060> kind<00:00:03.300> of<00:00:03.480> slow

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
seems to be moving his feet kind of slow

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.680 
seems to be moving his feet kind of slow
but<00:00:04.460> let's<00:00:05.460> just<00:00:05.580> go<00:00:05.730> ahead<00:00:05.759> and<00:00:06.089> adjust<00:00:06.150> that

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
but let's just go ahead and adjust that

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.049 
but let's just go ahead and adjust that
right<00:00:06.930> now

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:08.059 
right now

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.360 
right now
so<00:00:09.059> basically<00:00:09.620> start<00:00:10.620> using<00:00:10.769> three<00:00:11.130> we'll

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
so basically start using three we'll

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.710 
so basically start using three we'll
just<00:00:11.519> use<00:00:11.670> one<00:00:14.059> and<00:00:16.190> then<00:00:17.190> we'll<00:00:17.430> up<00:00:17.670> our<00:00:17.880> frame

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
just use one and then we'll up our frame

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.120 
just use one and then we'll up our frame
rate<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:18.960> little<00:00:19.350> bit<00:00:22.850> let's<00:00:23.850> go<00:00:23.970> back<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.420> our

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
rate a little bit let's go back to our

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.800 
rate a little bit let's go back to our
price<00:00:26.130> set<00:00:26.369> my<00:00:26.550> default<00:00:26.820> frame<00:00:27.390> rate<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.599> be

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
price set my default frame rate to be

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:35.720 
price set my default frame rate to be
thirty<00:00:30.470> just<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.590> soap<00:00:34.160> you<00:00:35.160> know<00:00:35.250> looks<00:00:35.489> pretty

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
thirty just a soap you know looks pretty

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.670 
thirty just a soap you know looks pretty
reasonable<00:00:36.200> looks<00:00:37.200> like<00:00:37.380> he's<00:00:37.530> walking<00:00:39.680> okay

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
reasonable looks like he's walking okay

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.959 
reasonable looks like he's walking okay
so<00:00:40.739> next<00:00:41.129> thing<00:00:41.250> we<00:00:41.430> want<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.640> do<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.850> we're

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
so next thing we want to do is we're

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.670 
so next thing we want to do is we're
going<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.180> actually<00:00:42.270> make<00:00:42.540> him<00:00:42.780> keep<00:00:43.350> moving

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
going to actually make him keep moving

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.430 
going to actually make him keep moving
while<00:00:43.829> he's<00:00:44.390> moving<00:00:45.390> his<00:00:45.480> feet<00:00:45.660> lies<00:00:45.899> on<00:00:46.410> a

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
while he's moving his feet lies on a

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.220 
while he's moving his feet lies on a
diagonal<00:00:47.480> so<00:00:48.480> let's<00:00:48.660> go<00:00:48.809> back<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.989> our

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
diagonal so let's go back to our

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.740 
diagonal so let's go back to our
ActionScript

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.370 

okay<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.040> the<00:00:59.040> reason<00:00:59.750> he's<00:01:00.750> not<00:01:00.960> living<00:01:01.140> his

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.380 
okay so the reason he's not living his

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.310 
okay so the reason he's not living his
feet<00:01:02.120> and<00:01:03.120> when<00:01:03.270> we're<00:01:03.420> moving<00:01:03.540> on<00:01:03.810> a<00:01:03.840> diagonal

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
feet and when we're moving on a diagonal

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.800 
feet and when we're moving on a diagonal
is<00:01:05.280> because<00:01:06.440> we've<00:01:07.440> we're<00:01:08.100> executing<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:09.420> go

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
is because we've we're executing to go

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.340 
is because we've we're executing to go
to<00:01:09.870> in<00:01:10.200> stop<00:01:11.030> commands<00:01:12.030> when<00:01:12.870> we're<00:01:13.020> holding

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
to in stop commands when we're holding

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.040 
to in stop commands when we're holding
for<00:01:13.800> example<00:01:14.220> if<00:01:14.460> we're<00:01:14.640> holding<00:01:14.940> up<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.480> left

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
for example if we're holding up and left

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.180 
for example if we're holding up and left
he's<00:01:19.050> gonna<00:01:19.260> go<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.560> install<00:01:20.040> on<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.490> up

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
he's gonna go to install on the up

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.860 
he's gonna go to install on the up
keyframe<00:01:23.190> which<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.330> going<00:01:24.480> to<00:01:24.570> go<00:01:24.660> to<00:01:24.720> the

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
keyframe which is going to go to the

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.520 
keyframe which is going to go to the
first<00:01:25.080> frame<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.340> walk<00:01:26.610> cycle<00:01:27.380> but<00:01:28.380> then

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
first frame of that walk cycle but then

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.880 
first frame of that walk cycle but then
it's<00:01:28.800> gonna<00:01:29.070> go<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.940> first<00:01:30.390> frame<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
it's gonna go to the first frame of the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.890 
it's gonna go to the first frame of the
left<00:01:32.130> walk<00:01:32.400> cycle<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.180> we're<00:01:33.360> basically<00:01:33.540> going

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
left walk cycle so we're basically going

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.310 
left walk cycle so we're basically going
back<00:01:34.440> and<00:01:34.650> forth<00:01:35.090> and<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.270> up<00:01:36.450> keyframe<00:01:37.050> to

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
back and forth and the up keyframe to

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.890 
back and forth and the up keyframe to
the<00:01:37.410> left<00:01:37.619> keyframe<00:01:38.160> so<00:01:38.570> it's<00:01:39.570> always<00:01:39.690> going

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
the left keyframe so it's always going

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.100 
the left keyframe so it's always going
to<00:01:39.960> be<00:01:40.050> on<00:01:40.260> the<00:01:40.350> first<00:01:40.619> frame<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.960> each

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
to be on the first frame of that of each

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.130 
to be on the first frame of that of each
walk<00:01:43.440> cycle<00:01:44.510> so<00:01:45.510> there's<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.869> few<00:01:46.080> different

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
walk cycle so there's a few different

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.210 
walk cycle so there's a few different
things<00:01:46.530> we<00:01:46.920> can<00:01:47.130> do<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.790> fix<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:49.040> I'm<00:01:50.040> just

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
things we can do to fix this I'm just

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.340 
things we can do to fix this I'm just
going<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.520> get<00:01:50.790> rid<00:01:50.910> of<00:01:51.060> all<00:01:51.330> these<00:01:51.600> go<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.080> in

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
going to get rid of all these go to in

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.410 
going to get rid of all these go to in
stop<00:01:52.680> commands<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.550> I'm<00:01:53.790> just<00:01:53.880> gonna<00:01:54.030> put

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
stop commands and I'm just gonna put

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.900 
stop commands and I'm just gonna put
them<00:01:54.600> into<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:55.520> separate<00:01:56.540> detection<00:01:58.610> so<00:01:59.610> first

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
them into a separate detection so first

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.330 
them into a separate detection so first
let's<00:02:00.119> get<00:02:00.270> rid<00:02:00.330> of<00:02:00.450> all<00:02:00.630> these

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:11.590 

now<00:02:06.950> I'm<00:02:07.950> going<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.670> write<00:02:09.030> an<00:02:09.630> if<00:02:09.930> statement

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
now I'm going to write an if statement

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.790 
now I'm going to write an if statement
that<00:02:12.600> detects<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.200> XP<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:14.430> first<00:02:14.670> XP<00:02:15.270> is

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
that detects the XP the first XP is

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.730 
that detects the XP the first XP is
greater<00:02:16.800> than<00:02:17.870> zero<00:02:18.870> so<00:02:19.250> if<00:02:20.250> he's<00:02:20.400> moving<00:02:21.740> to

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
greater than zero so if he's moving to

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:31.160 
greater than zero so if he's moving to
the<00:02:22.890> right<00:02:26.750> we're<00:02:27.750> gonna<00:02:27.990> use<00:02:29.780> we're<00:02:30.780> gonna<00:02:30.900> go

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
the right we're gonna use we're gonna go

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:40.160 
the right we're gonna use we're gonna go
through<00:02:31.440> this<00:02:31.530> stock<00:02:31.890> on<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.640> right<00:02:39.050> now<00:02:40.050> if

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
through this stock on the right now if

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.920 
through this stock on the right now if
it's

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:51.400 

that's<00:02:44.349> less<00:02:44.650> than<00:02:44.950> zero

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:03:06.100 

we're<00:02:51.980> gonna<00:02:52.190> go<00:02:52.460> to<00:02:52.520> the<00:02:52.880> stop<00:02:53.240> on<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.950> left

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.280 

you

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.259 

so<00:03:09.530> if<00:03:09.590> we<00:03:09.739> test<00:03:10.099> this<00:03:10.340> now<00:03:12.760> we<00:03:13.760> can<00:03:13.790> see<00:03:14.120> that

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
so if we test this now we can see that

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.660 
so if we test this now we can see that
when<00:03:14.720> we're<00:03:14.870> moving<00:03:14.959> on<00:03:15.230> a<00:03:15.260> diagonal<00:03:15.769> he's

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
when we're moving on a diagonal he's

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.899 
when we're moving on a diagonal he's
still<00:03:16.940> moving<00:03:17.060> his<00:03:17.330> feet<00:03:18.549> but<00:03:19.549> if<00:03:19.640> we're<00:03:19.760> going

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:19.909 
still moving his feet but if we're going

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:22.449 
still moving his feet but if we're going
up<00:03:20.209> straight<00:03:21.080> up<00:03:21.230> or<00:03:21.440> straight<00:03:21.470> down

we haven't set those keyframes yet let's

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.270 
we haven't set those keyframes yet let's
go<00:03:25.760> ahead<00:03:25.879> and<00:03:26.470> we'll<00:03:27.470> set<00:03:27.680> those<00:03:27.890> keyframes

go ahead and we'll set those keyframes

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:41.170 
go ahead and we'll set those keyframes
okay<00:03:31.280> so<00:03:31.340> we're<00:03:32.120> using<00:03:32.360> the<00:03:32.480> healthier

you<00:04:27.660> know<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:27.930> type<00:04:28.139> over<00:04:28.350> there

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:30.299 
you know the type over there

00:04:30.299 --> 00:04:36.839 
you know the type over there
see<00:04:31.299> if<00:04:31.419> this<00:04:31.569> works<00:04:33.899> diagnol<00:04:34.899> -<00:04:35.759> moving<00:04:36.759> his

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 
see if this works diagnol - moving his

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:40.739 
see if this works diagnol - moving his
feet<00:04:38.159> straight<00:04:39.159> down<00:04:39.519> with<00:04:40.359> his<00:04:40.539> feet

straight up with his feet that's pretty

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:50.580 
straight up with his feet that's pretty
good

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.250 

so<00:04:51.160> let<00:04:51.460> me<00:04:51.490> just<00:04:51.669> go<00:04:52.090> to<00:04:52.690> a<00:04:52.720> run-through<00:04:53.050> of

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
so let me just go to a run-through of

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.490 
so let me just go to a run-through of
this<00:04:53.500> code<00:04:53.770> one<00:04:54.220> more<00:04:54.430> time<00:04:54.840> so<00:04:55.840> here<00:04:56.080> we<00:04:56.230> used

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
this code one more time so here we used

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.780 
this code one more time so here we used
the<00:04:56.710> command<00:04:57.520> attach<00:04:57.970> movie<00:04:59.190> to<00:05:00.190> attach<00:05:00.639> a

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
the command attach movie to attach a

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.070 
the command attach movie to attach a
movie<00:05:01.090> clip<00:05:01.240> to<00:05:01.570> our<00:05:01.690> route<00:05:02.020> and<00:05:03.750> we<00:05:04.750> use<00:05:04.900> this

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
movie clip to our route and we use this

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.670 
movie clip to our route and we use this
word<00:05:05.380> character<00:05:06.870> because<00:05:07.870> our<00:05:08.260> in<00:05:08.560> our

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
word character because our in our

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.909 
word character because our in our
linkage<00:05:09.160> here<00:05:09.750> we're<00:05:10.750> using<00:05:11.020> the<00:05:11.290> identifier

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
linkage here we're using the identifier

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:16.230 
linkage here we're using the identifier
character<00:05:13.380> so<00:05:14.400> that's<00:05:15.400> the<00:05:15.669> word<00:05:15.790> we<00:05:15.910> use<00:05:15.940> for

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
character so that's the word we use for

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.150 
character so that's the word we use for
that<00:05:16.330> and<00:05:16.389> then<00:05:16.720> we<00:05:16.750> gave<00:05:17.020> it<00:05:17.169> our<00:05:17.410> instance

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
that and then we gave it our instance

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.580 
that and then we gave it our instance
name<00:05:18.370> of<00:05:18.580> char<00:05:18.970> and<00:05:20.430> this<00:05:21.430> was<00:05:21.669> our<00:05:22.350> our<00:05:23.350> depth

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
name of char and this was our our depth

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.090 
name of char and this was our our depth
that<00:05:23.800> we<00:05:23.950> used<00:05:24.419> so<00:05:25.419> we<00:05:25.600> we<00:05:26.320> asked<00:05:26.680> the<00:05:26.860> route

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
that we used so we we asked the route

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.719 
that we used so we we asked the route
further<00:05:27.550> its<00:05:28.180> next<00:05:28.600> highest<00:05:28.780> depth<00:05:29.729> because

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
further its next highest depth because

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:33.629 
further its next highest depth because
that's<00:05:31.240> the<00:05:31.570> movie<00:05:32.169> clip<00:05:32.350> we<00:05:32.500> attach<00:05:33.100> this<00:05:33.430> one

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639 
that's the movie clip we attach this one

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.100 
that's the movie clip we attach this one
to<00:05:33.820> you<00:05:34.680> and<00:05:35.680> here<00:05:35.889> we<00:05:36.010> set<00:05:36.250> our<00:05:36.490> movie<00:05:36.820> clip

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
to you and here we set our movie clip

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.170
