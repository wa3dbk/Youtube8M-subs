00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.179 
and remember the the Mac Pro Longwear
eyeshadows<00:01:54.810> are<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.110> large<00:01:55.439> size<00:01:55.860> pans

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
eyeshadows are the large size pans

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.249 
eyeshadows are the large size pans
they're<00:01:56.850> not<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.270> same<00:01:57.420> size<00:01:57.750> as<00:01:58.079> these

they're not the same size as these
regular<00:01:58.649> mica<00:01:58.979> shows<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.399> they<00:01:59.430> cost<00:01:59.820> even

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
regular mica shows so they cost even

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.660 
regular mica shows so they cost even

and I did photograph and swatch for this
one<00:03:59.150> too<00:03:59.450> and<00:03:59.840> I<00:04:00.260> found<00:04:00.470> that<00:04:00.650> Mac<00:04:00.890> arena<00:04:01.340> was

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
actually a really really close one so I

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.130 
actually a really really close one so I
will<00:04:04.580> go<00:04:04.790> ahead<00:04:05.000> and<00:04:05.270> insert<00:04:05.630> that<00:04:05.810> picture

will go ahead and insert that picture

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.660 
will go ahead and insert that picture
now

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.610

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
different I have been asked if the NYX

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.350 
different I have been asked if the NYX
eyeshadows<00:05:02.830> are<00:05:03.130> more<00:05:03.370> powdery<00:05:03.790> or<00:05:04.120> if

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
eyeshadows are more powdery or if

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.659 
eyeshadows are more powdery or if
they're<00:05:04.540> more<00:05:04.630> chunky<00:05:05.110> I<00:05:05.320> would<00:05:06.190> say<00:05:06.370> I

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
they're more chunky I would say I

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.300 
they're more chunky I would say I
usually<00:05:07.390> avoid<00:05:07.570> any<00:05:08.229> of<00:05:08.350> the<00:05:08.440> eyeshadows<00:05:08.950> from

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
usually avoid any of the eyeshadows from

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.770 
usually avoid any of the eyeshadows from
NYX<00:05:09.580> that<00:05:09.790> have<00:05:09.970> the<00:05:10.090> glitter<00:05:10.360> to<00:05:10.600> them

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
NYX that have the glitter to them

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.260 
NYX that have the glitter to them
because<00:05:11.470> those<00:05:11.710> will<00:05:12.040> be<00:05:12.280> chunky<00:05:12.550> and<00:05:13.030> more

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
because those will be chunky and more

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.560 
because those will be chunky and more
powdery<00:05:13.630> but<00:05:14.350> typically<00:05:14.919> I<00:05:15.669> don't<00:05:16.000> find<00:05:16.390> that

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
powdery but typically I don't find that

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.090 
powdery but typically I don't find that
I<00:05:16.630> have<00:05:16.840> a<00:05:16.870> lot<00:05:17.080> of<00:05:17.110> problem<00:05:17.500> with<00:05:17.530> like<00:05:17.890> any

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
I have a lot of problem with like any

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.560
