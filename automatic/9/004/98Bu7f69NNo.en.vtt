and some breakers don't have the ability
to<00:01:23.009> flirt<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.700> if<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.299> notice<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:25.170> over

it's a new exotic some sorts of weapon
buff<00:01:57.689> or<00:01:57.930> war<00:01:58.350> but<00:01:58.890> it's<00:01:59.009> definitely

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
buff or war but it's definitely

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.639 
buff or war but it's definitely
different<00:01:59.579> from<00:01:59.880> our<00:01:59.969> usual<00:02:00.149> arsenal<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:01.079> mean

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
different from our usual arsenal I mean

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.160 
different from our usual arsenal I mean
the<00:02:01.950> gun<00:02:02.159> itself<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.670> on<00:02:02.820> fire<00:02:03.119> but<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.840> model

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
the gun itself is on fire but the model

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.440 
the gun itself is on fire but the model
is<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.439> exact<00:02:04.740> same<00:02:04.950> as<00:02:05.159> thunderlord's<00:02:05.909> just

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
is the exact same as thunderlord's just

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.419 
is the exact same as thunderlord's just
painted<00:02:06.840> red<00:02:07.079> so<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.799> guess<00:02:08.039> we'll<00:02:08.190> just<00:02:08.340> have

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
painted red so I guess we'll just have

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.190 
painted red so I guess we'll just have
to<00:02:08.459> wait<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:08.879> see<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.569> find<00:02:09.840> out<00:02:09.959> more<00:02:10.140> about

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
video we can see the helmet is glowing
unfortunately<00:05:05.800> the<00:05:05.919> images<00:05:06.280> in<00:05:06.400> that<00:05:06.550> group

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
unfortunately the images in that group

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.700 
unfortunately the images in that group
and<00:05:07.030> so<00:05:07.449> we<00:05:07.539> don't<00:05:07.780> get<00:05:07.930> to<00:05:08.020> properly<00:05:08.410> see<00:05:08.560> the

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
and so we don't get to properly see the

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.620 
and so we don't get to properly see the
fronts<00:05:09.070> but<00:05:09.520> from<00:05:09.729> the<00:05:09.849> side<00:05:10.060> it<00:05:10.270> looks<00:05:10.419> very

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
fronts but from the side it looks very

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.779 
fronts but from the side it looks very
majestic<00:05:10.840> it<00:05:11.770> has<00:05:11.919> these<00:05:12.070> curves<00:05:12.430> that<00:05:12.580> run

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
majestic it has these curves that run

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:14.909 
majestic it has these curves that run
along<00:05:13.000> the<00:05:13.150> side<00:05:13.360> into<00:05:13.660> the<00:05:13.780> front<00:05:14.050> as<00:05:14.229> well<00:05:14.800> as

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
along the side into the front as well as

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:16.980 
along the side into the front as well as
these<00:05:15.039> contours<00:05:15.550> in<00:05:15.699> the<00:05:15.729> helmet<00:05:16.180> almost<00:05:16.900> like

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
these contours in the helmet almost like

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.300 
these contours in the helmet almost like
something<00:05:17.349> an<00:05:17.470> eye<00:05:17.650> would<00:05:17.860> wear

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
something an eye would wear

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.560 
something an eye would wear
which<00:05:18.639> would<00:05:18.820> fit<00:05:19.030> in<00:05:19.120> with<00:05:19.240> the<00:05:19.300> theme<00:05:19.539> of

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
which would fit in with the theme of

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.390 
which would fit in with the theme of
Titans<00:05:20.139> being<00:05:20.410> these<00:05:20.620> honorable<00:05:21.220> Knights

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
Titans being these honorable Knights

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.960 
Titans being these honorable Knights
these<00:05:22.060> defenders<00:05:22.750> of<00:05:22.780> the<00:05:22.990> city<00:05:23.580> next<00:05:24.580> up<00:05:24.849> is

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
these defenders of the city next up is

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.670 
these defenders of the city next up is
this<00:05:25.090> hunter<00:05:25.449> helmet<00:05:25.750> that<00:05:26.169> appears<00:05:26.500> to<00:05:26.590> be

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
this hunter helmet that appears to be

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.980 
this hunter helmet that appears to be
filled<00:05:26.889> with<00:05:27.130> void<00:05:27.400> lights<00:05:27.729> Bungie<00:05:28.690> really

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
filled with void lights Bungie really

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.140 
filled with void lights Bungie really
seems<00:05:29.199> like<00:05:29.260> they're<00:05:29.560> glowing<00:05:29.800> helmets<00:05:30.340> again

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
seems like they're glowing helmets again

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.089 
seems like they're glowing helmets again
only<00:05:31.360> a<00:05:31.510> brief<00:05:31.780> shot<00:05:32.020> and<00:05:32.229> since<00:05:32.710> this<00:05:32.860> helmet

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:33.099 
only a brief shot and since this helmet

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:34.800 
only a brief shot and since this helmet
is<00:05:33.280> filled<00:05:33.550> with<00:05:33.729> purple<00:05:34.090> void<00:05:34.330> lights<00:05:34.630> I'm

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
is filled with purple void lights I'm

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.360 
is filled with purple void lights I'm
guessing<00:05:35.590> that<00:05:35.680> this<00:05:35.770> is<00:05:35.919> going<00:05:36.130> to<00:05:36.220> be

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
guessing that this is going to be

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.219 
guessing that this is going to be
specific<00:05:36.880> to<00:05:36.909> the<00:05:37.120> Night<00:05:37.300> Stalker<00:05:37.539> subclass

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:38.229 
specific to the Night Stalker subclass

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:41.159 
specific to the Night Stalker subclass
and<00:05:39.030> finally<00:05:40.030> for<00:05:40.180> the<00:05:40.240> hunter<00:05:40.599> at<00:05:40.810> these

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
and finally for the hunter at these

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:42.779 
and finally for the hunter at these
exotic<00:05:41.680> ganas<00:05:42.010> which<00:05:42.190> have<00:05:42.340> these<00:05:42.490> burns

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
exotic ganas which have these burns

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:45.029 
exotic ganas which have these burns
running<00:05:43.270> along<00:05:43.479> the<00:05:43.659> arms<00:05:44.050> similar<00:05:44.830> to<00:05:44.949> the

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 
running along the arms similar to the

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:47.159 
running along the arms similar to the
young<00:05:45.220> arm<00:05:45.520> Karis<00:05:45.940> spine<00:05:46.270> I'm<00:05:46.539> really

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
young arm Karis spine I'm really

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:48.779 
young arm Karis spine I'm really
interested<00:05:47.289> in<00:05:47.530> seeing<00:05:47.770> what<00:05:48.190> the<00:05:48.400> exotic

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:48.789 
interested in seeing what the exotic

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:50.219 
interested in seeing what the exotic
Peck<00:05:48.970> for<00:05:49.180> these<00:05:49.270> girls<00:05:49.539> will<00:05:49.750> be<00:05:49.870> as<00:05:49.960> well

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229 
Peck for these girls will be as well

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:51.990 
Peck for these girls will be as well

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
hopefully these will be for the light

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.330 
hopefully these will be for the light
stocker<00:05:52.330> subclass<00:05:52.930> so<00:05:53.740> those<00:05:54.009> are<00:05:54.159> all<00:05:54.220> the

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
stocker subclass so those are all the

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.700 
stocker subclass so those are all the
exotics<00:05:54.789> are<00:05:54.880> much<00:05:55.060> despot<00:05:55.509> so<00:05:55.720> far<00:05:55.960> but<00:05:56.470> keep

exotics are much despot so far but keep

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.439 
exotics are much despot so far but keep
in<00:05:56.830> mind<00:05:56.860> not<00:05:57.220> all<00:05:57.250> of<00:05:57.490> them<00:05:57.610> are<00:05:57.729> 100%

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:58.449 
in mind not all of them are 100%

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:01.170 
in mind not all of them are 100%
