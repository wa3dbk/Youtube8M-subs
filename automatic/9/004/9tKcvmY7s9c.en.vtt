00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
okay so here we have the unfinished

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.760 
okay so here we have the unfinished
serving<00:00:17.580> tray<00:00:18.330> that<00:00:18.840> I<00:00:18.900> got<00:00:19.110> from<00:00:19.259> amazon.com

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
serving tray that I got from amazon.com

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.450 
serving tray that I got from amazon.com
and<00:00:20.779> I<00:00:21.779> will<00:00:22.020> put<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.410> exact<00:00:22.680> link<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.279> where<00:00:23.430> I

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
and I will put the exact link to where I

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.790 
and I will put the exact link to where I
can<00:00:23.670> get<00:00:23.789> this<00:00:24.029> but<00:00:24.869> for<00:00:25.199> this<00:00:25.410> particular

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
can get this but for this particular

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
can get this but for this particular
project

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.240 
project
whatever<00:00:27.570> serving<00:00:28.320> tray<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.800> you're<00:00:28.949> using

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
whatever serving tray that you're using

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.339 
whatever serving tray that you're using
you<00:00:29.490> want<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.730> make<00:00:29.910> sure<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:30.900> leak

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
you want to make sure that it is leak

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.880 
you want to make sure that it is leak
proof<00:00:31.890> because<00:00:32.610> we<00:00:33.360> will<00:00:33.570> be<00:00:33.780> pouring<00:00:34.320> resin

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
proof because we will be pouring resin

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.330 
proof because we will be pouring resin
in<00:00:35.070> here<00:00:35.790> so<00:00:36.570> for<00:00:37.019> this<00:00:37.260> particular<00:00:37.590> one<00:00:38.040> that

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
in here so for this particular one that

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
in here so for this particular one that
I<00:00:38.370> have<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.570> way<00:00:39.750> they<00:00:39.930> made<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.380> is<00:00:40.530> they<00:00:40.890> just

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
I have the way they made it is they just

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.690 
I have the way they made it is they just
stapled<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.780> parts<00:00:43.170> together<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:44.129> they're

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
stapled the parts together so they're

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.130 
stapled the parts together so they're
not<00:00:44.820> glued<00:00:45.090> together<00:00:45.270> or<00:00:45.600> anything<00:00:45.750> like<00:00:46.079> that

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
not glued together or anything like that

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.380 
not glued together or anything like that
so<00:00:46.500> there<00:00:47.129> are<00:00:47.309> some<00:00:47.610> gaps<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:48.090> can<00:00:48.239> definitely

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
so there are some gaps I can definitely

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.330 
so there are some gaps I can definitely
see<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.050> gaps<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:49.500> if<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.829> were<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.070> pour<00:00:50.309> a

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
see the gaps so if I were to pour a

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.729 
see the gaps so if I were to pour a
resin<00:00:50.789> right<00:00:51.000> now<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.629> way<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.289> right<00:00:52.530> now

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
resin right now the way it is right now

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.900 
resin right now the way it is right now
the<00:00:53.570> resin<00:00:54.570> will<00:00:54.719> just<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.770> know<00:00:55.800> leak<00:00:56.699> out

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
the resin will just you know leak out

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.049 
the resin will just you know leak out
and<00:00:57.270> make<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.930> huge<00:00:58.260> mess<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.460> order<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.789> make

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
and make a huge mess so in order to make

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.510 
and make a huge mess so in order to make
this<00:01:00.329> leak<00:01:00.629> proof<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.379> easiest<00:01:01.949> way<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.219> I

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
this leak proof the easiest way that I

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.670 
this leak proof the easiest way that I
found<00:01:03.440> probably<00:01:04.440> to<00:01:05.100> use<00:01:05.399> a<00:01:05.729> tackle<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.680> then

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
found probably to use a tackle and then

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.310 
found probably to use a tackle and then
fill<00:01:08.039> in<00:01:08.399> all<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.880> gaps<00:01:09.090> with<00:01:09.420> spackle<00:01:09.960> let<00:01:10.229> it

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
fill in all the gaps with spackle let it

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.520 
fill in all the gaps with spackle let it
dry<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.100> then<00:01:11.790> after<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.450> I'm<00:01:12.810> going<00:01:13.409> to

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
dry and then after that I'm going to

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.120 
dry and then after that I'm going to
lightly<00:01:13.770> sand<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.460> entire<00:01:15.470> tray<00:01:16.470> because<00:01:16.710> I

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
lightly sand the entire tray because I

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.539 
lightly sand the entire tray because I
do<00:01:17.670> feel<00:01:18.000> some<00:01:18.240> splinters<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.080> rough<00:01:19.710> spots

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
do feel some splinters and rough spots

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.170 
do feel some splinters and rough spots
and<00:01:21.240> then<00:01:21.330> after<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:22.140> am<00:01:22.470> going<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.430> paint

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
and then after that I am going to paint

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:51.540 
and then after that I am going to paint
it<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.990> let's<00:01:25.920> get<00:01:26.130> started

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
to get it so what I'm going to do with

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.810 
to get it so what I'm going to do with
this<00:03:30.880> is<00:03:31.120> I'm<00:03:31.240> going<00:03:31.510> to<00:03:31.630> cut<00:03:32.280> so<00:03:33.280> that<00:03:33.310> it'll

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
this is I'm going to cut so that it'll

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.060 
this is I'm going to cut so that it'll
fit<00:03:34.150> into<00:03:34.360> the<00:03:34.600> tray<00:03:34.960> and<00:03:35.290> I'm<00:03:35.590> going<00:03:35.830> to<00:03:35.860> glue

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
fit into the tray and I'm going to glue

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.760 
fit into the tray and I'm going to glue
it<00:03:36.190> down<00:03:36.400> using<00:03:36.970> Mod<00:03:37.150> Podge<00:03:37.360> and<00:03:37.780> this<00:03:38.410> one<00:03:38.620> is

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
it down using Mod Podge and this one is

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.710 
it down using Mod Podge and this one is
a<00:03:38.800> super<00:03:39.190> gloss<00:03:39.370> brilliant<00:03:39.970> and<00:03:40.270> I'm<00:03:40.480> going<00:03:40.660> to

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
a super gloss brilliant and I'm going to

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.720 
a super gloss brilliant and I'm going to
also<00:03:40.780> use<00:03:41.200> this<00:03:41.410> to<00:03:41.620> seal<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:42.040> paper<00:03:42.250> so<00:03:42.580> the

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
also use this to seal the paper so the

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.690 
also use this to seal the paper so the
resin<00:03:43.120> won't<00:03:43.450> stain<00:03:44.050> the<00:03:44.230> paper<00:03:44.500> now<00:03:45.280> using

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
resin won't stain the paper now using

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.940 
resin won't stain the paper now using
this<00:03:46.000> particular<00:03:46.360> Mod<00:03:46.930> Podge<00:03:47.140> of<00:03:47.380> super<00:03:47.740> gloss

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
this particular Mod Podge of super gloss

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.180 
this particular Mod Podge of super gloss
instead<00:03:48.460> of<00:03:48.580> the<00:03:48.730> regular<00:03:48.940> gloss<00:03:49.480> is<00:03:50.190> because

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
instead of the regular gloss is because

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.520 
instead of the regular gloss is because
I<00:03:51.640> hear<00:03:51.910> that<00:03:52.120> this<00:03:52.330> one<00:03:52.570> works<00:03:52.870> better<00:03:53.200> with

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
I hear that this one works better with

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.520 
I hear that this one works better with
the<00:03:53.650> resin<00:03:54.330> usually<00:03:55.330> the<00:03:55.570> Mod<00:03:55.870> Podge<00:03:56.110> gloss

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
the resin usually the Mod Podge gloss

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.490 
the resin usually the Mod Podge gloss
leaves<00:03:56.950> a<00:03:57.240> cloudy<00:03:58.240> film<00:03:59.220> to<00:04:00.220> the<00:04:00.550> whole<00:04:00.760> piece

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
leaves a cloudy film to the whole piece

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.450 
leaves a cloudy film to the whole piece
especially<00:04:02.500> it<00:04:02.650> becomes<00:04:02.980> noticeable

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:03.460 
especially it becomes noticeable

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.100 
especially it becomes noticeable
especially<00:04:03.940> when<00:04:04.030> you<00:04:04.120> pour<00:04:04.390> the<00:04:04.420> resin<00:04:04.660> over

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
especially when you pour the resin over

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.440 
especially when you pour the resin over
it<00:04:05.230> so<00:04:05.500> I'm<00:04:05.680> going<00:04:05.830> to<00:04:05.890> be<00:04:06.310> using<00:04:06.730> this<00:04:07.000> instead

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
it so I'm going to be using this instead

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.130 
it so I'm going to be using this instead
and<00:04:07.810> then<00:04:08.590> after<00:04:09.070> that<00:04:09.250> I'm<00:04:09.580> going<00:04:09.940> to<00:04:10.240> spray

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
and then after that I'm going to spray

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.500 
and then after that I'm going to spray

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370

kind of non rifling paper craft glue to
glue<00:06:25.810> down<00:06:26.020> the<00:06:26.080> paper<00:06:26.380> instead<00:06:26.979> of<00:06:27.160> the<00:06:27.550> Mod

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:27.820 
glue down the paper instead of the Mod

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.409 
glue down the paper instead of the Mod
Podge<00:06:28.440> super<00:06:29.440> gloss<00:06:29.650> that<00:06:30.130> I<00:06:30.310> use<00:06:30.610> because<00:06:31.120> it

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:31.419 
Podge super gloss that I use because it

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:33.180 
Podge super gloss that I use because it
did<00:06:31.570> cause<00:06:31.810> my<00:06:32.050> paper<00:06:32.289> to<00:06:32.500> wrinkle<00:06:32.860> a<00:06:32.949> little

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
did cause my paper to wrinkle a little

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.670 
did cause my paper to wrinkle a little
bit<00:06:33.419> well<00:06:34.419> once<00:06:34.599> I<00:06:34.720> pour<00:06:34.960> resin<00:06:35.139> over<00:06:35.590> you

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 
bit well once I pour resin over you

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.830 
bit well once I pour resin over you
can't<00:06:35.889> even<00:06:35.979> tell<00:06:36.310> that<00:06:36.580> to<00:06:37.330> be<00:06:37.419> on<00:06:37.509> the<00:06:37.599> safe

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 
can't even tell that to be on the safe

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.320 
can't even tell that to be on the safe
side<00:06:37.870> I<00:06:38.349> would<00:06:38.440> suggest<00:06:39.039> either<00:06:39.520> using<00:06:39.940> yes

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
side I would suggest either using yes

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.129 
side I would suggest either using yes
glue<00:06:40.720> or<00:06:41.229> even<00:06:42.070> the<00:06:42.340> Mod<00:06:42.610> Podge<00:06:42.940> cloth<00:06:43.720> the

glue or even the Mod Podge cloth the

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:46.439 
glue or even the Mod Podge cloth the
traditional<00:06:44.830> gloss<00:06:45.250> Mod<00:06:45.580> Podge<00:06:45.820> because<00:06:46.270> this

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:46.449 
traditional gloss Mod Podge because this

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:48.749 
traditional gloss Mod Podge because this
is<00:06:46.570> more<00:06:46.810> of<00:06:46.900> a<00:06:46.990> pace<00:06:47.259> it's<00:06:47.560> not<00:06:47.740> going<00:06:47.949> to<00:06:48.009> wet

00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:48.759 
is more of a pace it's not going to wet

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:51.270 
is more of a pace it's not going to wet
your<00:06:48.970> paper<00:06:49.240> and<00:06:49.720> get<00:06:50.319> it<00:06:50.409> all<00:06:50.530> wrinkly<00:06:51.009> so

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280 
your paper and get it all wrinkly so

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.010 
your paper and get it all wrinkly so
that's<00:06:51.819> something<00:06:52.000> to<00:06:52.150> keep<00:06:52.360> in<00:06:52.509> mind<00:06:52.569> I<00:06:52.960> think

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.020 
that's something to keep in mind I think

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.420 
that's something to keep in mind I think
I<00:06:53.319> would<00:06:53.440> have<00:06:53.500> done<00:06:53.710> that<00:06:53.889> instead<00:06:55.949> so<00:06:56.949> that

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:57.430 
I would have done that instead so that

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.640 
I would have done that instead so that
is<00:06:57.580> all<00:06:57.909> everybody<00:06:58.570> I<00:06:58.780> hope<00:06:58.960> you<00:06:59.110> guys<00:06:59.259> enjoy
