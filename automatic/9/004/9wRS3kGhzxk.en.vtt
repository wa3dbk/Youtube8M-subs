so<00:00:26.420> Chris<00:00:26.630> can<00:00:26.779> you<00:00:26.810> explain<00:00:27.140> the<00:00:27.350> hardware

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:27.770 
so Chris can you explain the hardware

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.410 
so Chris can you explain the hardware
monitoring<00:00:28.400> that<00:00:28.580> we<00:00:28.699> can<00:00:28.880> do<00:00:29.000> from<00:00:29.180> this

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
monitoring that we can do from this

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.350 
monitoring that we can do from this
interface<00:00:30.170> yeah<00:00:30.560> sure<00:00:30.770> of<00:00:30.920> course<00:00:31.210> first<00:00:32.210> we

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
interface yeah sure of course first we

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.060 
interface yeah sure of course first we
introduce<00:00:32.809> that<00:00:33.020> wicked<00:00:33.410> you<00:00:33.559> can<00:00:33.739> tweak<00:00:33.950> the

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
introduce that wicked you can tweak the

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.369 
introduce that wicked you can tweak the
voltage<00:00:34.460> that<00:00:34.850> frequency<00:00:35.270> you<00:00:35.840> can<00:00:35.900> see<00:00:36.200> we're

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
voltage that frequency you can see we're

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.340 
voltage that frequency you can see we're
at<00:00:36.440> right<00:00:36.590> now<00:00:36.650> and<00:00:37.070> here<00:00:38.030> we<00:00:38.210> have<00:00:38.239> some<00:00:38.629> some

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
at right now and here we have some some

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.799 
at right now and here we have some some
button<00:00:39.710> like<00:00:40.190> this<00:00:40.360> you<00:00:41.360> can<00:00:41.510> see<00:00:41.660> the

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
button like this you can see the

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.990 
button like this you can see the
temperature<00:00:42.410> you<00:00:42.890> can<00:00:42.920> monitoring<00:00:43.460> the<00:00:43.610> CPU

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
temperature you can monitoring the CPU

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.579 
temperature you can monitoring the CPU
temperature<00:00:44.290> yeah<00:00:45.290> and<00:00:46.390> not<00:00:47.390> only<00:00:47.449> CPU<00:00:48.410> the

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:48.589 
temperature yeah and not only CPU the

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:50.590 
temperature yeah and not only CPU the
Northbridge<00:00:49.190> the<00:00:49.460> options<00:00:49.879> fan<00:00:50.120> we've<00:00:50.480> had

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
Northbridge the options fan we've had

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.650 
Northbridge the options fan we've had
some<00:00:50.900> actual<00:00:51.410> fan<00:00:51.710> on<00:00:51.860> it<00:00:52.010> and<00:00:52.330> there<00:00:53.330> is<00:00:53.480> also

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
some actual fan on it and there is also

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.400 
some actual fan on it and there is also
fan<00:00:54.260> speed<00:00:54.530> yeah<00:00:55.430> it's<00:00:55.910> like<00:00:56.180> CPU<00:00:56.839> fans<00:00:57.170> be

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
fan speed yeah it's like CPU fans be

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.580 
fan speed yeah it's like CPU fans be
right<00:00:57.860> now<00:00:57.980> is<00:00:59.140> 1400<00:01:00.140> RPM<00:01:00.980> and<00:01:02.020> if<00:01:03.020> you<00:01:03.200> install

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
right now is 1400 RPM and if you install

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.609

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
frequency yeah not only cpu frequency

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.430 
frequency yeah not only cpu frequency
but<00:01:15.470> also<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:16.280> cupid<00:01:16.640> is<00:01:16.930> ciear<00:01:17.930> very

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
but also the cupid is ciear very

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.540 
but also the cupid is ciear very
frequency<00:01:19.600> and<00:01:20.600> there<00:01:21.560> is<00:01:21.649> some<00:01:21.830> advanced

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
frequency and there is some advanced

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.270 
frequency and there is some advanced
setting

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.880 

here's<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.400> item<00:01:30.000> called<00:01:30.299> my<00:01:30.570> favorite<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.830> you

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
here's a item called my favorite so you

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.149 
here's a item called my favorite so you
can<00:01:32.280> monitoring<00:01:32.970> those<00:01:33.439> items<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:35.009> you

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
can monitoring those items that you

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.399 
can monitoring those items that you
think<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.580> is<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.030> most<00:01:36.150> important<00:01:36.810> so

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
think that is the most important so

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.249 
think that is the most important so
there<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:38.840> setting<00:01:41.540> yeah<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.810> can<00:01:42.990> choose<00:01:43.200> a

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
there is a setting yeah you can choose a

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.010 
there is a setting yeah you can choose a
lot<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.100> islands<00:01:44.460> yeah<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.509> know<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.810> over

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
lot of islands yeah you know the over

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.539 
lot of islands yeah you know the over
Cocker<00:01:46.350> they<00:01:46.530> cannot<00:01:46.799> monitoring<00:01:47.310> all<00:01:47.520> the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
Cocker they cannot monitoring all the

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:55.870 
Cocker they cannot monitoring all the
eye<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.970> say<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.240> same<00:01:48.479> time<00:01:53.090> there's<00:01:54.090> a

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
eye and say the same time there's a

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.359 
eye and say the same time there's a
function<00:01:56.880> like<00:01:58.880> a<00:01:59.880> hace<00:02:00.720> poster<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.350> see<00:02:01.979> remote

hace diagram and hace file splash pad
I'll<00:02:06.990> seem<00:02:07.229> remote<00:02:07.530> which<00:02:07.740> means<00:02:07.979> i<00:02:08.550> can

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
I'll seem remote which means i can

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.890 
I'll seem remote which means i can
remote<00:02:09.300> control<00:02:09.800> this<00:02:10.800> is<00:02:11.360> so<00:02:12.360> around<00:02:12.750> i'm

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
remote control this is so around i'm

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:23.809 
remote control this is so around i'm
going<00:02:13.200> to<00:02:13.350> restart<00:02:14.130> it

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.770 

so<00:02:24.359> we're<00:02:24.599> restarting<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.409> system<00:02:26.780> you're

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
so we're restarting the system you're

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.330 
so we're restarting the system you're
starting<00:02:27.930> right<00:02:28.200> now<00:02:28.230> yeah<00:02:28.680> restarting<00:02:28.920> right

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
starting right now yeah restarting right

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:37.340 
starting right now yeah restarting right
now

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.120 

you<00:02:38.350> can<00:02:38.530> see<00:02:38.710> that<00:02:38.740> detect<00:02:39.220> memory<00:02:39.550> check<00:02:40.390> cpu

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
you can see that detect memory check cpu

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:50.540 
you can see that detect memory check cpu

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
is our see diagram the diagram means

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.190 
is our see diagram the diagram means
means<00:02:59.220> that<00:02:59.490> you<00:02:59.640> can<00:02:59.850> log<00:03:00.210> the<00:03:00.840> system

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
means that you can log the system

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.260 
means that you can log the system
information<00:03:01.440> in<00:03:02.010> real<00:03:02.250> time<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.850> you<00:03:03.090> can

information in real time and you can

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.770 
information in real time and you can
throw<00:03:03.600> it<00:03:03.630> in<00:03:03.990> a<00:03:04.080> diagram<00:03:04.440> and<00:03:04.950> this<00:03:05.780> default

throw it in a diagram and this default

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.070 
throw it in a diagram and this default
you<00:03:06.960> will<00:03:06.990> show<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.650> CPU<00:03:08.310> current<00:03:09.150> and<00:03:09.390> the

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
you will show the CPU current and the

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.320 
you will show the CPU current and the
CPU<00:03:10.440> voltage<00:03:10.770> and<00:03:11.160> of<00:03:11.550> course<00:03:11.820> you<00:03:11.940> can<00:03:12.120> add

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
CPU voltage and of course you can add

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.660 
CPU voltage and of course you can add
more<00:03:12.750> my<00:03:13.560> eternity<00:03:13.920> monitor<00:03:16.070> here<00:03:17.070> is<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.280> start

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
more my eternity monitor here is a start

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.760 
more my eternity monitor here is a start
button<00:03:17.880> here

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.960 

you<00:03:22.670> can<00:03:22.850> see<00:03:23.030> tracking<00:03:23.810> real<00:03:23.990> time<00:03:24.230> I<00:03:24.970> think

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
you can see tracking real time I think

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.760 
you can see tracking real time I think
the<00:03:26.060> expulsion<00:03:26.390> is<00:03:26.660> very<00:03:27.200> interesting

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
the expulsion is very interesting

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.160 
the expulsion is very interesting
because<00:03:27.800> it<00:03:28.370> was<00:03:28.790> feedback<00:03:29.300> by<00:03:29.570> the<00:03:29.630> power

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
because it was feedback by the power

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.860 
because it was feedback by the power
user<00:03:30.560> yeah<00:03:31.460> they<00:03:31.700> said<00:03:31.940> hey<00:03:32.210> you<00:03:32.270> you<00:03:32.660> have

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
user yeah they said hey you you have

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.490 
user yeah they said hey you you have
this<00:03:33.110> monitoring<00:03:33.890> system<00:03:34.340> so<00:03:34.610> can<00:03:35.240> you<00:03:35.500> make

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
this monitoring system so can you make

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.100 
this monitoring system so can you make
it<00:03:36.650> look<00:03:36.830> and<00:03:37.130> draw<00:03:37.820> a<00:03:37.850> diagram<00:03:38.270> and<00:03:38.570> their

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
it look and draw a diagram and their

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.620 
it look and draw a diagram and their
their<00:03:39.290> crew<00:03:39.710> police<00:03:40.010> they<00:03:41.000> like<00:03:41.180> to<00:03:41.300> run<00:03:41.330> this

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
their crew police they like to run this

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.020 
their crew police they like to run this
early<00:03:41.870> morning<00:03:42.250> they<00:03:43.250> want<00:03:43.460> to<00:03:43.550> know<00:03:43.730> when

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
early morning they want to know when

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.970 
early morning they want to know when
it's<00:03:44.510> the<00:03:44.600> happy<00:03:44.930> loading<00:03:45.380> when<00:03:45.650> it's<00:03:45.770> light

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
it's the happy loading when it's light

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.850 
it's the happy loading when it's light
loading<00:03:46.430> so<00:03:47.060> they<00:03:47.300> can<00:03:47.540> dynamically<00:03:48.260> change

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
loading so they can dynamically change

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.280 
loading so they can dynamically change
the<00:03:49.130> frequency<00:03:49.670> or<00:03:49.880> voltage<00:03:50.270> when<00:03:51.020> running

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
the frequency or voltage when running

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.890 
the frequency or voltage when running
the<00:03:51.440> benchmark
