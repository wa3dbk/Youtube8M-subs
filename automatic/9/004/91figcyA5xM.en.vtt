00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
back to 2012 I think the s3 was the most

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.700 
back to 2012 I think the s3 was the most
popular<00:01:57.030> smartphone<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.049> year<00:01:58.320> it

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
popular smartphone of the year it

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.069

essentially was the new iphone whenever
you<00:02:01.229> looked<00:02:01.409> around<00:02:01.560> everyone

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
you looked around everyone

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.230 
you looked around everyone
seemed<00:02:02.649> to<00:02:02.679> have<00:02:02.950> one<00:02:03.189> and<00:02:03.369> the<00:02:03.789> specs<00:02:04.060> have

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
seemed to have one and the specs have

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.300
