00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.610
 ok guys often was trees online and 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.959
 today I am going to teach you apart to the arch with 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.959
 curves with the inside of the foot 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.060
 because the first thing we're going to learn 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.489
 the game put a curve with the part 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.400
 internal technique 1 first you have to 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.670
 hit on the side or so that the 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.440
 ball take a little spin and do the 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.059
 lick in and then if 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.239
 wants the ball to go down and with a sag 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.890
 we have to try to hit him with the 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.540
 effect outwards with a little bit 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.940
 curve but at the same time a little bit 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.110
 up you can show it with your foot 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.930
 if we want to implement the curve the 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.760
 we are going to have to paste in this way 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.460
 so that it takes a curve and then so that 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.960
 the ball goes up, sells him to do so 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.760
 we are going to lift your foot a little 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.440
 up and that's going to make me take a 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.600
 little curve and at the same time a little curve 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.890
 from top to bottom for that ball 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.890
 download your return g 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.960
 all good 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.310
 basically the foot has to be at 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.110
 side of the ball when you stop him 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.670
 with the instep it is usually closer to the side 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.040
 of the ball but when you go to put 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.649
 aspect usually falls a little bit further back 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.050
 then I'm going to put it in appearance 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.940
 internal 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.950
 I usually stand up so you see how a 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.530
 little bit the ball away and a little bit 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.450
 there would be something like that if you put it very 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.280
 back when you take off you're going to hit 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.260
 forced and that's going to make the 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.870
 ball goes to the clouds that what 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.300
 many people pass on the other side if you put 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.460
 the foot very forward is not going to give you 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.340
 time to perform well the lever of the 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.290
 leg and you'll give and thrown into 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.430
 medium to the middle floor the ball is not going to 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.100
 come out strong and you can injure yourself 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.810
 so be very careful finally 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.520
 you have to keep in mind that the body 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.470
 you have to be relaxed for example if 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.120
 I'm going to put a free kick now 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.110
 the inner part with effect I'm going to 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.280
 hit like this and like that and he and the body do not 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.020
 I have to put the price of none 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.150
 way because maybe when I'm going to kick 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.830
 maybe you put yourself like that or move the 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.080
 You put it in your arms, what you do is 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.240
 to shape your body posture and 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.160
 make sense then is one thing that 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.630
 it happened to me and I had it correct that 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.170
 is when you kick you have to have the 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.170
 relaxed body 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.780
 yes 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.840
 ok guys I hope you liked the 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.730
 tutorial tries to implement it because 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.569
 This technique is essential to put 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.430
 some ruffled 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.709
 if you liked subscribe dale I like

 we see in the following tricks 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.830
