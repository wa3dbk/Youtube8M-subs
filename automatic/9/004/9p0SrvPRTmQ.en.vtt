00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.749
 show them how this makeup is done 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.400
 that is grench style is very similar 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:16.299
 also the style of makeup that 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:20.349
 they make maker and ashley olsen is like very 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.020
 rocker let's see how it's done and 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.420
 hope you like 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.110
 first of all I'm going to use this palette 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.960
 of colors of vueling on the tea 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.810
 everything in brown shades I'll start with 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.650
 the diffused brush and the base shade 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:41.760
 that would be the clearest is I'm going to 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.760
 apply on the entire eyelid 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.989
 from the eyelashes to the eyebrows 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.060
 to match the color of the eyelid 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.070
 now I'm going to use this same palette what 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.049
 what I'm going to do is I'm going to use this 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.170
 shadow of dark brown range with the 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.180
 shadow brush 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.470
 and I'm going to apply it all over the eyelid 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.470
 mobile to the fold 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.110
 and as I 'm applying it I 'm going said 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.110
 looking a little bit of the foot that also 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.579
 ready once apply this I'm going to 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:46.170
 apply the same with the same brush 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:48.530
 I'm going to apply it on the tabs of 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.530
 down 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.960
 by all the tabs below 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.720
 Now what I'm going to do is apply a 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.510
 shadow color bronze like this 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.170
 I will apply it will also arrive 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.170
 I just applied 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.000
 and I also blur it in the 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.260
 fold 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.260
 with the other shadow 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.550
 it does not matter if it's not very neat now 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.550
 let's give it a little bit like that 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:40.680
 this then that is a little messy 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.680
 it's not so perfect 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.060
 in a more rock style 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.580
 well then it's staying these were 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.990
 now I return the palette of maybelline to 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.970
 the before and now I will use this 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.580
 color that is like a bronze color more 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.410
 clear with the same brush I'm going to the 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.900
 I'm going to apply this shadow only in 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.920
 fold 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.920
 he blurred it 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.140
 and now I'm going to grab my brush 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.140
 blurred and that I'm going to 10 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.780
 so that I do not stay too 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.830
 applied a little more of the shadow of 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.830
 this shadow 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.680
 a little bit more here 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:56.410
 my base brush I will make a 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.410
 proposed hangover 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.209
 Now what I'm going to do is grab a 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.560
 black pencil eyeliner and I'm going to 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.560
 apply the eye all inside 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.900
 A) Yes 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.900
 and I have had it also outside 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.689
 and one performs the shadow one and spread it 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.529
 a little more 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:36.529
 not much 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.780
 now I'm going to curl my eyelashes 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.360
 and I'm going to use a black tab 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.690
 I'm going to use two layers on the lashes of 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.690
 above 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:21.290
 the first layer now I'm going to 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.880
 use another eyelash this one that has 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:27.560
 the super small brush 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.560
 I'm going to apply a low coat 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.729
 applied the second layer up the 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:36.729
 tabs above 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:52.000
 A) Yes 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.890
 now let's continue 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.139
 in this case I will not apply blush 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:58.590
 I'm just going to apply 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:01.120
 a bronzing powder that the cheeks 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:03.960
 then I will grab a brush of 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.960
 wrinkle like this 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.800
 and I will apply the blush 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.500
 below the cheekbones where it is formed 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:17.020
 the break between the jaw and cheekbone 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:20.520
 there I will apply that powder and what I'm going 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.520
 to do is blur it up 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.260
 in this way it helped that the face 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:30.340
 thin a little more of the sides the 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.340
 outline a little 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.090
 and finally for the lips I'm going to 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:40.570
 applying a blush of this color is 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.570
 type news 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:54.940
 well news style and I'm going to end up with a 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.940
 shine you are english rose 

00:06:56.249 --> 00:07:00.559
 I apply only in the center of 

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:00.559
 lips 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:27.310
 the girls then like that would see the light 

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:28.960
 final this would be the look branch 

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.510
 So, I hope you have them 

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.760
 I hope you try, I hope 

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:35.740
