00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.310
 nokia ask me why i keep 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.620
 ants but because the ant does not make noise 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.900
 we are the area from the smell of wool dust from them 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.000
 there is no rubbish at all 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.700
 dial pending your favorite carpet not 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.859
 crush your favorite slippers ants 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.189
 live in a compact and easy to formikarii 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.750
 Well, try to move the aquarium 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.970
 ants are very mobile and they will not 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.930
 lovely melancholic hang in one 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.359
 aquarium location 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.320
 Formicaria constantly what is happening 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.050
 work is in full swing 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.140
 ants do not sharpen claws sofa and spring 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.840
 they also have no complications where ants 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.270
 is pocketing one penny ant themselves 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.850
 puts order in his formarias and 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.629
 in general, they do everything themselves and they do not need 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.030
 to walk 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.210
 in order to make a formacaria us 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.160
 need two containers for pasta 1 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.940
 I had a capacity for a long time and it already 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.480
 old 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.780
 and 2 containers were purchased in the store 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.739
 shortly before this video open 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.899
 first capacity 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.949
 first capacity we will do moves with 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.720
 using plasticine 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.990
 take a technical bed and make moves 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.210
 let's give plasticine a start 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.390
 after which we stick 2 containers for 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.119
 the macaroni is good what's worse and 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.340
 make moves if you don't have plasticine 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.110
 quite a lot to do in the room 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.299
 floors like i do in this video 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:32.960
 Room should get 9-10 pieces and 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.960
 moves naturally more until 15 and 20 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.180
 Now pour the prepared plaster 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.270
 shape and get rid of the bubbles with 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.189
 using taps after gypsum 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.049
 and will harden neatly cut 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.659
 container and take the form out of it 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.390
 we get clay and put it on a new one 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.829
 new container 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.310
 cut off a piece of test tube she will 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.340
 perform 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.159
 we have a door for entering food 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:06.040
 then follow the drilled 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:08.800
 holes for this door using a drill 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.320
 insert our little door and 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.300
 smeared with any sealant to 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.200
 for example, if the water is not spread 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.550
 and in this case I use 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.550
 ordinary nail polish 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:29.420
 well then look for an ant and run them in 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.370
 formacarius and at first I collected a little 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.210
 ants well, then I think everyone will gather 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.360
 will find 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.990
 queen of theirs or just on the internet 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.220
 I will order 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:42.410
 full colonies without a queen they won't 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.670
 multiply a little bit 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.140
 well, everything is fixable interesting ants for 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.450
 they are interesting to watch 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.110
 for example in the evening sitting on the couch and 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.270
 watch as the work boils no special 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:00.080
 no care they all do 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:03.170
 yourself and three days you need to give him either 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.800
 minced shrimp or a few drops 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.200
 iodine and be sure to moisturize 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:12.170
 which i do moisten with 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.540
 about two milliliters of water every 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:22.300
 three days that's the way we are trying 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:24.230
 run away that's better close and also 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:29.480
 air needs to be released 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:32.780
 and we are not picky every three days 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:36.500
 easy to care for, so hereâ€™s a macro lens 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:39.980
 chick you can see at the maximum 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.659
 approximation in general thank you for your attention 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.909
