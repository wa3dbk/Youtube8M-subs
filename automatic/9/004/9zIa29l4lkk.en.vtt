00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
doesn't sound too bad it definitely

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.690 
doesn't sound too bad it definitely
sounds<00:01:20.759> like<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.909> v6<00:01:21.450> though<00:01:21.720> at<00:01:22.619> idle<00:01:23.040> it's

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
sounds like a v6 though at idle it's

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.730 
sounds like a v6 though at idle it's
it's<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.630> bit<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.930> more<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.320> throaty<00:01:25.619> sound

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
it's a bit of more of a throaty sound

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.219 
it's a bit of more of a throaty sound
but<00:01:26.310> at<00:01:26.490> higher<00:01:26.700> rpm<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.420> can<00:01:27.600> tell<00:01:27.810> it's<00:01:27.990> it's

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
but at higher rpm you can tell it's it's

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.490 
but at higher rpm you can tell it's it's
not<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.500> v8<00:01:29.180> but<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.210> knew<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.600> going<00:01:30.810> into<00:01:31.140> it

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040
