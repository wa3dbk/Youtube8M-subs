00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.210 
buckets in here which allows you to get
milk<00:02:27.930> buckets<00:02:29.360> sweet-ass<00:02:30.650> so<00:02:31.650> that's<00:02:31.830> what

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
milk buckets sweet-ass so that's what

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.760 
milk buckets sweet-ass so that's what
the<00:02:32.640> farmer<00:02:33.120> does<00:02:33.300> again<00:02:33.750> four<00:02:34.050> tiers<00:02:34.380> the

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
the farmer does again four tiers the

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.820 
the farmer does again four tiers the
different<00:02:35.100> tiers<00:02:35.280> they<00:02:35.790> will<00:02:36.500> since<00:02:37.500> there<00:02:37.739> is

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
different tiers they will since there is

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.190 
different tiers they will since there is
no<00:02:38.069> actual<00:02:38.489> tools<00:02:38.790> here<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.720> different<00:02:40.050> tiers

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
no actual tools here the different tiers

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.820 
no actual tools here the different tiers
just<00:02:40.530> work<00:02:40.739> faster<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:42.500> that's<00:02:43.500> that's

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
just work faster and that's that's

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.830 
just work faster and that's that's
pretty<00:02:44.190> much<00:02:44.370> it<00:02:44.610> so<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:46.680> next<00:02:47.450> thing<00:02:48.450> we<00:02:48.600> have

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
pretty much it so the next thing we have

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.640 
pretty much it so the next thing we have
here<00:02:49.110> is<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:50.060> killer<00:02:51.060> block<00:02:51.780> now<00:02:52.140> this<00:02:52.410> can

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
here is the killer block now this can

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.590 
here is the killer block now this can
work<00:02:52.860> in<00:02:53.160> conjunction<00:02:53.370> with<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.360> breeder

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
on it of course it won't get attacked

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.060 
on it of course it won't get attacked
now<00:05:06.450> of<00:05:06.539> course<00:05:06.690> these<00:05:07.350> things<00:05:07.410> will<00:05:07.860> also

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
now of course these things will also

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.120 
now of course these things will also
take<00:05:10.190> enchantments<00:05:11.190> like<00:05:11.370> any<00:05:11.610> other<00:05:11.789> tools

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
take enchantments like any other tools

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.190
