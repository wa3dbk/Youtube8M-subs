the pitman family in Paris so I don't

the pitman family in Paris so I don't
know<00:00:49.829> maybe<00:00:50.520> that's<00:00:50.700> an<00:00:50.910> option<00:00:51.059> but<00:00:51.719> where

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
know maybe that's an option but where

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.119

Anthony<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.670> don't<00:00:54.300> think<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.600> Bulls<00:00:54.840> would<00:00:54.989> be

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
Anthony I don't think the Bulls would be

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.560 
Anthony I don't think the Bulls would be
a<00:00:55.170> good<00:00:55.320> fit<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.949> here's<00:00:56.489> why<00:00:56.670> I'm<00:00:57.270> saying

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
a good fit and here's why I'm saying

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.310 
a good fit and here's why I'm saying
that<00:00:58.129> Derrick<00:00:59.129> Rose<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.670> the<00:01:00.059> main<00:01:00.300> star<00:01:01.050> in

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
Chicago Carmelo were most likely have to

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.020 
Chicago Carmelo were most likely have to
become<00:01:04.500> second<00:01:04.979> star<00:01:05.189> if<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.790> know<00:01:05.880> what<00:01:06.000> I
