sounds<00:02:45.970> like<00:02:46.000> this<00:02:46.120> and<00:02:47.460> I'm<00:02:48.460> gonna<00:02:48.700> strum

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
sounds like this and I'm gonna strum

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.760 
sounds like this and I'm gonna strum
from<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.750> fourth<00:02:50.140> string<00:02:50.590> down<00:02:52.200> so<00:02:53.200> that<00:02:53.320> open

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
from the fourth string down so that open

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.350 
from the fourth string down so that open
D<00:02:54.010> string<00:02:54.040> that's<00:02:54.730> my<00:02:54.940> root<00:02:55.210> note<00:02:55.480> and<00:02:57.360> this

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
D string that's my root note and this

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.760 
D string that's my root note and this
court<00:02:58.660> can<00:02:58.780> be<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:58.900> little<00:02:59.140> bit<00:02:59.260> tricky<00:02:59.590> there's

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
court can be a little bit tricky there's

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.500 
court can be a little bit tricky there's
a<00:02:59.830> little<00:03:00.100> bit<00:03:00.220> of<00:03:00.310> a<00:03:00.400> stretch<00:03:00.790> involved<00:03:01.360> here

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
a little bit of a stretch involved here

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.910 
a little bit of a stretch involved here
it's<00:03:01.630> not<00:03:01.720> a<00:03:01.780> real<00:03:01.960> comfortable<00:03:02.440> chord<00:03:02.770> to

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
it's not a real comfortable chord to

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.920 
it's not a real comfortable chord to
start<00:03:03.160> playing<00:03:03.400> when<00:03:03.610> you<00:03:03.700> first<00:03:03.940> start<00:03:04.330> but

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
start playing when you first start but

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.540 
start playing when you first start but
just<00:03:05.320> give<00:03:05.470> it<00:03:05.560> a<00:03:05.620> little<00:03:05.800> time<00:03:06.070> there's<00:03:06.490> a

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
just give it a little time there's a

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.880 
just give it a little time there's a
couple<00:03:06.850> of<00:03:07.060> variations<00:03:07.720> in<00:03:08.050> how<00:03:08.230> to<00:03:08.290> play<00:03:08.590> it

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
couple of variations in how to play it

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.810 
couple of variations in how to play it
I<00:03:08.920> generally<00:03:09.490> like<00:03:09.850> to<00:03:09.910> use<00:03:10.270> this<00:03:11.110> form<00:03:11.530> if<00:03:11.980> all

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
I generally like to use this form if all

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.610 
I generally like to use this form if all
I'm<00:03:13.180> doing<00:03:13.480> is<00:03:13.570> playing<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:13.959> chord<00:03:14.200> but<00:03:14.350> if<00:03:14.470> I

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
I'm doing is playing the chord but if I

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.430 
I'm doing is playing the chord but if I
want<00:03:14.920> to<00:03:15.070> do<00:03:15.340> some<00:03:16.090> other<00:03:16.450> things<00:03:16.990> I<00:03:17.260> might

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
want to do some other things I might

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.470 
want to do some other things I might
sometimes<00:03:17.950> use<00:03:18.160> my<00:03:18.310> little<00:03:18.520> finger<00:03:18.610> down<00:03:19.060> here

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
sometimes use my little finger down here

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
sometimes use my little finger down here
that<00:03:19.990> I<00:03:20.020> can

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.560 

can<00:03:30.500> use<00:03:30.710> that<00:03:31.310> finger<00:03:31.640> for<00:03:32.060> playing<00:03:32.330> bass

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
can use that finger for playing bass

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.810 
can use that finger for playing bass
notes<00:03:32.900> or<00:03:33.050> whatever<00:03:33.310> but<00:03:34.310> the<00:03:34.430> way<00:03:34.520> that<00:03:34.670> you

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
notes or whatever but the way that you

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.190 
notes or whatever but the way that you
want<00:03:35.000> to<00:03:35.060> play<00:03:35.240> it<00:03:35.300> for<00:03:35.510> now<00:03:35.630> is<00:03:35.840> just<00:03:36.050> like

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
want to play it for now is just like

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.210 
want to play it for now is just like
this<00:03:36.700> and<00:03:38.080> you<00:03:39.080> know<00:03:39.200> just<00:03:39.410> practice<00:03:39.950> with<00:03:40.100> it

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
this and you know just practice with it

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.070 
this and you know just practice with it
one<00:03:40.460> good<00:03:40.700> way<00:03:40.850> to<00:03:40.880> practice<00:03:41.420> is<00:03:41.570> just<00:03:41.780> coming

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
one good way to practice is just coming

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.290 
one good way to practice is just coming
out<00:03:42.200> of<00:03:42.260> a<00:03:42.560> D<00:03:42.830> chord<00:03:43.130> so<00:03:43.730> even<00:03:44.030> though<00:03:44.150> those

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
out of a D chord so even though those

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.120 
out of a D chord so even though those
two<00:03:44.330> chords<00:03:44.750> aren't<00:03:45.170> necessarily<00:03:45.560> played

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
two chords aren't necessarily played

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.970 
two chords aren't necessarily played
together<00:03:46.820> all<00:03:47.180> that<00:03:47.570> often<00:03:48.140> it<00:03:48.410> makes<00:03:48.680> it<00:03:48.890> a

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
together all that often it makes it a

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.980 
together all that often it makes it a
good<00:03:49.190> exercise<00:03:49.730> so<00:03:50.150> I<00:03:50.180> would<00:03:50.360> start<00:03:50.600> on<00:03:50.690> a<00:03:50.750> D

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:50.990 
good exercise so I would start on a D

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.990 
good exercise so I would start on a D
chord<00:03:51.290> and<00:03:52.090> then<00:03:53.090> leave<00:03:53.300> my<00:03:54.460> third<00:03:55.460> finger<00:03:55.820> and

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
chord and then leave my third finger and

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.820 
chord and then leave my third finger and
my<00:03:56.180> ring<00:03:56.210> finger<00:03:56.780> where<00:03:56.990> it<00:03:57.020> is<00:03:57.230> and<00:03:57.470> then<00:03:57.590> just

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
my ring finger where it is and then just

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.680 
my ring finger where it is and then just
move<00:03:58.010> these<00:03:58.190> two<00:03:58.340> fingers<00:03:58.550> into<00:03:58.970> the<00:03:59.240> D<00:03:59.420> minor

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
move these two fingers into the D minor

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:08.740 
move these two fingers into the D minor
shape<00:04:00.050> so<00:04:00.380> I<00:04:00.470> go<00:04:00.590> D<00:04:01.000> D<00:04:02.000> minor<00:04:03.610> and<00:04:07.630> just<00:04:08.630> give

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
shape so I go D D minor and just give

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:09.400 
shape so I go D D minor and just give
this<00:04:08.870> one

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
this one

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:10.870 
this one
you<00:04:09.500> know<00:04:09.620> a<00:04:09.650> little<00:04:09.980> practice<00:04:10.550> when<00:04:10.760> you're

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
you know a little practice when you're

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.430 
you know a little practice when you're
using<00:04:11.090> it<00:04:11.330> in<00:04:11.450> the<00:04:11.510> context<00:04:11.870> of<00:04:12.020> this<00:04:12.140> blues

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
using it in the context of this blues

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.250 
using it in the context of this blues
progression<00:04:13.010> that<00:04:13.130> I'm<00:04:13.220> giving<00:04:13.550> you<00:04:14.080> you<00:04:15.080> can

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
progression that I'm giving you you can

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.310 
progression that I'm giving you you can
take<00:04:15.470> this<00:04:15.890> shape<00:04:16.220> right<00:04:16.280> here<00:04:16.549> and<00:04:17.239> just<00:04:18.049> move

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
take this shape right here and just move

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.759 
take this shape right here and just move
it<00:04:18.440> up<00:04:18.620> and<00:04:18.980> then<00:04:19.489> go<00:04:19.670> into<00:04:19.820> the<00:04:20.030> a<00:04:20.450> minor<00:04:21.049> so<00:04:21.739> I

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
it up and then go into the a minor so I

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.560 
it up and then go into the a minor so I
don't<00:04:22.100> have<00:04:22.310> to<00:04:22.460> pull<00:04:22.850> out<00:04:23.030> of<00:04:23.060> this<00:04:23.300> shape

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
don't have to pull out of this shape

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.570 
don't have to pull out of this shape
entirely<00:04:24.050> and<00:04:24.500> then<00:04:24.590> go<00:04:24.800> into<00:04:24.950> the<00:04:25.190> a<00:04:25.220> minor

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
entirely and then go into the a minor

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.240 
entirely and then go into the a minor
chord<00:04:25.700> or<00:04:26.240> even<00:04:26.690> the<00:04:26.810> e7<00:04:27.470> for<00:04:27.650> that<00:04:27.770> matter<00:04:27.980> I

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
chord or even the e7 for that matter I

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.510 
chord or even the e7 for that matter I
can<00:04:28.430> just<00:04:28.640> keep<00:04:28.910> these<00:04:29.720> two<00:04:30.020> fingers<00:04:30.320> my<00:04:30.800> index

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
can just keep these two fingers my index

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.940 
can just keep these two fingers my index
and<00:04:31.820> middle<00:04:32.360> fingers<00:04:32.870> in<00:04:33.020> this<00:04:33.560> particular

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
and middle fingers in this particular

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.350 
and middle fingers in this particular
shape<00:04:34.400> and<00:04:34.580> then<00:04:34.730> just<00:04:34.940> do<00:04:35.060> a<00:04:35.090> slight

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
shape and then just do a slight

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.230 
shape and then just do a slight
adjustment<00:04:35.510> and<00:04:36.020> move<00:04:36.290> to<00:04:36.440> the<00:04:36.530> a<00:04:36.560> minor<00:04:37.240> there

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
adjustment and move to the a minor there

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.340 
adjustment and move to the a minor there
there<00:04:38.930> and<00:04:39.710> then<00:04:40.070> what<00:04:40.250> I<00:04:40.280> need<00:04:40.370> to<00:04:40.610> go<00:04:40.760> to<00:04:40.820> the

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
there and then what I need to go to the

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.630 
there and then what I need to go to the
e7<00:04:42.350> I<00:04:42.410> think<00:04:42.590> actually<00:04:42.770> in<00:04:43.040> this<00:04:43.130> particular

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
e7 I think actually in this particular

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.400 
e7 I think actually in this particular
instance<00:04:44.240> all<00:04:44.510> we<00:04:44.660> needed<00:04:44.930> we're<00:04:45.080> going<00:04:45.290> from

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
instance all we needed we're going from

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.610 
instance all we needed we're going from
the<00:04:45.560> e7<00:04:46.280> to<00:04:46.940> the<00:04:47.120> d7<00:04:47.690> so<00:04:47.720> I<00:04:47.900> would<00:04:48.169> just<00:04:48.410> take

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
the e7 to the d7 so I would just take

chord and the d7 chord into a D minor
chord<00:05:35.469> and<00:05:35.650> we'll<00:05:36.279> keep<00:05:36.460> the<00:05:36.669> e7<00:05:37.270> chord<00:05:37.300> just

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.899 
chord and we'll keep the e7 chord just
as<00:05:38.050> it<00:05:38.169> is<00:05:38.349> but<00:05:38.919> the<00:05:38.979> order<00:05:39.370> of<00:05:39.430> the<00:05:39.520> chords<00:05:39.819> is
