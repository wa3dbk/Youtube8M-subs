hi Dave Smith here from DJ s photography
this<00:00:08.389> video<00:00:08.720> is<00:00:08.900> another<00:00:09.200> in<00:00:09.559> the<00:00:09.830> series<00:00:10.040> of

this video is another in the series of
my<00:00:10.490> black<00:00:10.700> and<00:00:10.880> white<00:00:11.290> workflow<00:00:12.290> it's<00:00:12.589> been<00:00:12.740> a

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:12.769 
my black and white workflow it's been a

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.459 
my black and white workflow it's been a
little<00:00:12.950> while<00:00:13.190> since<00:00:13.219> I<00:00:13.610> posted<00:00:13.790> I<00:00:14.240> mean<00:00:15.200> I<00:00:15.289> did

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:15.469 
little while since I posted I mean I did

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.910 
little while since I posted I mean I did
post<00:00:16.010> one<00:00:16.250> from<00:00:17.060> my<00:00:17.180> holiday<00:00:17.539> home<00:00:17.770> during<00:00:18.770> the

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
post one from my holiday home during the

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.620 
post one from my holiday home during the
summer<00:00:19.160> but<00:00:19.369> the<00:00:19.430> sound<00:00:19.730> quality<00:00:19.820> was<00:00:20.270> awful

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
summer but the sound quality was awful

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.160 
summer but the sound quality was awful
so<00:00:20.780> I<00:00:20.840> took<00:00:20.990> it<00:00:21.170> off<00:00:21.700> so<00:00:22.700> I'm<00:00:23.000> back<00:00:23.150> in<00:00:23.570> Brussels

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
so I took it off so I'm back in Brussels

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.450 
so I took it off so I'm back in Brussels
now<00:00:24.380> and<00:00:24.760> this<00:00:25.760> is<00:00:26.650> one<00:00:27.650> little<00:00:27.890> area<00:00:28.130> where<00:00:28.400> I

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
now and this is one little area where I

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.139 
now and this is one little area where I
set<00:00:28.790> up<00:00:29.620> images<00:00:30.620> and<00:00:30.770> this<00:00:30.860> is<00:00:31.070> a<00:00:31.100> this<00:00:31.970> is<00:00:32.119> a

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
set up images and this is a this is a

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:35.200 
set up images and this is a this is a
series<00:00:32.809> that<00:00:32.840> I'm<00:00:33.340> just<00:00:34.340> starting<00:00:34.430> on<00:00:35.000> about

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
series that I'm just starting on about

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.090 
series that I'm just starting on about
beauty<00:00:35.629> in<00:00:35.690> decay<00:00:36.940> letting<00:00:37.940> these<00:00:38.089> flowers

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
beauty in decay letting these flowers

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.349 
beauty in decay letting these flowers
desiccating<00:00:40.100> this<00:00:40.280> way<00:00:40.519> it<00:00:40.730> gives<00:00:40.910> them<00:00:41.089> this

00:00:41.349 --> 00:00:41.359 
desiccating this way it gives them this

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:45.250 
desiccating this way it gives them this
highly<00:00:42.260> structural<00:00:43.390> property<00:00:44.390> which<00:00:44.539> I<00:00:44.690> feel

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
highly structural property which I feel

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.540 
highly structural property which I feel
is<00:00:45.289> very<00:00:45.589> good<00:00:45.859> for<00:00:46.100> black<00:00:46.219> and<00:00:46.429> white

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
is very good for black and white

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.919 
is very good for black and white
photography<00:00:47.319> so<00:00:48.319> I've<00:00:48.440> set<00:00:48.769> up<00:00:48.920> a<00:00:49.569> very<00:00:50.569> quick

00:00:50.919 --> 00:00:50.929 
photography so I've set up a very quick

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:52.930 
photography so I've set up a very quick
thing<00:00:51.170> years<00:00:51.499> don't<00:00:52.219> claim<00:00:52.460> any<00:00:52.670> great

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
thing years don't claim any great

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.529 
thing years don't claim any great
artistic<00:00:54.339> arrangement<00:00:55.339> here<00:00:55.999> I've<00:00:56.179> set<00:00:56.390> this

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
artistic arrangement here I've set this

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.020 
artistic arrangement here I've set this
up<00:00:56.749> for<00:00:56.780> our<00:00:57.079> purposes<00:00:57.699> and<00:00:58.699> I've

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
up for our purposes and I've

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.729 
up for our purposes and I've
deliberately<00:00:59.359> said<00:00:59.659> things<00:00:59.870> in<00:00:59.960> this<00:01:00.469> sort<00:01:00.710> of

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
deliberately said things in this sort of

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.579 
deliberately said things in this sort of
diagonal<00:01:01.219> line<00:01:01.489> along<00:01:01.819> here<00:01:02.149> and<00:01:02.780> what<00:01:03.469> we

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
diagonal line along here and what we

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:05.380 
diagonal line along here and what we
want<00:01:03.739> to<00:01:03.769> do<00:01:03.920> is<00:01:04.010> to<00:01:04.129> get<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:04.460> is<00:01:04.640> nicely

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
want to do is to get the is nicely

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.510 
want to do is to get the is nicely
focused<00:01:06.070> now<00:01:07.070> in<00:01:07.960> operating<00:01:08.960> any<00:01:09.680> camera<00:01:10.100> to

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
focused now in operating any camera to

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.780 
focused now in operating any camera to
be<00:01:10.610> honest<00:01:10.909> now<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:11.920> focusing<00:01:12.920> relies<00:01:13.250> upon<00:01:13.460> a

be honest now the focusing relies upon a
principle<00:01:14.210> called<00:01:14.659> a<00:01:14.780> shine<00:01:15.020> through

has<00:01:18.079> two<00:01:18.469> components<00:01:19.460> to<00:01:19.610> it<00:01:19.729> one<00:01:20.479> is<00:01:20.600> that<00:01:20.840> if

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
has two components to it one is that if

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.429 
has two components to it one is that if
your<00:01:21.890> subject<00:01:22.549> plane<00:01:22.820> here's<00:01:23.689> our<00:01:23.899> subject

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
your subject plane here's our subject

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.529 
your subject plane here's our subject
and<00:01:24.649> this<00:01:25.280> is<00:01:25.460> the<00:01:25.549> plane<00:01:25.820> that<00:01:25.850> we<00:01:26.180> want<00:01:26.329> to<00:01:26.390> be

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
and this is the plane that we want to be

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:29.469 
and this is the plane that we want to be
in<00:01:26.630> focus<00:01:26.930> here<00:01:27.729> and<00:01:28.729> so<00:01:28.909> that's<00:01:29.030> our<00:01:29.210> subject

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
in focus here and so that's our subject

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.550 
in focus here and so that's our subject
plane<00:01:30.430> and<00:01:31.430> your<00:01:31.579> lens<00:01:31.939> plane<00:01:32.390> and<00:01:32.659> this<00:01:33.289> lens

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
plane and your lens plane and this lens

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.069 
plane and your lens plane and this lens
here<00:01:33.979> and<00:01:34.189> your<00:01:34.399> image<00:01:34.759> plane<00:01:35.149> or<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.719> images

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079

here and your image plane or the images
form<00:01:36.409> if<00:01:36.950> there<00:01:37.189> are<00:01:37.340> parallel<00:01:37.960> then<00:01:38.960> you<00:01:39.200> can

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
form if there are parallel then you can

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.480 
form if there are parallel then you can
get<00:01:40.219> everything<00:01:40.640> in<00:01:40.850> focus<00:01:40.880> and<00:01:42.130> that's<00:01:43.130> the

get everything in focus and that's the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.120 
get everything in focus and that's the
part<00:01:44.090> of<00:01:44.299> the<00:01:44.359> shine<00:01:44.600> through<00:01:44.840> that<00:01:45.140> 35mm

unless of course you use a shift to lens
in<00:01:52.609> which<00:01:52.789> case<00:01:53.030> you<00:01:53.210> can<00:01:53.240> kind<00:01:53.869> of<00:01:54.049> get<00:01:54.289> some

in which case you can kind of get some
aspect<00:01:56.090> of<00:01:56.359> the

of the principle tells us that if you

of the principle tells us that if you
can't<00:02:02.690> get<00:02:02.960> those<00:02:03.200> three<00:02:03.380> things<00:02:03.590> in<00:02:03.800> parallel

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
can't get those three things in parallel

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.460 
can't get those three things in parallel
then<00:02:04.730> what<00:02:04.970> you<00:02:05.090> have<00:02:05.480> to<00:02:05.600> do<00:02:05.720> is<00:02:05.930> to<00:02:06.080> get<00:02:06.260> them

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
then what you have to do is to get them

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.669 
then what you have to do is to get them
to<00:02:06.680> meet<00:02:07.580> at<00:02:07.760> a<00:02:07.850> point<00:02:08.119> no<00:02:09.080> matter<00:02:09.380> where<00:02:09.649> that

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
to meet at a point no matter where that

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.680 
to meet at a point no matter where that
point<00:02:10.039> is<00:02:10.280> but<00:02:10.640> you<00:02:10.940> want<00:02:10.970> to<00:02:11.210> get<00:02:11.360> them<00:02:11.450> to

point is but you want to get them to
meet<00:02:11.840> at<00:02:11.990> a<00:02:12.050> point<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.760> I've<00:02:13.880> set<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.270> tempo

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
meet at a point and I've set the tempo

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.150 
meet at a point and I've set the tempo
eighths<00:02:14.840> up<00:02:15.020> here<00:02:15.230> to<00:02:15.380> illustrate<00:02:15.530> that<00:02:15.890> and

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
eighths up here to illustrate that and

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.790 
eighths up here to illustrate that and
I'm<00:02:16.250> going<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.520> show<00:02:16.700> it<00:02:16.820> with<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.060> GX<00:02:17.500> 680<00:02:18.500> as

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
I'm going to show it with the GX 680 as

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.730 
I'm going to show it with the GX 680 as
well<00:02:19.300> and<00:02:20.300> have<00:02:20.390> previously<00:02:20.930> loaded<00:02:21.200> videos

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
well and have previously loaded videos

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.920 
well and have previously loaded videos
that<00:02:21.950> show<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.730> movements<00:02:23.270> of<00:02:23.390> those<00:02:23.690> two

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
that show the movements of those two

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.800 
that show the movements of those two
cameras<00:02:24.440> so<00:02:24.830> if<00:02:24.950> you<00:02:25.130> want<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.090> see<00:02:26.450> what<00:02:26.690> the

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
cameras so if you want to see what the

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.840 
cameras so if you want to see what the
movements<00:02:27.290> are<00:02:27.440> you<00:02:28.280> can<00:02:28.430> go<00:02:28.550> and<00:02:28.640> look<00:02:28.700> at

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
movements are you can go and look at

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.330 
movements are you can go and look at
those<00:02:29.000> videos<00:02:31.180> as<00:02:32.180> well<00:02:32.390> okay<00:02:33.350> so<00:02:33.680> let's<00:02:34.280> have

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
those videos as well okay so let's have

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.370 
those videos as well okay so let's have
a<00:02:34.459> look<00:02:34.610> at<00:02:34.730> these<00:02:34.850> planes<00:02:35.209> and<00:02:35.390> so<00:02:35.540> I've<00:02:35.690> set

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
a look at these planes and so I've set

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.699 
a look at these planes and so I've set
this<00:02:36.530> up<00:02:36.739> now<00:02:36.980> this<00:02:37.190> is<00:02:37.840> set<00:02:38.840> up<00:02:39.050> and<00:02:39.230> focused

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
this up now this is set up and focused

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.740 
this up now this is set up and focused
so<00:02:39.800> all<00:02:40.130> these<00:02:40.400> three<00:02:40.760> flowers<00:02:41.239> are<00:02:41.420> in<00:02:41.540> good

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
so all these three flowers are in good

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.449 
so all these three flowers are in good
focus<00:02:42.320> and<00:02:42.470> we<00:02:42.560> can<00:02:42.739> get<00:02:42.920> to<00:02:43.070> see<00:02:43.250> that

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
focus and we can get to see that

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.180 
focus and we can get to see that
structural<00:02:44.090> detail<00:02:44.570> of<00:02:44.690> the<00:02:44.780> desiccation<00:02:45.470> but

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
structural detail of the desiccation but

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.760 
structural detail of the desiccation but
let's<00:02:46.340> look<00:02:46.489> at<00:02:46.610> the<00:02:46.670> three<00:02:46.880> points<00:02:47.270> here<00:02:47.510> is

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
let's look at the three points here is

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.580 
let's look at the three points here is
here<00:02:48.770> is<00:02:48.950> a<00:02:49.390> subject<00:02:50.390> line<00:02:50.600> coming<00:02:51.200> out<00:02:51.350> in

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
here is a subject line coming out in

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.070 
here is a subject line coming out in
this<00:02:51.770> direction<00:02:52.510> I'm<00:02:53.510> just<00:02:53.720> going<00:02:53.870> to<00:02:53.930> get

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
this direction I'm just going to get

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.830 
this direction I'm just going to get
something<00:02:54.830> that<00:02:54.980> help<00:02:55.220> us<00:02:55.370> see<00:02:55.400> that<00:02:58.840> the

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
something that help us see that the

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.620 
something that help us see that the
large<00:03:00.050> envelope<00:03:00.530> here<00:03:01.209> so<00:03:02.209> here's<00:03:02.480> our

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
large envelope here so here's our

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.440 
large envelope here so here's our
subject<00:03:03.200> plane<00:03:03.440> coming<00:03:04.100> off<00:03:04.220> in<00:03:04.450> this

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
subject plane coming off in this

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.050 
subject plane coming off in this
direction<00:03:06.370> okay<00:03:07.480> now<00:03:08.480> if<00:03:08.950> I've<00:03:09.950> used<00:03:10.790> the

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
direction okay now if I've used the

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.560 
direction okay now if I've used the
swing<00:03:12.430> adjustment<00:03:13.430> on<00:03:13.580> the<00:03:13.700> lens<00:03:13.910> panel<00:03:14.360> so

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
swing adjustment on the lens panel so

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.390 
swing adjustment on the lens panel so
the<00:03:14.780> letter<00:03:15.530> panel<00:03:15.920> isn't<00:03:17.680> isn't<00:03:18.680> zero<00:03:18.980> set

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
the letter panel isn't isn't zero set

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.680 
the letter panel isn't isn't zero set
I've<00:03:19.640> turned<00:03:20.269> it<00:03:20.570> so<00:03:21.140> my<00:03:21.350> less<00:03:22.220> plane<00:03:22.640> is<00:03:23.360> like

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
I've turned it so my less plane is like

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.050 
I've turned it so my less plane is like
this<00:03:23.959> it's<00:03:24.590> not<00:03:24.739> flat<00:03:25.130> onto<00:03:25.549> those<00:03:25.670> flowers

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
this it's not flat onto those flowers

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.750 
this it's not flat onto those flowers
giving<00:03:26.900> it<00:03:26.989> a<00:03:27.080> little<00:03:27.380> bit<00:03:27.500> of<00:03:27.590> Swing<00:03:27.950> coming

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
giving it a little bit of Swing coming

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.460 
giving it a little bit of Swing coming
out<00:03:28.880> in<00:03:29.030> this<00:03:29.150> direction<00:03:29.390> you<00:03:30.080> should<00:03:30.260> be<00:03:30.410> able

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
out in this direction you should be able

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.250 
out in this direction you should be able
to<00:03:30.650> see<00:03:31.150> but<00:03:32.150> those<00:03:32.360> two<00:03:32.630> planes

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
to see but those two planes

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.220 
to see but those two planes
there's<00:03:33.769> my<00:03:34.150> subject<00:03:35.150> plane<00:03:35.420> here's<00:03:35.720> my<00:03:35.930> lens

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
there's my subject plane here's my lens

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.300 
there's my subject plane here's my lens
plane<00:03:36.620> I'm<00:03:37.519> going<00:03:37.730> to<00:03:37.850> meet<00:03:38.060> here<00:03:38.390> abouts<00:03:39.310> to

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
plane I'm going to meet here abouts to

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.759 
plane I'm going to meet here abouts to
make<00:03:40.489> sure<00:03:40.700> that<00:03:40.880> I<00:03:40.940> get<00:03:41.120> maximum<00:03:41.769> focus

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
make sure that I get maximum focus

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.670 
make sure that I get maximum focus
maximum<00:03:43.459> depth<00:03:43.640> of<00:03:43.790> field<00:03:44.000> I<00:03:44.380> have<00:03:45.380> therefore

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
maximum depth of field I have therefore

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.500 
maximum depth of field I have therefore
needed<00:03:46.280> to<00:03:46.400> turn<00:03:47.299> to<00:03:47.690> swing<00:03:48.049> the<00:03:49.180> image<00:03:50.180> plane

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
needed to turn to swing the image plane

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.080 
needed to turn to swing the image plane
as<00:03:50.690> well<00:03:50.900> so<00:03:51.260> I've<00:03:51.410> used<00:03:51.739> the<00:03:52.519> back<00:03:52.730> swing

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
as well so I've used the back swing

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:59.199 
as well so I've used the back swing
facility<00:03:53.930> on<00:03:54.260> my<00:03:56.470> 10<00:03:57.470> by<00:03:57.650> 8<00:03:57.799> so<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:58.610> plane<00:03:58.910> here

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
facility on my 10 by 8 so the plane here

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.780 
facility on my 10 by 8 so the plane here
again<00:03:59.570> isn't<00:03:59.750> square<00:04:00.410> on<00:04:00.590> its<00:04:00.860> just<00:04:01.370> turn

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
again isn't square on its just turn

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.630 
again isn't square on its just turn
slightly<00:04:02.360> like<00:04:02.720> so<00:04:03.019> so<00:04:03.709> it's<00:04:03.739> gonna<00:04:04.160> come<00:04:04.459> out

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
slightly like so so it's gonna come out

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.870 
slightly like so so it's gonna come out
and<00:04:04.970> these<00:04:05.599> three<00:04:06.020> planes<00:04:06.770> are<00:04:07.489> all<00:04:07.700> going<00:04:07.819> to

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
and these three planes are all going to

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:08.880 
and these three planes are all going to
meet<00:04:08.060> around<00:04:08.390> this

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
meet around this

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.940 
meet around this
here<00:04:09.450> and<00:04:10.450> because<00:04:10.870> they<00:04:11.140> meet<00:04:11.410> at<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:11.680> font

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
here and because they meet at the font

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.040 
here and because they meet at the font
in<00:04:12.700> matter<00:04:13.000> where<00:04:13.209> the<00:04:13.330> point<00:04:13.540> is<00:04:13.750> because

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
in matter where the point is because

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.420 
in matter where the point is because
they<00:04:14.440> meet<00:04:14.620> at<00:04:14.740> the<00:04:14.800> point<00:04:15.390> I've<00:04:16.390> maximized<00:04:17.049> my

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
they meet at the point I've maximized my

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.460 
they meet at the point I've maximized my
depth<00:04:18.430> of<00:04:18.609> field<00:04:18.850> now<00:04:19.630> another<00:04:19.870> way<00:04:20.109> to<00:04:20.140> have

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
depth of field now another way to have

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.650 
depth of field now another way to have
done<00:04:20.680> this<00:04:20.940> would<00:04:21.940> be<00:04:22.120> to<00:04:22.300> set<00:04:22.540> everything

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
done this would be to set everything

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.210 
done this would be to set everything
square<00:04:23.460> and<00:04:24.460> get<00:04:24.760> the<00:04:25.350> the<00:04:26.350> back<00:04:26.560> and<00:04:26.860> the<00:04:26.950> film

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
square and get the the back and the film

I've<00:04:55.810> now<00:04:56.020> set<00:04:56.260> that<00:04:56.440> camera<00:04:56.800> up<00:04:56.919> to<00:04:56.950> take<00:04:57.280> a

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
I've now set that camera up to take a

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.110 
I've now set that camera up to take a

nice sharp picture of all three of these
desiccated<00:05:01.120> blooms<00:05:01.470> but<00:05:02.470> there<00:05:02.560> is<00:05:02.650> another

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
desiccated blooms but there is another

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.800 
desiccated blooms but there is another
way<00:05:03.070> to<00:05:03.130> think<00:05:03.370> about<00:05:03.520> this<00:05:04.890> one<00:05:05.890> of<00:05:06.010> the<00:05:06.810> one

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
way to think about this one of the one

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.500 
way to think about this one of the one
of<00:05:07.930> the<00:05:07.990> big<00:05:08.200> powers<00:05:08.650> of<00:05:08.970> using<00:05:09.970> cameras<00:05:10.330> like

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
of the big powers of using cameras like

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.690 
of the big powers of using cameras like
this<00:05:10.690> of<00:05:10.870> having<00:05:11.230> this<00:05:11.530> level<00:05:11.830> of<00:05:12.070> flexibility

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
this of having this level of flexibility

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.730 
this of having this level of flexibility
is<00:05:13.030> that<00:05:13.960> you<00:05:14.169> can<00:05:14.790> determine<00:05:15.790> your<00:05:16.590> plane<00:05:17.590> of

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
is that you can determine your plane of

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.320 
is that you can determine your plane of
focus<00:05:17.950> so<00:05:18.729> I<00:05:19.030> could<00:05:19.450> I<00:05:19.479> could<00:05:19.900> for<00:05:20.110> example

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
focus so I could I could for example

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.900 
focus so I could I could for example
rearrange<00:05:22.330> all<00:05:22.570> of<00:05:22.690> this<00:05:22.900> so<00:05:23.470> that<00:05:23.710> this<00:05:24.610> was

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
rearrange all of this so that this was

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.550 
rearrange all of this so that this was
out<00:05:25.060> the<00:05:25.210> focus<00:05:25.660> that<00:05:25.780> this<00:05:25.900> was<00:05:26.110> well<00:05:26.380> and

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
out the focus that this was well and

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.590 
out the focus that this was well and
truly<00:05:26.680> out<00:05:26.830> of<00:05:26.950> focus<00:05:27.370> and<00:05:27.520> my<00:05:27.790> sharp<00:05:28.090> focus

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.600 
truly out of focus and my sharp focus

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.850 
truly out of focus and my sharp focus
was<00:05:28.780> in<00:05:29.050> here<00:05:29.530> at<00:05:30.220> the<00:05:30.340> point<00:05:30.610> of<00:05:30.760> these<00:05:30.910> petals

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
was in here at the point of these petals

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.960 
was in here at the point of these petals
and<00:05:32.860> everything<00:05:33.250> else<00:05:33.400> will<00:05:33.580> be<00:05:33.669> able<00:05:33.790> to

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
and everything else will be able to

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.719 
and everything else will be able to
focus<00:05:34.390> so<00:05:35.260> I<00:05:35.290> couldn't<00:05:35.740> back<00:05:35.979> could<00:05:36.130> make<00:05:36.490> my

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:36.729 
focus so I couldn't back could make my

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.080 
focus so I couldn't back could make my
plane<00:05:37.000> of<00:05:37.180> focus<00:05:37.419> coincide<00:05:38.320> with<00:05:38.560> this<00:05:39.430> for

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
plane of focus coincide with this for

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.540 
plane of focus coincide with this for
example<00:05:40.450> I<00:05:40.540> could<00:05:40.600> choose<00:05:41.080> a<00:05:41.380> plane<00:05:42.160> of<00:05:42.340> focus

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
example I could choose a plane of focus

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.880 
example I could choose a plane of focus
that<00:05:42.880> went<00:05:43.090> through<00:05:43.300> like<00:05:43.510> this<00:05:43.770> then<00:05:44.770> I<00:05:44.800> would

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
that went through like this then I would

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.350 
that went through like this then I would
turn<00:05:45.220> this<00:05:45.430> lens<00:05:45.729> in<00:05:45.910> the<00:05:46.000> other<00:05:46.120> direction

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
turn this lens in the other direction

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.780 
turn this lens in the other direction
sorry<00:05:47.260> this<00:05:47.410> panel<00:05:47.950> in<00:05:48.280> the<00:05:48.370> other<00:05:48.520> direction

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.790 
sorry this panel in the other direction

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.750 
sorry this panel in the other direction
and<00:05:49.060> it's<00:05:49.870> back<00:05:50.140> in<00:05:50.380> the<00:05:50.410> other<00:05:50.530> direction

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.010 
and it's back in the other direction
which<00:05:51.760> will<00:05:51.910> throw<00:05:52.120> everything<00:05:52.270> else<00:05:52.660> out<00:05:52.900> of

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
which will throw everything else out of

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.310 
which will throw everything else out of
focus<00:05:53.320> and<00:05:53.530> that's<00:05:53.650> a<00:05:53.830> really<00:05:54.100> powerful<00:05:55.320> sort

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
focus and that's a really powerful sort

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.310 
focus and that's a really powerful sort
of<00:05:56.970> selective<00:05:58.800> point<00:05:59.800> of<00:05:59.950> focus<00:06:00.240> technique

cameras Turrell easily again if you have

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.679 
cameras Turrell easily again if you have
the<00:06:07.300> shoe<00:06:07.510> that<00:06:08.260> tilt<00:06:08.560> shift<00:06:08.590> lens<00:06:08.860> you<00:06:09.190> can

00:06:09.679 --> 00:06:09.689 
the shoe that tilt shift lens you can

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:12.529 
the shoe that tilt shift lens you can
could<00:06:09.839> do<00:06:09.989> that<00:06:11.059> but<00:06:12.059> that's<00:06:12.149> a<00:06:12.330> much<00:06:12.509> more

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:12.539 
could do that but that's a much more

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:15.439 
could do that but that's a much more
artistic<00:06:13.349> use<00:06:14.099> of<00:06:14.339> this<00:06:14.580> I<00:06:14.819> quite<00:06:15.089> like<00:06:15.299> the

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 
artistic use of this I quite like the

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:18.109 
artistic use of this I quite like the
idea<00:06:15.749> of<00:06:15.809> having<00:06:16.019> these<00:06:16.319> three<00:06:16.559> in<00:06:17.429> focus<00:06:17.969> so

00:06:18.109 --> 00:06:18.119 
idea of having these three in focus so

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:19.639 
idea of having these three in focus so
that's<00:06:18.299> one<00:06:18.479> of<00:06:18.599> the<00:06:18.689> images<00:06:19.079> I<00:06:19.229> would<00:06:19.409> shoot

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:19.649 
that's one of the images I would shoot

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:22.639 
that's one of the images I would shoot
and<00:06:20.309> of<00:06:20.429> course<00:06:20.639> whilst<00:06:21.329> we<00:06:21.539> can<00:06:21.689> change<00:06:22.439> the

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:22.649 
and of course whilst we can change the

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:25.489 
and of course whilst we can change the
plane<00:06:22.860> of<00:06:23.009> focus<00:06:23.219> like<00:06:23.639> so<00:06:23.939> if<00:06:24.599> we<00:06:24.899> use<00:06:25.169> the

00:06:25.489 --> 00:06:25.499 
plane of focus like so if we use the

00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:29.600 
plane of focus like so if we use the
tilt<00:06:26.869> property<00:06:27.869> of<00:06:27.989> these<00:06:28.199> panels<00:06:28.709> we<00:06:29.399> could

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
tilt property of these panels we could

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.739 
tilt property of these panels we could
actually<00:06:30.949> find<00:06:31.949> a<00:06:32.219> point<00:06:32.610> of<00:06:32.909> focus<00:06:33.119> rather

00:06:33.739 --> 00:06:33.749 
actually find a point of focus rather

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:36.619 
actually find a point of focus rather
than<00:06:33.959> the<00:06:34.110> plane<00:06:34.349> of<00:06:34.529> focus<00:06:34.559> I<00:06:35.159> could<00:06:35.629> by

00:06:36.619 --> 00:06:36.629 
than the plane of focus I could by

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:39.350 
than the plane of focus I could by
elting<00:06:37.229> these<00:06:37.619> backs<00:06:38.039> and<00:06:38.639> again<00:06:38.909> using<00:06:39.299> the

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 
elting these backs and again using the

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.079 
elting these backs and again using the
shine<00:06:39.599> fluid<00:06:39.899> principle<00:06:40.409> two<00:06:40.789> together<00:06:41.789> a

00:06:42.079 --> 00:06:42.089 
shine fluid principle two together a

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:44.269 
shine fluid principle two together a
plane<00:06:42.719> so<00:06:43.019> I've<00:06:43.559> got<00:06:43.709> a<00:06:43.739> plane<00:06:44.009> in<00:06:44.159> this

00:06:44.269 --> 00:06:44.279 
plane so I've got a plane in this

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:46.909 
plane so I've got a plane in this
direction<00:06:44.519> a<00:06:44.999> vertical<00:06:45.479> plane<00:06:45.749> I<00:06:45.989> could<00:06:46.619> also

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 
direction a vertical plane I could also

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:49.669 
direction a vertical plane I could also
focus<00:06:47.459> on<00:06:47.729> a<00:06:47.789> tilted<00:06:48.269> plane<00:06:48.479> in<00:06:49.229> this

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:49.679 
focus on a tilted plane in this

00:06:49.679 --> 00:06:52.600 
focus on a tilted plane in this
direction<00:06:50.239> using<00:06:51.239> the<00:06:51.509> tilts<00:06:52.050> of<00:06:52.229> these

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:52.610 
direction using the tilts of these

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.589 
direction using the tilts of these
paddles<00:06:53.610> and<00:06:54.499> I<00:06:55.499> choose<00:06:56.189> a<00:06:56.249> very<00:06:56.579> small<00:06:57.029> point

00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:57.599 
paddles and I choose a very small point

00:06:57.599 --> 00:07:00.199 
paddles and I choose a very small point
of<00:06:57.749> focus<00:06:58.050> in<00:06:58.499> there<00:06:58.739> where<00:06:59.369> the<00:06:59.579> rest<00:06:59.849> of<00:07:00.029> that

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:00.209 
of focus in there where the rest of that

00:07:00.209 --> 00:07:02.029 
of focus in there where the rest of that
balloon<00:07:00.509> was<00:07:00.689> out<00:07:00.839> the<00:07:00.989> focus<00:07:01.439> all<00:07:01.649> of<00:07:01.679> these

00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:02.039 
balloon was out the focus all of these

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:04.819 
balloon was out the focus all of these
booms<00:07:02.399> are<00:07:02.639> out<00:07:02.789> of<00:07:02.819> focus<00:07:03.439> you<00:07:04.439> can<00:07:04.589> really

00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:04.829 
booms are out of focus you can really

00:07:04.829 --> 00:07:08.059 
booms are out of focus you can really
hone<00:07:05.159> in<00:07:05.339> on<00:07:05.839> on<00:07:06.839> the<00:07:06.989> actual<00:07:07.319> point<00:07:07.619> of<00:07:07.829> focus

00:07:08.059 --> 00:07:08.069 
hone in on on the actual point of focus

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:10.100 
hone in on on the actual point of focus
that<00:07:08.309> you're<00:07:08.639> interested<00:07:08.969> in<00:07:09.269> and<00:07:09.479> you<00:07:09.749> end<00:07:09.929> up

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.110 
that you're interested in and you end up

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.949 
that you're interested in and you end up
kind<00:07:10.349> of<00:07:10.529> twisting<00:07:11.099> this<00:07:11.489> thing<00:07:11.809> in<00:07:12.809> all

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:12.959 
kind of twisting this thing in all

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:15.529 
kind of twisting this thing in all
directions<00:07:13.139> and<00:07:13.709> it's<00:07:13.919> it<00:07:14.519> takes<00:07:14.849> quite<00:07:15.329> some

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:15.539 
directions and it's it takes quite some

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:17.719 
directions and it's it takes quite some
time<00:07:15.809> to<00:07:15.839> set<00:07:16.259> up<00:07:16.439> such<00:07:16.709> a<00:07:16.739> complicated<00:07:17.189> shot

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:17.729 
time to set up such a complicated shot

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:20.179 
time to set up such a complicated shot
but<00:07:18.719> it's<00:07:18.839> very<00:07:18.959> satisfying<00:07:19.589> to<00:07:19.709> be<00:07:19.829> able<00:07:20.039> to

00:07:20.179 --> 00:07:20.189 
but it's very satisfying to be able to

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:22.219 
but it's very satisfying to be able to
have<00:07:20.429> that<00:07:20.579> level<00:07:21.029> of<00:07:21.269> control<00:07:21.329> about<00:07:21.899> what

00:07:22.219 --> 00:07:22.229 
have that level of control about what

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:25.669 
have that level of control about what
you're<00:07:22.349> doing<00:07:23.479> okay<00:07:24.479> so<00:07:24.689> I<00:07:24.899> hope<00:07:25.349> that<00:07:25.559> that's

00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:25.679 
you're doing okay so I hope that that's

00:07:25.679 --> 00:07:28.159 
you're doing okay so I hope that that's
been<00:07:25.979> of<00:07:26.399> some<00:07:26.849> interest<00:07:27.329> in<00:07:27.449> some<00:07:27.509> use<00:07:27.929> I'm

00:07:28.159 --> 00:07:28.169 
been of some interest in some use I'm

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:31.519 
been of some interest in some use I'm
going<00:07:28.229> to<00:07:28.439> show<00:07:29.069> the<00:07:29.719> similar<00:07:30.719> process<00:07:30.989> with

00:07:31.519 --> 00:07:31.529 
going to show the similar process with

00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:38.209 
going to show the similar process with

the picture that you want my next set is

00:07:50.099 --> 00:07:53.329 
the picture that you want my next set is
to<00:07:50.309> consider<00:07:50.999> the<00:07:51.089> exposure<00:07:51.629> and<00:07:52.379> how<00:07:52.649> we<00:07:52.709> how

00:07:53.329 --> 00:07:53.339 
to consider the exposure and how we how

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:57.829 
to consider the exposure and how we how
we<00:07:53.399> find<00:07:53.879> the<00:07:54.029> exposure<00:07:55.129> for<00:07:56.329> for<00:07:57.329> a<00:07:57.360> shot<00:07:57.629> like

00:07:57.829 --> 00:07:57.839 
we find the exposure for for a shot like

00:07:57.839 --> 00:08:00.259 
we find the exposure for for a shot like
this<00:07:58.219> this<00:07:59.219> camera<00:07:59.579> and<00:07:59.789> on<00:07:59.939> the<00:08:00.029> fringe
