00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
about expending an awful lot of energy

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.630 
about expending an awful lot of energy
here<00:01:26.229> and<00:01:26.350> getting<00:01:26.560> nothing<00:01:26.890> done<00:01:26.920> we've<00:01:27.610> got

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
here and getting nothing done we've got

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.010 
here and getting nothing done we've got
one<00:01:28.060> jump<00:01:28.360> down<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:31.210> two<00:01:31.479> that<00:01:31.690> are<00:01:31.810> down

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
one jump down the two that are down

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.810 
one jump down the two that are down
counting<00:01:32.590> this<00:01:32.740> one<00:01:33.009> now<00:01:33.159> however<00:01:33.640> have<00:01:33.790> been

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
counting this one now however have been

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.700 
counting this one now however have been
the<00:01:34.000> most<00:01:34.180> spectacular<00:01:34.390> tonight<00:01:34.960> so<00:01:35.290> far<00:01:35.500> I

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
the most spectacular tonight so far I

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.680 
the most spectacular tonight so far I
guess<00:01:36.460> he's<00:01:36.640> going<00:01:36.790> to<00:01:36.880> save<00:01:37.090> that<00:01:37.119> corner

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
guess he's going to save that corner

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.060 
guess he's going to save that corner
dock<00:01:37.900> where<00:01:38.080> he<00:01:38.140> takes<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.470> ball<00:01:38.530> between<00:01:38.830> his

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
dock where he takes the ball between his

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.859 
dock where he takes the ball between his
legs<00:01:39.399> for<00:01:39.610> the<00:01:39.729> finals<00:01:40.180> I<00:01:40.270> guess<00:01:40.420> he<00:01:40.570> figures

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
legs for the finals I guess he figures

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.930 
legs for the finals I guess he figures
you<00:01:40.990> didn't<00:01:41.290> final<00:01:41.649> cubing<00:01:42.040> so<00:01:42.250> he<00:01:42.460> just<00:01:42.670> waved

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
you didn't final cubing so he just waved

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.550 
you didn't final cubing so he just waved
it<00:01:43.149> off<00:01:43.270> back<00:01:43.600> I<00:01:43.630> think<00:01:43.810> he<00:01:44.080> was<00:01:44.229> going<00:01:44.440> to

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
it off back I think he was going to

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.889 
it off back I think he was going to
attempt

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899
