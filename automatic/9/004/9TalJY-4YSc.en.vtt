00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
if it's still wet and if it's wet then

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.370 
if it's still wet and if it's wet then
my<00:03:02.680> hair<00:03:02.980> will<00:03:03.250> fall<00:03:03.940> into<00:03:04.150> a<00:03:04.390> curly<00:03:04.900> structure

and I don't want that

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.630 
and I don't want that

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
so the key continue over and the reason

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.880 
so the key continue over and the reason
I'm<00:03:09.850> saying<00:03:10.120> it<00:03:10.360> is<00:03:10.570> because<00:03:11.110> it's<00:03:11.470> very<00:03:11.560> easy

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
I'm saying it is because it's very easy

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.550 
I'm saying it is because it's very easy
to<00:03:12.040> forget<00:03:12.610> to<00:03:12.850> dry<00:03:13.390> down<00:03:13.720> to<00:03:13.990> the<00:03:14.110> roots<00:03:14.320> in

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
to forget to dry down to the roots in

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.220 
to forget to dry down to the roots in
the<00:03:14.740> back<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.970> always<00:03:16.120> go<00:03:16.510> for<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.840> front<00:03:17.020> in
