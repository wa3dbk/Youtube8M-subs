00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
hello my name is Josiah ray I'm going to

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.299 
hello my name is Josiah ray I'm going to
show<00:00:09.929> you<00:00:10.019> how<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.170> draw<00:00:10.440> trees<00:00:10.800> in<00:00:11.010> Google

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
show you how to draw trees in Google

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.759 
show you how to draw trees in Google
Sketchup<00:00:11.550> now<00:00:12.269> instead<00:00:12.660> of<00:00:12.719> doing<00:00:12.960> kind<00:00:13.679> of

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
Sketchup now instead of doing kind of

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.169 
Sketchup now instead of doing kind of
like<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:13.920> stick<00:00:14.309> with<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.490> great<00:00:14.759> big<00:00:14.910> green

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
like a stick with a great big green

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.210 
like a stick with a great big green
pyramid<00:00:15.719> on<00:00:15.839> top<00:00:16.080> I'm<00:00:16.619> actually<00:00:16.859> going<00:00:17.160> to

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
pyramid on top I'm actually going to

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.130 
pyramid on top I'm actually going to
bring<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.760> photorealistic<00:00:18.330> tree<00:00:18.900> into

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
bring a photorealistic tree into

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.260 
bring a photorealistic tree into
Sketchup<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.859> have<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.490> react<00:00:20.789> like<00:00:20.939> one<00:00:21.150> of

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
Sketchup and have it react like one of

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.090 
Sketchup and have it react like one of
those<00:00:21.470> constantly<00:00:22.470> facing<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.890> camera

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
those constantly facing the camera

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.070 
those constantly facing the camera
components<00:00:23.910> so<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.539> first<00:00:24.720> thing<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.960> do

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
components so the first thing to do

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.109 
components so the first thing to do
download<00:00:25.650> an<00:00:25.769> image<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.160> tree<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.670> the

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
download an image of a tree and the

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.410 
download an image of a tree and the
Stevens<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.599> I've<00:00:27.779> chosen<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:29.179> you'll<00:00:30.179> see

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
Stevens that I've chosen and you'll see

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.880 
Stevens that I've chosen and you'll see
that<00:00:30.539> it's<00:00:30.660> got<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.810> totally<00:00:31.230> white<00:00:31.380> background

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
that it's got a totally white background

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.410 
that it's got a totally white background
and<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.250> actually<00:00:32.550> very<00:00:32.579> common<00:00:33.120> for

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
and this is actually very common for

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.690 
and this is actually very common for
trees<00:00:33.600> if<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.870> do<00:00:34.380> like<00:00:34.559> an<00:00:34.950> image<00:00:35.219> search<00:00:35.430> for

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
trees if you do like an image search for

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.700 
trees if you do like an image search for
trees<00:00:35.940> online<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.930> want<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.200> pick<00:00:37.380> one<00:00:37.410> that's

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
trees online you want to pick one that's

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.920 
trees online you want to pick one that's
got<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.890> fairly<00:00:38.550> uniform<00:00:39.210> background<00:00:39.450> although

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
got a fairly uniform background although

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.049 
got a fairly uniform background although
you<00:00:39.989> can<00:00:40.260> easily<00:00:40.860> delete<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.610> background<00:00:41.969> if

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
you can easily delete the background if

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.540 
you can easily delete the background if
you<00:00:42.090> need<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:43.260> first<00:00:43.920> things<00:00:44.160> first<00:00:44.219> I'm

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
you need to so first things first I'm

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.940 
you need to so first things first I'm
going<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.789> open<00:00:44.850> up<00:00:45.059> Photoshop<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:46.350> we're

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
going to open up Photoshop and we're

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:54.560 
going to open up Photoshop and we're
going<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.190> bring<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.399> tree<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:52.309> and<00:00:53.570> the

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
going to bring that tree in and the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.060 
going to bring that tree in and the
reason<00:00:54.840> I'm<00:00:54.960> using<00:00:55.140> Photoshop<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.890> I'm

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
reason I'm using Photoshop is I'm

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.650 
reason I'm using Photoshop is I'm
actually<00:00:56.190> going<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.550> create<00:00:56.820> an<00:00:56.940> alpha<00:00:57.329> layer

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
actually going to create an alpha layer

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.430 
actually going to create an alpha layer
on<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.020> or<00:00:58.170> an<00:00:58.260> alpha<00:00:58.350> Channel<00:00:58.829> and<00:01:00.440> that

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
on this or an alpha Channel and that

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.779 
on this or an alpha Channel and that
will<00:01:01.590> allow<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.890> tree<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.219> appear

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
will allow the tree to appear

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.939 
will allow the tree to appear
transparent<00:01:03.030> inside<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.719> Google<00:01:04.049> Google

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
transparent inside of Google Google

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.780 
transparent inside of Google Google
Sketchup<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:06.799> magic<00:01:07.799> wand<00:01:07.979> tool<00:01:08.220> will<00:01:08.490> select

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
Sketchup so magic wand tool will select

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.000 
Sketchup so magic wand tool will select
all<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.119> white<00:01:09.299> background<00:01:09.540> but<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.830> is

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
all of the white background but this is

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.740 
all of the white background but this is
actually<00:01:11.159> going<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.610> say<00:01:11.850> we<00:01:12.330> want<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.630> white

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
actually going to say we want the white

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.940 
actually going to say we want the white
background<00:01:13.200> visible<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.770> tree

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
background visible and the tree

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.120 
background visible and the tree
invisible<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:15.060> we're<00:01:15.240> going<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.450> say<00:01:15.750> select

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
invisible so we're going to say select

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.580 
invisible so we're going to say select
invert<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.570> now<00:01:18.570> we<00:01:18.630> want<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:18.990> come<00:01:19.229> over<00:01:19.350> to

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
invert and now we want to come over to

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.640 
invert and now we want to come over to
the<00:01:19.740> channels<00:01:20.159> tab<00:01:21.030> here<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.540> select<00:01:22.290> new

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
the channels tab here and select new

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.200 
the channels tab here and select new
Channel<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.520> will<00:01:23.700> automatically

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
Channel and this will automatically

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.330 
Channel and this will automatically
create<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.630> Alpha<00:01:24.750> Channel<00:01:25.170> for<00:01:25.380> us<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:26.130> get

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
create the Alpha Channel for us to get

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.520 
create the Alpha Channel for us to get
this<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.790> look<00:01:26.820> correctly<00:01:27.600> we're<00:01:28.170> going<00:01:28.380> to

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
this to look correctly we're going to

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.149 
this to look correctly we're going to
say<00:01:28.799> edit<00:01:29.509> fill<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.750> underneath<00:01:31.560> contents

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
say edit fill and underneath contents

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.609 
say edit fill and underneath contents
instead<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:33.049> foreground<00:01:34.049> color<00:01:34.290> or<00:01:34.470> anything

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
instead of foreground color or anything

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.859 
instead of foreground color or anything
like<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:34.890> we're<00:01:35.220> going<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.460> say<00:01:35.670> white<00:01:36.030> say

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
like that we're going to say white say

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.289 
like that we're going to say white say
okay<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:38.100> now<00:01:38.250> our<00:01:38.400> tree<00:01:38.670> will<00:01:38.850> be<00:01:38.970> totally

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
okay and so now our tree will be totally

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.580 
okay and so now our tree will be totally
visible<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.960> background<00:01:40.350> will<00:01:40.439> be

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
visible and the background will be

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.370 
visible and the background will be
completely<00:01:41.009> gone<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.670> last<00:01:42.659> last<00:01:43.049> thing<00:01:43.259> to

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
completely gone and last last thing to

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.530 
completely gone and last last thing to
do<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.790> to<00:01:44.790> save<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.570> image<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.229> file<00:01:46.560> save<00:01:47.189> as

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
do is to save the image so file save as

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.850 
do is to save the image so file save as
I'm<00:01:48.540> going<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:48.990> save<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.350> right<00:01:49.560> into<00:01:49.770> my

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
I'm going to save this right into my

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.600 
I'm going to save this right into my
pictures<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:52.110> we<00:01:52.229> want<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.530> save<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.890> as<00:01:53.040> a

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
pictures and we want to save it as a

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.630 
pictures and we want to save it as a
tiff<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.649> the<00:01:55.649> reason<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.310> tip<00:01:56.490> will

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
tiff and the reason is that the tip will

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.670 
tiff and the reason is that the tip will
give<00:01:56.790> us<00:01:56.909> access<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.509> Alpha<00:01:58.320> channel<00:01:58.560> that

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
give us access to the Alpha channel that

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.230 
give us access to the Alpha channel that
we<00:01:58.740> just<00:01:58.890> created<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.369> we'll<00:01:59.549> say<00:01:59.700> save

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
we just created so we'll say save

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.910 
we just created so we'll say save
I'm<00:02:00.719> not<00:02:00.899> going<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.079> choose<00:02:01.229> any<00:02:01.409> compression

I'm not going to choose any compression

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.249 
I'm not going to choose any compression

Sketchup<00:02:07.770> will<00:02:08.550> say<00:02:08.849> file

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
Sketchup will say file

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.890 
Sketchup will say file
in<00:02:10.840> port<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.940> we're<00:02:13.240> going<00:02:13.390> to<00:02:13.420> go<00:02:13.570> into<00:02:13.750> our

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
in port and we're going to go into our

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.710 
in port and we're going to go into our
pictures<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.350> find<00:02:14.530> that<00:02:14.620> tree<00:02:17.490> and<00:02:18.570> we<00:02:19.570> can

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
pictures to find that tree and we can

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.830 
pictures to find that tree and we can
select<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.340> TIF<00:02:21.340> from<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.880> file<00:02:22.240> types<00:02:22.540> and

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
select the TIF from the file types and

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.390 
select the TIF from the file types and
there's<00:02:23.200> our<00:02:23.290> tree<00:02:23.500> right<00:02:23.680> there<00:02:23.710> so<00:02:24.070> open

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
there's our tree right there so open

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.790 
there's our tree right there so open
that<00:02:24.550> and<00:02:25.180> we've<00:02:25.750> got<00:02:25.930> a<00:02:25.960> tree<00:02:26.200> but<00:02:26.470> it's<00:02:26.620> not

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
that and we've got a tree but it's not

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.340 
that and we've got a tree but it's not
really<00:02:27.520> standing<00:02:28.420> exactly<00:02:28.570> straight<00:02:29.110> so

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
really standing exactly straight so

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.080 
really standing exactly straight so
we'll<00:02:29.470> just<00:02:29.650> kind<00:02:30.250> of<00:02:30.370> plop<00:02:30.640> it<00:02:30.790> onto<00:02:31.000> the

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
we'll just kind of plop it onto the

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.680 
we'll just kind of plop it onto the
ground<00:02:31.270> for<00:02:31.450> a<00:02:31.480> moment<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:34.030> you<00:02:34.210> can<00:02:34.330> scale<00:02:34.630> it

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
ground for a moment and you can scale it

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.780 
ground for a moment and you can scale it
up<00:02:34.950> that's<00:02:35.950> a<00:02:36.070> good<00:02:36.220> size

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
up that's a good size

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.300 
up that's a good size
select<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:37.690> move<00:02:37.900> tool<00:02:37.960> if<00:02:38.500> you<00:02:38.890> come<00:02:39.010> over<00:02:39.040> to

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
select the move tool if you come over to

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.780 
select the move tool if you come over to
the<00:02:39.400> side<00:02:39.640> it'll<00:02:39.880> give<00:02:40.060> you<00:02:41.580> should<00:02:42.580> give<00:02:42.670> you

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
the side it'll give you should give you

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.210 
the side it'll give you should give you
an<00:02:42.880> option<00:02:43.030> to<00:02:43.210> scale<00:02:43.750> it<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:44.380> rotate<00:02:45.100> it

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
an option to scale it to rotate it

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.810 
an option to scale it to rotate it
excuse<00:02:45.550> me<00:02:45.990> so<00:02:46.990> that's<00:02:47.140> not<00:02:47.920> quite<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.490> option

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
excuse me so that's not quite the option

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.090 
excuse me so that's not quite the option
that<00:02:48.850> we<00:02:48.970> were<00:02:49.120> hoping<00:02:49.270> for<00:02:49.800> we<00:02:50.800> want<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.040> go

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
that we were hoping for we want to go

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.670 
that we were hoping for we want to go
along<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.760> side<00:02:52.030> so<00:02:52.630> that<00:02:52.810> when<00:02:52.990> we<00:02:53.140> have<00:02:53.530> the

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
along the side so that when we have the

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.860 
along the side so that when we have the
rotation<00:02:54.670> access<00:02:55.180> pop-up<00:02:55.540> it's<00:02:55.690> kind<00:02:55.840> of

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
rotation access pop-up it's kind of

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.300 
rotation access pop-up it's kind of
along<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.290> side<00:02:56.530> of<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.770> tree<00:02:56.920> instead<00:02:57.190> of

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
along the side of the tree instead of

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.520 
along the side of the tree instead of
along<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:58.000> bottom<00:02:58.330> of<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.510> tree<00:02:58.690> it's<00:02:59.410> all

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
along the bottom of the tree it's all

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.520 
along the bottom of the tree it's all
right<00:02:59.650> there's<00:02:59.830> pretty<00:03:00.070> good<00:03:00.190> and<00:03:00.970> we'll<00:03:01.530> get

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
right there's pretty good and we'll get

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.440 
right there's pretty good and we'll get
this<00:03:02.710> vertical<00:03:03.220> and<00:03:03.490> now<00:03:03.940> you'll<00:03:04.120> see<00:03:04.180> that

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
this vertical and now you'll see that

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.790 
this vertical and now you'll see that
the<00:03:04.540> tree<00:03:04.690> is<00:03:04.720> kind<00:03:04.870> of<00:03:04.960> going<00:03:05.110> underground<00:03:05.590> so

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
the tree is kind of going underground so

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.770 
the tree is kind of going underground so
again<00:03:06.010> select<00:03:06.610> the<00:03:06.880> far<00:03:07.090> corner<00:03:07.420> of<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.600> tree

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
again select the far corner of the tree

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.900 
again select the far corner of the tree
and<00:03:07.960> just<00:03:08.050> bring<00:03:08.620> it<00:03:08.680> up<00:03:08.770> to<00:03:08.830> the<00:03:09.100> to<00:03:09.820> the

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
and just bring it up to the to the

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.820 
and just bring it up to the to the
access<00:03:10.300> point<00:03:10.360> so<00:03:10.870> it's<00:03:11.020> now<00:03:11.440> totally

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
access point so it's now totally

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.180 
access point so it's now totally
vertical<00:03:12.630> and<00:03:13.630> the<00:03:14.380> very<00:03:14.560> last<00:03:14.680> thing<00:03:14.860> to<00:03:15.070> do

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
vertical and the very last thing to do

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.430 
vertical and the very last thing to do
is<00:03:15.340> to<00:03:15.459> get<00:03:15.550> this<00:03:15.760> to<00:03:16.030> always<00:03:16.330> face<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:17.020> camera

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
is to get this to always face the camera

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.810 
is to get this to always face the camera
so<00:03:19.860> right-click<00:03:20.860> on<00:03:20.980> the<00:03:21.070> tree<00:03:21.310> and<00:03:21.489> say

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
so right-click on the tree and say

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.350 
so right-click on the tree and say
explode<00:03:22.300> and<00:03:22.800> then<00:03:23.800> come<00:03:24.010> up<00:03:24.040> went<00:03:24.550> the<00:03:24.700> with

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
explode and then come up went the with

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.760 
explode and then come up went the with
the<00:03:25.480> tree<00:03:25.660> selected<00:03:26.170> so<00:03:26.350> you<00:03:26.380> see<00:03:26.560> all<00:03:26.650> those

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
the tree selected so you see all those

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.090 
the tree selected so you see all those
little<00:03:26.860> dots<00:03:27.250> in<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:27.520> background<00:03:27.780> say<00:03:28.780> edit

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
little dots in the background say edit

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.360 
little dots in the background say edit
make<00:03:30.100> component<00:03:30.610> and<00:03:31.890> we<00:03:32.890> want<00:03:33.100> to<00:03:33.190> select

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
make component and we want to select

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.550 
make component and we want to select
always<00:03:33.730> face<00:03:33.910> camera<00:03:34.270> and<00:03:34.450> set<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.140> component

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
always face camera and set the component

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.699 
always face camera and set the component
access<00:03:35.980> and<00:03:36.220> this<00:03:36.910> will<00:03:37.180> this<00:03:37.959> will<00:03:38.230> we<00:03:38.530> want

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
access and this will this will we want

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.080 
access and this will this will we want
to<00:03:38.830> be<00:03:38.980> in<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:39.190> middle<00:03:39.489> instead<00:03:39.670> of<00:03:39.910> on<00:03:40.000> the

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
to be in the middle instead of on the

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.990 
to be in the middle instead of on the
corner<00:03:40.420> because<00:03:41.350> when<00:03:42.250> we<00:03:42.370> rotate<00:03:42.670> around<00:03:42.790> the

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
corner because when we rotate around the

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.580 
corner because when we rotate around the
tree<00:03:43.239> we<00:03:43.450> want<00:03:43.690> it<00:03:43.780> to<00:03:43.930> rotate<00:03:44.140> from<00:03:44.470> the

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
tree we want it to rotate from the

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.680 
tree we want it to rotate from the
middle<00:03:44.980> so<00:03:45.430> as<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:45.970> camera<00:03:46.209> goes<00:03:46.239> around<00:03:46.570> the

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
middle so as the camera goes around the

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.330 
middle so as the camera goes around the
tree<00:03:46.810> basically<00:03:47.350> what<00:03:47.739> this<00:03:47.830> means<00:03:47.890> is<00:03:48.160> it's

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
tree basically what this means is it's

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.010 
tree basically what this means is it's
going<00:03:48.400> to<00:03:48.580> rotate<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:49.120> picture<00:03:49.300> to<00:03:49.840> always

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
going to rotate the picture to always

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.840 
going to rotate the picture to always
face<00:03:50.200> the<00:03:50.230> camera<00:03:50.709> if<00:03:50.860> you<00:03:51.310> set<00:03:51.550> it<00:03:51.580> on<00:03:51.730> the

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
face the camera if you set it on the

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.699 
face the camera if you set it on the
corner<00:03:52.180> where<00:03:52.330> it<00:03:52.360> defaults<00:03:52.870> to<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:53.470> tree<00:03:53.650> is

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
corner where it defaults to the tree is

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.350 
corner where it defaults to the tree is
going<00:03:53.860> to<00:03:53.920> kind<00:03:54.130> of<00:03:54.160> act<00:03:54.310> like<00:03:54.400> a<00:03:54.489> door<00:03:54.880> as<00:03:55.120> you

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
going to kind of act like a door as you

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.670 
going to kind of act like a door as you
move<00:03:55.510> around<00:03:55.630> it<00:03:55.870> in<00:03:55.989> several<00:03:56.200> rotating<00:03:56.560> from

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
move around it in several rotating from

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.020 
move around it in several rotating from
the<00:03:56.770> middle<00:03:57.070> so<00:03:57.459> we're<00:03:57.550> just<00:03:57.580> going<00:03:57.850> to<00:03:57.910> go

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
the middle so we're just going to go

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.500 
the middle so we're just going to go
right<00:03:58.209> to<00:03:58.300> the<00:03:58.390> midpoint<00:03:58.570> and<00:03:58.810> double-click

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
right to the midpoint and double-click

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.750 
right to the midpoint and double-click
and<00:04:01.510> we'll<00:04:01.660> say<00:04:01.840> create<00:04:02.260> and<00:04:02.530> now<00:04:03.340> as<00:04:03.610> you

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
and we'll say create and now as you

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.910 
and we'll say create and now as you
rotate<00:04:04.090> around<00:04:04.239> the<00:04:05.020> tree<00:04:05.260> is<00:04:05.350> always<00:04:05.530> facing

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
rotate around the tree is always facing

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.830 
rotate around the tree is always facing
a<00:04:05.980> camera<00:04:06.340> and<00:04:06.550> this<00:04:06.910> works<00:04:07.209> great<00:04:07.660> with

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
a camera and this works great with

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.870 
a camera and this works great with
shrubbery<00:04:08.440> and<00:04:08.650> brush<00:04:08.950> and<00:04:08.980> stuff<00:04:09.400> like<00:04:09.610> that

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
shrubbery and brush and stuff like that

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.250 
shrubbery and brush and stuff like that
so<00:04:10.360> you<00:04:10.450> can<00:04:10.480> place<00:04:10.690> it<00:04:10.810> around<00:04:10.900> your<00:04:11.050> house

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
so you can place it around your house

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.050 
so you can place it around your house
and<00:04:11.290> actually<00:04:11.680> have<00:04:11.800> it<00:04:11.830> look<00:04:12.190> photorealistic

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
and actually have it look photorealistic

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.300 
and actually have it look photorealistic
next<00:04:13.810> to<00:04:13.870> your<00:04:13.959> house<00:04:14.140> and<00:04:14.470> it<00:04:14.860> works<00:04:15.070> really

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
next to your house and it works really

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.370 
next to your house and it works really
