00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.490 

all<00:02:37.690> right<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:37.960> if<00:02:38.020> you<00:02:38.080> try<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.260> figure<00:02:38.350> out

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
all right and if you try to figure out

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.290 
all right and if you try to figure out
what<00:02:38.770> it<00:02:38.890> should<00:02:39.010> be<00:02:39.040> you<00:02:39.910> can<00:02:40.030> match<00:02:40.150> my

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
what it should be you can match my

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:49.020 
what it should be you can match my
numbers<00:02:40.540> so<00:02:41.280> 64<00:02:42.280> 48<00:02:43.380> 129<00:02:44.380> 119<00:02:46.740> 193<00:02:47.790> 173<00:02:48.790> and

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
numbers so 64 48 129 119 193 173 and

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.720 
numbers so 64 48 129 119 193 173 and
they<00:02:49.450> don't<00:02:49.570> have<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:49.750> be<00:02:49.810> exact<00:02:50.140> but<00:02:50.350> whatever

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
they don't have to be exact but whatever

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.230

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
okay well create a new layer and go to

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:11.340

color select and in your color select
instead<00:03:14.950> of<00:03:15.070> doing<00:03:15.220> point<00:03:15.459> sample<00:03:15.670> do<00:03:15.910> 3x3

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
instead of doing point sample do 3x3

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.110 
instead of doing point sample do 3x3
average<00:03:17.110> this<00:03:17.320> makes<00:03:17.530> it<00:03:17.650> easier<00:03:17.950> to<00:03:18.370> pick<00:03:18.910> one

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
average this makes it easier to pick one

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.890 
average this makes it easier to pick one
color<00:03:19.360> at<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:19.570> time

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
color at a time

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.900 
color at a time
so<00:03:20.350> now<00:03:20.470> let's<00:03:21.040> pick<00:03:21.160> one<00:03:21.310> of<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:21.459> teal<00:03:21.640> colors

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910

right now that's done it's drop the

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.170 
right now that's done it's drop the
opacity<00:04:23.479> to<00:04:24.479> where<00:04:24.600> it<00:04:24.690> almost<00:04:25.050> looks<00:04:25.350> like

opacity to where it almost looks like

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.830 
opacity to where it almost looks like
it's<00:04:27.180> natural<00:04:27.949> so<00:04:28.949> I<00:04:28.979> think<00:04:29.070> of<00:04:29.490> 45<00:04:30.210> looks<00:04:30.419> good

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
it's natural so I think of 45 looks good
