00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
if you make this be sure to turn down

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.830 
if you make this be sure to turn down
the<00:00:49.110> volume<00:00:49.140> because<00:00:50.750> it<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.960> very<00:00:52.110> loud<00:00:53.840> so

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
the volume because it is very loud so

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.200 
the volume because it is very loud so
basically<00:00:55.410> what<00:00:55.829> i<00:00:55.860> have<00:00:56.129> here<00:00:56.489> i'm<00:00:56.879> going<00:00:57.120> to

basically what i have here i'm going to

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.840 
basically what i have here i'm going to
turn<00:00:57.450> the<00:00:58.520> setting<00:00:59.520> on<00:00:59.730> too<00:01:00.570> far<00:01:01.550> so<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.610> guys

spawned<00:01:10.049> towels<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.619> here<00:01:10.649> and<00:01:11.779> they<00:01:12.779> go<00:01:12.990> into

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
spawned towels in here and they go into

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.699 
spawned towels in here and they go into
a<00:01:13.439> chamber<00:01:13.799> which<00:01:14.219> is<00:01:14.399> right<00:01:14.670> about<00:01:14.999> there<00:01:15.709> and

they're held there you can see the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.499 
they're held there you can see the
chamber<00:01:19.649> right<00:01:19.859> here<00:01:21.319> they're<00:01:22.319> held<00:01:23.450> until<00:01:24.450> I

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
chamber right here they're held until I

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.739 
chamber right here they're held until I
flick<00:01:25.079> the<00:01:25.349> switch<00:01:25.590> up<00:01:25.799> there<00:01:26.039> when<00:01:26.909> i<00:01:26.939> do<00:01:27.060> this

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:27.749 
flick the switch up there when i do this

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:31.730 
flick the switch up there when i do this
piston<00:01:28.349> will<00:01:29.299> contract<00:01:30.439> letting<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.469> cows

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
piston will contract letting the cows

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:40.749 
piston will contract letting the cows
free<00:01:32.279> when<00:01:33.029> that<00:01:33.240> happens<00:01:35.359> cows<00:01:36.359> will<00:01:39.020> be<00:01:40.020> shot

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
free when that happens cows will be shot

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.659 
free when that happens cows will be shot
string<00:01:41.759> bar<00:01:42.119> if<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.270> can<00:01:42.539> see<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:43.669> right

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:44.669 
string bar if you can see that right

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:48.609 
string bar if you can see that right
there<00:01:44.729> will<00:01:45.689> be<00:01:45.869> shot<00:01:46.109> extremely<00:01:46.829> far<00:01:47.099> and<00:01:47.369> i

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
there will be shot extremely far and i

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.620 
there will be shot extremely far and i
have<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.919> reason<00:01:50.489> for<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.789> it's<00:01:50.999> not<00:01:51.209> just<00:01:51.509> a

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
have a reason for this it's not just a

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.560 
have a reason for this it's not just a
random<00:01:51.959> glitch<00:01:52.259> if<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:53.489> can<00:01:53.669> see

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.830 

a<00:01:58.220> part<00:01:59.220> of<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.370> coding<00:01:59.729> in<00:01:59.880> Minecraft<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.600> if

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
a part of the coding in Minecraft is if

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.930 
a part of the coding in Minecraft is if
two<00:02:02.540> entities<00:02:03.540> spawn<00:02:04.460> close<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.700> each<00:02:05.820> other

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
two entities spawn close to each other

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.169 
two entities spawn close to each other
or<00:02:06.210> just<00:02:06.630> are<00:02:06.900> close<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.770> each<00:02:07.800> other<00:02:08.179> they

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
or just are close to each other they

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.050 
or just are close to each other they
will<00:02:09.690> be<00:02:10.080> put<00:02:10.590> one<00:02:10.979> will<00:02:11.130> be<00:02:11.280> pushed<00:02:11.550> away<00:02:11.730> from

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
will be put one will be pushed away from

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.470 
will be put one will be pushed away from
matter<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:13.580> they'll<00:02:14.580> they'll<00:02:15.090> just<00:02:15.270> push

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
matter and they'll they'll just push

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.770 
matter and they'll they'll just push
away<00:02:15.600> from<00:02:15.720> each<00:02:16.050> other<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.830> can<00:02:16.980> see<00:02:17.780> they

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
away from each other you can see they

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.530 
away from each other you can see they
are<00:02:18.810> pushing<00:02:19.290> away<00:02:19.560> from<00:02:19.680> each<00:02:19.980> other<00:02:20.100> in<00:02:21.000> my

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
are pushing away from each other in my

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.370 
are pushing away from each other in my
example<00:02:22.280> so<00:02:23.280> when<00:02:23.459> you<00:02:23.580> have<00:02:24.170> 2000<00:02:25.170> cals

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
example so when you have 2000 cals

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.449 
example so when you have 2000 cals
pushing<00:02:25.950> away<00:02:26.070> from<00:02:26.370> one<00:02:26.580> cow<00:02:27.650> it<00:02:28.650> is<00:02:28.980> pretty

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
pushing away from one cow it is pretty

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.050 
pushing away from one cow it is pretty
obvious<00:02:29.580> that<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.690> one<00:02:30.870> cow<00:02:31.110> will<00:02:31.290> be<00:02:31.410> shot

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
obvious that the one cow will be shot

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.040 
obvious that the one cow will be shot
extremely<00:02:33.060> far<00:02:33.560> and<00:02:35.270> this<00:02:36.270> is<00:02:36.450> my<00:02:36.660> machine

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
extremely far and this is my machine

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.150 
extremely far and this is my machine
calc<00:02:37.320> and<00:02:37.560> I<00:02:37.830> have<00:02:38.130> not<00:02:38.420> fully<00:02:39.420> loaded<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:40.170> it

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
calc and I have not fully loaded it it

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
calc and I have not fully loaded it it
works<00:02:41.790> one<00:02:42.510> hundred<00:02:42.959> percent<00:02:42.989> well<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:47.730> these

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
works one hundred percent well and these

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.720 
works one hundred percent well and these
