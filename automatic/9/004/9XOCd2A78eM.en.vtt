magazine I had to have it so I jumped

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.139 
magazine I had to have it so I jumped
around<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:43.140> lot<00:00:43.320> but<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.250> finally<00:00:44.700> came<00:00:44.969> around

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
around a lot but I finally came around

and I settled on a gun that had a number
of<00:00:48.149> features<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.980> kind<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.160> split<00:00:50.640> the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
of features that kind of split the

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.040 
of features that kind of split the
difference<00:00:50.879> between<00:00:51.480> all<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.020> different

ankle you carried it in pockets and
quite<00:01:12.570> often<00:01:12.810> because<00:01:13.380> you'd<00:01:13.860> be<00:01:14.040> working

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
quite often because you'd be working

opportunity to maintain your guns like

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.310 
opportunity to maintain your guns like
you<00:01:18.840> probably<00:01:19.259> should<00:01:20.090> resisted<00:01:21.090> rust<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
you probably should resisted rust the

you probably should resisted rust the
off-duty<00:01:22.680> gun<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:22.979> originally<00:01:23.670> had<00:01:23.909> was<00:01:24.390> a

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
off-duty gun I originally had was a

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.050 
off-duty gun I originally had was a
slightly<00:01:24.869> smaller<00:01:25.590> version<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.430> five-shot

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
slightly smaller version in five-shot

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.480 
slightly smaller version in five-shot
but<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.049> problem<00:01:28.500> with<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.829> gun<00:01:29.040> was<00:01:29.250> is

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
but the problem with that gun was is

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.819 
but the problem with that gun was is
that<00:01:29.700> was<00:01:29.880> almost<00:01:30.270> kind<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.600> too<00:01:30.960> compact<00:01:31.530> I

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
that was almost kind of too compact I

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.130 
that was almost kind of too compact I
felt<00:01:32.520> like<00:01:32.670> when<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:32.880> had<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.390> my<00:01:33.570> hand<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:34.079> a

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
felt like when I had it in my hand in a

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.319 
felt like when I had it in my hand in a
threatening<00:01:34.470> situation<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:35.460> didn't<00:01:36.210> have

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
threatening situation I didn't have

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.260 
threatening situation I didn't have
enough<00:01:36.600> gun<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:37.890> competitors<00:01:38.549> six-shot

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
enough gun the competitors six-shot

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.230 
enough gun the competitors six-shot
revolver<00:01:39.869> was<00:01:40.380> just<00:01:40.680> slightly<00:01:41.159> too<00:01:41.610> big<00:01:41.640> but

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
revolver was just slightly too big but

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.569 
revolver was just slightly too big but
it<00:01:42.329> had<00:01:42.540> some<00:01:42.780> features<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.320> liked<00:01:43.619> like<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.520> a

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
it had some features I liked like a a

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.289 
it had some features I liked like a a
projected<00:01:45.479> or<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.689> protected<00:01:46.409> ejector<00:01:47.130> rod<00:01:47.299> so

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
projected or a protected ejector rod so

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.510 
projected or a protected ejector rod so
when<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.020> finally<00:01:49.350> got<00:01:49.590> around<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:50.009> looking<00:01:50.399> at

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
when I finally got around to looking at

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.130 
when I finally got around to looking at
the<00:01:50.640> Ruger<00:01:50.939> SP<00:01:51.329> 101

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
the Ruger SP 101

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.230 
the Ruger SP 101
I<00:01:52.170> found<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.159> difference<00:01:53.399> between<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.090> two

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
I found the difference between the two

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.069 
I found the difference between the two
revolvers<00:01:54.829> it<00:01:55.829> has<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.399> rubber<00:01:56.820> grip<00:01:57.299> that's

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
revolvers it has a rubber grip that's

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.770 
revolvers it has a rubber grip that's
that's<00:01:58.469> that's<00:01:58.950> not<00:01:59.219> exactly<00:01:59.579> rounded<00:02:00.509> but

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
that's that's not exactly rounded but

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.260 
that's that's not exactly rounded but
it's<00:02:00.899> not<00:02:01.079> exactly<00:02:01.259> square<00:02:01.979> either<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
it's not exactly square either the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.260 
it's not exactly square either the
panels<00:02:03.869> on<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.200> side<00:02:04.469> are<00:02:04.680> plastic<00:02:05.430> so<00:02:05.640> when

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
panels on the side are plastic so when

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.119
