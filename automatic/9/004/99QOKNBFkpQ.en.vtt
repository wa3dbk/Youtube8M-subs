00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
on music so DJ's are super super

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
expensive or they can be and so one

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.160 
expensive or they can be and so one
thing<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:08.850> recommend<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.450> renting<00:01:09.960> some

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
thing I recommend is renting some

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.380 
thing I recommend is renting some
speakers<00:01:10.560> or<00:01:10.770> borrowing<00:01:11.400> some<00:01:11.700> speakers<00:01:12.060> from

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
speakers or borrowing some speakers from

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.690 
speakers or borrowing some speakers from
a<00:01:12.479> friend<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.900> hooking<00:01:13.710> them<00:01:13.890> up<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.369> a

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
a friend and hooking them up to a

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.870 
a friend and hooking them up to a
playlist<00:01:15.240> on<00:01:15.750> your<00:01:16.110> iPod<00:01:16.500> or<00:01:16.830> iPhone<00:01:17.009> or<00:01:17.520> iPad
