00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
you can kind of see if I was just so I

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.640 
you can kind of see if I was just so I
kind<00:00:49.650> of<00:00:49.739> how<00:00:49.890> maybe<00:00:50.790> the<00:00:50.970> containers<00:00:51.540> are<00:00:51.780> so

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
kind of how maybe the containers are so

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.140 
kind of how maybe the containers are so
I<00:00:53.010> think<00:00:53.220> that's<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.519> pretty<00:00:53.670> good<00:00:53.940> deal

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
I think that's a pretty good deal

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.719 
I think that's a pretty good deal
because<00:00:54.409> you<00:00:55.409> know<00:00:55.530> it's<00:00:55.710> less<00:00:56.280> than<00:00:56.519> two

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:56.729 
because you know it's less than two

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:58.759 
because you know it's less than two
dollars<00:00:57.119> a<00:00:57.150> container<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.080> there's<00:00:58.589> all

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
dollars a container and there's all

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.070 
dollars a container and there's all
different<00:00:58.799> colors<00:00:59.460> as<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.699> can<00:01:00.000> see<00:01:00.239> that

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
different colors as you can see that

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.719 
different colors as you can see that
kind<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.379> gives<00:01:01.650> you<00:01:01.769> a<00:01:01.860> better<00:01:02.040> idea<00:01:02.159> what<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:02.729 
kind of gives you a better idea what the

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:04.700 
kind of gives you a better idea what the
different<00:01:03.030> colors<00:01:03.330> are<00:01:03.540> so<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.530> thought<00:01:04.650> that

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
different colors are so I thought that

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.530 
different colors are so I thought that
was<00:01:05.070> really<00:01:05.250> cool<00:01:06.920> this<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.100> like<00:01:08.280> a

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
it was but it was 550 and I thought that

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.530 
it was but it was 550 and I thought that
was<00:01:16.470> really<00:01:16.680> cool<00:01:17.030> there's<00:01:18.030> 1<00:01:18.300> 2<00:01:18.570> 3<00:01:19.040> 4<00:01:20.040> 5<00:01:20.400> 6<00:01:20.430> 1<00:01:21.210> 2

3<00:01:21.750> 4<00:01:22.350> 5<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.550> there's<00:01:23.760> 30<00:01:24.150> different

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450

rope big stack of them for four dollars

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.080 
rope big stack of them for four dollars
so<00:04:19.989> i<00:04:20.230> thought<00:04:20.500> that<00:04:20.560> was<00:04:20.799> a<00:04:21.130> pretty<00:04:21.519> good<00:04:21.940> bye

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
so i thought that was a pretty good bye

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.550 
so i thought that was a pretty good bye
even<00:04:22.480> though<00:04:22.600> there's<00:04:22.780> no<00:04:23.020> way<00:04:23.200> i'd<00:04:23.320> be<00:04:23.500> able

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
even though there's no way i'd be able

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.600 
even though there's no way i'd be able
to<00:04:23.680> use<00:04:23.860> all<00:04:24.040> of<00:04:24.220> these<00:04:24.370> but<00:04:26.190> four<00:04:27.190> dollars<00:04:27.490> you

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
to use all of these but four dollars you

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.230 
to use all of these but four dollars you
kind<00:04:27.820> of<00:04:27.880> can't<00:04:28.090> beat<00:04:28.270> this

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
kind of can't beat this

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:35.800 
kind of can't beat this
I<00:04:29.330> have<00:04:30.110> no<00:04:30.349> idea<00:04:30.470> how<00:04:30.650> many<00:04:30.919> there<00:04:31.069> are<00:04:34.810> then

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
I have no idea how many there are then

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.200 
I have no idea how many there are then
leave<00:04:36.319> your<00:04:36.470> practice<00:04:36.949> fingers<00:04:37.340> and<00:04:37.669> a<00:04:38.000> over

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
leave your practice fingers and a over

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.969 
leave your practice fingers and a over
three<00:04:38.479> four<00:04:38.690> dollars<00:04:39.080> so<00:04:39.380> i<00:04:39.620> think<00:04:39.830> that's

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
three four dollars so i think that's

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.999 
three four dollars so i think that's
pretty<00:04:40.340> much<00:04:40.520> a<00:04:40.580> general<00:04:41.150> price<00:04:42.430> everywhere

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:45.009 
pretty much a general price everywhere

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:47.740 
pretty much a general price everywhere
so<00:04:46.009> you<00:04:46.069> know<00:04:46.430> you<00:04:46.490> can<00:04:46.550> make<00:04:46.910> them<00:04:47.120> stick<00:04:47.509> to

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
so you know you can make them stick to

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.040 
so you know you can make them stick to
