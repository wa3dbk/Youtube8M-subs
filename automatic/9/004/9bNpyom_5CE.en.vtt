it it was kind of it was a toss-up for a

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.960 
it it was kind of it was a toss-up for a
lot<00:01:03.500> of<00:01:03.530> people<00:01:03.620> you<00:01:04.369> know<00:01:04.460> one<00:01:04.610> of<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:04.759> cool

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
lot of people you know one of the cool

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.480 
lot of people you know one of the cool
things<00:01:05.000> was<00:01:05.540> that<00:01:05.570> it<00:01:06.380> did<00:01:06.680> kind<00:01:06.950> of<00:01:07.009> have<00:01:07.250> a

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
things was that it did kind of have a

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.609 
things was that it did kind of have a
progression<00:01:08.000> a<00:01:08.450> you<00:01:08.720> know<00:01:08.840> checkpoint<00:01:09.410> type

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
progression a you know checkpoint type

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:10.990 
progression a you know checkpoint type
thing<00:01:09.860> of<00:01:10.009> getting<00:01:10.340> to<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:10.610> end<00:01:10.789> and

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
thing of getting to the end and

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.150 
thing of getting to the end and
completing<00:01:11.570> the<00:01:11.690> map<00:01:11.960> and<00:01:12.259> while<00:01:12.590> a<00:01:12.860> lot<00:01:12.920> of

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 
completing the map and while a lot of

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.740 
completing the map and while a lot of
people<00:01:13.399> don't<00:01:13.759> like<00:01:13.970> this<00:01:14.180> I<00:01:14.360> think<00:01:14.570> it's<00:01:14.690> a

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
people don't like this I think it's a

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.870 
people don't like this I think it's a
cool<00:01:14.930> idea<00:01:14.990> but<00:01:15.409> I<00:01:15.680> think<00:01:16.040> the<00:01:16.159> problem<00:01:16.400> was

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
cool idea but I think the problem was

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.000 
cool idea but I think the problem was
that<00:01:17.360> once<00:01:17.810> you<00:01:17.960> do<00:01:18.110> it<00:01:18.260> it's<00:01:18.380> over<00:01:18.560> you<00:01:18.890> know

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
that once you do it it's over you know

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.680 
that once you do it it's over you know
there's<00:01:19.190> no<00:01:19.430> reason<00:01:19.790> to<00:01:19.820> replay<00:01:20.240> it<00:01:20.270> an

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
there's no reason to replay it an

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.020 
there's no reason to replay it an
extinction<00:01:21.680> in<00:01:21.799> that<00:01:21.979> case<00:01:22.220> it<00:01:22.490> was<00:01:22.610> just<00:01:22.880> that

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
extinction in that case it was just that

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.480 
extinction in that case it was just that
there<00:01:23.210> was<00:01:23.240> really<00:01:23.510> no<00:01:23.810> reason<00:01:24.170> to<00:01:24.920> want<00:01:25.130> to<00:01:25.250> do

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
there was really no reason to want to do

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.399 
there was really no reason to want to do
it<00:01:25.640> over<00:01:25.820> again<00:01:26.030> and<00:01:26.659> you<00:01:26.869> know<00:01:26.960> I<00:01:26.990> feel<00:01:27.260> like

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
it over again and you know I feel like

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.050 
it over again and you know I feel like
