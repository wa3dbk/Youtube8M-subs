developing<00:03:09.100> as<00:03:09.250> new<00:03:09.430> cities<00:03:09.850> so<00:03:10.840> the

developing as new cities so the

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.770 
developing as new cities so the

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
salvation for Bangalore will lie in

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
be a set of nodes and people will have

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.370 
be a set of nodes and people will have
will<00:03:22.570> live<00:03:22.810> and<00:03:23.080> work<00:03:23.380> in<00:03:24.070> these<00:03:24.340> nodes<00:03:24.730> and

will live and work in these nodes and

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.380 
will live and work in these nodes and
typically<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:26.590> role<00:03:26.770> of<00:03:26.890> government<00:03:27.400> will<00:03:28.239> be

typically the role of government will be

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.940 
typically the role of government will be

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
between these nodes so typically you

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.550

kind of debates that are happening with

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.380 
kind of debates that are happening with
local<00:05:20.680> so<00:05:21.160> we<00:05:21.250> need<00:05:21.370> to<00:05:21.460> balance<00:05:21.550> these<00:05:21.880> up<00:05:22.060> so

local so we need to balance these up so

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:23.940 
local so we need to balance these up so
I<00:05:22.420> think<00:05:22.510> that's<00:05:22.810> the<00:05:23.110> order<00:05:23.500> of<00:05:23.620> the<00:05:23.710> day<00:05:23.890> for

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
I think that's the order of the day for

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:31.440 
I think that's the order of the day for
what<00:05:24.460> Jane<00:05:24.790> and<00:05:24.940> urm<00:05:25.240> 2.0<00:05:25.840> should<00:05:26.080> be<00:05:30.450> there

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
what Jane and urm 2.0 should be there

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.200 
what Jane and urm 2.0 should be there
