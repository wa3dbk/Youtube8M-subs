personal<00:01:56.700> person<00:01:57.060> but<00:01:57.570> for<00:01:57.689> myself<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.409> about

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
personal person but for myself and about

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.090 
personal person but for myself and about
a<00:01:58.680> week<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.460> start<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.420> get<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.960> pilling<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.380> it

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
a week I start to get the pilling and it

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.749 
a week I start to get the pilling and it
can<00:02:02.729> last<00:02:02.939> anywhere<00:02:03.450> for<00:02:04.049> two<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:05.280> four<00:02:05.520> days

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
can last anywhere for two to four days

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.479 
can last anywhere for two to four days
with<00:02:06.420> my<00:02:06.630> skin<00:02:06.930> like<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.500> said<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:08.009> might<00:02:08.190> vary

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
with my skin like I said it might vary

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.380 
with my skin like I said it might vary
person<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.000> person

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
person to person

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.360 
person to person
that's<00:02:09.869> my<00:02:10.020> time<00:02:10.319> frame<00:02:10.649> for<00:02:10.890> pilling<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:11.340> I

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
that's my time frame for pilling so I

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.460 
that's my time frame for pilling so I
know<00:02:11.520> that<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:11.940> have<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.270> good<00:02:12.510> week

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
downtime and I have to start worrying

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.140 
downtime and I have to start worrying
about<00:02:18.360> if<00:02:18.930> I'm<00:02:19.410> going<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.740> peel<00:02:20.010> being<00:02:20.640> outside
