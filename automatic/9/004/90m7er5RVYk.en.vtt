00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.330

 I was looking for the truth of the people there 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.830
 truth of people's lives 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.390
 before making them disguised, he did the 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:36.020
 crane operator at the italsider and then later at one 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.729
 evening came in the way of the field 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.780
 saw how fun it was to do 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.910
 transvestite 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.770
 and then he said okay I'll do it 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.540
 me too the transvestite I stop doing the 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:02:00.470

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.440
 I had brought the lay person as a negative 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.950
 from 400 hazard I focused it in the 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.430
 pole on the door and I waited 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:15.620
 slowly the door opened like this 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.950
 very slow and this figure of appeared

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.700
 as always in search of the truth 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:37.230
 always until he has the strength to 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:41.940
 live and the strength to search 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.160
 the soul is always on the way always not 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:03:08.900
 never stops
