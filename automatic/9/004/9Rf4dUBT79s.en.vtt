00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
that to secure our ribbon I'm going to

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.580 
that to secure our ribbon I'm going to
stick<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.479> right<00:01:54.780> up<00:01:55.670> inside<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.990> ribbon<00:01:58.290> so

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
stick that right up inside the ribbon so

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.750 
stick that right up inside the ribbon so
it's<00:01:58.740> not<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.040> poke<00:01:59.759> anybody

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.190 

we're<00:02:03.150> going<00:02:03.330> to<00:02:03.390> use<00:02:03.540> another<00:02:03.960> one

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
we're going to use another one

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.089 
we're going to use another one
this<00:02:05.770> below<00:02:06.220> it

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
this below it

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.429 
this below it
and<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.489> trick<00:02:08.849> is<00:02:08.879> getting<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.689> up<00:02:09.780> inside

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:10.439 
and the trick is getting it up inside

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:13.630 
and the trick is getting it up inside
the<00:02:10.679> ribbon<00:02:11.069> but<00:02:11.610> if<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:11.849> run<00:02:12.060> into<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.510> stem

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
the ribbon but if you run into the stem

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.240 
the ribbon but if you run into the stem
that's<00:02:14.640> going<00:02:14.969> to<00:02:15.030> be<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.150> problem<00:02:15.719> I'm<00:02:16.250> just

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
that's going to be a problem I'm just

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.160 
that's going to be a problem I'm just
running<00:02:17.879> these<00:02:18.209> up<00:02:18.480> inside<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.530> ribbon

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
running these up inside the ribbon

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.459 
running these up inside the ribbon
evenly-spaced

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:22.469 
evenly-spaced

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:23.990 
evenly-spaced
it's<00:02:22.920> not<00:02:23.040> going<00:02:23.219> to<00:02:23.280> show<00:02:23.489> when<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.760> girls

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000
