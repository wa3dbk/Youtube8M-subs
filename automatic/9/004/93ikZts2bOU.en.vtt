00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
okay but that there's some sort of

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.370 
okay but that there's some sort of
sanitary<00:01:53.700> difference<00:01:54.240> between<00:01:54.659> taking<00:01:55.140> a

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
hundreds of years ago or a hundred years

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.000 
hundreds of years ago or a hundred years
ago<00:02:44.330> I'd<00:02:44.630> say<00:02:44.660> and<00:02:45.140> now<00:02:45.440> we're<00:02:45.620> sort<00:02:45.800> of<00:02:45.920> going

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
ago I'd say and now we're sort of going

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.160 
ago I'd say and now we're sort of going
back<00:02:46.250> so<00:02:46.400> is<00:02:46.490> the<00:02:46.580> West<00:02:46.790> slipping<00:02:47.570> up<00:02:47.690> here<00:02:47.870> I

think not only are they slipping up but
with<00:02:50.330> we're<00:02:50.660> gonna<00:02:50.750> double<00:02:51.260> what<00:02:51.500> go<00:02:52.010> to<00:02:52.070> ten

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
with we're gonna double what go to ten

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.540 
with we're gonna double what go to ten
