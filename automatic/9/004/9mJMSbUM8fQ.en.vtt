00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
this time not as much as he for 12

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.399 
this time not as much as he for 12
anyway<00:01:56.860> now<00:01:57.070> I<00:01:57.100> get<00:01:57.369> a<00:01:57.399> tow<00:01:57.549> gets<00:01:58.060> around<00:01:58.409> 20

grand<00:01:59.619> and<00:01:59.830> that's<00:01:59.950> sort<00:02:00.130> of<00:02:00.220> a<00:02:00.280> goalkeeper

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
grand and that's sort of a goalkeeper

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.660 
grand and that's sort of a goalkeeper
Forester<00:02:01.270> I<00:02:01.299> believe<00:02:01.689> he<00:02:02.680> actually<00:02:02.920> sold<00:02:03.369> for

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670

around<00:02:03.750> 12<00:02:04.750> grand<00:02:05.140> which<00:02:06.009> was<00:02:06.430> really

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
around 12 grand which was really

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:09.330
