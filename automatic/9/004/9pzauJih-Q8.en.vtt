00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
the solar panel was charging but it's

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.480 
the solar panel was charging but it's
like<00:01:45.090> we've<00:01:45.450> also<00:01:45.600> panels<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.770> brighter<00:01:47.040> the

like we've also panels the brighter the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.179 
like we've also panels the brighter the
weather<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:49.170> quicker<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.560> battery's<00:01:49.890> charge

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
weather the quicker the battery's charge

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.170 
weather the quicker the battery's charge
you'll<00:01:51.000> see<00:01:51.210> slower<00:01:52.170> then<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.250> go<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.909> tastes

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
you'll see slower then you go it tastes

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.700 
you'll see slower then you go it tastes
longer<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.600> do<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.710> that's<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.979> solar<00:01:56.219> panel

got on the fish finder you've got a

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.970 
got on the fish finder you've got a
contrast<00:02:50.860> you<00:02:51.370> also<00:02:51.580> have<00:02:51.760> a<00:02:51.790> backlight<00:02:52.980> you

also<00:02:54.340> have<00:02:54.610> a<00:02:54.959> sensitivity<00:02:55.959> so<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.590> water<00:02:56.860> is

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
also have a sensitivity so the water is

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.820 
also have a sensitivity so the water is
colored<00:02:57.490> or<00:02:57.730> clear<00:02:57.790> with<00:02:58.750> just<00:02:58.959> a<00:02:59.050> 76<00:02:59.620> it's

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830

tivity<00:03:00.310> on<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:01.000> fish<00:03:01.150> finder<00:03:01.180> a<00:03:01.840> very<00:03:02.680> very

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
tivity on the fish finder a very very

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.090 
tivity on the fish finder a very very
useful<00:03:03.430> tool<00:03:04.980> so<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.430> fish<00:03:06.580> finders<00:03:07.090> are

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
useful tool so the fish finders are

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.720 
useful tool so the fish finders are
fitted<00:03:09.100> at<00:03:09.910> viper<00:03:10.680> directly<00:03:11.680> or<00:03:12.190> as<00:03:12.459> i<00:03:12.550> said

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
fitted at viper directly or as i said

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.970 
fitted at viper directly or as i said
before<00:03:12.850> you<00:03:13.570> can<00:03:13.600> have<00:03:13.959> them<00:03:14.110> on<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.800> boat

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
before you can have them on the boat

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.060 
before you can have them on the boat
already<00:03:15.310> fitted<00:03:16.560> also<00:03:17.560> with<00:03:17.769> the<00:03:17.920> fish

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
already fitted also with the fish

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.830 
already fitted also with the fish
finders<00:03:18.580> you<00:03:18.940> do<00:03:19.090> different<00:03:19.480> types<00:03:19.690> of

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
finders you do different types of

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.840 
finders you do different types of
ariel's<00:03:20.320> and<00:03:20.620> this<00:03:21.400> will<00:03:21.580> give<00:03:21.730> you<00:03:21.820> different

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
ariel's and this will give you different

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.580 
ariel's and this will give you different
types<00:03:22.450> of<00:03:22.600> distance<00:03:22.959> that<00:03:23.140> you<00:03:23.170> want<00:03:23.350> to<00:03:23.380> take

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
types of distance that you want to take

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.340 
types of distance that you want to take
your<00:03:23.709> boat<00:03:23.950> out<00:03:24.190> so<00:03:24.850> the<00:03:25.570> more<00:03:25.750> you<00:03:25.780> pay<00:03:26.080> for

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
your boat out so the more you pay for

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.120 
your boat out so the more you pay for
the<00:03:26.440> aerial<00:03:26.830> or<00:03:27.040> see<00:03:27.610> you<00:03:28.120> go<00:03:28.269> further<00:03:29.100> with<00:03:30.100> a

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
the aerial or see you go further with a
