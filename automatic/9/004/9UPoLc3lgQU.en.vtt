controlled and of course it does all the
looping<00:00:40.649> for<00:00:41.100> all<00:00:41.250> these<00:00:41.370> pedals<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:41.910> you

00:00:42.169 --> 00:00:42.179 
looping for all these pedals that you

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:45.590 
looping for all these pedals that you
see<00:00:42.390> on<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.629> board<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.350> do<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.579> my<00:00:45.090> way<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.480> the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
see on that board I do it my way in the

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.660 
see on that board I do it my way in the
sense<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:45.960> as<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.410> can<00:00:46.559> see<00:00:46.769> there's<00:00:47.309> round

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
sense that as you can see there's round

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.639 
sense that as you can see there's round
corners<00:00:48.179> on<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.420> pedal<00:00:48.719> board<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.440> never

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
corners on the pedal board so you never

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.340 
corners on the pedal board so you never
break<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.280> edges<00:00:50.609> off<00:00:50.780> its<00:00:51.780> all<00:00:52.019> full

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
break the edges off its all full

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.689 
break the edges off its all full
professional<00:00:53.100> velcro<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.999> can<00:00:54.539> lift<00:00:54.749> actually

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
professional velcro I can lift actually

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.279 
professional velcro I can lift actually
boards<00:00:56.699> with<00:00:57.089> each<00:00:57.269> pedal<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.899> won't<00:00:58.109> come

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
boards with each pedal and it won't come

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.450 
boards with each pedal and it won't come
off<00:00:58.320> see<00:00:59.039> underneath<00:00:59.370> here<00:00:59.760> full<00:01:00.269> anti-skid

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
off see underneath here full anti-skid

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.100 
off see underneath here full anti-skid
so<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.609> will<00:01:02.820> not<00:01:02.999> move<00:01:03.239> no<00:01:03.600> matter<00:01:03.719> where<00:01:04.019> on

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
so it will not move no matter where on

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.920 
so it will not move no matter where on
stage<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.530> will<00:01:04.620> not<00:01:04.800> slide<00:01:05.159> all<00:01:06.000> right<00:01:06.570> angle

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
stage it will not slide all right angle

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.440 
stage it will not slide all right angle
connectors<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.650> used<00:01:08.160> all<00:01:08.400> George<00:01:08.760> L<00:01:09.030> cable

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450
