right<00:04:21.609> there<00:04:21.940> so<00:04:22.720> I'm<00:04:22.810> just<00:04:22.840> gonna<00:04:23.050> attach

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
right there so I'm just gonna attach

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.950 
right there so I'm just gonna attach
this<00:04:23.470> right<00:04:23.770> under<00:04:24.280> here<00:04:24.520> and<00:04:25.510> I'm<00:04:25.570> gonna<00:04:25.720> come

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
this right under here and I'm gonna come

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.700 
this right under here and I'm gonna come
up<00:04:26.110> on<00:04:26.229> this<00:04:26.410> side<00:04:26.680> and<00:04:27.750> pick<00:04:28.750> this<00:04:28.960> one<00:04:29.229> up<00:04:29.289> I

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
up on this side and pick this one up I

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.050

think<00:04:30.130> what<00:04:30.250> will<00:04:30.370> work<00:04:30.490> better<00:04:30.729> if<00:04:30.910> I<00:04:31.030> just

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
think what will work better if I just

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.640 
think what will work better if I just
kind<00:04:31.419> of<00:04:31.510> go<00:04:32.169> like<00:04:32.350> that<00:04:32.530> first<00:04:34.410> make<00:04:35.410> sure<00:04:35.440> I

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
kind of go like that first make sure I

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.500 
kind of go like that first make sure I
get<00:04:35.949> that<00:04:36.070> adjusted<00:04:36.220> where<00:04:36.729> I<00:04:36.789> want<00:04:37.060> it<00:04:37.210> and

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
get that adjusted where I want it and

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.590 
get that adjusted where I want it and
then<00:04:38.380> this<00:04:38.530> way<00:04:38.740> I<00:04:38.770> can<00:04:39.100> make<00:04:39.130> sure<00:04:39.310> yeah<00:04:40.240> there

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
then this way I can make sure yeah there

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.240 
then this way I can make sure yeah there
we<00:04:40.720> go

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
we go

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.510
