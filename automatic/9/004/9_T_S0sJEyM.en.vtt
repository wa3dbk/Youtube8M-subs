know<00:02:07.130> before<00:02:07.400> you<00:02:07.460> get<00:02:07.580> all<00:02:07.670> mad<00:02:07.880> say<00:02:08.239> wait<00:02:08.539> a

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
know before you get all mad say wait a

know before you get all mad say wait a
minute<00:02:08.690> that's<00:02:09.080> tiny<00:02:09.379> is<00:02:09.800> also<00:02:10.190> coupled<00:02:10.429> to<00:02:10.700> an

electric motor that drives the front

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.380 
electric motor that drives the front
wheels<00:02:12.890> so<00:02:13.370> you've<00:02:13.459> got<00:02:13.489> two<00:02:13.760> separate<00:02:14.090> motors

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390

driving<00:02:14.690> different<00:02:14.930> axles<00:02:15.260> it's<00:02:15.379> kind<00:02:15.590> of<00:02:15.620> a

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
driving different axles it's kind of a

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.710 
driving different axles it's kind of a
