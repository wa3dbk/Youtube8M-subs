00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 and several clubs in Central America that 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.250
 train pit bulls faced each other 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.319
 in el salvador in a competition 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.990
 ernesto rivas was there and shows us 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.219
 that there was no blood or aggression 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.219
 applause and cries of happiness 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.210
 to talk about pit bull dogs is to talk about 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:25.849
 force fights and aggressiveness concepts 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.000
 that pitbull club of el salvador is 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.859
 changing we are working as we 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.390
 give fundamentals to people at 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.220
 creators of pitbulls to those who have 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.680
 a pitbull of how to train them how 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.150
 educate them properly so that they 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.130
 can socialize with other people and 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:44.040
 can socialize with other dogs 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:47.180
 with that purpose dogs from Honduras 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.470
 Nicaragua and El Salvador clashed 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.860
 demonstrating intelligence and much 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:55.860
 obedience thus denying the myth that 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.050
 It has made us beasts so 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.510
 it happens that there are people who take care of 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.630
 spread misinformation to others 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.630
 people 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.520
 and it's not the dog is the human the 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.159
 who misappropriates strength and instinct 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:16.259
 protector of these dogs that people 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.390
 describes as aggressive that is a lie not 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.340
 there are aggressive pit bull only people that 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.799
 they make them like that then we 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.590
 we focused on sport maxtor was a 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.950
 warrior forced from a thousand battles but 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.860
 Today is rehabilitated him and his master who 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.710
 accepts that it is inhuman to force 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.679
 these animals are destroyed them good 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.050
 I was wrong in the way I treated 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:42.390
 to the animal to walk me I do not 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.640
 I was interested in that they were dying I was dying but 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.979
 it exists then already to see see what he 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.280
 ago another appreciation has been taken 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.039
 darling then it is better taken care of 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.159
 maxtor's wounds have healed and today he 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:58.789
 Gives satisfaction to his handsome 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.789
 overcoming the heights 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.840
 It may be difficult to erase the stigma that 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.720
 weighs on this race but at least here 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.550
 we have seen a different pit bull we have 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.850
 seen a dog that despite being very 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.940
 strong does not stop being the best friend of 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.940
 man 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.340
 good and of course that is also a 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:28.579
 great friend of them my dog ​​is super 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.579
 loving is super obedient well faithful 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.909
 it's just the opposite what people 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.760
 I think people are confused by the 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:44.640
 aspect and the bad reputation says she but in 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.099
 reality ensures that they are so loving 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.950
 as the most tender pet with the 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:56.480
 difference that they have the ability to 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.480
 drag 745 pounds in a few seconds 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.090
 yes we channel the energy correctly 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.470
 of the dog for his attention 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.410
 then we can have a pet 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.110
 nice an athlete and is that few 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.330
 have seen these dogs fighting for 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.870
 be the best in high jump in strength 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:18.480
 speed or suspended with its prey and 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.540
 the best obeying 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.580
 here is what the press is going to see 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.560
 see his friends will know his 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.780
 relatives all the people will know that 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.030
 has an extremely good dog and without 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.490
 need to hurt him what's left 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.860
 Of course, it is the human being who has 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.770
 bestialized to this faithful race and 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.500
 protective and that many times for its 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:43.770
 fidelity have died in fights 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.400
 clandestine thinking are defending 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.400
 to their masters 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.330
 the call that the clubs 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.459
 Central America did to the world is 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.470
 to finish the pitbull fights for 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.470
 give this race a chance
