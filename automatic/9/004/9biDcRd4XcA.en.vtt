00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
could use bitter could even use

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.169 
could use bitter could even use
something<00:00:11.160> like<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.280> dark<00:00:11.519> stout<00:00:11.790> as<00:00:12.000> well

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
something like a dark stout as well

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.220 
something like a dark stout as well
first<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:12.780> all<00:00:12.900> need<00:00:13.170> half<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:14.450> pound<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.870> flour

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
first of all need half a pound of flour

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.689 
first of all need half a pound of flour
and<00:00:16.529> just<00:00:16.680> sit<00:00:16.890> it<00:00:17.010> through<00:00:17.220> so<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.460> avoid<00:00:17.670> all

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
and just sit it through so you avoid all

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.330 
and just sit it through so you avoid all
the<00:00:18.000> lumps<00:00:18.650> so<00:00:19.650> you<00:00:19.710> get<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.830> nice<00:00:20.070> smooth

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
the lumps so you get a nice smooth

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.060 
the lumps so you get a nice smooth
bitter<00:00:20.609> just<00:00:20.880> tap<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.119> through<00:00:21.920> and<00:00:22.920> all

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
bitter just tap that through and all

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.800 
bitter just tap that through and all
we're<00:00:23.189> going<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.400> add<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:23.820> see<00:00:24.300> some<00:00:24.750> of

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
we're going to add to that see some of

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.900 
we're going to add to that see some of
the<00:00:24.869> lumps<00:00:25.109> still<00:00:25.320> remain<00:00:25.619> in<00:00:25.740> here<00:00:26.010> slowly

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
the lumps still remain in here slowly

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.750 
the lumps still remain in here slowly
we're<00:00:27.180> going<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.359> incorporate<00:00:28.670> roughly<00:00:29.670> about

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
we're going to incorporate roughly about

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.209 
we're going to incorporate roughly about
half<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.660> pint<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.910> beer<00:00:33.710> just<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.770> little<00:00:35.010> bit<00:00:35.100> at

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
half a pint of beer just a little bit at

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.459 
half a pint of beer just a little bit at
first<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.059> get<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.210> nice<00:00:36.390> paste<00:00:36.840> then

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
first so you get a nice paste then

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.200 
first so you get a nice paste then
slowly<00:00:37.829> whip<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.280> rest<00:00:38.399> in<00:00:38.640> not<00:00:38.790> too<00:00:38.940> fast

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
slowly whip the rest in not too fast

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.540 
slowly whip the rest in not too fast
don't<00:00:39.989> bring<00:00:40.110> too<00:00:40.170> much<00:00:40.500> flour<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:40.920> all<00:00:41.129> at<00:00:41.399> one

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
don't bring too much flour in all at one

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.270 
don't bring too much flour in all at one
go<00:00:41.780> you<00:00:42.780> can<00:00:42.930> just<00:00:42.960> see<00:00:43.350> it's<00:00:43.800> probably<00:00:43.920> just<00:00:44.129> a

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
go you can just see it's probably just a

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.619 
go you can just see it's probably just a
little<00:00:44.340> bit<00:00:44.579> too<00:00:44.760> thick<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:45.030> just<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.420> little

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
little bit too thick so just a little

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:55.279 
little bit too thick so just a little
bit<00:00:45.750> more<00:00:45.870> beer<00:00:46.050> into<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:53.870> okay<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:54.989> that's<00:00:55.140> as

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
bit more beer into it okay and that's as

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.970 
bit more beer into it okay and that's as
hard<00:00:55.469> as<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.800> gets<00:00:56.270> okay<00:00:57.649> take<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.680> little<00:00:58.829> bit

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
hard as it gets okay take a little bit

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.260 
hard as it gets okay take a little bit
of<00:00:59.070> fish<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.399> could<00:00:59.550> use<00:00:59.760> some<00:01:00.059> cooked

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
of fish you could use some cooked

of fish you could use some cooked
potatoes<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.960> could<00:01:01.109> use<00:01:01.260> vegetables<00:01:01.800> for

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
potatoes you could use vegetables for

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:02.889 
potatoes you could use vegetables for
this<00:01:02.070> as<00:01:02.219> well

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899

160<00:01:16.400> 170<00:01:17.400> degrees<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:18.570> fish<00:01:18.780> will<00:01:18.930> probably

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
160 170 degrees this fish will probably

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.740 
160 170 degrees this fish will probably
take<00:01:19.650> something<00:01:20.220> like<00:01:20.600> probably<00:01:21.600> no<00:01:21.720> more

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
take something like probably no more

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.370 
take something like probably no more
than<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.110> minute<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.500> cook<00:01:23.600> and<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.659> great<00:01:24.930> secret

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
than a minute to cook and a great secret

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.109 
than a minute to cook and a great secret
to<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:28.100> is<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.460> can<00:01:29.579> actually<00:01:29.880> make

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
to this is that you can actually make

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.749 
to this is that you can actually make
this<00:01:30.270> butter<00:01:30.570> probably<00:01:31.530> an<00:01:31.890> hour<00:01:32.250> saw<00:01:32.549> before

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
this butter probably an hour saw before

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.249 
this butter probably an hour saw before
and<00:01:32.970> before<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.689> actually<00:01:33.810> need<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.229> as<00:01:34.350> well

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
and before you actually need it as well

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.109 
and before you actually need it as well
although<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.650> cook<00:01:37.860> maybe<00:01:38.700> just<00:01:38.909> give<00:01:39.030> it

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
although this to cook maybe just give it

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.609 
although this to cook maybe just give it
a<00:01:39.180> little<00:01:39.299> bit<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.630> term<00:01:39.840> once<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.229> started

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
a little bit of a term once it started

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.800 
a little bit of a term once it started
to<00:01:40.860> started<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.610> cook<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.820> little<00:01:42.000> on<00:01:42.479> the
