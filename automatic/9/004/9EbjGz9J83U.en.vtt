 Teachings of Jesus 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.660
 as we speak in the previous program 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.730

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.430
 nice reading you take 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:37.910
 knowledge of the whole history of 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:41.079
 successors of those who were 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.359
 recognized as apostles 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:47.809
 started as a disciple ended up as 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:50.480
 the door word disciple is one who 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:54.559
 everything starts the door comes from the verb soler 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:57.620
 that is listed and Hebrew is to send 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.219
 those who were sent by jesus 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.990
 for a mission that the Greeks call 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:07.970
 apostle our dear acquaintance paulo 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:10.640
 paulo is known as paulo bet 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.829
 Why did not you study with Jesus? 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.930
 He met Jesus already on the road 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:18.340
 of apricot in that episode that everyone 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:22.490
 We Christians know but there Paul 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:25.850
 became a messenger of Jesus when 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.070
 he surrenders in that sublime moment 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.520
 of his existence when he asks 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:35.450
 you who are you I am Jesus whom thou 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:39.020
 people and he promptly says that you want 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.840
 that I then do jesus from there 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.180
 destination for a mission and how it was 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.909
 sent but was not a disciple he is 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.670
 known as Paul the Apostle 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:53.719
 the disciples were disciples before and 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:57.490
 apostle later and we are going to speak today 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:02:02.270
 a little bit on the hill of olive trees 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.320
 and mount Zion, and mount moriah, I have 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.829
 I have been 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.700
 Thank god, God gave me the opportunity. 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:12.390
 to have visited that region 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.680
 several times and the first time I 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:19.970
 I was there I practically went to 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:23.519
 explore from a spiritual and 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:27.720
 archaeological topographic's ways 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:29.459
 Jesus and a local impressed me 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.540
 enough 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:36.450
 we climbed the hill of olive trees 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.810
 world of olive trees is a mountain that 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:48.829
 is called and Hebrew 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:53.280
 razvan rat monte monte das oliveiras 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:54.380
 it is situated to the east of the old 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.380
 Jerusalem 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:01.470
 we had in the church of the ascension there 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.049
 octagonal church up 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.000
 We have a little and we are going to visit the church. 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:09.660
 from our father 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.170
 besides Jesus taught his disciples to 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:16.170
 hour ' at their request and then when people 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:19.170
 leaves our father's church on a lookout 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.410
 this lookout is fantastic because it 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.440
 puts you in a wonderful vision as you 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.109
 stand face to face with the golden dome 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.799
 the ancient city of jerusalem 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:34.560
 You have practically all the 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:38.549
 ministry of jesus in judea 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.350
 with the exception of Berber jericho 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.680
 other places he walked away but he 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:46.829
 always I was in Jerusalem and alviverde 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.989
 for one day preached in the night time 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:52.560
 and went to the hill of olive trees where 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:55.079
 slept in this wonderful grotto known 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.000
 today as our father's cave because 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:00.690
 Jesus, I do not have the privilege that we 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.840
 we have in some occasions of power today 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.819
 To sleep, note is our pedagogy and not 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.739
 had conditions the son of man does not have 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.709
 a stone cut off the head and 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.840
 ceded the value of the cedar 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:17.970
 the hill of olive trees is in jerusalem 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.340
 down to a Jewish cemetery because 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:25.520
 Jews believe 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:28.250
 What jesus when it comes to initiations 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.160
 he will come from Bethany to spend there in that 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.610
 region of the world of olive trees will 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.790
 be assessed and rest report to all 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.520
 those who are in that cemetery there 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:42.520
 will enter Jerusalem is the law 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:49.150
 I tell you that it was one of the places 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:50.870
 who else put me in the bc I was filled with 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.419
 spirituality of sensations 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.930
 wonderful that I got to stay in that 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:58.010
 miro generally below the viewpoint below 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.919
 Our Father's War 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:03.410
 you have a wonderful vision not only of 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:08.740
 jerusalem as well as all locations 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:08.740
 where did jesus go where he performed 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:18.110
 the law you find the domus church 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:20.020
 left bottom where jesus limbs or about 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.910
 jerusalem who cried 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.520
 in that famous passage and leadership in 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:28.460
 jerusalem jerusalem that kills the prophets 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.940
 and stones those who have sought 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:34.580
 How many times did I want one of your children? 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:38.750
 like the chicken the chicks underneath 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:41.330
 however do not want him to cry about 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.940
 jerusalem and the architect belluschi as well 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.099
 Italian berlutti designed a church 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:53.020
 because there is no chapel there that has a 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:56.110
 a tear symbolizing love for us 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:59.720
 regretting that the countrymen themselves 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.310
 I did not know and besides the movie, my 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:06.770
 dear you look down those 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:08.530
 Cemetery there he has figures 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.419
 of the Old Testament 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:14.300
 including buried the law 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:17.360
 there in that graveyard you have absolute 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.970
 reason you have sacks father john 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:27.620
 baptist yet another in many others 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:32.009
 funds from the time you visited 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:34.379
 Do you have this memory in the cedar valley? 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:35.969
 I think they were the river that passed 

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:38.999
 in which it is covered 

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:42.719
 You do not see the river anymore but the 

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:45.270
 Orthodox who was there where is the side 

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:48.149
 right to the getsemani church where he went 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:52.349
 buried according to him Maria of Nazare 

00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:54.659
 A chapel is buried there in the cave. 

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:57.479
 which has the Russian Orthodox Church a 

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:58.559
 a little closer to Maria's church 

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:01.409
 Madalena 

00:06:58.559 --> 00:07:04.529
 so there is a living story to be 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:06.719
 tell you how rich it is 

00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:09.449
 It's as if you've seen the law in some 

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:12.659
 moments felt like I was from 

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:16.379
 suddenly finds Jesus find 

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:19.229
 Jesus in that panorama with so much 

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:21.629
 story with so much wonder that both 

00:07:19.229 --> 00:07:24.029
 enriches our spirit 

00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:25.800
 but it does not leave there that we will be back 

00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:28.800
 even in the second part of our problem 

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:31.649
 to talk about the importance of 

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:34.639
 olive trees at the origin of Christianity 

00:07:31.649 --> 00:07:34.639
 by now
