00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.740
 you will go to your 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:35.070

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.200
 here 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.790
 you go to the first site that I 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.930
 would put as usual in the 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.100

 I was already me I already did 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.780
 it is there you install it and you will 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.260
 ask if you want installation 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.460
 personalized then a moment in 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.360
 the installation and ask you how much 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.340
 you want languages 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.000
 I advise you only one language 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.530
 the French after is understood aims this 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.450

 have them installed you click on them 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:12.390
 so you get on that you have you 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.950
 first have video dvd as you are 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.759
 doubt it is to burn your movies 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.240
 on dvd legal attention cd audio down 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.729
 everyone suspects the music 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.070
 the images on cd or dvd I do not know 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.509
 What's the point 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.329
 but it's good to copy discs 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.729
 unprotected attention and and phase is 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.470
 outright a CD cd dvd or bdr them 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.020
 that I do not know what it is then 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.750
 we will be more interested in audio cd 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.790
 we will click on already given to the hard ones in 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.290

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.460
 so already you'll need a cd or 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.420
 dvd everyone probably you 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.700
 go introduce in your computer 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.860
 You can find laon cd dvd in the market 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.899
 at the market finally to finally walk 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.640
 on internal you find cheap me 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.769
 I have a thousand I bought 1000 for 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:13.760
 50 euros so a great deal 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:16.099
 500 dvd 500 cd so it goes normally 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.909
 like that will insert your cd or dvd 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:21.319
 you will see at the bottom left there here 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:22.939
 cdr fast so me it's a cd I have 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.359
 introduces it's not a dvd but dvd 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:28.790
 it's the same thing it's empty dvd-r 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:32.269
 with the size of your cd size 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.790
 remaining - brest 1h19 of track so 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.180
 you do not ask how we do 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.909
 now 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.299
 then you're already on it that ten 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:42.579
 local 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:45.620
 the user bah me it's me them 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:49.370
 music and you'll come across all your 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:53.090
 music themselves what you do not have 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:57.590
 damn in a folder then you can 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.930
 no you can for ba1 series of 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.449
 badens music in the table there in 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.829
 the pure serious and you're going to produce a 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:05.139
 music for me example I take 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:10.510
 Indochinese 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:13.900
 no i did not want the advanced and shit 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.900
 so wait 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.980
 excuse me excuse me a little 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.760
 Technical problem 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.770
 I did not want to throw it at all 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.140
 I hope you have heard nothing so 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.790
 this is my music you want to put a 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.950
 music you do not click twice because 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.350
 that if it's not going to launch it then I 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.140
 indochine again 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.000
 I click once I slip it and there 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.820
 you see that it created a small 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.750
 green bar with a red line all over 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.770
 right here and that from this trait 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.960
 red you will not be able to master anymore 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.950
 odessa music indochina it's 3 5 2 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.600
 3 3 minutes 54 you can put that 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.590
 depends how long your cd have yielded 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.750
 like me it's going max 20 music 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:04.130
 so I do not have my going to take part in 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.900
 caylar said up we'll even go get 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.410
 further away will go to not me at 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:12.050
 take flo rida 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.660
 so what would you like to change 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.470
 order 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.770
 imagine i'm going to be florid and in 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:22.190
 first no you wanted once on 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:24.740
 florida you ride it from oro and that's it and 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:28.120
 you can do that up to me 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:31.450
 I wanted to many times hop 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.530
 yes it's already in the audio track 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.010
 so here's the jelly put twice ten 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.750
 github 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.360
 that's it finally until it gets there 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.810
 down so as soon as you feel like base 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.669
 of the cre was what you do 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.000
 finally I mean you want to 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.620
 to delete a music or have it removed 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.720
 so you want to burn 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:55.040
 click on serious and that is then month 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.660
 burning options what I you 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:04.820
 advise is to leave or m 48 x 48 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:06.340
 x 8468 kb per second spends your 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.080
 Internet connection 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.580
 so there you finally uncheck anything 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.680
 unless you want to be the pc 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.380
 after the engraving especially do not check 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.700
 simulate burning a break from two 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.650
 seconds between each track to know 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.040
 for this after two no more time 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.940
 but it's going faster 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:27.340
 no more no banon break 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.300
 progression of the engraving is when 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.240
 you will start there you need 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.520
 click or click nova start 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.430
 Engraving e you entered 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:45.340
 information and selected texts 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:46.570
 that's good because it's waiting for me 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.160
 believe it's just because I put 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.270
 several music I put several 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.320
 once denied that relies on beautiful music 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:56.080
 is excellent and so that's the cd he 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.210
 do not want it so yes they are even if 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.460
 you are weir and then it will start 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:03.160
 by that so see dickie top-10 github 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.300
 dig it up I like a lot of times your 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.200
 music and he'll start to 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:10.810
 treat like this here I go on time 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.040
 we'll wait until it's over 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.440
 Besides, I take the opportunity to talk about 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.810
 my chain my chain i'm waiting for the 1500 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.510
 saw that I already said it but I am 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:23.890
 happy because there are 20 videos 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:25.390
 1500 saw his subscribers brian has others who 

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:26.710
 will say it's better than that so there 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.560
 as soon as it's over he'll put that to you 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.640
 and there lavaud pc will start to make 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:40.630
 buzzing I let you listen to the 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:42.850
 mine sorry shit I got the trick of 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:45.100
 my pc fell so I do not know 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:47.740
 if you've heard this group so the 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:51.430
 poultry will you grave it and that's it 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.750
 you will have to wait for it depends I 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.340
 advise you to do nothing during 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.230
 that it's serious so it'll take a 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.000
 crazy time 

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:59.980
 so there I do not know it's not so I 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.690
 can not see it so it already takes 

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.650
 you can see it at but that's it 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.370
 because I have not seen a lot of 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.830
 music is going fast 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:09.130
 here I hope that this little tutorial on 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:11.440
 how ah yes I want to clarify too 

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:13.630
 that if you start an engraving and that 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.150
 you cancel your future cd but 

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:20.710

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:21.520
 superb you can erase the disc 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.020
 or the dvd
