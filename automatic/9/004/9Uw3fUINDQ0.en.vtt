00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.770
 I present to your attention a resistor 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.139
 bottom resistor if not at hand 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.139
 the necessary resistor in principle can 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.710
 using a pencil to pick it up 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:20.340
 there's a slate pencil just need to be 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.289
 you need to take the usual ordinary black and white 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.449
 graphite pencil 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.769
 not colored there is not white not pink 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.160
 glamorous a no 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.869
 we take an ordinary pencil but without written 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.210
 lerua merlen they are the best 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.390
 these are the most accurate resistors that we do 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.260
 for our experiments, too, a little sharpen 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.739
 his little bit here on one side and on 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.440
 other 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.719
 Now he will be like this to 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.910
 here here I just have such here 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.129
 pincers so that I could like this 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.190
 ok take here like this so 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.760
 contact was good he will continue with 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:02.070
 This side will do the same under 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:06.869
 let's get a little bit so let's say 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.360
 Now all he has done neatly 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.909
 dragged well, you can, in principle, not sharply 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.140
 do we like to draw there all sorts 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.640
 schemes do not need here and here we take have 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.920
 I remind you once more of Leurois Merlin pencil 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.220
 be sure to go there take this 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.299
 pencil here that is they are the best 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.869
 the most delicious 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.000
 here then we connect a crocodile here 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.780
 so here that we were now 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.110
 a little bit and you need a little bit here 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.430
 modify 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:43.500
 here 's a bit of a corner to round out 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.320
 this is very important very important because 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.240
 may not work look here 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.649
 connect such a crocodile me 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.439
 there is my that he dangles contact here 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:02:00.090
 so good it holds in your right hand 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:02.100
 pencil and in his left hand we take very 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.469
 it is important that there is a red wire black 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.880
 green purple is here to be 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.940
 only red wire 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:13.920
 and so here we hold in this hand and here 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.570
 bring about there is a contact hold so 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.610
 a little bit 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:24.209
 keep it so apparently and then steal a guy 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:28.530
 In short, the grinder meat is already with us 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:37.340
 would pickled so look what 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:37.340
 happens so who smokes and someone smokes 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:45.230
 so someone smokes shorter so already wire 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.830
 hot means perehochetsya so here 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:52.670
 this is either bad contact or do not know 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.670
 that there is just needed and 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.370
 already red one more time so 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.850
 the resistance is apparently very small 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:10.160
 there is a small because it does not burn 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.160
 now it warms up a little shorter 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:19.170
 resistance is already becoming less 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:22.470
 Vidos yes that is, as if there is already soot 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.820
 a little bit went a little bit there will release 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:29.130
 quite a bit almost like that 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:32.040
 apparently do not want to go bad team 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.820
 whisper ohh caught fire yes look how 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:39.780
 remarkably lit the wire we put out the ears 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:42.660
 Oh, everything was peeled off and the lead became us 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.340
 everything is available now we can take 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:49.519
 stylus and use it as 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.519
 resistor thank you for your attention
