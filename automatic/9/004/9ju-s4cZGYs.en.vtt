00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.960
 in this video we will see how 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.799
 we transform this tangle we go to 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.799
 proceed with cleaning 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:18.200
 we will choose two or three 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:20.270
 an example here we see up close 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.740
 the trunk to the mother trunk now 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.460
 we will see how we are cleaning 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.849
 well, we are already clearing 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.390
 already looks much more clear now like this 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.530
 that we will proceed to choose the 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.910
 offshoots 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.910
 how to make the grafts 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:44.050
 well we have chosen this scion no but 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.690
 It has certain wounds 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.120
 we will look for a cutting site where the 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.410
 bark is healthy and you can accentuate 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.489
 cuts 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:58.060
 so that no infection was raised 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.060
 through the cells 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.380
 we owe 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.380
 estimate the cut 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.380
 Y 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:16.260
 now h 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:19.560
 clean up all the actions that are going 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.590
 all these hairs do not have to proceed 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.490
 to a cleaning 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.729
 so that it is very clean 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.729
 but 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.110
 Hello 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.740
 that is a little bit in between does not happen 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.590
 nothing 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.770
 not because that does not make good contact 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.899
 approach the camera as you see this is the 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.659
 wood this is the change and that's the 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:59.020
 bark then we proceed to make a 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.020
 vertical cut 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.520
 in the cortex 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:11.080
 and it has to be easily separated 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.080
 we'll see how it is 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.540
 no this 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.330
 it's not very easy to separate because it's not 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.690
 it has rained a lot and then it needs 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.690
 of water 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.180
 we're going to leave it like that and we'll make the wedge 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:48.240
 the branch has to be the second year 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.240
 to go well 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:57.610
 the important thing to catch a tree 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.610
 that produces and we want or not 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:06.120
 the trees have crossed pollination 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:08.520
 then it never guarantees 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.770
 what of seed 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.090
 be equal 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.090
 the offspring are equal 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.800
 Mother 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.800
 good as you see 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.690
 I have pineapple 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.690
 you introduce someone 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.709
 bale 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.520
 a little more 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.710
 so 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:48.700
 and we already have one 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.700
 this is colored to 500 types of grafts 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:54.450
 two or three are made to guarantee one 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:54.450
 at least 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.350
 and it is done when the trees start to 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:08.790
 move that is when the olive tree begins to bloom 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:11.160
 it's a water that to see when 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.860
 and start moving 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.870
 We can see 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.510
 the beginning of flowering 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.949
 in the deciduous trees you see 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.560
 easy when the buds start to 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:26.740
 sprout but leaves us perennial is more 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.389
 complicated to know when it is then 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.449
 when it starts to bloom, we have 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.310
 is telling us the tree that is already 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:36.300
 leaving the vegetation of the state 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.300
 vegetative winter 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.390
 on this side they take off from climbing 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.889
 all right 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.840
 just put different thicknesses 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:04.360
 towards the cut until you see the center 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.360
 which is where the sap is fed 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.660
 now with us we put more applies 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:27.400
 tics 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.400
 it's a healing paste 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.220
 to avoid possible infections 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.949
 for 21 days it is left tied to the ribbon 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:06.900
 for the wound to sound 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.750
 at 21 days 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.759
 short so as not to strangle or there 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.270
 professionals who make some children in 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:14.270
 fast 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.139
 applies also 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:38.590
 a little more 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:40.710
 and why not 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:47.720
 get dehydrated 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:47.720
 the mara and then the graft is already 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.660
 dark I swear I do it better 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.990
 internally 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.990
 efe 

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:06.309
 this is a crown graft 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.650
 and it is already
