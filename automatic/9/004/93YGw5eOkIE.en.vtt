00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.440
 Y 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.070
 hello friends today I bring you something that 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.920
 came to the head while playing sonic 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.710
 good is sonic 1 and sounds could have 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.350
 been the same game if what I said 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.480
 could have been the same good game 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.670
 this theory occurred to me while doing 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.500
 weird things with save stage here 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.449
 I will show what happens if we put a 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.449
 silver stay from sounds to sound 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.100
 as they saw I put a side state of 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.380
 sounds in sonic 1 and curiously I do not know 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.140
 diving neither the graphics nor the 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.270
 nothing the funny thing is that music is heard 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.700
 well which gives me a theory that 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.190
 you could or none and sounds have been 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.170
 the same game plus they are interest 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.630
 and the are and ends was also in the 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.790
 same game but divided into two parts 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.890
 and that probably would have been a 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.440
 same game good other things that gives me 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.479
 the theory that they are one and sounds are 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.070
 the same game is the split is in the 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.840
 two games are the same 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.000
 for example the sonic sprite in the 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.000
 two games are the same just look 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.180
 we also have other things like 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.340
 maps that never put into the game there are 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.940
 four maps in total the first of 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.920
 these is hayden to take them good 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.350
 here I have a theory maybe when 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.060
 only gets the six emeralds these 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.920
 will take it and back from the zone and that 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.110
 then it goes out of there arrives to endeavor 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.630
 gilles here theory 2 is that after 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.910
 from sonic to the address found 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.520
 something that will take you to palace item like 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.780
 a hole one tunnel so good 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.490
 let's move to the next map - jake city 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.040
 this map could be the connection between 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.200
 1 and 2 as sonic that after beating 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.120
 german in sonic one manages to escape without 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.980
 that sound frees German ship and 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.680
 there you have to jump again from the 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.660
 death to fall in jersey city after 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.370
 from this it occurs to me that it could happen 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.530
 to get to emeralds like 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.090
 example when escaping from the city arrives 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.250
 saa and back and when you get out of there 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.680
 you come to the surface in emeralds 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.780
 although good is just a small theory 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.150
 of how maps could be hidden too 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.870
 I have another theory of how it would appear 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.030
 times' 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.400
 it would be good that when there are lies 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.830
 the new dead dais saw that the lane 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.140
 or saves at the end dire goes flying with 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.390
 sonic arrive from other sites and click on the 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.430
 abandoned city in chaos find the 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.560
 goalkeeper like those who are and three which 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.959
 it takes them to go in bullets but they disappear 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.940
 to six emeralds good I already talked a lot 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.160
 of this so let's move on to another theory 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.170
 that could continue as we see is to shine 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.360
 with that has a background that looks like 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.680
 a city so this brings me to this 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.080
 theory that they are and that when passing 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.030
 stringer zone arrives from another side city 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.800
 well those are the theories that I took to 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.660
 investigate so let's move on to the next 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.660
 deleted map 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.730
 good watson where is a forest with 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.950
 trees the theory is that after that 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.630
 sony pasamar play zone that we live are 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.850
 some ruins but at the bottom of the 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.010
 scenario there is a forest that could be 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.230
 wo where could I say that after that 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.390
 sonic comes out of the coils comes water 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.910
 where good let's go now to the last map 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.450
 erased 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.670
 VICTOR This map is of a good desert 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.770
 I just found a theory and it's something 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.600
 that has to do with expressions I 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.880
 I said apparently that in the background too 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.070
 there is a forest a city in ruins and for 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.620
 last some mountains my theory is that you 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.750
 you ask the ones in the mountains after 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.480
 we arrived in jerusalem city arriving at 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.220
 heaps and then we got the first 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.830
 of although I could mar litigation to be 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.810
 between no site city and watson in what 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.970
 well I still do not know the other games have 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.100
 many good things but that's all 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.870
 that I could see and give a theory the theory 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.690
 what they are and how and two could have 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.640
 been a single game is possible by the way 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.450
 can put their own theory in the 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.310
 comments 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.320
 or if they saw that I was wrong in something 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.960
 you can also write it well I would 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.600
 dismissal I dedicated to the video share or 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.880
 with your friends and on your social networks and 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.770
 of course subscribe to the channel that a 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.720
 Subscription always helps 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.440
 I am extinct metal and I started good 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:44.270
 nights and try braceros sorry but 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.270
 I wanted to say the xx of d
