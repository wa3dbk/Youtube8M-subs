00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.840
 previously it has been raised as average 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.430
 hour an hour before and how do you get here to 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.250
 first hour you check that it is 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.200

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.040
 that he has eaten that he has no 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.180
 health problem and the following is 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.110
 clean you clean to lend 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.300
 service and after cleaning it so what 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.310
 first there is breakfast is age 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.069

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.260
 straw 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.260

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.389
 that one hour after boarding the 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.920
 horses to go to provide services and 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:42.239
 they render services before all tomorrow or 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.329
 between all later it depends on turn that 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.280
 have already the arrival of horses the goal 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.650
 checkpoint looks again to be 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.599
 perfectly and again well the I think 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.599
 from midday or the feed of the 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.450
 nine o'clock at night and it is left loose 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:00.240
 to the block to rest and the truth 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.450
 have a pretty good life for them 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.940
 On Thursdays different schools come 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.160
 who ask for them or ask for permission or 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.870
 they want to come visiting 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.970
 facilities of both the squadron and 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.730
 of the municipal police canine and if 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.580
 equestrian beams and visions and pages with 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:22.220
 different actors really that is a 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:26.860
 worth seeing and apart from colleges come 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.930
 Disabled schools and foundations 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.940
 to observe all this and the truth is 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.430
 that since this is being done 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.530
 labor we see that we are closer to 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.390
 citizens of the people are interested 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.160
 Pretty what they see they do not see on the street 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.960
 but you do not see what happens here in the 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.000
 unit when they come they really stay 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.000
