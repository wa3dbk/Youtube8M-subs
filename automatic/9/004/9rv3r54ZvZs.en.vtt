00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.070
 i 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:40.880
 the composition we are going to make is a 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:44.060
 composition on romantic basis ideal for 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.250
 a two-person dinner is romantic 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.730
 Well, it's going to take you to sailing 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.690
 create a certain atmosphere of romanticism 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.930
 giving also with the materials that 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.930
 we used 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.670
 fruits for the sensation of romanticism 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.790
 the first step is a good choice of 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.670
 the basis in this case to use a base 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.620
 wicker is going to be the most work or 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:14.560
 less rustic since later 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:17.200
 let's also use downloaded branches 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.670
 of climbers then we have to 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.840
 choose a suitable base for example for 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.120
 this kind of work a very base 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.740
 Elegant 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.620
 we are going to place the flower sponge 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.320
 Fresh, the ideal is to have it in water 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.960
 about 10 minutes so 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.310
 horizontal and that we do not press for 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.580
 down because if it does not come to life 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.140
 we cut 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.140
 a little at the height of the container 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.190
 and his thing is that the bid is pretty 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.190
 stable 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.229
 for and then the work does not move us 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.020
 to several sides we leave some egg that 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.900
 will be after the composition go 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.950
 drinking water approximately every three 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.200
 days we have to fill in 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.970
 once placing the sponge we are going to 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.940
 place a base of branches 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.700
 dry in this case is antelope yes 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.220
 but it can be of any type of branch 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.320
 that we have for the field that 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.330
 does the work is going to be rustic 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.370
 romantic romantic a little bit by the 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.990
 quality of the candle and for the tones and 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.750
 rustic by many of the elements that 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.580
 let's place 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.810
 initially I would go with sheet what 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.810
 let's leave all leaves 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.170
 once it is placed with wires 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.220
 in the form of fork we fix in some 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.220
 point sponge 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:52.680
 in the central part we are going to place 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:55.260
 glass a motorcycle type the cover 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.109
 and inside we're going to place a candle that 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.560
 go fastened with two spikes to what the 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.560
 sponge 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:09.939
 first let's go answer by some sides 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.939
 so it does not look 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:21.010
 if we apply a composition on base is 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.900
 fundamental to use razor and perform 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.940
 the bevel cut to make it much more 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.110
 easy to introduce the flower in the sponge and 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.810
 on the other hand so that the most 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.280
 Water conductors do not close 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.220
 it's going to be a job that we're going to 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.280
 denominate work to groups since the 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.170
 flower validates group 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.120
 it's not going to go a willing 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.010
 over others but these little ones go 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.410
 test groups to stay much more 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.690
 interesting how they put epa to see 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.030
 we will have special interest in the 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.920
 flower that we are going to use that is not 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.349
 all at the same height but have 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.180
 Its highest flower and low form to create 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.860
 more interest so that you do not see all the 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.350
 flower in the first sight impact 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.819
 the groups we will take into account that 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:06.850
 be of different volume 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.350
 larger groups and smaller groups 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:12.210
 the nun takes approximately in the 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:14.380
 market roughly 20 years 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.489
 previously after in a cycle in the 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.280
 which one 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.070
 the flower 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:26.660
 the pricked in the filled container 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:28.040
 of leaves leaves or branches 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.910
 We are hanging by the hand in your 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.430
 pendulum 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.410
 a little to relate the color to 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.800
 that is not so isolated what are the 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.650
 branches we see that it pendulates because it has 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:43.440
 drop so far all the flowers that 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:46.560
 we have been placing groups have gone to 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.260
 come together to the center now let's 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.060
 place the antonio mini that a little bit 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.130
 so how does it have to bend its 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.170
 stem let's use looked also 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.370
 giving beauty to the stem that want 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.650
 transparent on the rest of the 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.580
 flowers and at the same time accompany 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.580
 the shape of the crown 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.280
 we puncture the antonio in the sponge and 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:10.580
 then we guide her very carefully and the 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.960
 same structure no longer supports us 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:16.710
 allows us the previous one in that area 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.900
 we have hung the gerberas and some rose 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.240
 as I said earlier fundamental 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.240
 that not all the flowers are placed 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.699
 at the same height but some are 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.250
 measure mother and others one more part 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:31.789
 top to create this all these 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.080
 jumps that we do that are not very 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:36.529
 shrill since we always have 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.959
 that save what the form 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:40.219
 the effect that makes us put flowers in the 

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:42.619
 part of below is a little create 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:44.360
 depth and create more interest in 

00:05:42.619 --> 00:05:45.560
 the composition 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.050
 once we have finished 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.500
 composition we proceed to put some 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.500
 material that we have transparency 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.500
 envelope 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:09.550
 to reflect some flowers 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.540
 and also to create a little effect of 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.740
 much more 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.740
 healthy work 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.720
 let's make the candle or to create a 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:22.780
 little atmosphere of romanticism 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.490
 warmth as you told me earlier 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:28.550
 this work is characterized as a 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:32.340
 romantic rustic work ideal for a 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:35.090
 Evening dinner for couple in 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.090
 or garden
