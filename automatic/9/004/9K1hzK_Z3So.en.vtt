00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
I think it's what five yards up maybe to

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.279 
I think it's what five yards up maybe to
five<00:04:51.610> or<00:04:51.789> ten<00:04:51.940> yards<00:04:52.180> up<00:04:52.360> you<00:04:53.020> know<00:04:53.110> obviously

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
five or ten yards up you know obviously

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:56.230 
five or ten yards up you know obviously
to<00:04:53.650> prevent<00:04:54.310> the

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
to prevent the

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.580
