 Hi lovies, welcome back on my youtube channel J'adoreMyCurls 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.880
 Today I'll show you how I change my old, wash &amp; go into an elegant updo. 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.380
 The link to my Wash &amp; Go is in the discription bar or click the link on the screen. 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.740
 I divide the hair in two. It doesn't matter if it's straight 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.720
 We start with the second section. 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.060
 Divide this into 5. This can be more, but I choose to do this in 5 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.560
 Secure the hair with a small elastic 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:32.560
 Because my hair is very dry, since this is an old wash, I use coconut oil and water. 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.060
 This can be a little bit confusing, but pay attention. 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.320
 Take the 3 last parts. Devide every parts in 2. 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.360
 Put the middle part between the last part. 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:57.080
 Now grab the last part, which is already devided in 2 and twist this with the third part, which is also devided 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.900
 Because, I've made 5 parts, the last two parts are a bit easier. 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.880
 You only have to devide those 2 and twist, without including other parts. 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.880
 Now grab the left twists and twist them all in one. The same thing you do with the right twists. 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.140
 Now we are going to start with the other half. 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.360
 I put the hair in a high pontail. 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.620
 Now cross the 2 twist around the ponytail. 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.880
 Make small twists and secure with bobby pins.
