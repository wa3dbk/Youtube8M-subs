CT series please open the CT series with

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.750 
CT series please open the CT series with
12<00:00:22.900> 26<00:00:23.529> images<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:26.070> go<00:00:27.070> down<00:00:27.279> to<00:00:27.310> the<00:00:27.550> liver

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
12 26 images and go down to the liver

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.200 
12 26 images and go down to the liver
and<00:00:28.140> in<00:00:29.140> the<00:00:29.230> liver<00:00:29.410> you<00:00:29.470> see<00:00:29.800> two<00:00:30.039> big<00:00:30.310> lesions

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
and in the liver you see two big lesions

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.360 
and in the liver you see two big lesions
this<00:00:31.720> one<00:00:31.960> on<00:00:32.110> this<00:00:32.290> one<00:00:32.470> and<00:00:33.150> we<00:00:34.150> want<00:00:34.690> to

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
this one on this one and we want to

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.640 
this one on this one and we want to
measure<00:00:36.370> the<00:00:36.820> size<00:00:37.510> the<00:00:37.870> volume<00:00:38.230> of<00:00:38.410> this

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
measure the size the volume of this

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.180 
measure the size the volume of this
lesion<00:00:39.629> we<00:00:40.629> can<00:00:40.930> use<00:00:41.199> this<00:00:41.470> segmentation

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
lesion we can use this segmentation

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.610 
lesion we can use this segmentation
algorithm<00:00:42.670> because<00:00:42.970> that<00:00:43.269> the<00:00:44.019> contrast<00:00:44.470> is

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
algorithm because that the contrast is

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.560 
algorithm because that the contrast is
too<00:00:44.860> low<00:00:45.070> and<00:00:45.340> it<00:00:45.640> wouldn't<00:00:45.940> work<00:00:46.030> because<00:00:46.270> it

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
too low and it wouldn't work because it

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.720 
too low and it wouldn't work because it
would<00:00:46.690> run<00:00:46.960> out<00:00:46.989> of<00:00:47.350> the<00:00:47.470> lesion<00:00:47.800> and<00:00:48.010> get<00:00:48.579> all

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
would run out of the lesion and get all

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.870 
would run out of the lesion and get all
the<00:00:49.030> liver<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:50.350> recommend<00:00:51.190> that<00:00:51.309> you<00:00:51.370> have<00:00:51.640> a

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:51.880 
the liver I recommend that you have a

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.880 
the liver I recommend that you have a
look<00:00:52.180> at<00:00:52.300> it<00:00:52.450> what<00:00:52.630> I'm<00:00:52.780> doing<00:00:53.110> and<00:00:53.230> then<00:00:53.380> after

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
look at it what I'm doing and then after

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.250 
look at it what I'm doing and then after
that<00:00:54.040> you<00:00:54.309> can<00:00:54.520> repeat<00:00:55.030> it<00:00:55.090> so<00:00:55.540> just<00:00:56.020> have<00:00:56.230> a

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
that you can repeat it so just have a

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.100 
that you can repeat it so just have a
look<00:00:56.440> at<00:00:56.530> it<00:00:56.649> we<00:00:57.489> have<00:00:57.610> to<00:00:57.850> go<00:00:58.750> to<00:00:58.809> the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
look at it we have to go to the

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.380 
look at it we have to go to the
beginning<00:00:59.559> of<00:00:59.920> the<00:01:00.040> lesion<00:01:00.399> may<00:01:00.579> be<00:01:00.790> here<00:01:01.120> and

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
beginning of the lesion may be here and

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.200 
beginning of the lesion may be here and
we<00:01:01.840> use<00:01:02.050> a<00:01:02.079> tool<00:01:02.440> which<00:01:02.950> is<00:01:03.129> called<00:01:03.399> closed

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
we use a tool which is called closed

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:11.639 
we use a tool which is called closed
polygon<00:01:05.550> and<00:01:06.899> I<00:01:08.100> try<00:01:09.100> to<00:01:09.130> mark<00:01:09.490> up<00:01:10.649> to

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
polygon and I try to mark up to

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:13.200 
polygon and I try to mark up to
highlight<00:01:12.009> that<00:01:12.369> lesion

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
highlight that lesion

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.240 
highlight that lesion
and<00:01:13.360> on<00:01:13.750> the<00:01:13.869> last<00:01:15.300> point<00:01:16.300> I<00:01:16.600> click<00:01:17.259> twice<00:01:17.590> then

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
and on the last point I click twice then

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.359 
and on the last point I click twice then
the<00:01:18.429> polygon<00:01:18.970> is<00:01:19.090> closed<00:01:19.420> I<00:01:19.800> could<00:01:20.800> do<00:01:20.950> that<00:01:21.160> in

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
the polygon is closed I could do that in

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.639 
the polygon is closed I could do that in
every<00:01:21.580> single<00:01:22.090> slice<00:01:22.330> but<00:01:22.690> this<00:01:22.929> may<00:01:23.140> be<00:01:23.170> a<00:01:23.410> lot

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
every single slice but this may be a lot

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.460 
every single slice but this may be a lot
of<00:01:23.679> work<00:01:24.009> so<00:01:24.459> I<00:01:24.490> decide<00:01:25.300> I'll<00:01:26.050> see<00:01:26.200> looks<00:01:26.350> will

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
of work so I decide I'll see looks will

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.130 
of work so I decide I'll see looks will
assist<00:01:26.709> me<00:01:26.800> with<00:01:26.920> that<00:01:27.160> I<00:01:27.369> go<00:01:27.970> I<00:01:28.360> go<00:01:28.509> down<00:01:28.780> a

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
assist me with that I go I go down a

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:38.219 
assist me with that I go I go down a
couple<00:01:29.830> of<00:01:30.099> slices<00:01:30.520> and<00:01:32.130> do<00:01:33.130> it<00:01:33.280> again<00:01:36.599> so<00:01:37.599> last

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
couple of slices and do it again so last

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.680 
couple of slices and do it again so last
click<00:01:38.770> it's<00:01:38.979> double<00:01:39.340> and<00:01:39.520> if<00:01:39.880> it<00:01:40.030> doesn't<00:01:40.509> fit

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
click it's double and if it doesn't fit

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.839 
click it's double and if it doesn't fit
we<00:01:41.470> can<00:01:41.970> also<00:01:42.970> move<00:01:43.420> that<00:01:44.410> points<00:01:44.920> to<00:01:45.550> adjust

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:45.849 
we can also move that points to adjust

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:51.749 
we can also move that points to adjust
it<00:01:46.030> I<00:01:46.209> could<00:01:46.690> download<00:01:46.869> a<00:01:47.080> little<00:01:47.259> bit<00:01:47.500> more<00:01:50.759> do

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
it I could download a little bit more do

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:59.910 
it I could download a little bit more do
it<00:01:51.789> again<00:01:53.160> and<00:01:57.119> go<00:01:58.119> to<00:01:58.179> the<00:01:58.420> last<00:01:58.690> slice<00:01:59.649> where

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
it again and go to the last slice where

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.249 
it again and go to the last slice where
I'm<00:01:59.979> seeing<00:02:00.310> the<00:02:00.459> lesion<00:02:00.849> right<00:02:01.509> thing<00:02:02.020> for

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
I'm seeing the lesion right thing for

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.559 
I'm seeing the lesion right thing for
this<00:02:02.440> region<00:02:03.039> and<00:02:03.610> that's<00:02:04.179> it

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
this region and that's it

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.889 
this region and that's it
now<00:02:05.560> I<00:02:05.590> have<00:02:05.830> maybe<00:02:06.610> ten<00:02:07.179> slices<00:02:07.450> with<00:02:07.840> the

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
now I have maybe ten slices with the

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.410 
now I have maybe ten slices with the
lesion<00:02:08.229> in<00:02:08.319> it<00:02:08.470> and<00:02:08.709> I<00:02:08.920> have<00:02:09.069> marked<00:02:09.369> up<00:02:09.580> three

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
lesion in it and I have marked up three

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.650 
lesion in it and I have marked up three
or<00:02:10.630> four<00:02:11.580> closed<00:02:12.580> polygons<00:02:14.130> Osirak<00:02:15.130> scan

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
or four closed polygons Osirak scan

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.390 
or four closed polygons Osirak scan
calculate<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.989> missing<00:02:17.290> polygons<00:02:17.770> for<00:02:18.250> that

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
calculate the missing polygons for that

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.610 
calculate the missing polygons for that
you<00:02:18.730> have<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:19.060> name<00:02:19.239> all<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:19.599> polygons<00:02:20.290> the

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
you have to name all the polygons the

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.020 
you have to name all the polygons the
same<00:02:20.890> name<00:02:21.189> which<00:02:21.730> is<00:02:21.909> done<00:02:22.120> by

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
same name which is done by

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.720 
same name which is done by
menu<00:02:23.860> roy<00:02:25.209> roy<00:02:26.209> renamed<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:27.340> just<00:02:28.340> say<00:02:28.490> all

menu roy roy renamed and just say all
rise<00:02:29.090> in<00:02:29.330> this<00:02:29.420> year's<00:02:29.720> they<00:02:29.930> give<00:02:30.140> it<00:02:30.260> a<00:02:30.470> name

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
rise in this year's they give it a name

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.670 
rise in this year's they give it a name
like<00:02:31.580> one<00:02:31.910> so<00:02:32.420> now<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.750> Roy's<00:02:33.080> have<00:02:33.319> to<00:02:33.470> name

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
like one so now the Roy's have to name

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.020 
like one so now the Roy's have to name
one<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:35.020> if<00:02:36.020> I've<00:02:36.410> done<00:02:36.680> so<00:02:36.950> I<00:02:37.100> can<00:02:37.190> go<00:02:37.490> to<00:02:37.550> Roy

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
one and if I've done so I can go to Roy

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.530 
one and if I've done so I can go to Roy
Roy<00:02:38.930> vol<00:02:39.760> generate<00:02:40.760> missing

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
Roy vol generate missing

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.990 
Roy vol generate missing
Roy's<00:02:43.239> so<00:02:44.239> oh<00:02:44.569> she<00:02:44.930> looks<00:02:45.260> now<00:02:45.470> has

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
Roy's so oh she looks now has

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.559 
Roy's so oh she looks now has
interpolated<00:02:47.000> in<00:02:48.250> all<00:02:49.250> slices<00:02:50.209> from<00:02:50.510> the

closed polygon see okay now we have one
polygon<00:04:59.760> we<00:05:00.030> go<00:05:00.150> down<00:05:00.360> a<00:05:00.389> little<00:05:00.630> bit<00:05:01.280> go<00:05:02.280> down

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
polygon we go down a little bit go down

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.960 
polygon we go down a little bit go down
a<00:05:02.460> little<00:05:02.610> bit

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
a little bit

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:09.830 
a little bit
draw<00:05:03.600> the<00:05:03.660> next<00:05:04.280> closed<00:05:05.280> roy<00:05:08.450> and<00:05:09.450> you<00:05:09.570> do<00:05:09.720> it

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
draw the next closed roy and you do it

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.550 
draw the next closed roy and you do it
three<00:05:10.470> four<00:05:10.800> times<00:05:10.830> and<00:05:11.900> important<00:05:12.900> is<00:05:13.020> we

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
three four times and important is we

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.240 
three four times and important is we
have<00:05:13.710> to<00:05:14.360> have<00:05:15.360> rows<00:05:15.780> at<00:05:16.110> the<00:05:16.139> first<00:05:16.860> and<00:05:17.160> the

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
have to have rows at the first and the

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.760 
have to have rows at the first and the
last<00:05:17.430> slice<00:05:18.090> where<00:05:18.720> we<00:05:18.810> see<00:05:19.020> the<00:05:19.200> lesion<00:05:19.590> of

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
last slice where we see the lesion of

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:30.770 
last slice where we see the lesion of
course

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:36.950 

so<00:05:33.470> if<00:05:34.470> you<00:05:34.680> have<00:05:34.770> done<00:05:34.980> it<00:05:35.300> we<00:05:36.300> have<00:05:36.390> to<00:05:36.510> rename

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
so if you have done it we have to rename

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.350 
so if you have done it we have to rename
the<00:05:37.650> Royce<00:05:37.890> because<00:05:38.400> the<00:05:38.520> Royce<00:05:38.670> now<00:05:38.940> have<00:05:39.180> no

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
the Royce because the Royce now have no

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.380 
the Royce because the Royce now have no
name<00:05:39.630> we<00:05:40.230> have<00:05:40.320> to<00:05:40.440> rename<00:05:40.800> them<00:05:41.010> Roy<00:05:41.940> rename
