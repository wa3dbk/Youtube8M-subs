00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
but I'm using this to support my golf

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.429 
but I'm using this to support my golf
clubs<00:01:01.410> because<00:01:02.539> when<00:01:03.539> painting<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.110> mud<00:01:04.290> is

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
clubs because when painting the mud is

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.500 
clubs because when painting the mud is
covered<00:01:04.890> if<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.309> if<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.580> paint<00:01:05.850> them<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.390> you

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
covered if you if you paint them and you

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.719 
covered if you if you paint them and you
put<00:01:06.659> them<00:01:06.840> down<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.159> paint<00:01:08.369> one<00:01:08.490> half

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
put them down is that you paint one half

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.340 
put them down is that you paint one half
put<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.060> down<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.479> leave<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.780> dry<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.080> then

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
put it down and leave it to dry and then

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.780 
put it down and leave it to dry and then
turn<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.799> over<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.010> do<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.220> other<00:01:11.280> side<00:01:11.430> you

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
turn it over and do the other side you

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.600 
turn it over and do the other side you
end<00:01:11.939> up<00:01:12.150> with<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.330> line<00:01:12.570> all<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.710> way<00:01:13.740> down<00:01:13.860> and

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
end up with a line all the way down and

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.640 
end up with a line all the way down and
I<00:01:15.560> didn't<00:01:16.560> really<00:01:16.860> like<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.530> wanted<00:01:19.530> to

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
I didn't really like it so I wanted to

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.210 
I didn't really like it so I wanted to
minimize<00:01:20.420> that<00:01:21.420> but<00:01:22.020> also<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.439> try<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.799> speed

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
minimize that but also to try and speed

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.399 
minimize that but also to try and speed
up<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.460> process<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.090> actually<00:01:24.630> painting<00:01:25.290> it

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
up the process of actually painting it

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.679 
up the process of actually painting it
so<00:01:25.740> we're<00:01:26.580> going<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.880> do<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.240> can<00:01:27.360> actually

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
so we're going to do is you can actually

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.060 
so we're going to do is you can actually
paint<00:01:27.960> all<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.409> this<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.829> then<00:01:28.920> we're<00:01:29.040> going

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
paint all of this and then we're going

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.130 
paint all of this and then we're going
to<00:01:29.280> rest<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.820> on<00:01:30.530> to<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:32.270> actual<00:01:33.270> dowel<00:01:33.840> and

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
to rest it on to the actual dowel and

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.080 
to rest it on to the actual dowel and
which<00:01:34.320> means<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.950> you've<00:01:35.040> only<00:01:35.280> got<00:01:35.670> this

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
which means that you've only got this

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.289 
which means that you've only got this
edge<00:01:36.390> there<00:01:37.100> is<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.310> only<00:01:38.549> bit<00:01:38.939> that's<00:01:39.119> going

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
edge there is the only bit that's going

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.200 
edge there is the only bit that's going
to<00:01:39.390> get<00:01:39.540> any<00:01:39.720> slight<00:01:40.670> marking<00:01:41.670> while<00:01:41.970> you're

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
to get any slight marking while you're

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.240 
to get any slight marking while you're
actually<00:01:42.360> from<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.049> actual<00:01:43.409> paint<00:01:43.680> work<00:01:43.890> as

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.480 
actually from the actual paint work as

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
its drying in black said you need time

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.520 
its drying in black said you need time

start off in this part here where you've

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:11.330 
start off in this part here where you've
got<00:04:05.609> your<00:04:05.730> join<00:04:06.919> and<00:04:07.919> come<00:04:08.099> around<00:04:08.430> and<00:04:10.340> I'm

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
got your join and come around and I'm

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.339 
got your join and come around and I'm
just<00:04:11.519> dipping<00:04:11.699> into<00:04:11.970> my<00:04:12.090> ledger<00:04:12.389> small<00:04:12.959> amount

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
just dipping into my ledger small amount

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.810 
just dipping into my ledger small amount
onto<00:04:13.560> the<00:04:13.799> brush<00:04:13.979> each<00:04:14.190> time<00:04:16.609> we'll<00:04:17.609> come

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
onto the brush each time we'll come

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.550 
onto the brush each time we'll come
around

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:30.710 

and<00:04:22.560> I<00:04:24.830> know<00:04:25.830> it<00:04:26.070> looks<00:04:26.100> dreadful<00:04:27.950> but<00:04:29.720> let's

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
and I know it looks dreadful but let's

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.210 
and I know it looks dreadful but let's
like<00:04:30.900> the<00:04:31.050> golf<00:04:31.230> bag<00:04:31.410> it<00:04:31.710> doesn't<00:04:31.950> even<00:04:32.070> look

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
like the golf bag it doesn't even look

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.860 
like the golf bag it doesn't even look
anything<00:04:32.580> like<00:04:32.700> a<00:04:32.880> golf<00:04:33.180> bag<00:04:33.360> at<00:04:33.540> this<00:04:33.630> moment

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
anything like a golf bag at this moment

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.500 
anything like a golf bag at this moment
in<00:04:34.139> time<00:04:34.320> so<00:04:34.620> just<00:04:35.400> don't<00:04:35.580> worry<00:04:35.850> about<00:04:35.880> it

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
in time so just don't worry about it

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.250 
in time so just don't worry about it
you're<00:04:37.139> just<00:04:37.290> going<00:04:37.410> to<00:04:37.440> paint<00:04:37.650> this<00:04:37.830> on<00:04:39.260> you

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
you're just going to paint this on you

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.510 
you're just going to paint this on you
know<00:04:40.320> to<00:04:40.410> try<00:04:40.620> and<00:04:40.830> come<00:04:41.010> up<00:04:41.040> and<00:04:41.160> leave

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
know to try and come up and leave

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.129 
know to try and come up and leave
yourself<00:04:41.730> roughly<00:04:42.360> the<00:04:42.480> same<00:04:42.660> amount<00:04:42.720> of

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
yourself roughly the same amount of

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:44.930 
yourself roughly the same amount of
space<00:04:43.470> at<00:04:43.650> the<00:04:43.740> top<00:04:44.010> because<00:04:44.340> the<00:04:44.370> top<00:04:44.430> bit<00:04:44.820> is

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
space at the top because the top bit is

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.010 
space at the top because the top bit is
where<00:04:45.120> you're<00:04:45.210> going<00:04:45.300> to<00:04:45.360> paint<00:04:45.570> it<00:04:45.750> black

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
where you're going to paint it black

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.080 
where you're going to paint it black
later<00:04:46.590> on<00:04:47.180> but<00:04:49.070> you<00:04:50.070> could<00:04:50.340> end<00:04:50.550> up<00:04:50.669> having<00:04:50.760> to

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
later on but you could end up having to

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:57.110 
later on but you could end up having to
put<00:04:51.270> three<00:04:51.630> coats<00:04:51.960> of<00:04:52.380> the<00:04:53.310> silver<00:04:53.700> on<00:04:54.620> so<00:04:56.120> but

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
put three coats of the silver on so but

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.800 
put three coats of the silver on so but
if<00:04:57.270> you<00:04:57.389> do<00:04:57.600> quite<00:04:58.080> a<00:04:58.139> good<00:04:59.300> finish<00:05:00.300> like<00:05:00.540> this

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
if you do quite a good finish like this

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.960 
if you do quite a good finish like this
then<00:05:01.260> hopefully<00:05:01.830> just<00:05:02.160> two<00:05:02.430> is<00:05:02.580> going<00:05:02.790> to<00:05:02.880> be

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
then hopefully just two is going to be

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.280 
then hopefully just two is going to be
enough<00:05:03.150> but<00:05:03.360> like<00:05:03.570> I<00:05:03.600> said<00:05:03.780> you<00:05:03.960> can<00:05:04.110> see

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
enough but like I said you can see

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.320 
enough but like I said you can see
through<00:05:04.530> it<00:05:04.560> it's<00:05:04.800> patchy<00:05:05.010> you've<00:05:06.000> got<00:05:06.180> to

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
through it it's patchy you've got to

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.560 
through it it's patchy you've got to
remember<00:05:06.570> that<00:05:07.130> this<00:05:08.130> joining<00:05:08.850> area<00:05:09.270> there

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
remember that this joining area there

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:17.270 
remember that this joining area there
there's<00:05:10.229> quite<00:05:10.560> a<00:05:10.590> lot<00:05:11.130> of<00:05:11.490> the<00:05:14.090> of<00:05:15.090> the<00:05:16.280> food

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
there's quite a lot of the of the food

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.770 
there's quite a lot of the of the food
coloring<00:05:17.520> that's<00:05:17.790> actually<00:05:18.120> gone<00:05:18.300> into<00:05:18.600> there

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
coloring that's actually gone into there

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.719 
coloring that's actually gone into there
so<00:05:19.020> it's<00:05:19.200> if<00:05:19.440> the<00:05:19.710> moisture<00:05:20.220> is<00:05:20.280> gone<00:05:20.400> in<00:05:20.580> it

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
so it's if the moisture is gone in it

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:23.690 
so it's if the moisture is gone in it
which<00:05:20.910> is<00:05:21.030> actually<00:05:21.360> going<00:05:21.510> to<00:05:21.630> risk<00:05:22.700> making

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
which is actually going to risk making

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.790 
which is actually going to risk making
the<00:05:24.390> ends<00:05:25.260> of<00:05:25.380> you<00:05:25.500> golf<00:05:25.860> clubs<00:05:26.250> come<00:05:26.700> away<00:05:26.820> so

the ends of you golf clubs come away so

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.890 
the ends of you golf clubs come away so
you've<00:05:28.800> got<00:05:28.950> to<00:05:29.070> try<00:05:29.190> and<00:05:29.280> work<00:05:29.610> quite<00:05:29.910> quite

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
you've got to try and work quite quite

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.779 
you've got to try and work quite quite
quickly<00:05:31.169> and<00:05:33.830> put<00:05:34.830> them<00:05:34.979> into<00:05:35.100> place<00:05:35.430> and<00:05:35.640> then

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:35.789 
quickly and put them into place and then

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:37.700 
quickly and put them into place and then
these<00:05:36.000> need<00:05:36.270> to<00:05:36.300> be<00:05:36.390> left<00:05:36.690> again<00:05:36.990> but<00:05:37.470> leave
