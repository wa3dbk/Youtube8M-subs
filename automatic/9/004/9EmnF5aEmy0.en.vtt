weekend but I think collectively as a
group<00:04:30.360> we're<00:04:30.840> a<00:04:30.870> very<00:04:31.139> odd<00:04:31.380> mix<00:04:31.800> of<00:04:32.039> people

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
group we're a very odd mix of people

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.629 
group we're a very odd mix of people
that<00:04:32.610> have<00:04:33.110> fought<00:04:34.110> in<00:04:34.320> combat<00:04:34.860> but<00:04:35.190> basically

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
that have fought in combat but basically

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.659 
that have fought in combat but basically

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
mix but it works
