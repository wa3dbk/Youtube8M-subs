00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.990
 hello to all then this is a video 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:10.200
 specifically addressed to 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.809
 beauty counselor the real is there 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.240
 as you can see from the title vi 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.330
 I will explain how to introduce you to customers 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.130
 this video is not all my own 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.650
 lot was suggested to me by mine 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.750
 leader sabrina ambrogini that health 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.730
 that I thank so much for the help that 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.210
 always gives me all the information that 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.470
 he gave me 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.149
 therefore, to be able to shoot this video there 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.520
 I will explain a little how to introduce you to the 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.360
 customers how to give a good one 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.629
 impression 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.750
 then go first and go well 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.170
 dressed and made up that is, don't go in 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.690
 coveralls disheveled with puffy eyes from 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.860
 a barely awake because anyway not 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.800
 don't give a good impression 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:59.270
 if you go with a sad face 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.350
 in the end maybe buy more out of pity 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.239
 rather than because interested in 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.129
 products so maybe buy them for 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.290
 make you a pleasure and then you don't see yourself 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.150
 buy more then a customer lost to 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.189
 end if you go anyway maybe always 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.020
 asking her to order because otherwise 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:21.000
 do not reach the minimum order 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.070
 however found to be heavy or stressful 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.170
 because it is a person feels almost in 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.330
 I must do this favor and maybe 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.549
 however you have not intrigued her 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.000
 buy so much to make you a pleasure 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:37.710
 so as in the previous case, yes 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.560
 buy more instead if you introduce yourself 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.780
 however well dressed well made up not 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.189
 it means to be dressed and made up like 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.060
 if it should go to a great race 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.549
 there is simply a bit of makeup 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.610
 dress neat and clean and above all 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:57.500
 a beautiful smile will surely help you 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.119
 in your intent because anyway 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.070
 these people our customers 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.670
 unconsciously they will trust us 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.560
 because anyway we must be the ones 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.349
 first promoters of the products that media 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.420
 one of rehab use them on the same ones if we 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.970
 we come a product that we do not know e 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.040
 that we don't use what sense it has 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.520
 the customers maybe then make us some 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.560
 questions 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.790
 we do n't even know how to answer or 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.410
 maybe we introduce ourselves to a client 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.150
 wearing a perfume, for example, is not 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.269
 I know I had done the review on 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.040
 csir purple soils wear this scent 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.319
 maybe the customer asks you what hand 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.819
 It smells good but then the scent is 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.420
 I say look at is one that is here on 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:41.310
 catalog and we talk about the product e 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.940
 who knows if you don't buy it the same thing 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.769
 applies to in make-up for any 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.129
 in other words, what we can 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:54.540
 present himself on our skin 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:57.030
 and then another very important thing about 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.650
 always be sincere if you ask us 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.099
 our personal opinion on a 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.810
 product if we consider the product 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.670
 it is not particularly good is not that 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.230
 we have to sell it by force we search 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.830
 maybe to focus more on 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:15.150
 products that we consider more valid because 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:18.390
 however if we promote a product that 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.790
 of which we are not convinced the customer 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.800
 anyway he will notice it maybe 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.510
 loses a little confidence in ours 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.290
 comparisons 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.299
 I took the clothes and another one 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.730
 very important thing 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.799
 when you bring the catalog to the customer 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.690
 maybe bring if you have any 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.959
 the occasion always two or three products from 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.810
 let her find out how she tells me 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.060
 sabrina is a product seen is half 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.150
 sold therefore 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.910
 I always tend however it goes well beyond the 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.530
 made use of products 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.510
 reuse i from a to z own 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.520
 from the bubble bath shuffle to tricks 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.160
 there is however some use all the 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.959
 book share products is always good 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.730
 still have some products at home 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.860
 to find the clients that can 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.459
 be a hand cream the face cream a 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.200
 perfume because they can touch anyway 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.620
 with hand being however produced on 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.569
 catalog maybe and they don't realize 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.549
 good of colors do not realize 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:20.760
 of fragrance is always better 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:23.340
 however, seeing something is something else 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.120
 always very important to leave i 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.030
 samples 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:30.270
 I personally have always given gods 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.860
 samples whatever the amount 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.150
 order they gave me when I was 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.280
 the order arrives I always leave gods 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.550
 new samples to try 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.889
 because always always a good 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.930
 try them and against new products 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:49.350
 then maybe he likes a cream 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:51.330
 buy it if I do n't know how to stay 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.430
 you are without catalogs or are not there 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.890
 arrived contact the parent company 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.900
 she is there for any problem 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.840
 just any problem 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.850
 any doubt you have about the products 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.860

 to help you especially sabrina that 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.780
 the one with more experience than me 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.450

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.970

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:21.660

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.610
 I have always done looks like a customer of fa 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.669
 an order a little higher than usual 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.740
 make them 1 May is not what you owe 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:32.100
 spend who knows how much pocket money 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:36.389
 yours may be a balm 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:38.250
 lips or a mini shower gel you decide 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:40.530
 then you or a gadget sometimes 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.810
 however in the catalog there are among us 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.729
 gadgets for example not only i 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.289

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:48.630

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:50.880
 customers is something that the 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.070
 makes you want to buy again e 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.230
 anyway 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:57.220
 is satisfactory when you receive a 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:06:00.290
 a free gift anyway 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:03.560

 on the contrary, thank her because I have 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:14.270
