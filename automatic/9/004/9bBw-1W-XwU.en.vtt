we also focused on the makeup of the ski
the<00:01:49.470> makeup<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:49.979> materials<00:01:50.459> that<00:01:50.520> we're

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
the makeup of the materials that we're

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.339 
the makeup of the materials that we're
using<00:01:50.819> to<00:01:51.030> make<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.209> much<00:01:51.479> better<00:01:51.690> balance

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:52.349 
using to make a much better balance

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:54.139 
using to make a much better balance
we<00:01:52.709> took<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.130> Polonia<00:01:53.640> wood<00:01:53.880> core

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
we took the Polonia wood core

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.270 
we took the Polonia wood core
lightweight<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.929> really<00:01:55.530> focused<00:01:56.130> on

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
lightweight and really focused on

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.100 
lightweight and really focused on
balancing<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:57.000> tip<00:01:57.179> and<00:01:57.330> tail<00:01:57.390> flex<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:57.990> that

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
balancing the tip and tail flex so that

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.809
