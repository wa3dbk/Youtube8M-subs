 the rest of the chocolate will stop you 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.890

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.899
 I have connected all the ingredients 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.820

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.470
 Going on this will be a blob each time 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.120

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.850
 What's best with a syringe bag 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.140
