00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
just going to pick single column then if

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.110 
just going to pick single column then if
you<00:00:33.000> go<00:00:33.120> ahead<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.420> take<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.750> click<00:00:34.320> into<00:00:34.829> your

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
you go ahead and take a click into your

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.580 
you go ahead and take a click into your
canvas<00:00:36.120> here<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.989> will<00:00:37.290> select<00:00:37.710> one<00:00:38.129> single

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
canvas here it will select one single

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.900 
canvas here it will select one single
column<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.770> pixels<00:00:41.579> it's<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.940> 1<00:00:42.920> 1<00:00:43.920> pixel<00:00:44.430> wide

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
column of pixels it's a 1 1 pixel wide

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.740 
column of pixels it's a 1 1 pixel wide
so<00:00:45.210> it's<00:00:45.360> just<00:00:45.570> selecting<00:00:46.110> one<00:00:46.350> row<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.680> pixels

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
so it's just selecting one row of pixels

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.319 
so it's just selecting one row of pixels
so<00:00:48.750> what<00:00:49.230> can<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:49.829> be<00:00:49.890> used<00:00:50.399> for<00:00:50.670> why<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.000> this

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
so what can this be used for why is this

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.540 
so what can this be used for why is this
any<00:00:51.600> good<00:00:51.719> well<00:00:52.590> one<00:00:52.829> thing<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.039> it's<00:00:53.340> good

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
any good well one thing that it's good

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.209 
any good well one thing that it's good

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
pixels and you're going to use that for

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.719 
pixels and you're going to use that for
a<00:01:06.689> video<00:01:06.960> game<00:01:07.170> or<00:01:07.200> something<00:01:07.619> like<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.740> then

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
really bright so maybe I'll go with this

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.080

whichever<00:01:45.509> works<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.259> your<00:01:46.350> picture<00:01:47.299> now<00:01:48.299> when

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
whichever works in your picture now when

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.719 
whichever works in your picture now when
you<00:01:48.720> have<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.470> selection<00:01:49.979> if<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.970> press<00:01:51.479> o<00:01:52.729> and

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
you have a selection if you press o and

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.690 
you have a selection if you press o and
then<00:01:54.509> backspace<00:01:55.409> on<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.770> PC

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
then backspace on the PC

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.530 
then backspace on the PC
it'll<00:01:57.180> fill<00:01:57.600> in<00:01:57.960> your<00:01:58.170> selection<00:01:59.299> with<00:02:00.299> that

color so now if I go to I should have

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.420 
color so now if I go to I should have
done<00:02:04.409> this<00:02:04.530> on<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.710> different<00:02:04.979> layer<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:05.340> I'm

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
done this on a different layer so I'm

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.639 
done this on a different layer so I'm
going<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.869> undo<00:02:06.869> I'm<00:02:07.140> going<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.380> step

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
going to undo I'm going to step

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.710 
going to undo I'm going to step
backwards<00:02:08.099> so<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.910> fill<00:02:09.119> isn't<00:02:09.569> there

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
backwards so the fill isn't there

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.969 
backwards so the fill isn't there
anymore<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.200> I'm<00:02:10.319> going<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.500> create<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.830> new

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
anymore and I'm going to create a new

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.680 
anymore and I'm going to create a new
layer

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
layer

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.230 
layer
and<00:02:11.780> do<00:02:12.410> this<00:02:12.590> on<00:02:12.830> a<00:02:12.860> new<00:02:13.040> layer<00:02:13.280> so<00:02:13.340> click<00:02:14.090> on

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
and do this on a new layer so click on

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.480 
and do this on a new layer so click on
this<00:02:14.420> paper<00:02:15.200> down<00:02:15.710> here<00:02:15.920> right<00:02:16.070> next<00:02:16.220> to<00:02:16.370> the

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
this paper down here right next to the

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.940 
this paper down here right next to the
trash<00:02:16.700> can<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:17.440> it<00:02:18.440> will<00:02:18.470> create<00:02:18.680> a<00:02:18.800> new<00:02:18.920> layer

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
trash can and it will create a new layer

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.470 
trash can and it will create a new layer
for<00:02:19.310> you<00:02:19.400> and<00:02:19.640> now<00:02:19.760> we're<00:02:20.060> going<00:02:20.210> to<00:02:20.270> create

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
for you and now we're going to create

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.740 
for you and now we're going to create
our<00:02:20.540> guide<00:02:20.810> on<00:02:21.020> this<00:02:21.170> new<00:02:21.500> layer<00:02:21.730> so<00:02:22.730> now<00:02:23.360> I<00:02:23.390> can

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
our guide on this new layer so now I can

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.510 
our guide on this new layer so now I can
hit<00:02:23.900> alt<00:02:24.200> backspace<00:02:24.710> and<00:02:26.620> now<00:02:27.620> I<00:02:27.650> can<00:02:28.160> go<00:02:28.490> to

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
hit alt backspace and now I can go to

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.850 
hit alt backspace and now I can go to
select<00:02:28.970> deselect<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:29.990> then<00:02:30.020> you<00:02:30.380> can<00:02:30.560> see

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
select deselect and then you can see

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.630 
select deselect and then you can see
that<00:02:31.190> there<00:02:31.460> is<00:02:31.490> a<00:02:31.670> line<00:02:32.120> there<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:33.490> you<00:02:34.490> can

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
that there is a line there and you can

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.960 
that there is a line there and you can
see<00:02:34.820> that<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.120> guide<00:02:35.330> is<00:02:35.540> right<00:02:35.960> there<00:02:36.970> now

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
see that the guide is right there now

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.570 
see that the guide is right there now
all<00:02:38.660> we<00:02:38.870> need<00:02:39.020> to<00:02:39.050> do<00:02:39.320> is<00:02:39.620> just<00:02:40.360> transform<00:02:41.360> this

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
all we need to do is just transform this

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.370 
all we need to do is just transform this
going<00:02:43.580> to<00:02:43.700> edit<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:44.390> then<00:02:44.420> let's<00:02:45.230> go<00:02:45.320> to

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
going to edit and then let's go to

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.790 
going to edit and then let's go to
transform<00:02:45.980> and<00:02:46.310> we'll<00:02:46.430> go<00:02:46.550> to<00:02:46.610> rotate<00:02:47.090> and

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
transform and we'll go to rotate and

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.160 
transform and we'll go to rotate and
right<00:02:48.800> here<00:02:49.010> on<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.250> rotate<00:02:49.640> is<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:50.210> angle<00:02:50.600> so

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
right here on the rotate is the angle so

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.190 
right here on the rotate is the angle so
then<00:02:51.560> you<00:02:51.710> can<00:02:51.890> change<00:02:52.280> it<00:02:52.430> to<00:02:52.460> say<00:02:52.910> like<00:02:53.240> a<00:02:53.510> 45

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
then you can change it to say like a 45

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.150 
then you can change it to say like a 45
degree<00:02:54.380> angle<00:02:54.560> if<00:02:54.950> you<00:02:55.040> would<00:02:55.160> like<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:57.160> there

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
degree angle if you would like and there

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.570 
degree angle if you would like and there
you<00:02:58.250> go

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
you go

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.970 
you go
now<00:02:58.790> you<00:02:58.850> have<00:02:59.120> your<00:02:59.330> guide<00:02:59.780> at<00:03:00.110> 45<00:03:00.620> degrees

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
now you have your guide at 45 degrees

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.680 
now you have your guide at 45 degrees
and<00:03:01.840> since<00:03:02.840> we<00:03:03.080> put<00:03:03.620> this<00:03:03.770> on<00:03:04.670> a<00:03:04.730> separate

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
and since we put this on a separate

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.770 
and since we put this on a separate
layer<00:03:05.930> I'm<00:03:06.410> able<00:03:06.740> to<00:03:06.980> move<00:03:07.190> it<00:03:07.340> around<00:03:07.480> as<00:03:08.480> I

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
layer I'm able to move it around as I

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.070 
layer I'm able to move it around as I
please<00:03:09.580> so<00:03:10.580> you<00:03:10.610> can<00:03:10.880> see<00:03:11.090> that<00:03:11.300> this<00:03:11.510> light

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
please so you can see that this light

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.710 
please so you can see that this light
blue<00:03:12.290> kind<00:03:13.160> of<00:03:13.280> has<00:03:13.400> a<00:03:13.430> hard<00:03:13.760> time<00:03:13.820> in<00:03:14.330> the

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
blue kind of has a hard time in the

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.510 
blue kind of has a hard time in the
inside<00:03:15.200> of<00:03:15.440> this<00:03:15.850> really<00:03:17.860> bright<00:03:18.860> background

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
inside of this really bright background

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.699 
inside of this really bright background
so<00:03:19.820> you<00:03:20.000> might<00:03:20.480> want<00:03:20.690> to<00:03:20.780> change<00:03:21.050> the<00:03:21.170> color<00:03:21.380> up

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
so you might want to change the color up

for you on how just one way on how to

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.540 
for you on how just one way on how to
use<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:31.430> marquee<00:03:32.239> tools<00:03:32.739> so<00:03:33.739> the<00:03:33.950> single<00:03:34.310> row

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
use the marquee tools so the single row

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.580 
use the marquee tools so the single row
if<00:03:35.030> you<00:03:35.150> just<00:03:35.330> click<00:03:35.540> it<00:03:35.720> just<00:03:35.750> does<00:03:36.080> one

across like this so you can make the

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.460 
across like this so you can make the
guides<00:03:39.739> either<00:03:40.070> way<00:03:40.310> with<00:03:40.550> either<00:03:40.730> of<00:03:40.940> these
