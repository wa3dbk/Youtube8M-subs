00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:07.780
 Hey, just like here is another video 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:11.140
 of the garden plan and go 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:13.140
 teaching how to play without which the 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.990
 Minecraft 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.760
 Well the first thing you are going to do is go 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.660
 to the control panel after going to 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.550
 control panel go to java go down 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.020
 then they go to java they give in to see 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.990
 you are not going to look like anything here 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:31.050
 as they read me double click they are going to go to 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.720
 place that hairline or see how 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:39.180
 I want to say x uppercase x lower case 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:41.610
 tiny x again in mma good 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.250
 it depends on your computer's swing 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:49.000
 how many gigabytes do you have how many girls 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:52.920
 they like how many gigas they love 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.070
 then you are vain 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.710
 in terms of level they love forgiveness 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.710
 well then my computer has 2 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.830
 gigas of ram how many a few a 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.140
 giga a gig is a thousand megabytes 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.540
 so if they are two gigas they are two thousand 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.410
 megas 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:16.670

 survival plus world options 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.950
 because by default 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.310
 let's see is already creating our 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.160
 world loaded with the world 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.060
 ground and let's wait for it to go 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.060
 loading everything 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.280
 let's wait for it to load 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.330

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.739
 never takes a wait so data does not 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.320
 God made within 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.480

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:10.540
 Well, it's not average, because I'm 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.260
 recording but the reality is that he is 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:17.239
 he is 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.239

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.210
 the nobel of those bloggers good as 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.210

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:35.290
 good for those who arrive because I'm 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.290
 recording but it's not because 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:43.249
 but it's not why 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:43.249

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.980
 It was good before, so it was for now 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.660

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.660

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.320
 good 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:06.070
 we already know that it is loading my world and 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:08.740
 Well that's how it is after fixing everything or 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:12.640
 be after not placing that but 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:15.160

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.480
