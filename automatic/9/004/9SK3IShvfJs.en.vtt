00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello everyone this is because 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.600
 for video test.com today I'm testing 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.150
 professional jumbo home SITAC 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.400
 nutrition a well known gamer who enjoys 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.700
 a pretty good reputation 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.700
 here we go 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.490
 so here we have a pot of 1 kg 260 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:26.140
 chocolate taste 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.779
 we can also find taste 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.860
 raspberry chocolate and banana skin 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:34.960
 1 kg of 160 so and 3 kg 240 at the level 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.180
 commercial arguments so on the 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.489
 bridge can see that citec puts forward 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.220
 that there are 52 grams of protein from 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:46.600
 quality in a dose of 162 grams of 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:49.269
 django enriched with jumbo a matrix of 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.210
 different complex ingredients of 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:54.010
 6 carb carbs including flour 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.299
 oats you can Latin to fast 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:00.280
 slang if creatine form and it would 

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:03.460
 specially designed for morphologies 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.830
 athletic and in tips for use 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.619
 we are therefore advised a full dose 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.970
 that is 162 grams per day in 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.070
 four hundred thousand liquid lives 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.840
 so be consumed little by little while at 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.090
 long day be taken to 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.600
 training schedules before during and 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.840
 afterwards so at the level of composition 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:28.270
 for 100 g of jumbo we find 3.7 g of 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:31.479
 lipids 52 5 grams of carbohydrates and 32.1 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.880
 g of protein at the ingredient level 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:37.240
 so the protein is a concentrate of 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.770
 white ra filter then we find 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.819
 ingredients the group is in the form of 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.159
 matrix so there is the 6 carb matrix so 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:46.630
 for carbohydrates with dextrose from 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.319
 platinum with oatmeal 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.389
 maltodextrin fructose evit ar go on 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:55.569
 then found under all of a 

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:59.319
 matrix jumbo matrix created composed 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:02.590
 of six creatine a jumbo matrix to 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:05.679
 millau select amino acid compound 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.979
 bca express a matrix m to caregivers 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:12.010
 precursors of ena is a matrix 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.130
 micro nutrium compound complex support 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.470
 a magnesium and vitamin c is finally in 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.390
 end of the list the bio perrine that is 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.130
 supposed to help digestion of 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.220
 nutrients 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.780
 so I of course not have fun to describe 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.770
 one by one all the ingredients that 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.050
 up 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:33.100
 this guÃ©naire so in the video will last 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.750
 hours so I'm going to summarize the 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.930
 main points so here we are on a 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.310
 32% protein content which 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.480
 place on average high compared to 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:46.960
 reassures frequently encountered the source 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.970
 is unique it's a concentrate us and he 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:53.050
 is specified concentrated we are ultra 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.910
 filtered I send you back to the Arctic 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.490
 where there is a link to a daiki article 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.460
 in the latest issue of bodybuilding 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:04.270
 rules then the carbohydrates we 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:07.210
 found up to 52% so composed 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:10.630
 of six carbohydrate carbohydrates hadjeba 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:13.360
 like for example oatmeal and 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.670
 palatines aux and carbohydrates hadj is 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.040
 high as maltodextrin still 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.780
 levitt argo then we find the 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.870
 matrix crabs so have composed of six 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:27.490
 creatine as a reminder apart from creatine 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:29.680
 monohydrate the other creatine does 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.620
 only have business arguments 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.050
 to defend their reputation 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:38.260
 then we find the matrix of 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.110
 so amino acids that amino acid 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.000
 whose proportions are not known 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.430
 and at the end of the list the bca in a 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.340
 negligible amount 1 g for one dose 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.280
 of 162 grams and precursors of 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.350
 hainaut with especially arginine for 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.600
 our advice of use so we see 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.690
 that if we take a 2 162 grams of 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.860
 jumbo pro it will make a contribution 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.510
 additional calorie of 673 calories 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.410
 usually when we want to make a 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.820
 mass intake quite clean we advise 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:14.260
 often increase by approximately 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:16.720
 250 to 300 calories in this case for 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.480
 about 300 calories one can take a 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.549
 dose of 80 g of jumbo 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:24.250
 so that can be a problem because we 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.020
 divide the our daily dose by 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.550
 two we see that there is a lot 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.990
 of ingredients some of which are already 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.560
 under dosed with a dose of sense 262 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.169
 that a pardon 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.060
 so if we divide by two that makes 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:40.229
 a lot of ingredients that are 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.490
 under dosed and therefore by the same to 6000 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:46.300
 for the missile test it and I 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:48.310
 prepared a dose of 40 g so with the 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:54.460
 pod that is provided and about 200 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:05:01.120
 thousand liters of water we can see that there is 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:03.930
 not foam at all that the product is 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.930
 pretty well diluted 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:12.779
 here 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.300
 so conclude in strong point one can 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.389
 point out the carbohydrate protein ratio 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.180
 which above average compared 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:28.330
 to the majority of other gainers the 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:31.090
 visibility that is good and the dose 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.830
 low enough lipids we could have 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.629
 also talk about the presence of carbohydrates 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.849
 with giba but we do not know exactly 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:41.080
 in what proportion they are present 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:42.580
 compared to carbohydrates alg high in 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.659
 weak point we find a lot 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:49.300
 unnecessary ingredients or under dosing the 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:51.039
 presence of carbohydrates with geo favorable to 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.599
 a fat intake and little 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:55.090
 information on the proportions of 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:58.030
 some ingredients with regards 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.409
 my in my opinion perso so me what 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.000
 I'm mainly looking for a gainers 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:03.069
 they bring me calories 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.870
 additional easy to manage 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:07.060
 in the form of proteins and carbohydrates 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.150
 we see we have a list 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.259
 long enough ingredients 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.310
 personally I prefer products 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:14.529
 simple 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:17.590
 there we see the presence of creatine from 

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:19.479
 hainaut booster of amino acids that 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.940
 are not for me not justified in a 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:24.279
 gamer he still keeps the advantage 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.490
 to have carbohydrate protein ratio at 

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:29.020
 above average and it is not 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.610
 exclusively composed of carbohydrates alger 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.440
 to like for example some winner 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:35.770
 that we can find with only 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.330
 maltodextrin with regard to 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.659
 the missibility go pretty good we got it 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:43.690
 seen the chocolate taste is quite sweet but 

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:45.849
 remains pleasant with regard to 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:47.229
 the use I decided on as soon as 

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:49.000
 early not to apply the doses 

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:49.930
 advised by the brand and I am 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.460
 am kept at a daily dose 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.770
 about 80 g 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.750
 it allowed me to easily complete 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.379
 my caloric intake are however 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.379
 make fat
