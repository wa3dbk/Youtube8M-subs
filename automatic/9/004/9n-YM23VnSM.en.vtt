00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.149
 in another video 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.020
 first I will give everything of me so that it 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.020
 have fun in this video 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.289
 let's start the science goals in 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.199
 as to the top of your group or 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:30.169
 be all direct 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:32.300
 on the following a white color 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.399
 basic basic basic is useful for 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.970
 summer winter to that I wanted to say 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:40.040
 in fact the basics of your classes depend 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.720
 much of the lifestyle you have and 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.790
 you an hour a basic of micros 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.339
 it's super super basic that I have to 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.670
 have gotten I'm college not 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:51.050
 I work and I dress super relaxed for 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.179
 the university and by then those 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.730
 things and right now we're pretty much in 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:57.739
 the cold weather then rights 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.239
 basic for when you work or for 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.670
 when it's summer they're going to change a 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.020
 little bit so saying that we're going to 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.650
 pursue 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:09.410
 again this thing is polito 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.820
 superimportant a basic bolus that 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.890
 it seems to me to dance man called 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.150
 for everything to get emailings for 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.150
 put it with votes for the occasion 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:28.200
 but with an element of this that says 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.960
 in French it means very pretty very 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.170
 beautiful 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.180
 that state because I wear it at school 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.960
 and you will love you until the 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.210
 baccalaureate in French but simple and 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.370
 unique so this is super important 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.430
 a town that struggles with anything 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.590
 of another very important item is the 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.119
 typical white blouse for example here is 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.369
 talking with a little bit of detail and 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.950
 also against light and is that I would say 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.110
 that is super important is the blouse to 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.390
 pictures can put you over the pole 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.610
 white that have a white polo 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.910
 bandages or put it under a coat 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.230
 I would overcome using it closed there are millions of 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.480
 ways to use these things 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.170
 in terms of things a little bit more 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.200
 sheltered the basic sweater of how the 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.720
 half woven half as well as this one is 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.180
 super essential for is because life 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.160
 super good and it serves as a 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.070
 anything 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.340
 and a house definitely has to 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:37.450
 have in your closet you do not know but I 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.250
 all the good of jean I do them and saying 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.740
 that opened me very well for putting 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.320
 under some house here much more 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.970
 thick to the poor on top of a tired 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.580
 with a hood or I do not know what could 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.220
 mine in all the ways of another 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.540
 blazer too important is the blazer 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.569
 black a black blazer 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.159
 last forever forever if it is 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.719
 that you buy it in good quality 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:02.579
 example of children and I bought it makes 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:05.489
 about four years and this seller 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:07.620
 inaugurated to this day and they have not 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.780
 shattered is perfect it's like 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.700
 to use it also for when I work 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.099
 I do not know in fact that you have to buy those 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.550
 garments as essential for floors in 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:20.140
 symbian giving a little more 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:23.690
 and then the last thing you have to have 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:28.730
 a lot is like a trench coat or a 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:31.700
 saco that fascinates me is a super critic 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.680
 super long good the 30 know 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.570
 brand new narrow like that a little 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.510
 different during a little thinner 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:42.230
 being that there were much more normal 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.680
 they did not rule since they do not have buttons and the 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.680
 of mango 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:52.430
 on the bottom part I the truth is 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.370
 which part of below I could say I started 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.550
 skirts with their hands or almost nothing else 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.830
 I started not winter or autumn 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.590
 still in winter autumn I'm jeans from 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.840
 top down and black pants yes my 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.850
 essential gin are this already the same as 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.780
 my son that is like a well clear good 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:14.440
 but scratch addict yes you have to 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:19.090
 have quality like a wave much more 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:22.710
 h the typical white jean this book is 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:27.940
 very high called me from above what 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:30.700
 very much for when you want 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:35.200
 super basic is this which is the color 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:37.690
 typical of jean manners is unique that 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.220
 combines with everything everything could use it 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.120
 I am with what I have put oriented to 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:46.190
 a white people with a scarf 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:49.610
 animal print and this project 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:52.400
 and there is another essential below is the 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.660
 black trousers a black pants is going to 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.880
 serve for exhibitions in the 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.880
 university for the champions for what 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:02.000
 so be that definitely pants 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.580
 essential black of our process and 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.560
 Now as for shoes shoes 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.690
 winter remember me definitely 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:13.130
 I would recommend you to have some boots 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:16.990
 super cute and practical blacks as they are 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.990
 This is where Carmen Steffens 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:24.689
 and the truth is that for all 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.899
 ballerinas depending on saying what 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:29.249
 have, for example, any basic 

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:31.770
 that I have my closet and also with 

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:34.369
 garments a little more striking where I 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.369
 touch 

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:40.259
 finally another basic super important 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:42.459
 They are white sneakers or slippers 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:44.169
 simply super comfortable but that the 

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:46.449
 you can use with a self-editing to super 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:48.909
 casual and chic at the same time and you 're 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:51.699
 definitely his perception in his 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:53.169
 crosses and in girls that matter of the 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:55.509
 clothes that I wanted to teach 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:58.089

00:05:55.509 --> 00:06:00.610

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:07.209
 video of how 15 minutes and we do not want 

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:08.829

00:06:07.209 --> 00:06:10.839

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:14.829
 for example one in saline and I'll go 

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:20.199
 advancing that the europe scarf something 

00:06:14.829 --> 00:06:25.259
