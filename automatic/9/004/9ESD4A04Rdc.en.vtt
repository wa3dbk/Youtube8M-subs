00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
doing here we have Optifine so I could

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.200 
doing here we have Optifine so I could
zoom<00:05:18.920> in<00:05:19.870> it's<00:05:20.870> pretty<00:05:21.080> cool<00:05:21.970> anyways<00:05:22.970> and

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
zoom in it's pretty cool anyways and

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.600 
zoom in it's pretty cool anyways and
yeah<00:05:23.930> you<00:05:24.710> would<00:05:24.830> know<00:05:24.860> something's<00:05:25.340> going<00:05:25.460> on

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.520 
yeah you would know something's going on
here<00:05:26.140> but<00:05:27.140> who<00:05:27.680> knows<00:05:27.920> it<00:05:28.400> might<00:05:29.260> it<00:05:30.260> might<00:05:30.380> be

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
here but who knows it might it might be

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:37.510 
here but who knows it might it might be
random<00:05:30.950> and<00:05:35.230> this<00:05:36.230> used<00:05:36.470> to<00:05:36.560> be<00:05:36.680> a<00:05:36.710> full<00:05:37.040> cave

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
random and this used to be a full cave

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.940 
random and this used to be a full cave
but<00:05:38.360> I'd<00:05:38.480> block<00:05:38.840> it<00:05:38.990> off<00:05:39.110> right<00:05:39.260> here<00:05:39.440> for<00:05:39.740> some

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
but I'd block it off right here for some

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:47.680 
but I'd block it off right here for some
redstone<00:05:40.160> I<00:05:40.870> think<00:05:41.870> yeah<00:05:44.530> anyways<00:05:46.660> yeah<00:05:47.660> I

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
redstone I think yeah anyways yeah I

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.990 
redstone I think yeah anyways yeah I
hope<00:05:48.080> this<00:05:48.290> video<00:05:48.560> gets<00:05:48.890> as<00:05:49.040> many<00:05:49.250> views<00:05:49.610> as<00:05:49.820> it

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
did the first time around it was up to

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.540 
did the first time around it was up to
like<00:05:52.280> 3000<00:05:53.120> man<00:05:54.050> like<00:05:54.260> if<00:05:55.010> I<00:05:55.160> would<00:05:55.340> have<00:05:55.430> made

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 
this a lot sooner again it would

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:01.000 
this a lot sooner again it would
probably<00:05:58.130> be<00:05:58.460> way<00:05:58.730> past<00:05:58.760> five<00:05:59.480> thousand<00:06:00.110> one

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.010 
probably be way past five thousand one

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.500 
probably be way past five thousand one
of<00:06:01.130> my<00:06:01.220> biggest<00:06:01.610> videos<00:06:02.830> so<00:06:03.830> I<00:06:04.300> hope<00:06:05.300> I<00:06:05.450> could
