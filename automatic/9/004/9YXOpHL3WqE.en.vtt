you<00:01:46.920> for<00:01:47.070> Keurig<00:01:47.369> machines<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.540> other<00:01:48.720> thing

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
you for Keurig machines the other thing

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.810 
you for Keurig machines the other thing
that<00:01:49.110> people<00:01:49.320> find<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:50.009> they<00:01:50.130> wonder<00:01:50.520> about

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
that people find that they wonder about

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.330 
that people find that they wonder about
is<00:01:51.119> how<00:01:51.930> much<00:01:52.170> are<00:01:52.500> they<00:01:52.590> going<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.890> increase

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
is how much are they going to increase

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.219 
is how much are they going to increase
their<00:01:53.640> environmental<00:01:54.119> footprint<00:01:54.750> on<00:01:54.990> the

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
their environmental footprint on the

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.929 
their environmental footprint on the
earth<00:01:55.350> when<00:01:56.130> they<00:01:56.250> begin<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.520> make<00:01:56.700> use<00:01:56.909> of

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
earth when they begin to make use of

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.910 
earth when they begin to make use of
single<00:01:57.420> serve<00:01:57.600> machines<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.439> reason<00:01:58.770> for

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
single serve machines and the reason for

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.490 
single serve machines and the reason for
that<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.700> similar<00:02:00.240> serve<00:02:00.570> machines<00:02:01.079> the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
that is that similar serve machines the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.530 
that is that similar serve machines the
coffee<00:02:01.740> for<00:02:02.130> them<00:02:02.280> comes<00:02:02.640> in<00:02:02.880> these<00:02:03.090> plastic

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
coffee for them comes in these plastic

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.230 
coffee for them comes in these plastic
pods<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.710> inside<00:02:05.369> with<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:05.640> pod<00:02:05.850> is<00:02:05.880> just

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
pods and inside with this pod is just

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.240 
pods and inside with this pod is just
some<00:02:06.360> coffee<00:02:06.600> in<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:07.020> little<00:02:07.259> filter<00:02:07.530> but

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
some coffee in a little filter but

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.480 
some coffee in a little filter but
you'll<00:02:08.369> notice<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.879> it's<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.270> lot

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
you'll notice that it's a lot

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.910 
you'll notice that it's a lot
plastic<00:02:10.030> and<00:02:10.270> these<00:02:10.600> are<00:02:10.750> not<00:02:10.930> recyclable<00:02:11.560> and

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
plastic and these are not recyclable and

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.920 
plastic and these are not recyclable and
so<00:02:12.760> there's<00:02:12.940> a<00:02:13.000> lot<00:02:13.150> of<00:02:13.270> waste<00:02:13.570> here

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
so there's a lot of waste here

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.340 
so there's a lot of waste here
potentially<00:02:14.530> so<00:02:15.660> even<00:02:16.660> though<00:02:16.780> you<00:02:16.840> get<00:02:17.110> the

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
potentially so even though you get the

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.290 
potentially so even though you get the
single-serve<00:02:17.980> convenience<00:02:18.700> you<00:02:19.150> know<00:02:19.240> you

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
single-serve convenience you know you

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.600 
single-serve convenience you know you
are<00:02:19.660> going<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:20.290> possibly<00:02:20.590> raise<00:02:21.340> your

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
are going to possibly raise your

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.150 
are going to possibly raise your
environmental<00:02:22.060> footprint<00:02:22.660> so<00:02:23.110> a<00:02:23.350> lot<00:02:24.130> of

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
environmental footprint so a lot of

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.950 
environmental footprint so a lot of
folks<00:02:24.370> want<00:02:24.610> to<00:02:24.730> be<00:02:24.790> green<00:02:25.090> and<00:02:25.420> making<00:02:25.780> use<00:02:25.930> of

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
folks want to be green and making use of

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.020 
folks want to be green and making use of
these<00:02:26.200> options<00:02:26.500> is<00:02:27.040> going<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:27.400> allow<00:02:27.730> you<00:02:27.790> to

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
these options is going to allow you to

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.800 
these options is going to allow you to
do<00:02:28.330> that

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
do that

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.720 
do that
so<00:02:29.560> what<00:02:29.890> I'm<00:02:29.980> going<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.190> talk<00:02:30.340> about<00:02:30.520> making

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
so what I'm going to talk about making

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.710 
so what I'm going to talk about making
use<00:02:31.060> of<00:02:31.090> today<00:02:31.900> is<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.620> perfect<00:02:32.920> pod<00:02:33.490> easy<00:02:34.090> Cup

use of today is the perfect pod easy Cup

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.410 
use of today is the perfect pod easy Cup
now<00:02:35.440> this<00:02:35.800> is<00:02:35.950> again<00:02:36.220> for<00:02:36.610> Keurig<00:02:37.030> coffee

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
now this is again for Keurig coffee

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.220 
now this is again for Keurig coffee
machines<00:02:38.050> and<00:02:38.490> this<00:02:39.490> is<00:02:39.880> a<00:02:40.090> very<00:02:40.510> cool<00:02:40.780> option

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
machines and this is a very cool option

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.040 
machines and this is a very cool option
some<00:02:41.950> folks<00:02:42.250> tell<00:02:42.700> me<00:02:42.820> sometimes<00:02:43.270> that<00:02:43.420> they

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
some folks tell me sometimes that they

some folks tell me sometimes that they
can<00:02:44.260> taste<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.680> difference<00:02:45.070> between<00:02:45.130> coffee

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
can taste the difference between coffee

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.570 
can taste the difference between coffee
that<00:02:45.970> has<00:02:46.090> been<00:02:46.270> brewed<00:02:46.690> over<00:02:47.590> a<00:02:47.800> wire<00:02:48.340> mesh

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
that has been brewed over a wire mesh

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.330 
that has been brewed over a wire mesh
filter<00:02:49.000> and<00:02:49.210> coffee<00:02:49.450> that<00:02:49.720> has<00:02:49.750> been<00:02:50.020> brewed

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
filter and coffee that has been brewed

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.450 
filter and coffee that has been brewed
using<00:02:51.340> a<00:02:51.820> paper<00:02:52.210> filter<00:02:52.690> and<00:02:52.900> so<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.830> easy<00:02:54.010> cup

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
using a paper filter and so the easy cup

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.370 
using a paper filter and so the easy cup
the<00:02:54.700> perfect<00:02:55.060> pod<00:02:55.210> easy<00:02:55.510> cup<00:02:55.750> actually<00:02:56.170> makes

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
the perfect pod easy cup actually makes

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.610 
the perfect pod easy cup actually makes
use<00:02:56.680> of<00:02:56.920> paper<00:02:57.790> filters<00:02:58.300> so<00:02:58.960> this<00:02:59.290> is<00:02:59.440> pretty

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
use of paper filters so this is pretty

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.180 
use of paper filters so this is pretty
cool

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
cool

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.760 
cool
because<00:03:01.120> it<00:03:01.330> does<00:03:01.540> give<00:03:01.780> you<00:03:01.900> that<00:03:01.930> option<00:03:02.380> for

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
because it does give you that option for

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
being able to brew coffee even closer to

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.230 
being able to brew coffee even closer to
your<00:03:05.320> traditional<00:03:05.800> drip<00:03:06.040> drip<00:03:06.580> machine<00:03:06.880> but

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
your traditional drip drip machine but

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.820 
your traditional drip drip machine but
being<00:03:07.570> able<00:03:07.660> to<00:03:07.810> get<00:03:07.990> the<00:03:08.140> ease<00:03:08.290> of<00:03:08.320> single

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
being able to get the ease of single

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.770 
being able to get the ease of single
serve<00:03:09.010> now<00:03:09.250> there's<00:03:09.850> a<00:03:09.910> little<00:03:10.240> more<00:03:10.420> setup

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
serve now there's a little more setup

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.160 
serve now there's a little more setup
using<00:03:11.560> an<00:03:11.710> option<00:03:12.160> like<00:03:12.520> the<00:03:12.940> EZ<00:03:13.150> cup<00:03:13.630> because

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
using an option like the EZ cup because

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.290 
using an option like the EZ cup because
you<00:03:14.710> are<00:03:14.890> going<00:03:15.160> to<00:03:15.280> have<00:03:15.640> to<00:03:15.850> put<00:03:16.000> a<00:03:16.030> filter

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
you are going to have to put a filter

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.900 
you are going to have to put a filter
inside<00:03:16.720> of<00:03:16.870> it<00:03:16.960> and<00:03:17.110> things<00:03:17.290> like<00:03:17.470> that<00:03:17.530> so<00:03:17.950> it

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
inside of it and things like that so it

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.490 
inside of it and things like that so it
takes<00:03:19.120> a<00:03:19.240> little<00:03:19.330> longer<00:03:19.480> but<00:03:19.900> you<00:03:20.140> still<00:03:20.380> get

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
takes a little longer but you still get

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.980 
takes a little longer but you still get
the<00:03:20.560> ease<00:03:20.740> of<00:03:20.770> single<00:03:21.250> serve<00:03:21.460> so<00:03:22.150> inside<00:03:22.690> of

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
the ease of single serve so inside of

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.780 
the ease of single serve so inside of
the<00:03:23.110> EZ<00:03:23.290> cup<00:03:23.800> you're<00:03:24.160> gonna<00:03:24.250> notice<00:03:24.520> that

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
the EZ cup you're gonna notice that

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.240 
the EZ cup you're gonna notice that
you've<00:03:24.910> got<00:03:24.940> this<00:03:25.360> spring<00:03:26.080> bottom<00:03:26.560> right<00:03:26.920> here

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
you've got this spring bottom right here

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.950 
you've got this spring bottom right here
and<00:03:27.430> this<00:03:27.910> just<00:03:27.940> gives<00:03:28.240> you<00:03:28.420> a<00:03:28.480> little<00:03:28.600> bit<00:03:28.840> of

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:28.960 
and this just gives you a little bit of

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.660 
and this just gives you a little bit of
resistance<00:03:29.440> when<00:03:29.650> you<00:03:29.740> put<00:03:29.920> your<00:03:30.040> coffee<00:03:30.280> in

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
resistance when you put your coffee in

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.850
