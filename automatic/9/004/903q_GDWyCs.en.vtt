00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:17.029
 hello everyone with you green you today 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.070
 let's plunge into the world of ms50 lie about it 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.860
 tank I already saw but he was 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.289
 more fun than informative it 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.880
 video informative and full guide 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.330
 detailing with all his analysis 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.130
 characteristics and so if from the advantage 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.370
 there are drawbacks let's start with the pros 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.050
 This machine is the most important plus 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.970
 tool 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.100
 not even that she is good no when you 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.309
 open a tank buy it you already 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.860
 pumped maximum top gun 10 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.780
 level with good armor penetration 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.210
 good rate of fire and good 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.000
 final accuracy 033 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.250
 it's all super there is of course its own spoon 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.369
 the tar that we talk in the minuses and 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.680
 let's pause the weapon for now 

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:02.170
 him back next plus this 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.489
 excellent dynamic performance 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.580
 excellent maximum maneuverability 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.560
 speed this all allows us to be very 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.950
 quickly hold all the bets we only 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.530
 we can imagine all the bushes of all 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.630
 cool points are all our ours 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.000
 allies do not have time to go so we 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.980
 do we take some bush 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.010
 he is our all guys bye no 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:27.500
 get this next plus 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.200
 good frontal car booking 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.570
 have we keep hitting ninth levels 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.610
 tanks of course that are below us even 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.860
 for a dozen non-penetration arrives and 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.600
 of course it allows us to impose 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.330
 aggressive play especially when we're in 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.310
 so even in this video you donâ€™t 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.060
 I'll miss you 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:51.860
 most aggressively in their own world 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:55.280
 but within these limits of what is permitted not to 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.130
 die another plus that's big 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.079
 shoot ammunition which 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.049
 sometimes I fly around the table like birds 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.640
 sometimes you admit to the bushes he doesn't 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.530
 end i mean i don't know what you need 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.899
 make it end with me he neither 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.819
 never ended think everyone 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.030
 players who have already played this tank 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.190
 there was the same thing on this pros 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.549
 Unfortunately, of course they are over 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.560
 bright in weight and but cons also have to 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:26.660
 sorry let's look at the cons and 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:30.739
 then we will generally rate our car 1 minus 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:33.470
 it is a weapon yes how are these tools even though it 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.690
 top 10 level both very much 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.760
 cons it is which unfortunately 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.640
 spoils the game on this tank 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.890
 the main minus is damage per minute damage in 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.140
 minute small for us damage per minute 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.860
 among ninth level classmates 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.140
 loses only t95 t30 I personally do not know 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.970
 why cheated so Americans but the fact 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.739
 the fact remains all the other tanks 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.000
 cause potential 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:02.150
 damage more than we therefore need it 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.489
 strengthen here I coffee all the time put on 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.430
 car and already somehow this disadvantage 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:10.489
 compensated for one more minus this 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.400
 tools he has the worst stabilization then 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:16.519
 There is, if you twist the case, then the spread 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.680
 awesome time information 2 and 3 that is 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.079
 after a huge scattered need even before 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.829
 our good precision 033 whistle and 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:27.709
 two three seconds is a lot of it is not 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.600
 allows you to move very quickly 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.409
 fetus to turn and shoot need 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.790
 example 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:35.010
 stood second 3 and then only 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.680
 a shot of course it's a waste of time and 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.730
 rubbing and home smaller dp name therefore 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.959
 it's all sad and weapons in mensa 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.430
 cumulatively, I can say that the instrument 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.549
 I didn't like it anymore 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.349
 liked it and unfortunately it is for 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:51.959
 the next minus is what a good old woman 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:54.870
 there was no us in the forehead but the sides of the roof 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.969
 feed all this suffers any land mines from 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.909
 artillery almost always comes with a plan 

00:03:56.969 --> 00:04:01.859
 freak and if you have a little bit of back 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:04.439
 the body is not as it should be 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:07.109
 twisted in the board immediately arrive in 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:10.889
 breaks the shell is wild and delivers 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:15.569
 you need to do it very carefully still 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:17.759
 one minus it also spoils everything 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.410
 car booking impression 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:23.490
 for turrets on top with instruments 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.380
 observations that allow the enemy 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.919
 even with a small break through punch on 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.990
 the cathedral that is a very close distance 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:34.169
 available that everyone can have evicted 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.599
 these turrets average distance seems to be 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:39.620
 less yes and no longer for our 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:42.270
 Kosovo guns in general then the application 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.250
 Fri-Sau as extremely 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.099
 narrow ie it narrows the spectrum 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.409
 applications and let's see what we in 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:51.060
 eventually we get fast 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:53.520
 signed up a good balloon 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:57.539
 booking but mediocre 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:01.080
 a tool with bad dm and vulnerable 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:02.009
 places in the forehead and also extremely weak 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.200
 armored 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:07.780
 the sides and the roofs that is 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:11.070
 what we need to do to all 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:14.200
 turned ubon shoot bye d and 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.450
 also not to be too close 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.220
 distances from afar if we are 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:21.430
 shoot then hope only for good luck 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.170
 because it's hard to get there 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.690
 although if we fully converge on 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:28.270
 we have good strengths so if we 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.590
 want to lose in dpm and but get in 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.710
 principle, you can do it 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:35.500
 that is, roughly two tactics in one 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.900
 tactics you dictate the rules of the game very 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.850
 play aggressively 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:43.000
 take damage all by yourself either 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:46.630
 some kind of non - penetration 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.630
 enemy fire leads you second 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.390
 option you go to a bush and sit in it 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.860
 shot heat to distant targets 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.420
 Wake up slowly but with good 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.170
 already get accurate 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:02.380
 from afar I of course I chose the first 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:05.770
 option because hitting me is not 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.720
 interests are uninteresting it is boring what 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.760
 I advise you but of course I am very 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.000
 often watched the picture when such 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.560
 progressive guys like me 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.129
 merged first and then the whole team 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.949
 losing therefore still need 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:23.069
 aggression aggression but wisely approach 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:26.699
 this concept and still measured 

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:29.069
 a cleft to know your strength 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:31.860
 equipment that we put aiming drives 

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:35.610
 ventilation and rammer i set exactly 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:38.159
 such a set of the crew swing all the same 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.319
 if distant and tape disguise it if 

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:43.199
 near the repair and then have at its 

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:48.110
 the discretion of the military fraternity also will not 

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:50.099
 superfluous with a sixth sense of course and by 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.409
 first aid kit 

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:54.330
 repair kit and coffee can be put 

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:57.539
 of course both put out or but the tank burns 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:07:00.719
 extremely rare but the increment and dpm it 

00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:03.689
 with me the centrists will be noticeable on this 

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:05.879
 thank you all for watching do not forget 

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:09.649
 subscribe put like and wait for new 

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:09.649
 video bye bye
