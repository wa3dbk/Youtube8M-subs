00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.980
 hello I'm king bites the creator of 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.050
 ki-moon method and in this video as 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.210
 happens in our courses you will see and 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.279
 you go above all to live in such a way 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.230
 differently our brain works like 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.939
 we think for this we must 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.130
 prepare a small graphical exercise 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.330
 transformer I present to you by hand ramírez 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.980
 the first person in the world who 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.720
 implemented the ping method 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.670
 hello, friends, I'm really going to 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.110
 explain how I redesigned my signature thanks 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.059
 to the ki-moon method of graphs of the 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.739
 information it is important that now you 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.960
 look at what he's doing because it 's the 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.059
 key to our re-educator method 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.769
 of the unconscious first of all I'm going to 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.870
 make my old signature that you will see 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:50.629
 composed of a line on top of which 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.000
 I wrote my name the first surname 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.549
 last name on top wrote the 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.750
 maternal surname and also made a loop 

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:59.640
 and I crossed it out as 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.810
 and this was because I was very shy 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.390
 and also had some complete 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.880
 indeed the hand signing in a 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.830
 envelope that protects the name and 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.960
 two surnames the surname of the mother is 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.130
 placed above protecting his name and 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.220
 last name 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.320
 besides beats and roof shape and by 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.180
 On top of everything hand is crossed out what we 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.640
 indicates that he had as he said very 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.930
 well some complexes now hand you're going 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.240
 to do without a signature and liked 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.800
 transformed with the pine method that was 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.170
 the ready of stroke of health for the 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.790
 new level of success both personally and 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.680
 professional and the increase in 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.080
 emotional intelligence 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.660
 the ki-moon method has three keys the 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.310
 first is auto-suggestion the second 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.620
 its great differential is the great 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.270
 transformation and the third maybe the most 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.990
 important the reeducation of 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.570
 unconscious 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.700
 is right who for what the 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.290
 graph and transformation exercises 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.030
 Self positive instructions work 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.890
 we have to distract the conscious 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.380
 fix now we have the signature of 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.440
 hand perfectly made signature with 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.450
 his name and with his first surname with 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.940
 a slightly upward direction and 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.680
 cross out without loop without envelopes with 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.720
 the initial of both the name of as of 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.610
 sufficiently large surname as 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.290
 to promote your self-esteem 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.510
 it is important that you do the same 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.760
 sign with your name with fast and that 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.030
 repeat this signature and transformed graph 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.000
 10 to 15 times daily 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.260
 You've seen all the changes in the firm 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.190
 you've really seen all the changes 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.190
 what happened here 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.680
 you are really sure you have seen what 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.330
 that emanated and I have done during this 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.060
 mini choice of transformation graph 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.520
 besides the signature of hand before your eyes 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.650
 there have been four changes yes yes 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:49.660
 four changes much more obvious and it's 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.550
 this video actually not go on 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.620
 the change of hand signature but on 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.320
 how our brain works and how 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.540
 it only serves a very small part of what 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.250
 what happens around you let's see the 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.530
 four changes of which I spoke to you 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.000
 a moment ago first I have 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.640
 changed a dark jacket for a 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.520
 clear second hand has changed its 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.290
 gray jacket by a navy blue third 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.959
 during the scene we have removed the 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.300
 carpet and room we have also removed 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.209
 the black curtain and a 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.280
 completely white slate incredible 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.410
 true, well, this is what happens to us 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.190
 a little bit everyone has educated us so that 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.110
 unconsciously we look at the bad 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.850
 and in this way so foolish we miss 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.450
 everything beautiful in our lives 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.030
 and we bitter the existence 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.849
 let's see what has really happened before 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.230
 your eyes without trap or cardboard or 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.480
 viking bytes from the creator of the method 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.670
 ki-moon in this video as it happens in 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.470
 our courses you're going to see and you're going 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.510
 everything to live in how differently 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.910
 our brain works like we do 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.250
 we thought for it we have prepared a 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.690
 small exercise graph transformer 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.250
 I present by hand Ramírez the first 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.590
 person in the world who implemented the 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.390
 ki-moon hello friends method effectively 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.980
 I will explain how to redesign my signature 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.959
 thanks to the ki-moon method of graph 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.580
 transformation is important that now 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.040
 pay attention to what he does because he is 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.390
 the key to our re-educator method 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.769
 of the unconscious 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.650
 first of all I will make my signature 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:14.450
 old that look carefully first I go and 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.560
 I change the brown jacket for another 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.350
 much more clear 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.810
 above he wrote the mother's last name and 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.820
 I also made a loop and crossed it out as 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.380
 you can see now this was due to 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.020
 that I was very shy and also had 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.509
 Some 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.910
 indeed the hand signature has a 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:33.650
 wrap and that's me I'm changing 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.509
 the old jacket by a navy blue 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.069
 Look, Kim, really, both of you 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:39.199
 jackets do not look anything like 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:41.659
 that we had before beats and in the form of 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:43.789
 roof and above all hand is 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:45.319
 He crosses out what indicates to us that he had 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:47.750
 he has said very well some complexes 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:49.729
 Now hands are going to make your new signature now 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.830
 graph transformed with the ki-moon method 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:54.259
 that was the starting signal for the 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.849
 new level of success both personally and 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:57.830
 professional and the increase 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:00.170
 emotional intelligence 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.720
 the ki-moon method has three keys the 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.400
 first is auto-suggestion the second 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.710
 its great differential is the great 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.360
 transformation and the third maybe the most 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.060
 important the reeducation of 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.639
 unconscious 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.770
 is right who for what the 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:16.389
 graph and transformation exercises 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.150
 Positive self instructions work 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.950
 we have to distract the conscious 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.440
 fix now we have the signature of 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:26.050
 hand perfectly made signature with 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.849
 his name and with his first surname 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.220
 with a slightly upward direction 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:32.949
 without flaw incredible what the mind does 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.840
 true even if you think you attend to everything 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:37.389
 you only unconsciously attend to 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.879
 what you have been educated for 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:41.800
 so that you reeducate your unconscious or 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:45.030
 you can never reach a full life 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.030
 happy and successful
