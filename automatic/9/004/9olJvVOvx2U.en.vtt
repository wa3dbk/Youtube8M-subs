the<00:01:33.990> pack<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.439> actually<00:01:35.070> replace<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.670> this

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
the pack to actually replace and this

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.370 
the pack to actually replace and this

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
different objects so for instance if you

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.960 
different objects so for instance if you
actually<00:01:40.740> listen<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.400> without<00:01:41.579> in

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
actually listen to it without in

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.550 
actually listen to it without in
attached<00:01:42.329> wave<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.750> tall<00:01:44.990> you<00:01:45.990> may<00:01:46.229> be<00:01:46.290> able

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
attached wave and tall you may be able

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.850 
attached wave and tall you may be able
to<00:01:46.680> hear<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:46.920> maybe<00:01:47.579> not<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.799> then<00:01:49.799> we

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
to hear that maybe not and then we

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.899 
to hear that maybe not and then we
attach<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.430> surface<00:01:50.640> such<00:01:50.939> as<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.210> table

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.349 

you<00:01:54.689> can<00:01:54.840> suddenly<00:01:55.020> start<00:01:55.469> to<00:01:55.590> hear<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.890> sound

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:56.359 
you can suddenly start to hear the sound

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:59.809 
you can suddenly start to hear the sound
as<00:01:57.359> its<00:01:58.049> using<00:01:58.499> the<00:01:58.590> table<00:01:58.950> itself<00:01:59.249> as<00:01:59.759> a

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
as its using the table itself as a

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:06.260 
as its using the table itself as a
speaker<00:02:03.530> so<00:02:04.530> we'll<00:02:04.799> test<00:02:05.039> out<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.819> objects

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
speaker so we'll test out the objects

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.680 
speaker so we'll test out the objects
such<00:02:06.539> as<00:02:07.429> this<00:02:08.429> big<00:02:08.640> plastic<00:02:08.849> box<00:02:10.160> again

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
such as this big plastic box again

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:19.339 
such as this big plastic box again
attaching<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.840> box<00:02:13.290> itself<00:02:17.840> and<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:19.200> get

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
attaching it to box itself and you get

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.070 
attaching it to box itself and you get
deeper<00:02:19.769> sound<00:02:20.239> because<00:02:21.239> it's<00:02:21.269> using<00:02:21.780> some<00:02:22.049> of

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
deeper sound because it's using some of

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.809 
deeper sound because it's using some of
the<00:02:22.200> container<00:02:22.680> itself<00:02:22.980> as<00:02:23.250> kind<00:02:23.519> of<00:02:23.549> a<00:02:23.640> bass

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
the container itself as kind of a bass

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.509 
the container itself as kind of a bass
speaker<00:02:27.739> again<00:02:28.739> we'll<00:02:29.069> move<00:02:29.190> on<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.489> a

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
speaker again we'll move on to a

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.720 
speaker again we'll move on to a
different<00:02:29.610> objects<00:02:30.450> on<00:02:30.810> slightly<00:02:31.319> smaller

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
different objects on slightly smaller

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.539 
different objects on slightly smaller
replace<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:33.920> and<00:02:34.920> you've<00:02:35.129> got<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.340> small

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
replace that and you've got a small

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.309 
replace that and you've got a small
container<00:02:35.790> here<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.450> again<00:02:36.660> attach<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.290> to
