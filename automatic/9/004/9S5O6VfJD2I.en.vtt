00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.720
 well then we are here on the map 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.900
 which is called the great cheese safety 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.640
 chis i think this map is called good 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.070
 first of all I want to clarify not what 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.610
 we have created we have not created it the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.489
 creator has been right here says see that 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.260
 I read and he does not like that anymore 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.780
 maps but you buckled with this map to 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.440
 more so I 'm going to show you and I'm going to 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.670
 give the rules and what is this map 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.410
 well here are the main rules 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.030
 we have translated them if they do not understand something 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.829
 please do not be warned if there is any 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.629
 error or if they have found something without 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.920
 translate so good here the 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.500
 translation that he has done to our 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.059
 channels so they go and well 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.199
 let's explain to create map nor what 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.199
 explain what the map is about 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:10.220
 it is good then the map of what it is 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:12.770
 it is what is going to count thus 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.920
 it has to be put in the case of a 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.090
 mouse that like us in this case in 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.130
 his case would be a mouse yes 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.020
 the main thing is to get all the 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.920
 cheeses that are scattered around the house is 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.539
 a house that has if it's contests and 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.400
 all that is very big 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:32.950
 they will like accessories 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.080
 so it 's good to get the cheeses 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.870
 make the secondary objectives 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.850
 there are some bonuses there until 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:43.540
 a room that will be called room of the 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:47.530
 monument where there are bonuses and it is 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.380
 where they have to go as I say there are 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.700
 some lights and in those lights they have to 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.960
 raise the levers so that front and 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:58.560
 he will tell you what moment 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.630
 well I will tell you about him as 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.240
 visions of kart good so here it is 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.460
 good that says in some things some 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.619
 things that come to be really good 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:14.060
 the things they must do are found 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:16.670
 on this side here daniela de copeco 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.830
 in the room of the monument here is like 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.620
 the monument I do not know a mouse doing it 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.250
 a monument to a cat or a rabbit I do not know 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.050
 sleeping but good here goes this look 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.020
 here you pull the levers when you have 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.849
 turned on the lights of what this is about 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.910
 bonus example of the lobby table 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:37.220
 these are bonuses here they say jala the for 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.940
 when you have turned on the lights there are 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.370
 lights with levers to the reds are the 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.650
 espichas and the lights will be undertaken or if 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.450
 you find these lights like this and here you 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.819
 they say where you could find those 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.530
 lights bonuses the table the lobby in the 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.569
 lobby table could you find 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.490
 the lights so when you find it 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.930
 so that you do not get upset and you can 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:03.240
 already fulfilled the bonuses to the lever 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.100
 good and so each one 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.150
 well they asked good here too 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.970
 there are bonuses that are the levers 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.920
 they will ask one thing 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.270
 here because there are no levers well 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.610
 because this is where the 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.700
 cheese here you think about the hallway and in 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.380
 the bathroom and the bathroom would have to 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.930
 put the cheese and when they have 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.460
 found on top of them there is no that is 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.050
 the lobby table there are those who see the 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.720
 cabinet here where the bathroom good 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.890
 that do not have levers are cheeses 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.670
 example there is also cheese look at the 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.890
 cheese from the kitchen and the dining room 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.800
 all that and good and here the dow 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.530
 ministry the cheese the good bedroom 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.260
 that's all you have to complete everything 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.840
 you will start with some things that you 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.710
 give away will have to see here 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.840
 make 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.730
 Well, here they give you the first things 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.260
 and there, you can only enter there 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.920
 when you already have finished all 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.570
 cheeses according to the signs good one of 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.370
 the main rules is that you can 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.800
 mess everything you can and everything 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.340
 you find you can build you can 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.870
 destroy but let's say some sign says 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.430
 Do not destroy, you must not destroy 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.440
 so I'll show you some of the 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.530
 images but I'll show you the bedroom 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.000
 let's go up 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:22.100
 here we can see the sun or whatever 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.220
 necessary as a written danilo and good 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.620
 there this map does not play it in pacific 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.169
 since the creator has said to play 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.360
 in hardcore but hardcore mode is not that 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.700
 want hardcore it would be very difficult to 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.100
 must play in fight mode because there 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.900
 many do not think thank you with the 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.720
 game but here we see a laptop 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.360
 hypergiant and how can you see is 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.700
 excellent since I work a whole map 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.460
 history and content we are planned 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.890
 translate it again because then some 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.660
 parts have not been translated by some 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.520
 good friends contacts who do not 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.380
 translated well because this map already 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.090
 we have translated perfectly we can 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.280
 find my aquariums there is everything in 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.890
 this map we will go to see the camera for 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.980
 that they see the pixel perfection of 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:09.550
 this guy is amazing 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:11.170
 so I do not know how they sign and 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.670
 I will leave in the description the download of 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.130
 true map the true forum 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.680
 map that is in English and we will leave you 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.470
 mediafire 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.360
 and it's in Spanish, this is what 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.240
 we have translated that we have 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.539
 lasted almost a week with danilo because 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:30.720
 it's immense kitchen room and so they 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:33.150
 showed a part of the piece of 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.940
 subject is not a mouse so one must 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.430
 go like a rodent out there 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.880
 they should play multiplayer because 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.350
 it's completely difficult to use 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.520
 stairs all 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:51.720
 so then until the next danilo 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:54.030
 something to say that nothing more to say 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.340
 we will be translating more maps and 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.590
 then for him at least and who 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:02.160
 they want to play some map they do not communicate 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:04.980
 or if we translate it and nothing else 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.780
 visited on my channel that of edwin and the 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.420
 same progress that will have 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:12.920
 so subscribe for more maps and 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.920
 to the toll road
