00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
opposite so if you did the index finger

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.750 
opposite so if you did the index finger
in<00:02:34.170> this<00:02:34.320> hand<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.770> this<00:02:34.950> hand<00:02:35.010> you<00:02:35.340> won't<00:02:35.550> and

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
in this hand and this hand you won't and

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.820 
in this hand and this hand you won't and
so<00:02:35.970> forth<00:02:36.240> so<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.720> diagonal<00:02:37.260> line<00:02:37.440> will<00:02:37.709> call

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
so forth so the diagonal line will call

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.120 
so forth so the diagonal line will call
from<00:02:38.040> this<00:02:38.220> corner<00:02:38.490> into<00:02:38.940> here<00:02:39.209> so<00:02:40.040> kind<00:02:41.040> of

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
from this corner into here so kind of

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.980 
from this corner into here so kind of
like<00:02:41.280> you<00:02:41.459> know<00:02:41.490> it's<00:02:41.790> in<00:02:42.030> towards<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.690> hand

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
like you know it's in towards the hand

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.570 
like you know it's in towards the hand
and<00:02:43.290> when<00:02:43.410> you<00:02:43.500> have<00:02:43.740> your<00:02:43.830> hands<00:02:44.040> placed<00:02:44.400> like

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
and when you have your hands placed like

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:52.520 
and when you have your hands placed like
this<00:02:44.720> it's<00:02:45.720> in<00:02:46.020> going<00:02:46.920> in<00:02:47.100> alright<00:02:51.110> so<00:02:52.110> and<00:02:52.470> the

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
this it's in going in alright so and the

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.199 
this it's in going in alright so and the
trick<00:02:52.740> to<00:02:52.770> this<00:02:52.890> again<00:02:53.250> is<00:02:53.370> how<00:02:53.520> like<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:54.000> same

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
trick to this again is how like the same

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.990 
trick to this again is how like the same
way<00:02:54.480> that<00:02:54.660> I<00:02:54.720> did<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.290> french<00:02:55.800> manicure<00:02:56.280> it's

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
way that I did the french manicure it's

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.740 
way that I did the french manicure it's
you<00:02:57.390> turn<00:02:57.780> your<00:02:58.290> nail<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:59.370> it's<00:02:59.519> from<00:02:59.820> corner

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
you turn your nail so it's from corner

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.910 
you turn your nail so it's from corner
to<00:03:00.989> corner<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:02.720> don't<00:03:03.720> worry<00:03:03.930> if<00:03:04.230> you<00:03:04.590> think

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
to corner and don't worry if you think

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.759 
to corner and don't worry if you think
you<00:03:05.040> messed<00:03:05.280> up<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.550> line<00:03:06.080> and<00:03:07.080> it's<00:03:07.320> and<00:03:07.620> then

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
you messed up the line and it's and then

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:13.100 
you messed up the line and it's and then
you<00:03:07.890> fill<00:03:08.100> it<00:03:08.220> in<00:03:10.250> you<00:03:11.250> put<00:03:11.519> too<00:03:11.730> much<00:03:11.880> of<00:03:12.840> the

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
you fill it in you put too much of the

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.350 
you fill it in you put too much of the
yellow<00:03:13.350> we<00:03:13.890> can<00:03:14.070> go<00:03:14.190> ahead<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.430> go<00:03:14.790> back<00:03:15.000> over

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
yellow we can go ahead and go back over

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.030 
yellow we can go ahead and go back over
with<00:03:15.570> the<00:03:15.690> orange<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.230> make<00:03:16.380> it<00:03:16.530> more<00:03:16.769> like<00:03:16.830> a
