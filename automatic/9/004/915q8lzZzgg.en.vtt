measure<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.490> stroke<00:01:41.820> length<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.540> engine

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
measure the stroke length of this engine

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.749 
measure the stroke length of this engine
and<00:01:43.049> Stroke<00:01:43.799> length<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.220> term<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.460> makes

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
and Stroke length is a term that makes

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
talking to the camera this goes all the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.120 
talking to the camera this goes all the
EFI<00:01:48.000> series<00:01:48.329> engines<00:01:48.720> say<00:01:48.930> 352<00:01:49.619> on<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.860> block

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
EFI series engines say 352 on the block

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.039 
EFI series engines say 352 on the block
but<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.790> was<00:01:50.880> just<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.149> casing<00:01:51.540> number<00:01:51.780> it

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
but that was just the casing number it

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.840 
but that was just the casing number it
could<00:01:52.140> be<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.290> 360<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.009> could<00:01:53.130> be<00:01:53.189> 390<00:01:53.759> we

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
could be a 360 it could be 390 we

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.800 
could be a 360 it could be 390 we
actually<00:01:54.090> have<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.270> get<00:01:54.450> in<00:01:54.540> there<00:01:54.659> and

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
actually have to get in there and

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.270 
actually have to get in there and
measure<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.290> stroke<00:01:55.560> length<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.130> that's

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
measure the stroke length so that's

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.889 
measure the stroke length so that's
something<00:01:56.579> we'll<00:01:56.700> do<00:01:56.820> because<00:01:57.180> another<00:01:57.810> thing

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
something we'll do because another thing

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.690 
something we'll do because another thing
we<00:01:58.079> have<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.259> do<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.530> fix<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.159> valve<00:01:59.399> seals

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700

this<00:01:59.969> thing<00:02:00.180> blows<00:02:00.450> oil<00:02:00.750> like<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:00.960> spy<00:02:01.259> truck

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
this thing blows oil like a spy truck

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.260 
this thing blows oil like a spy truck

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.419 
here sound off in the comments but you

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:54.000 
here sound off in the comments but you
shouldn't<00:03:52.690> need<00:03:52.750> to<00:03:52.810> because<00:03:53.290> it's<00:03:53.470> pretty

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
shouldn't need to because it's pretty

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.189

the<00:04:03.579> wiring<00:04:03.819> at<00:04:04.120> some<00:04:04.329> point<00:04:04.599> maybe<00:04:05.349> swap<00:04:05.620> in

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829

some<00:04:05.979> nicer<00:04:06.250> gauges<00:04:06.639> but<00:04:06.760> for<00:04:07.000> now<00:04:07.120> it's

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
some nicer gauges but for now it's

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:09.839 
some nicer gauges but for now it's

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
planning on swapping this thing out no I

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.019 
planning on swapping this thing out no I
can't<00:04:20.409> use<00:04:20.530> a<00:04:20.560> standard<00:04:20.680> radio<00:04:21.370> which<00:04:21.669> is<00:04:21.699> fine

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:22.029 
can't use a standard radio which is fine

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:24.600 
can't use a standard radio which is fine
because<00:04:22.630> there's<00:04:23.050> no<00:04:23.169> din<00:04:23.469> opening<00:04:24.010> behind<00:04:24.400> it

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
because there's no din opening behind it

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.270 
because there's no din opening behind it
instead<00:04:25.479> I<00:04:25.539> found<00:04:25.840> a<00:04:26.050> radio<00:04:26.169> that<00:04:26.469> looks<00:04:26.800> Oh

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.650 
highway this thing's not screaming along
I<00:05:11.080> pretty<00:05:12.040> much<00:05:12.130> never<00:05:12.610> need<00:05:12.940> first<00:05:13.330> gear

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
I pretty much never need first gear

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.120 
I pretty much never need first gear
unless<00:05:13.870> I<00:05:14.020> have<00:05:14.110> a<00:05:14.169> steep<00:05:14.440> hill<00:05:14.680> in<00:05:14.830> front<00:05:14.950> of

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
unless I have a steep hill in front of

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.830 
unless I have a steep hill in front of
me<00:05:15.190> so<00:05:15.310> I'm<00:05:15.400> always<00:05:15.550> taking<00:05:15.940> off<00:05:16.030> in<00:05:16.210> second<00:05:16.720> I

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
me so I'm always taking off in second I

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.570 
me so I'm always taking off in second I
learned<00:05:17.410> that<00:05:17.620> to<00:05:17.800> get<00:05:17.890> it<00:05:18.010> into<00:05:18.130> third<00:05:18.430> you

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
learned that to get it into third you

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.040 
learned that to get it into third you
just<00:05:18.760> kind<00:05:18.910> of<00:05:18.970> let<00:05:19.120> it<00:05:19.150> do<00:05:19.330> its<00:05:19.360> own<00:05:19.600> thing<00:05:19.900> if

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
just kind of let it do its own thing if

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.510 
just kind of let it do its own thing if
you<00:05:20.140> force<00:05:20.470> it<00:05:20.650> you'll<00:05:20.830> get<00:05:21.010> a<00:05:21.070> grinding<00:05:21.460> noise

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
you force it you'll get a grinding noise

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.640 
you force it you'll get a grinding noise
but<00:05:22.450> other<00:05:22.600> than<00:05:22.720> that<00:05:22.780> it<00:05:23.050> shifts<00:05:23.410> better

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
but other than that it shifts better

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.920 
but other than that it shifts better
than<00:05:23.800> I<00:05:23.860> thought<00:05:24.070> it<00:05:24.130> would<00:05:24.450> it's<00:05:25.450> a<00:05:25.510> nice<00:05:25.660> old

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
than I thought it would it's a nice old

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.200 
than I thought it would it's a nice old
robust<00:05:26.440> transmission<00:05:27.130> and<00:05:27.370> I<00:05:27.639> don't<00:05:27.940> see<00:05:28.060> any

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
robust transmission and I don't see any

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.650 
robust transmission and I don't see any
need<00:05:28.389> to<00:05:28.600> change<00:05:29.080> this<00:05:29.169> up<00:05:29.320> anytime<00:05:29.530> soon

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
need to change this up anytime soon

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.450 
need to change this up anytime soon

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
down there which is kind of neat for

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.440 
down there which is kind of neat for
nighttime<00:05:36.100> driving<00:05:36.400> situations<00:05:37.060> this<00:05:37.300> is<00:05:37.390> a

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
nighttime driving situations this is a
