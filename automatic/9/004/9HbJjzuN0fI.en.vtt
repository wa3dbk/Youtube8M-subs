00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.190
 Hello and welcome to here 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:18.900
 my youtube channel to another 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.539
 film about the dj phantom three the copter 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.140
 with the great camera down here underneath 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.939
 with cameras it's like that most of the time 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.579
 For example, the cameras have so 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.369
 an objective ceiling here so what 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:34.890
 during transport to the ceiling 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.370
 or on the front of the objective comes 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.830
 around there just the objective lenses 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.630
 protect to protect the vmv filter 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.900
 the before that are so during the 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:49.470
 transports as that comes to nothing 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:52.430
 unfortunately not so with the phantom 3 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.870
 There are now some providers the 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.780
 sell lens cap 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.410
 going priced so was with five euro 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.150
 go and lie in the maximum at 10 euros in 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.679
 There are different providers 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:10.499
 For example, 3d printers you can buy the 

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:14.539
 but there is a simple and a lot of it 

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:16.640
 cheaper solution and that means in saana 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:20.090
 deospray and how the whole thing works 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.090
 I'll show you now 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:33.180
 this looks like this deospray look 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.790
 amadeus spray this is a normal deodorant 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.640
 Spray what you get under your armpits 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.520
 or the breast I have my spray 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.020
 bought here fresh herbes fresh 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.299
 it's not personal taste though 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.060
 maybe it is the one or 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.880
 other the deo spray bottle here the 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.810
 costs only 69 cents and is with it 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.850
 Of course, much cheaper than some 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.080
 lens cover the one on the internet 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.479
 ready to buy 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.250
 apropos lens cover we are fine 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.130
 actually not like the deodorant spray 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.380
 but this is about this one 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.830
 lid is here because it fits 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.620
 wonderful as an objective lid on the 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.420
 camera of the phantom 3 when we open the lid 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.400
 keep right here next time you will 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.549
 Find out that from the height 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.590
 fits perfectly and also from the 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:25.470
 size as I always do that 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.840
 then that fits very well that 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.730
 it still loosens a bit 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.860
 can certainly leave it that way if you can 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.989
 for example, somewhere in a suitcase 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.519
 stowed away and here something else 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.630
 before that is so that this lid itself 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.040
 can not solve 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.380
 but I'll do something here now 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.980
 thus make the other a little better 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.530
 fits and that I take mine again 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.040
 leuco sieg tape that's all 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.230
 thin fine white textile adhesive tape 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.690
 You can get that in the pharmacy and me 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.579
 use has long been at the phantom 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.320
 for example, antennas or similar 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.820
 the legs sticking that they'll 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.799
 always very neat from you can see that 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.420
 even on the white legs then not 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.180
 really and here I can do that 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.640
 use a very thin layer inside 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.519
 to stick in rhine again in addition 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.260
 stick in this lid and that 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.780
 I press this carefully now 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.120
 and if we still have it inside now 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.829
 have once glued additionally in then 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.040
 The whole thing fits in wonderfully 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:25.560
 now on the camera to hide the 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.600
 Now here on it so and you 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.880
 then you will realize that now 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.319
 also stops and does not slip down too 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.780
 if we are here a bit like that 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.980
 keep it low so that fits in wonderfully and 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.430
 Of course we can also use this lid 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.469
 at any time very easy to take off again and 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.290
 then have a very good protection here 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:46.650
 and a cheap protection for ours 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.030
 phantom three camera yes that 's it 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.219
 again from me I hope my tip 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.840
 could help you and liked you 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:53.310
 and if so, then I'm happy 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.719

 but her before me now with strangers 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.409
 I have to decorate feathers at the end of the 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.659
 Films still admit that the idea to do so 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:13.349
