00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.670
 ps dear friends on my channel today 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.250
 another video about car 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.309
 today I want to tell you about this on 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.980
 such chips as electric windows 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:18.029
 in particular about how to do so 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.640
 not only with the ignition on, they 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.199
 worked as planned here 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.570
 only when turned on when off 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.109
 they do n't always work 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.099
 convenient there are opponents and supporters 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.619
 of this 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.100
 but I'm landing now will show you how everything 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.440
 do so that they work with 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.910
 ignition on and off for 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.500
 we will need this 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.920
 from under the steering wheel remove this one here 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.210
 decorative nodochka say let's remove and 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.020
 get to 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.640
 Relyushki responsible for the work 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:57.180
 power windows this is relay k2 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:03.870
 it is located here that is in 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:07.670
 left row 2 below needed from there 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.140
 remove then you need to disassemble it 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.930
 some 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:18.000
 flat device for example not big 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:20.009
 remove the top with a screwdriver or 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.320
 remove the top and pull out the middle 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.000
 the result is the same but call it as 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.890
 want to 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.409
 need to pull out and what to do but 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.630
 principle, I have already done it 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.740
 close this work contact 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.920
 where is 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.470
 the relay is in contact at the moment of pressing 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.210
 the buttons on you are touching and the system 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.759
 works i.e. the lifts lower and 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.299
 lift the glass off 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.310
 ignition 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.680
 this business does not work but for all this 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:51.329
 the case worked necessary this one 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.970
 contact to close, that is, he seemed to be pressed 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.700
 and we press the button it sticks and 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.140
 closes the circuit 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.430
 can be done as follows 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.079
 For example, inserted a piece of paper 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.780
 insert here there books nylon 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.579
 for example screed plastic disposable there 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.920
 a piece but it makes no difference 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.869
 piece of paper principle 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.420
 fits very well nothing with her 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.599
 will not be left a piece of paper and this one to 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.250
 mustache as if I pulled the chain and closed 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.930
 is it turns out now that in any 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.400
 moment 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.980
 The main thing is to hang on the battery 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.170
 terminals well ignition is not on 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.420
 turned on indifference push the button 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.810
 the glass goes down closes that is 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.030
 it is very convenient especially in summer 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.500
 smokers sit waiting for someone opened 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.260
 closed no need to start at the same time 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.319
 car but that's very comfortable and how do i 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.670
 It seems useful I do not know what they did 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.310
 so that only with ignition 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.470
 could do it well what pictures 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.780
 some kind of security but i don't see 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.420
 for what purposes could you think of it 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.709
 in one way is eliminated from 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.780
 as follows, that is this one 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:57.110
 right posting 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.709
 she pressed her must come here to 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.600
 this woman not to the coil is 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.480
 have come and fix but i 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:10.730
 did it this way pasted 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:13.040
 a piece of paper by the way I almost forgot one 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.930
 a little nuance between here this plate 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.760
 on which contact and between this one 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.739
 coil which is also located 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.370
 contact that is between those contacts 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:24.769
 which we close the patch here these 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.470
 preferably only conductive 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.280
 the first time I put the lubricant on without 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.170
 conductive grease 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.730
 that is, just pyataks locked put 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.280
 a piece of paper that the chain was a lock before all 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.959
 worked a lot worked about but not 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.820
 more than a month later they stopped 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.890
 work we rather work then something not 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:43.850
 working that is what is happening contact 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:46.400
 and oxidize over time this happens 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.600
 or corrosion or something else may be 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.340
 someone paper slink a little there 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.380
 either there got out somehow well i mean i 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.930
 did what I put on a new mask and 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.330
 anointed someone holding a mask 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.280
 penny i'm by this very 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.870
 avoid what will happen 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.300
 contact oxidation and 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.610
 probably more than six months or her 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.130
 too , more than a year windows 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.170
 work like a clock after all 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:19.510
 if you do it at all deliveries 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:23.120
 it did need to collect back 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.370
 roles and put the relay on its staffing 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.370
 a place 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:32.540
 wrong and can not deliver 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:35.450
 because there is the location of the legs so 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:40.930
 done that the opposite of u and not like this 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:42.680
 put the relay look ignition on 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.020
 which is now on 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:52.570
 now turned off that's off 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:52.570
 no problem ignition 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:59.219
 It works without problems well and just 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:04.329
 we try a case with ignition 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:06.179
 Naturally the same thing 

00:05:04.329 --> 00:05:08.079
 such a simple way how to deliver 

00:05:06.179 --> 00:05:08.679
 power window work without 

00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:11.199
 ignition 

00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:12.789
 more than a year I exploit very satisfied 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:14.829
 very often helps out especially when 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:16.539
 night or night 

00:05:14.829 --> 00:05:19.359
 wants to open a window but to you 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:21.909
 have to turn on the ignition 

00:05:19.359 --> 00:05:22.839
 and this accordingly light up the daytime 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:24.189
 running lights 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:25.809
 that is, when you have it you don't want 

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:28.479
 somewhere you can water without problems 

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:30.369
 use windows but principle on 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:31.839
 This is all my who liked the video and 

00:05:30.369 --> 00:05:36.269
 it was helpful to like 

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:36.269
