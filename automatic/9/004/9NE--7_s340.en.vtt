00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.270 
you have on the cue ball retains so it's
not<00:02:48.690> easy<00:02:48.959> speed

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.840

oh he hit it just right see a little

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.699 
oh he hit it just right see a little
higher<00:02:57.060> that<00:02:57.390> q-ball<00:02:57.660> would<00:02:57.959> have<00:02:58.050> died<00:02:58.260> but

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.689 

he<00:04:32.979> looking<00:04:33.370> makes<00:04:33.580> angles<00:04:34.210> like<00:04:34.300> this<00:04:34.509> I

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 
he looking makes angles like this I

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:38.339 
he looking makes angles like this I
would<00:04:36.699> think<00:04:37.150> he's<00:04:37.449> going<00:04:37.660> to<00:04:37.720> cut<00:04:37.960> the<00:04:38.110> ball

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:38.349 
would think he's going to cut the ball

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:41.279 
would think he's going to cut the ball
in<00:04:38.590> and<00:04:38.770> go<00:04:38.889> one<00:04:39.160> two<00:04:39.699> three<00:04:40.389> two<00:04:40.599> bound<00:04:40.870> here

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:41.289 
in and go one two three two bound here

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:46.439 
in and go one two three two bound here
and<00:04:42.190> but<00:04:42.669> he's<00:04:42.849> looking<00:04:43.389> to<00:04:43.509> see<00:04:44.909> something<00:04:45.909> I

and but he's looking to see something I

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.499

think he wants to just assure themselves
he<00:04:49.870> can<00:04:49.990> get<00:04:50.139> by<00:04:50.319> the<00:04:50.379> sex<00:04:50.770> yeah<00:04:51.250> oh<00:04:51.490> he<00:04:52.090> played

think the six got a cushion well if if
Martinez<00:05:42.669> doesn't<00:05:43.210> call<00:05:43.419> it<00:05:43.630> but<00:05:44.560> you<00:05:44.650> know

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
Martinez doesn't call it but you know

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.469 
Martinez doesn't call it but you know
that<00:05:44.979> that's<00:05:45.190> the<00:05:45.340> only<00:05:45.639> time<00:05:45.849> we're<00:05:46.150> allowed

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 
that that's the only time we're allowed

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:51.360 
that that's the only time we're allowed
to<00:05:47.789> to<00:05:48.789> have<00:05:49.060> a<00:05:49.090> replay<00:05:49.509> as<00:05:49.870> if<00:05:50.409> they<00:05:50.620> ask<00:05:50.949> and

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
to to have a replay as if they ask and

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.430 
to to have a replay as if they ask and
have<00:05:51.849> a<00:05:51.880> little<00:05:52.090> bit<00:05:52.330> of<00:05:52.360> the<00:05:52.539> debate<00:05:52.870> he

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
have a little bit of the debate he

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.969 
have a little bit of the debate he
didn't<00:05:53.830> hit<00:05:53.949> a<00:05:54.009> rail<00:05:55.050> we<00:05:56.050> got<00:05:56.229> to<00:05:56.319> see<00:05:56.500> that<00:05:56.529> one

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
didn't hit a rail we got to see that one

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:59.999 
didn't hit a rail we got to see that one
again<00:05:57.659> we<00:05:58.659> got<00:05:58.810> to<00:05:58.930> show<00:05:59.080> that<00:05:59.289> again<00:05:59.469> I<00:05:59.800> don't

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:00.009 
again we got to show that again I don't

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:05.519 
again we got to show that again I don't
think<00:06:00.069> he<00:06:00.370> got<00:06:00.550> a<00:06:00.580> rail<00:06:04.110> now<00:06:05.110> if<00:06:05.259> you<00:06:05.409> were

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:05.529 
think he got a rail now if you were

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:07.379 
think he got a rail now if you were
playing<00:06:05.770> and<00:06:06.159> you<00:06:06.310> were<00:06:06.430> 19<00:06:06.909> is<00:06:07.090> and<00:06:07.270> you<00:06:07.360> know

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:07.389 
playing and you were 19 is and you know

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:09.209 
playing and you were 19 is and you know
you<00:06:07.569> didn't<00:06:07.990> get<00:06:08.139> a<00:06:08.169> rail<00:06:08.409> well<00:06:08.620> I<00:06:08.650> don't<00:06:09.009> think

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:09.219 
you didn't get a rail well I don't think

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:11.309 
you didn't get a rail well I don't think
he<00:06:09.460> knows<00:06:09.580> he<00:06:09.759> didn't<00:06:10.029> get<00:06:10.090> a<00:06:10.150> rail<00:06:10.360> there<00:06:11.229> were

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:11.319 
he knows he didn't get a rail there were

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:12.959 
he knows he didn't get a rail there were
three<00:06:11.560> balls<00:06:11.800> moving<00:06:12.130> he<00:06:12.490> probably<00:06:12.729> feels

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:12.969 
three balls moving he probably feels

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:15.330 
three balls moving he probably feels
like<00:06:13.150> he<00:06:13.360> got<00:06:13.479> a<00:06:13.539> rally<00:06:13.840> when<00:06:14.740> he<00:06:14.860> saw<00:06:15.039> that<00:06:15.069> he

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.340 
like he got a rally when he saw that he

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.950 
like he got a rally when he saw that he
was<00:06:15.490> going<00:06:15.940> to<00:06:16.000> be<00:06:16.120> pushing<00:06:16.360> that<00:06:16.569> forward<00:06:16.900> to

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
was going to be pushing that forward to

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.300 
was going to be pushing that forward to
the<00:06:17.020> corner<00:06:17.319> pocket<00:06:17.349> I<00:06:17.770> think<00:06:17.889> he<00:06:17.979> started

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
the corner pocket I think he started

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.529 
the corner pocket I think he started
walking<00:06:18.460> away<00:06:18.729> he<00:06:19.000> might<00:06:19.180> have<00:06:19.270> thought<00:06:19.389> the

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:19.539 
walking away he might have thought the

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:21.990 
walking away he might have thought the
six<00:06:19.779> got<00:06:19.990> a<00:06:20.020> cushion<00:06:20.370> that's<00:06:21.370> where<00:06:21.639> it's<00:06:21.759> seen

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
six got a cushion that's where it's seen

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.040 
six got a cushion that's where it's seen
again<00:06:22.389> I<00:06:22.840> hope<00:06:23.319> we<00:06:23.500> can<00:06:23.710> get<00:06:23.800> a<00:06:23.860> replay<00:06:24.250> of<00:06:24.370> that

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:33.850 

long<00:06:29.050> for<00:06:29.440> available

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.480 

gets<00:06:34.860> up<00:06:35.070> and<00:06:35.220> pops<00:06:35.550> it<00:06:35.820> in<00:06:37.070> well<00:06:38.070> a<00:06:38.100> strange

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
gets up and pops it in well a strange

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.240 
gets up and pops it in well a strange
turn<00:06:38.730> of<00:06:38.790> events<00:06:38.970> there<00:06:39.480> Danny<00:06:39.810> no<00:06:40.770> I'm<00:06:40.950> sure

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.250 
turn of events there Danny no I'm sure

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:52.200 
turn of events there Danny no I'm sure
he<00:06:41.430> didn't<00:06:41.700> get<00:06:41.820> a<00:06:41.850> rail

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:52.210 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:56.260 

three<00:06:53.210> balls<00:06:53.480> away<00:06:53.750> from<00:06:54.910> cutting<00:06:55.910> into<00:06:56.150> that

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.270 
three balls away from cutting into that

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:02.340 
three balls away from cutting into that
deficit<00:06:59.770> wouldn't<00:07:00.770> it<00:07:00.830> be<00:07:00.980> something<00:07:01.280> if

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:02.350 
deficit wouldn't it be something if

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:09.130 
deficit wouldn't it be something if
Martinez<00:07:03.350> wins<00:07:03.710> the<00:07:04.460> match<00:07:04.670> from<00:07:04.970> here<00:07:05.300> I<00:07:08.140> mean
