purebred cats stay indoors probably one
of<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.870> basic<00:01:04.199> reasons<00:01:04.379> for<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:04.890> is

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
of the basic reasons for that is

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.430 
of the basic reasons for that is
genetically<00:01:05.610> they've<00:01:06.600> been<00:01:06.869> bred<00:01:07.110> for

generations as indoor cats so a number

of them have lost some of the street
smarts<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:13.440> they<00:01:13.560> would<00:01:13.709> have<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.280> other

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:14.429 
smarts that they would have the other

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:16.460 
smarts that they would have the other
thing<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.819> you<00:01:15.000> expose<00:01:15.420> your<00:01:15.630> cat<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.110> lot<00:01:16.350> of

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:34.430 
hair I believe the only cat that doesn't
shed<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.300> the<00:01:33.450> Sphinx<00:01:33.660> because<00:01:34.080> it<00:01:34.200> doesn't

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
shed is the Sphinx because it doesn't

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.589 
shed is the Sphinx because it doesn't
have<00:01:34.530> any<00:01:34.679> hair<00:01:34.880> but<00:01:35.880> if<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.149> if<00:01:36.300> you<00:01:36.390> brush

00:01:41.839 --> 00:01:41.849 
early summer that's that's the high

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:43.790 
early summer that's that's the high
season<00:01:42.149> for<00:01:42.270> shedding<00:01:42.630> because<00:01:43.050> it<00:01:43.380> will<00:01:43.590> pick

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
season for shedding because it will pick

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.279 
season for shedding because it will pick
up<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.039> little<00:01:44.369> bit<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.610> an<00:01:44.700> undercoat<00:01:45.170> in<00:01:46.170> the
