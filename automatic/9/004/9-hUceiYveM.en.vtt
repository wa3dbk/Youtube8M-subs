mountains there's no shortage of water

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.960 
mountains there's no shortage of water
so<00:03:17.290> you<00:03:17.350> just<00:03:17.530> mix<00:03:17.740> water<00:03:18.040> with<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.490> hydrated

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
so you just mix water with the hydrated

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.640 
so you just mix water with the hydrated
food<00:03:19.240> and<00:03:19.480> then<00:03:19.600> you're<00:03:19.810> hydrated<00:03:20.380> food

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
food and then you're hydrated food

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.170 
food and then you're hydrated food
becomes<00:03:21.130> almost<00:03:21.690> normal<00:03:22.690> food<00:03:23.460> almost<00:03:24.460> so

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
becomes almost normal food almost so

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.210 
becomes almost normal food almost so
basically<00:03:25.630> the<00:03:25.870> way<00:03:26.050> that<00:03:26.080> vestibules<00:03:26.890> work

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
basically the way that vestibules work

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.830 
basically the way that vestibules work
and<00:03:27.460> the<00:03:27.550> reason<00:03:27.940> that<00:03:27.970> you<00:03:28.270> can<00:03:28.510> actually

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
and the reason that you can actually

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.320 
and the reason that you can actually
cook<00:03:29.260> inside<00:03:29.920> a<00:03:29.980> vestibule<00:03:30.670> is<00:03:30.790> because<00:03:31.150> the

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
cook inside a vestibule is because the

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.990 
cook inside a vestibule is because the
floor<00:03:31.800> the<00:03:32.800> floor<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:33.280> tent<00:03:33.550> while<00:03:33.700> there<00:03:33.910> is

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
floor the floor the tent while there is

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.930 
floor the floor the tent while there is
no<00:03:34.210> floor<00:03:34.570> in<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:35.500> vestibule<00:03:35.820> you<00:03:36.820> would

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
no floor in the vestibule you would

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.130 
no floor in the vestibule you would
never<00:03:37.120> cook<00:03:37.330> actually<00:03:37.720> inside<00:03:38.050> the<00:03:38.260> main<00:03:38.440> temp

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
never cook actually inside the main temp

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.680 
never cook actually inside the main temp
while<00:03:41.140> the<00:03:41.260> floor<00:03:41.530> of<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.770> tent<00:03:41.950> is<00:03:42.100> plastic

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
while the floor of the tent is plastic

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.330 
while the floor of the tent is plastic
and<00:03:43.690> out<00:03:43.840> here<00:03:44.080> as<00:03:44.290> you<00:03:44.440> can<00:03:44.560> see<00:03:44.740> the<00:03:44.920> floor<00:03:45.190> of

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
and out here as you can see the floor of

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.510 
and out here as you can see the floor of
the<00:03:45.430> vestibule<00:03:46.000> is<00:03:46.180> just<00:03:46.420> snow<00:03:47.220> there's<00:03:48.220> even

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
the vestibule is just snow there's even

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.550 
the vestibule is just snow there's even
a<00:03:48.610> bit<00:03:48.730> of<00:03:48.820> a<00:03:48.880> gap<00:03:49.120> underneath<00:03:49.660> the<00:03:49.990> vestibule

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
a bit of a gap underneath the vestibule

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.620 
a bit of a gap underneath the vestibule
there<00:03:50.740> a<00:03:50.770> bit<00:03:50.950> of<00:03:51.040> airflow<00:03:52.020> both<00:03:53.020> sides<00:03:54.630> the

that vestibule door before I go to sleep

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.199 
that vestibule door before I go to sleep
to<00:04:06.910> block<00:04:07.120> out<00:04:07.330> the<00:04:07.480> wind<00:04:08.910> but<00:04:09.910> there<00:04:10.090> is

to block out the wind but there is

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.370

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
cooking you just have to be really

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.789 
cooking you just have to be really
careful<00:04:16.090> that<00:04:16.450> you<00:04:16.540> have<00:04:16.660> a<00:04:16.690> reliable<00:04:17.200> stove

caused the vestibule to melt catch on

caused the vestibule to melt catch on
fire<00:04:30.790> and<00:04:31.150> look<00:04:31.540> the<00:04:31.930> whole<00:04:32.080> thing<00:04:32.290> could

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
fire and look the whole thing could

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.320 
fire and look the whole thing could
escalate<00:04:32.710> into<00:04:33.010> a<00:04:33.100> massive<00:04:33.520> disaster<00:04:34.090> because

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
escalate into a massive disaster because

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.090 
escalate into a massive disaster because
you<00:04:34.960> might<00:04:35.140> end<00:04:35.320> up<00:04:35.410> having<00:04:35.560> to<00:04:35.770> spend<00:04:35.860> the

you might end up having to spend the

you might end up having to spend the
whole<00:04:36.190> night<00:04:36.250> in<00:04:36.490> the<00:04:36.790> snow<00:04:37.030> with<00:04:38.020> no<00:04:38.230> tent

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
whole night in the snow with no tent

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.270 
whole night in the snow with no tent
that<00:04:39.400> would<00:04:39.550> not<00:04:39.730> be<00:04:39.880> fun<00:04:41.130> particularly<00:04:42.130> if<00:04:42.190> it

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
that would not be fun particularly if it

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:49.260 
that would not be fun particularly if it
was<00:04:42.400> raining<00:04:42.790> and<00:04:42.880> snowing

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.310 

it's<00:04:50.270> now<00:04:50.420> about<00:04:50.780> 7:00<00:04:51.320> a.m.<00:04:52.900> we<00:04:53.900> must<00:04:54.140> have

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
it's now about 7:00 a.m. we must have

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.440 
it's now about 7:00 a.m. we must have
had<00:04:54.500> about<00:04:54.800> 15<00:04:55.160> centimeters<00:04:55.730> of<00:04:56.180> snow

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
had about 15 centimeters of snow

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.240 
had about 15 centimeters of snow
overnight<00:04:58.630> every<00:04:59.630> hour<00:04:59.780> so<00:05:00.230> every<00:05:00.890> roughly

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
overnight every hour so every roughly

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.620 
overnight every hour so every roughly
every<00:05:01.340> two<00:05:01.700> hours<00:05:01.880> I<00:05:02.090> think<00:05:02.120> that<00:05:02.420> though<00:05:02.600> just

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
every two hours I think that though just

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.220 
every two hours I think that though just
shake<00:05:03.080> the<00:05:03.260> tent<00:05:03.560> to<00:05:03.770> just<00:05:04.070> clear<00:05:04.370> the<00:05:04.610> snow

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
shake the tent to just clear the snow

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.990 
shake the tent to just clear the snow
off<00:05:06.230> the<00:05:06.500> tent<00:05:06.830> to<00:05:07.220> stop<00:05:07.430> the<00:05:07.580> tent<00:05:07.820> from

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
off the tent to stop the tent from

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.120 
off the tent to stop the tent from
collapsing<00:05:08.570> and<00:05:09.350> now<00:05:10.240> cooking<00:05:11.240> breakfast<00:05:11.840> as

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
collapsing and now cooking breakfast as

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.340 
collapsing and now cooking breakfast as
the<00:05:13.130> porridge<00:05:13.630> it's<00:05:14.630> got<00:05:14.780> a<00:05:14.810> bit<00:05:15.020> of<00:05:15.110> water

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
the porridge it's got a bit of water

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.760 
the porridge it's got a bit of water
boiling<00:05:15.680> here<00:05:16.480> well<00:05:17.480> it's<00:05:18.320> going<00:05:18.470> to<00:05:18.560> boil

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
boiling here well it's going to boil

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:24.370 
boiling here well it's going to boil
soon<00:05:20.680> and<00:05:22.300> after<00:05:23.300> breakfast<00:05:23.690> come<00:05:23.960> back<00:05:24.200> for<00:05:24.350> a
