00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.809
 Roman fur decline in new car 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.809
 It's what's 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:17.320
 For example the work of the coating has ended 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:23.670
 This order is 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:28.460
 It is pxv 250 among the select series 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.460
 We wish you or let's pour water 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:49.650
 Compared with the strong water-repellent series of 200 , this 250 product is also 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.710
 Although it is a water repellent type a 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:59.070
 While letting the end scrape 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:01.050
 It can be said that it is a product with an emphasis on drainage 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.790
 As you can see 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.790
 How about playing rather than playing? 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.180
 Graduation and water draw a 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.110
 Disappear and disappear 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.600
 I think it is such an expression 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.600
 Then please take a look again 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.630
 I think every time is easy to understand 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:27.520
 Although a good look at the cone feeling 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.520
 It has been when passing through 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:36.890
 So I would like to hear from you 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:39.220
 Run good keys of the rain and go home 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.870
 The car has been cleaned a 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.450
 About come also castle customers 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.740
 Dirt and both 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.690
 Water is 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.130
 It cuts together 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.500
 It is a victory 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:02:01.110
 It was apx jar is 250 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:01.110
 I think this is popular in the first series Red
