00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
then we want to find where the middle of

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.550 
then we want to find where the middle of
this<00:01:40.670> pieces<00:01:41.210> so<00:01:41.630> we're<00:01:41.929> going<00:01:42.049> to<00:01:42.109> fold<00:01:42.319> it<00:01:42.469> in

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
this pieces so we're going to fold it in

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.770 
this pieces so we're going to fold it in
half<00:01:42.590> just<00:01:43.369> to<00:01:43.520> create<00:01:43.759> a<00:01:43.880> seem<00:01:44.240> to<00:01:44.450> work<00:01:44.569> with

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
half just to create a seem to work with

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.620 
half just to create a seem to work with
and<00:01:45.229> we'll<00:01:46.009> use<00:01:46.159> that<00:01:46.189> as<00:01:46.520> our<00:01:46.670> guide<00:01:46.850> next

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
and we'll use that as our guide next

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.080 
and we'll use that as our guide next
step<00:01:47.780> take<00:01:48.079> one<00:01:48.350> side<00:01:48.649> over<00:01:49.009> and<00:01:49.280> gently<00:01:49.640> fold

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
step take one side over and gently fold

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.690 
step take one side over and gently fold
it<00:01:50.299> so<00:01:50.509> the<00:01:50.600> end<00:01:50.810> is<00:01:51.170> in<00:01:51.350> the<00:01:51.439> middle<00:01:51.619> of<00:01:51.920> your

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
it so the end is in the middle of your

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.779 
it so the end is in the middle of your
piece<00:01:53.329> of<00:01:53.509> tape<00:01:53.979> do<00:01:54.979> the<00:01:55.100> same<00:01:55.340> thing<00:01:55.579> on<00:01:55.700> the

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
piece of tape do the same thing on the
