word didn't you to our knowledge this is
the<00:02:27.060> first<00:02:27.450> report<00:02:27.690> of<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.290> supernumerary

breast tissue on the foot except for it

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.910 
breast tissue on the foot except for it
does<00:02:32.130> not<00:02:32.400> have<00:02:32.820> the<00:02:33.090> mammary<00:02:33.540> glands<00:02:34.170> the

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
does not have the mammary glands the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.000 
does not have the mammary glands the
difference<00:02:35.280> is<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.580> could<00:02:35.760> not<00:02:35.970> produce<00:02:36.210> milk

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
can become very red why because we want

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.200 
can become very red why because we want
the<00:03:08.910> blood<00:03:09.270> to<00:03:09.870> be<00:03:09.990> four<00:03:10.260> steps<00:03:10.590> to<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:11.180> to<00:03:12.180> the

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
the blood to be four steps to the to the

the blood to be four steps to the to the
outer<00:03:12.480> surface<00:03:12.930> is<00:03:13.350> far<00:03:13.620> up<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.130> outer

outer surface is far up to the outer
surface<00:03:14.550> as<00:03:14.880> possible<00:03:15.480> so<00:03:15.750> that<00:03:15.780> way<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.830> air

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
surface as possible so that way the air

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.560 
surface as possible so that way the air
can<00:03:17.459> actually<00:03:18.090> cool<00:03:18.480> your<00:03:19.050> blood<00:03:19.350> so<00:03:20.190> those

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
can actually cool your blood so those

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.070 
can actually cool your blood so those
blood<00:03:21.570> vessels<00:03:21.600> become<00:03:22.140> very<00:03:22.560> dilated<00:03:23.870> if<00:03:24.870> you

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
blood vessels become very dilated if you

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.980 
blood vessels become very dilated if you
have<00:03:25.170> high<00:03:25.410> temperature<00:03:25.980> what<00:03:26.220> happens<00:03:29.990> you

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
have high temperature what happens you

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.660 
have high temperature what happens you
kill<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.380> bacteria<00:03:31.530> so<00:03:32.010> that's<00:03:32.160> a<00:03:32.250> good<00:03:32.430> thing

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
kill the bacteria so that's a good thing

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.540 
kill the bacteria so that's a good thing
right<00:03:34.370> right<00:03:35.370> so<00:03:36.060> when<00:03:36.510> you<00:03:36.660> run<00:03:36.930> fever<00:03:37.550> should

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
right right so when you run fever should

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.020 
right right so when you run fever should
you<00:03:38.850> automatically<00:03:39.600> take<00:03:39.930> an<00:03:40.080> aspirin<00:03:40.760> no<00:03:41.760> it

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
you automatically take an aspirin no it

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.570 
you automatically take an aspirin no it
needs<00:03:42.239> to<00:03:42.420> do<00:03:42.570> its<00:03:42.690> job<00:03:43.020> doesn't<00:03:43.440> it<00:03:43.650> when<00:03:44.459> you

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
needs to do its job doesn't it when you

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.240 
needs to do its job doesn't it when you
get<00:03:44.790> concerned<00:03:45.300> if<00:03:46.110> it<00:03:46.320> starts<00:03:46.680> running<00:03:47.010> over

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
get concerned if it starts running over

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.210 
get concerned if it starts running over
a<00:03:47.280> hundred<00:03:47.580> and<00:03:47.760> 102<00:03:48.709> then<00:03:49.709> you<00:03:49.830> can<00:03:50.010> start

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
a hundred and 102 then you can start

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.520 
a hundred and 102 then you can start
getting<00:03:50.340> concerned<00:03:50.880> it<00:03:51.480> makes<00:03:51.810> you<00:03:52.020> a<00:03:52.230> key

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
getting concerned it makes you a key

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.080 
getting concerned it makes you a key
because<00:03:52.830> it's<00:03:53.010> doing<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.310> job<00:03:53.400> that<00:03:53.640> it<00:03:53.910> needs

to be doing alright but so many times we
are<00:03:58.110> you<00:03:58.680> know<00:03:58.770> everybody<00:03:59.130> thinks<00:03:59.220> that<00:03:59.489> a

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
are you know everybody thinks that a

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.000 
are you know everybody thinks that a
fever<00:03:59.820> is<00:04:00.030> bad<00:04:00.239> and<00:04:00.510> a<00:04:00.600> fever<00:04:00.810> is<00:04:00.989> not<00:04:01.200> bad<00:04:01.470> if

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
fever is bad and a fever is not bad if

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.410 
fever is bad and a fever is not bad if
fever<00:04:02.280> just<00:04:02.640> means<00:04:02.820> you've<00:04:03.000> got<00:04:03.209> an<00:04:03.300> infection

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
fever just means you've got an infection

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.300 
fever just means you've got an infection
somewhere<00:04:04.350> and<00:04:04.620> you've<00:04:04.709> got<00:04:04.830> a<00:04:04.890> battle<00:04:05.160> going

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
somewhere and you've got a battle going

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.479 
somewhere and you've got a battle going
on<00:04:05.959> okay<00:04:06.959> if<00:04:07.709> you<00:04:07.830> have<00:04:07.980> low<00:04:08.250> blood

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
on okay if you have low blood

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.520 
on okay if you have low blood
temperature<00:04:09.020> signals<00:04:10.020> are<00:04:10.170> sent<00:04:10.290> to<00:04:10.410> the

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
temperature signals are sent to the

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.890 
temperature signals are sent to the
nerve<00:04:10.709> cells<00:04:11.040> to<00:04:11.340> constrict<00:04:11.940> sweat<00:04:12.450> and<00:04:12.720> blood

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
nerve cells to constrict sweat and blood

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.560 
nerve cells to constrict sweat and blood
vessels<00:04:13.370> at<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.550> temperature<00:04:15.000> still<00:04:15.270> Falls

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
muscle activity is stimulated causing

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.789 
muscle activity is stimulated causing
shivering<00:04:18.600> so<00:04:19.109> if<00:04:19.169> you<00:04:19.230> have<00:04:19.320> high<00:04:19.590> blood

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
shivering so if you have high blood

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.219 
shivering so if you have high blood
temperature<00:04:20.390> what's<00:04:21.390> going<00:04:21.600> to<00:04:21.690> rush<00:04:21.870> to<00:04:21.900> the

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
temperature what's going to rush to the

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.920 
temperature what's going to rush to the
surface<00:04:23.150> alright<00:04:24.150> so<00:04:24.419> it's<00:04:24.510> going<00:04:24.600> to<00:04:24.660> die

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
surface alright so it's going to die

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.480 
surface alright so it's going to die
alight<00:04:25.260> those<00:04:25.470> blood<00:04:25.740> vessels<00:04:25.770> you're<00:04:26.340> going

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
alight those blood vessels you're going

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.050 
alight those blood vessels you're going
to<00:04:26.550> start

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
to start

to start
wedding<00:04:27.389> you<00:04:27.570> want<00:04:27.750> to<00:04:27.840> get<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.110> blood<00:04:28.800> up

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
wedding you want to get the blood up

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.270 
wedding you want to get the blood up
closer<00:04:29.639> to<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.120> surface<00:04:30.419> of<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:31.139> body<00:04:31.290> so

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
closer to the surface of the body so

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.640 
closer to the surface of the body so
that<00:04:32.310> way<00:04:32.610> it<00:04:32.730> can<00:04:32.880> cool<00:04:33.120> down<00:04:33.180> if<00:04:33.780> you<00:04:34.440> have

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
that way it can cool down if you have

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.290 
that way it can cool down if you have
low<00:04:35.040> blood<00:04:35.310> temperature<00:04:36.590> you<00:04:37.590> want<00:04:37.889> to<00:04:38.310> keep

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
low blood temperature you want to keep

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.780 
low blood temperature you want to keep
it<00:04:39.450> as<00:04:39.600> warm<00:04:39.990> as<00:04:40.139> possible<00:04:40.230> so<00:04:41.070> your<00:04:41.460> blood

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
it as warm as possible so your blood

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.290 
it as warm as possible so your blood
vessels<00:04:41.820> are<00:04:42.330> going<00:04:42.510> to<00:04:42.630> constrict<00:04:43.169> down<00:04:43.560> and

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
vessels are going to constrict down and

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.240 
vessels are going to constrict down and
if<00:04:45.300> you're<00:04:45.570> cold<00:04:45.870> enough<00:04:46.200> then<00:04:46.620> you're<00:04:47.130> going

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
if you're cold enough then you're going

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.340 
if you're cold enough then you're going
to<00:04:47.340> start<00:04:47.520> shivering<00:04:47.930> right<00:04:48.930> and<00:04:49.110> remember

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
to start shivering right and remember

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.700 
to start shivering right and remember
the<00:04:49.440> arrector<00:04:49.800> pili<00:04:49.950> is<00:04:50.760> going<00:04:50.970> to<00:04:51.030> cause

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
the arrector pili is going to cause

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.700 
the arrector pili is going to cause
goosebumps<00:04:52.710> to<00:04:52.919> occur<00:04:54.020> but<00:04:55.020> any<00:04:55.169> questions<00:04:55.590> on

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
goosebumps to occur but any questions on

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.820 
goosebumps to occur but any questions on
that<00:04:57.500> feeling<00:04:58.500> of<00:04:58.620> wounds<00:05:00.680> inflammation<00:05:01.680> the

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
that feeling of wounds inflammation the

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.190 
that feeling of wounds inflammation the
area's<00:05:02.250> blood<00:05:02.550> vessels<00:05:03.000> become<00:05:03.180> dilated<00:05:04.080> and

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
area's blood vessels become dilated and

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.379 
area's blood vessels become dilated and
permeable<00:05:04.650> forcing<00:05:05.280> fluids<00:05:05.460> into<00:05:06.270> the

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
permeable forcing fluids into the

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.080 
permeable forcing fluids into the
affected<00:05:06.870> area<00:05:07.169> this<00:05:07.710> provides<00:05:08.160> oxygen<00:05:08.400> and

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
affected area this provides oxygen and

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.290 
affected area this provides oxygen and
nutrients<00:05:09.660> to<00:05:09.660> promote<00:05:10.139> healing<00:05:10.580> so<00:05:11.580> this<00:05:12.060> is

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
nutrients to promote healing so this is

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.780 
nutrients to promote healing so this is
why<00:05:12.600> when<00:05:12.990> you<00:05:13.110> have<00:05:13.290> an<00:05:13.380> infected<00:05:13.919> area<00:05:14.310> that

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
why when you have an infected area that

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.210 
why when you have an infected area that
it<00:05:14.970> area<00:05:15.389> will<00:05:15.660> turn<00:05:16.020> red<00:05:16.940> that<00:05:17.940> make<00:05:18.150> sense

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
it area will turn red that make sense

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.620 
it area will turn red that make sense
all<00:05:20.220> right<00:05:20.520> you<00:05:21.030> want<00:05:21.210> them<00:05:21.389> to<00:05:21.510> become

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
all right you want them to become

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.350 
all right you want them to become
dilated<00:05:22.560> you<00:05:22.680> want<00:05:22.860> as<00:05:22.979> much<00:05:23.250> fluid<00:05:23.910> up<00:05:24.090> there

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
dilated you want as much fluid up there

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.320 
dilated you want as much fluid up there
as<00:05:24.600> possible<00:05:25.250> get<00:05:26.250> more<00:05:26.460> white<00:05:26.700> blood<00:05:27.030> cells

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
as possible get more white blood cells

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.960 
as possible get more white blood cells
up<00:05:27.540> there<00:05:27.780> more<00:05:27.990> oxygen<00:05:28.710> and<00:05:28.889> nutrients<00:05:29.400> so

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
up there more oxygen and nutrients so

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.050 
up there more oxygen and nutrients so
the<00:05:30.090> cells<00:05:30.389> that<00:05:30.660> are<00:05:30.930> there<00:05:31.320> can<00:05:32.100> do<00:05:32.250> that<00:05:32.460> do

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
the cells that are there can do that do

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.500 
the cells that are there can do that do
their<00:05:33.210> jobs<00:05:33.479> that<00:05:33.720> they<00:05:33.840> need<00:05:34.050> to<00:05:34.080> do

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
their jobs that they need to do

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.640 
their jobs that they need to do
epithelial<00:05:36.510> cells<00:05:36.780> will<00:05:37.080> divide<00:05:37.200> very

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
epithelial cells will divide very
