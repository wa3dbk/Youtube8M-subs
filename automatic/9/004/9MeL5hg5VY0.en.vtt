into system setup mode when you're

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.080 
into system setup mode when you're
setting<00:00:19.529> up<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.740> new<00:00:19.770> plane<00:00:20.220> or<00:00:20.490> one<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:21.029> you

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
setting up a new plane or one that you

setting up a new plane or one that you
already<00:00:21.210> have<00:00:21.539> that<00:00:21.779> has<00:00:21.990> two<00:00:22.289> aileron<00:00:22.859> servos

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:23.359 
already have that has two aileron servos

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.029 
already have that has two aileron servos
you<00:00:24.359> can<00:00:24.539> do<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:24.869> what<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.619> do<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:25.949> go

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
you can do this what you do is to go

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.570 
you can do this what you do is to go
down<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.480> wing<00:00:27.480> type<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:27.990> then<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:29.039> your<00:00:29.160> wing

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
down to wing type and then in your wing

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.550 
down to wing type and then in your wing
you<00:00:29.730> set<00:00:29.970> flap<00:00:30.240> around<00:00:30.420> very<00:00:31.050> simple<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.529> just

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
you set flap around very simple it just

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.950 
you set flap around very simple it just
shows<00:00:31.890> two<00:00:32.550> servos<00:00:32.940> one<00:00:33.210> for<00:00:33.420> each<00:00:33.510> aileron

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
shows two servos one for each aileron

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.780 
shows two servos one for each aileron
and<00:00:34.140> they<00:00:34.620> can<00:00:34.770> be<00:00:34.860> used<00:00:35.010> as<00:00:35.130> flap<00:00:35.370> around<00:00:35.520> so

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
and they can be used as flap around so

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.080 
and they can be used as flap around so
that's<00:00:35.940> all<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.180> do<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.540> then<00:00:36.980> you<00:00:37.980> go<00:00:38.879> and

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
that's all you do and then you go and

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.680 
that's all you do and then you go and
just<00:00:40.040> start<00:00:41.040> up<00:00:41.190> your<00:00:41.309> transmitter<00:00:41.879> this

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
just start up your transmitter this

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.540 
just start up your transmitter this
would<00:00:42.870> just<00:00:43.020> be<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.320> main<00:00:43.469> screen<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.399> let<00:00:44.489> me

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
would just be the main screen so let me

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.580 
would just be the main screen so let me
go<00:00:44.610> ahead<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:44.940> plug<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.420> mini<00:00:45.960> Fontana<00:00:46.379> X

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
go ahead and plug in the mini Fontana X

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:57.549 
go ahead and plug in the mini Fontana X
now

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.799 

so<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.620> set<00:00:58.949> up<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.280> flap<00:01:00.059> around<00:01:00.239> wing<00:01:00.540> type

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
so you set up the flap around wing type

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.319 
so you set up the flap around wing type
and<00:01:01.079> then<00:01:01.559> once<00:01:01.739> you're<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:01.980> here<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:03.090> go<00:01:03.269> to

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
and then once you're in here you go to

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.990 
and then once you're in here you go to
your<00:01:03.540> flap<00:01:04.170> system<00:01:04.739> I've<00:01:05.220> already<00:01:05.430> set<00:01:05.820> mine

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
your flap system I've already set mine

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.749 
your flap system I've already set mine
up<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.710> when<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.799> originally<00:01:08.310> go<00:01:08.430> into<00:01:08.610> here

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
up and when you originally go into here

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:10.039 
up and when you originally go into here
it'll<00:01:08.880> say<00:01:09.030> inhibit<00:01:09.479> because<00:01:09.720> it's<00:01:09.840> turned

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
it'll say inhibit because it's turned

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.109 
it'll say inhibit because it's turned
off<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.440> just<00:01:10.560> click<00:01:11.190> on<00:01:11.310> inhibit<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.850> scroll

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
off you just click on inhibit and scroll

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.969 
off you just click on inhibit and scroll
over<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.479> then<00:01:12.960> you'll<00:01:13.110> get<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.350> menu<00:01:13.649> and

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
over and then you'll get this menu and

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.790 
over and then you'll get this menu and
it'll<00:01:14.550> all<00:01:14.640> be<00:01:14.670> zeros<00:01:15.149> now<00:01:16.050> I<00:01:16.080> set<00:01:16.560> mine<00:01:16.770> up

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
it'll all be zeros now I set mine up

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.910 
it'll all be zeros now I set mine up
with<00:01:17.159> 20<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.729> then<00:01:18.390> negative<00:01:18.780> 20<00:01:19.170> that's<00:01:19.800> a

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
with 20 and then negative 20 that's a

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.380 
with 20 and then negative 20 that's a
three<00:01:20.159> position<00:01:20.340> switch<00:01:20.790> as<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.060> can<00:01:21.270> see

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
three position switch as you can see

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.810 
three position switch as you can see
here<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:21.690> is<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.990> switch<00:01:22.200> at<00:01:22.350> time<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.820> the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
here this is the switch at time and the

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.690 
here this is the switch at time and the
top<00:01:24.560> number<00:01:25.560> refers<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.070> when<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.460> switch<00:01:26.670> is

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
top number refers to when the switch is

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.669 
top number refers to when the switch is
up<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.630> middle<00:01:27.899> number<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.259> when<00:01:28.410> the<00:01:28.500> switch

00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:28.679 
up the middle number is when the switch

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:30.350 
up the middle number is when the switch
is<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.039> middle<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.940> bottom<00:01:30.240> number

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
is in the middle and the bottom number

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.600 
is in the middle and the bottom number
is<00:01:30.570> when<00:01:30.690> the<00:01:30.780> switch<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:30.990> in<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.259> bottom<00:01:31.649> so

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
is when the switch is in the bottom so

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.080 
is when the switch is in the bottom so
there's<00:01:32.759> three<00:01:32.910> positions<00:01:33.360> like<00:01:33.509> we<00:01:33.660> see<00:01:35.090> so

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
there's three positions like we see so

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.120 
there's three positions like we see so
when<00:01:36.240> lines<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.720> center<00:01:37.080> I<00:01:37.289> have<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
when lines in the center I have the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.460 
when lines in the center I have the
wings<00:01:39.200> flat<00:01:40.200> when<00:01:41.039> I<00:01:41.070> hit<00:01:41.280> mine<00:01:41.490> up<00:01:42.289> turns<00:01:43.289> into

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
wings flat when I hit mine up turns into

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.120 
wings flat when I hit mine up turns into
spoiler<00:01:43.950> arms<00:01:44.270> when<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.300> hit<00:01:45.420> mine<00:01:45.600> down<00:01:46.130> turns

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
spoiler arms when I hit mine down turns

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.100 
spoiler arms when I hit mine down turns
into<00:01:47.310> flap<00:01:47.580> arounds<00:01:47.940> and<00:01:50.270> of<00:01:51.270> course<00:01:51.509> ailerons

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
into flap arounds and of course ailerons

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.770 
into flap arounds and of course ailerons
works<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.220> same<00:01:53.429> no<00:01:53.729> matter<00:01:53.909> where<00:01:54.090> they<00:01:54.270> are

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.059
