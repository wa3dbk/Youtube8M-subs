when I first picked up the box it was

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.380 
when I first picked up the box it was
noticeably<00:00:46.469> heavier<00:00:46.739> than<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.340> ps4<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.000> mean<00:00:48.360> I

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
noticeably heavier than the ps4 I mean I

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.150 
noticeably heavier than the ps4 I mean I
knew<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.809> came<00:00:48.960> with<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.260> Kinect<00:00:49.620> but<00:00:49.920> that

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
knew it came with the Kinect but that

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.090 
knew it came with the Kinect but that
does<00:00:50.370> not<00:00:50.399> weigh<00:00:50.820> much<00:00:51.120> by<00:00:51.420> itself<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.649> Xbox

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
does not weigh much by itself the Xbox

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.069 
does not weigh much by itself the Xbox
one<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.430> much<00:00:53.699> bigger<00:00:53.940> than<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.180> ps4<00:00:54.360> thus

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
one is much bigger than the ps4 thus

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.229 
one is much bigger than the ps4 thus
weighing<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.649> lot<00:00:55.829> more<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.640> inside<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.120> box

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239

given me that money now would have made
the<00:01:44.009> same<00:01:44.340> thing<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:45.149> mean<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.930> does<00:01:46.079> have

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
the same thing I mean it does have

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.080 
the same thing I mean it does have
improved<00:01:46.649> buttons<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.100> course<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.579> gamepad

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
improved buttons of course the gamepad

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.300 
improved buttons of course the gamepad
is<00:01:48.329> more<00:01:48.570> clicky<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.020> analog<00:01:49.619> feel<00:01:49.979> more

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
is more clicky and analog feel more

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.340 
is more clicky and analog feel more
smooth<00:01:50.670> giving<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.090> precise<00:01:51.450> feeling<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.170> it

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
smooth giving a precise feeling so it

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.319 
smooth giving a precise feeling so it
was<00:01:52.470> an<00:01:52.590> overall<00:01:52.920> upgrade<00:01:53.369> for<00:01:53.579> sure<00:01:53.850> the

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
was an overall upgrade for sure the

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.209 
was an overall upgrade for sure the
vibrating<00:01:54.750> motors<00:01:55.140> also<00:01:55.560> have<00:01:55.710> been<00:01:55.860> improved

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
vibrating motors also have been improved

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.100 
vibrating motors also have been improved
providing<00:01:56.820> better<00:01:57.030> feedback<00:01:57.509> during<00:01:57.750> games

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
providing better feedback during games

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.870 
providing better feedback during games
and<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.530> battery<00:01:58.740> box<00:01:59.009> has<00:01:59.280> been<00:01:59.490> integrated

into the controller's frame and does not

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.120 
into the controller's frame and does not
stick<00:02:02.610> out<00:02:02.759> like<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.270> previous<00:02:03.750> model<00:02:04.229> moving

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130

on to the headset I can say that it is

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.809 
on to the headset I can say that it is
much<00:02:07.020> better<00:02:07.200> than<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.439> ps4<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:08.220> it's<00:02:08.399> not<00:02:08.640> an

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
much better than the ps4 is it's not an

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.550 
much better than the ps4 is it's not an

this<00:02:30.630> is<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.020> Kinect<00:02:31.350> sensor<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:32.130> it

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
this is the Kinect sensor and it

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.220 
this is the Kinect sensor and it
basically<00:02:32.700> tracks<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.150> users<00:02:33.510> movements<00:02:33.780> and

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
basically tracks the users movements and

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.750 
basically tracks the users movements and
it<00:02:34.320> can<00:02:34.440> do<00:02:34.530> some<00:02:34.740> cool<00:02:34.980> stuff<00:02:35.280> like<00:02:35.340> using

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
it can do some cool stuff like using

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.180 
it can do some cool stuff like using
your<00:02:35.910> hands<00:02:36.240> to<00:02:36.450> resize<00:02:36.810> windows<00:02:37.260> or<00:02:37.650> even

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
stuff like that if you are too lazy to

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.540 
stuff like that if you are too lazy to
use<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:48.959> controller<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.920> design<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.459> the

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
use the controller the design of the

use the controller the design of the
Xbox<00:02:50.970> one<00:02:51.300> is<00:02:51.510> not<00:02:51.720> that<00:02:51.959> bad<00:02:52.200> as<00:02:52.350> some<00:02:52.500> people

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
Xbox one is not that bad as some people

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.620 
Xbox one is not that bad as some people
say<00:02:53.010> I<00:02:53.040> mean<00:02:53.370> it<00:02:53.489> obviously<00:02:53.520> doesn't<00:02:54.300> compare

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
say I mean it obviously doesn't compare

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.930 
say I mean it obviously doesn't compare
to<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.810> ps4<00:02:55.470> but<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.130> could<00:02:56.340> use<00:02:56.489> something<00:02:56.760> to

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
to the ps4 but it could use something to

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.640 
to the ps4 but it could use something to
spice<00:02:57.360> it<00:02:57.390> up<00:02:57.720> instead<00:02:58.110> of<00:02:58.200> looking<00:02:58.440> like<00:02:58.500> a

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
spice it up instead of looking like a

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.460 
spice it up instead of looking like a
cable<00:02:59.100> box<00:02:59.250> or<00:02:59.550> DVR<00:03:00.209> on<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.780> back<00:03:00.930> of<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.200> Xbox

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
like the Xbox one I think the software

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.370 
like the Xbox one I think the software
is<00:03:35.700> great<00:03:35.910> and<00:03:36.209> much<00:03:36.390> more<00:03:36.630> advanced<00:03:36.959> than<00:03:37.230> the

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.860 
is great and much more advanced than the
ps4<00:03:37.680> but<00:03:38.580> when<00:03:38.670> it<00:03:38.760> comes<00:03:38.910> down<00:03:39.060> to<00:03:39.120> console

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
ps4 but when it comes down to console

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.780 
ps4 but when it comes down to console
and<00:03:40.110> control<00:03:40.650> design<00:03:40.950> I'm<00:03:41.160> leaning<00:03:41.459> towards

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.080 
and control design I'm leaning towards
the<00:03:41.910> ps4<00:03:42.590> however<00:03:43.590> I<00:03:43.620> will<00:03:43.860> always<00:03:44.070> choose<00:03:44.459> PC

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
the ps4 however I will always choose PC

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.120 
the ps4 however I will always choose PC
over<00:03:45.330> any<00:03:45.510> console<00:03:45.989> but<00:03:46.650> I<00:03:46.680> would<00:03:46.860> like<00:03:46.980> to
