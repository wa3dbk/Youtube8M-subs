00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:06.520
 It is the most beautiful thing I have seen 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.520
 to 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.060
 there are very good youtube girls 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.010
 here to your gamer and good guys we are 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:29.250
 in a new review of the baby world 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:34.140
 animals and good to tell you that this mode 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:37.710
 is for version 1.6 point 41 points 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.280
 7 points 2 and 1.7 point diaz good guys 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.559
 this way baby animas add this look 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.900
 and simply as they say title 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.780
 Fuck that he does they're just giving good 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:52.430
 as it says in the title when you you 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.440
 you get good then 2 burn and you work 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.310
 and since a little bit of that nobody 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.310
 carrots where the carrots are 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.310
 carrots 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.500
 they fall in love 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.869
 and have this little thing forget this little thing 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.009
 It is not the normal pig because this speck 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:28.050
 adds these little things when separating 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:32.520
 animals when they have relationships 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:34.200
 they release a different baby, not the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.780
 that we usually know are the 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.530
 big heads but they are super cool 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:45.270
 it's like the water that you have to 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:48.930
 grab them and it would hit all of Asia 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.400
 well this is the same with cows that 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.400
 the cows I think it was 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:00.549
 that were the cows I do not remember 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:04.450
 was the little thing is here on the web 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:08.890
 The two of you here go to the vaquita 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:12.140
 little god of mine how cool is not you 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.410
 so super good is not some 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.830
 It makes you want to suck everything in the 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.830
 head 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.980
 and it also happens with the wolves that the 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.310
 wolves if I'm not mistaken it was meat 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.310
 cooked 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.080
 and for you you too and berna 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.960
 rock 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.670
 and this I did see that it was a beauty or 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.670
 be you shit where is 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:46.450
 look how beautiful it is like a mini 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.300
 Lobito or super 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.950
 they are super well that is the people I 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.950
 I like I love no no no 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:05.659
 well we'll get it out at the end of the video 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:09.019
 good and also happens with the chickens that 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:13.220
 to see if I'm right was with seeds 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.810
 here are the seeds 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.959
 Y 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.849
 and the chickens are super beautiful this 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.180
 chick will like our 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:26.720
 dear friend is good that she likes 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.060
 much the ducklings and the and this is more what 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.690
 more similar to a duckling 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.810
 I've seen good let's go to the sheep 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:39.170
 I think they also have their little things 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:43.180
 I do not know how bees mate with 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.829
 this sure not with the web 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.900
 maybe they could with the hosts 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.750
 never have sheep varied to mines and 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.380
 separate 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:55.050
 Let's see 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:57.450
 and you will see this little thing that is visca visca 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.890
 authentic 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.140
 well this is what we add 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.930
 tested with some other animals and not 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.060
 it has worked out for me but this is what 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.430
 they added for as long as I hope that the 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:15.820
 vegetable update it for the version 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:20.230
 1.8 and bring more more beauty more 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:23.980
 little animals and good guys tell you what 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:26.140
 last to finish the video that in 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.420
 the description has how to install the 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:31.690
 monkey how to install this mode but how 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:34.060
 install all minecraft modes now 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.740
 only the forge change it for the version 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:40.230
 who want for example is this 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:42.639
 version of forge would be version 1.10 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.370
 1.7 point 10 that is the version that I am 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.830
 using now but it is already to your liking or 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.280
 be the taste to the version they give me 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.280
 Juarez 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:56.640
 the video is from a youtuber partner 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.800
 I saw it, I loved it, it was super good 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:02.640
 his life is not the same, I 'm not helping a 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.800
 little bit by sending you subs moving that you 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.530
 go watch your video and to settle 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.450
 this way those who do not know why there 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.270
 some who do know that it is very common 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.520
 Some know it because they are safe 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.350
 entering new people new to minecraft 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.210
 perhaps 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:23.330
 we're going to come to that mode and it's 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:25.190
 when it is a different installation to 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.910
 the normal 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:32.630
 to install is forged to go to the folder 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:35.990
 of mods and put the mod inside the 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:39.260
 folder that is different from that already from a 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:42.100
 video at the end installing the good engine 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.100
 goodbye guys
