00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.009
 yes here 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:01.219
 today in our release is the death machine 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:54.430
 death car loading procedure 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:58.300
 a very long and tedious process to start 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:02.760
 you need to wind off the trunks after 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.760
 what you need to pull the gum on the trunk 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.570
 and so you need to do with all three 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.570
 trunks 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:59.310
 she has 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.830
 three barrel rotating 360 degrees 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:27.780
 laser grip 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:27.780
 target designator tapes with cartridges and 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.370
 fire control module 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.730
 which can also be used 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.730
 separate from the weapon 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:04:05.250
 now let's try out of it 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:04:13.700
 shoot as you can see the spread is very 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:13.700
 big so not all killed 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:48.289
 as I said earlier 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:50.590
 there is a remote death machine 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:50.590
 control 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.639
 now I will show it to you 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:21.510
 thanks for watching this video your 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.810
 support encourages me to release 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:28.740
 the following reviews do not forget also 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:32.120

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.120
