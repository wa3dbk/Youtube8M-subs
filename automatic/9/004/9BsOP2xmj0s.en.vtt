there or the setups people have made on

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.909 
there or the setups people have made on
there<00:05:32.580> but<00:05:33.090> honestly<00:05:33.389> is<00:05:33.539> a<00:05:33.570> bit<00:05:33.810> of<00:05:33.900> a<00:05:34.050> handful

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 
there but honestly is a bit of a handful

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:36.830 
there but honestly is a bit of a handful
and<00:05:35.130> they're<00:05:35.310> not<00:05:35.490> really<00:05:35.669> listed<00:05:36.270> very<00:05:36.509> well

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
and they're not really listed very well

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.080 
and they're not really listed very well
in<00:05:37.139> it<00:05:37.289> it's<00:05:37.680> just<00:05:38.039> some<00:05:38.610> of<00:05:38.729> them<00:05:38.849> on<00:05:38.969> the

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
in it it's just some of them on the

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.629 
in it it's just some of them on the
front<00:05:39.360> I<00:05:39.479> absolutely<00:05:39.659> awful<00:05:40.229> honestly<00:05:40.949> and<00:05:41.219> it

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:41.639 
front I absolutely awful honestly and it

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:43.370 
front I absolutely awful honestly and it
just<00:05:41.849> takes<00:05:42.030> so<00:05:42.270> much<00:05:42.449> searching<00:05:42.750> because<00:05:43.110> the

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 
just takes so much searching because the

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.370 
just takes so much searching because the
filters<00:05:43.800> of<00:05:43.949> rubbish<00:05:44.340> in<00:05:44.490> it<00:05:44.610> is<00:05:44.759> just<00:05:45.180> it

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
filters of rubbish in it is just it

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.920 
filters of rubbish in it is just it
really<00:05:46.380> needs<00:05:46.710> to<00:05:46.800> be<00:05:46.919> more<00:05:47.849> need<00:05:48.210> for<00:05:48.240> speeded

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
really needs to be more need for speeded

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.050 
really needs to be more need for speeded
simplified<00:05:49.800> basically<00:05:50.610> it's<00:05:50.759> the<00:05:50.849> way<00:05:50.940> I'm

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
simplified basically it's the way I'm

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.129 
simplified basically it's the way I'm
putting<00:05:51.300> out<00:05:51.389> i<00:05:51.419> think<00:05:51.570> need<00:05:51.810> for<00:05:51.960> speed<00:05:52.110> is

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:52.139 
putting out i think need for speed is

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:53.749 
putting out i think need for speed is
one<00:05:52.349> of<00:05:52.440> those<00:05:52.500> games<00:05:52.680> that<00:05:52.800> really<00:05:53.250> will<00:05:53.460> do

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 
one of those games that really will do

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
that kind of thing well so there are my

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.189 
that kind of thing well so there are my
main<00:05:56.370> wants<00:05:56.909> probably<00:05:57.539> think<00:05:57.719> of<00:05:57.780> more<00:05:57.930> later

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
main wants probably think of more later

00:05:58.199 --> 00:05:59.779 
main wants probably think of more later
but<00:05:58.380> well<00:05:59.069> wait<00:05:59.219> till<00:05:59.370> it's<00:05:59.490> actually
