00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.630 
here and change it really fast really
quickly<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:42.200> that's<00:01:43.200> about<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.619> if<00:01:43.860> your<00:01:44.189> ISO

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
quickly and that's about it if your ISO

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.060 
quickly and that's about it if your ISO
is<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.689> film<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.200> put<00:01:46.409> into<00:01:46.560> your

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
is in the film that you put into your

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.560 
is in the film that you put into your
back<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.579> what's<00:01:47.970> complete<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.450> was

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
back and what's complete it was

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.600 
back and what's complete it was
completely<00:01:49.020> awesome<00:01:49.560> about<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.130> or<00:01:50.490> its

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
completely awesome about this or its

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.490 
completely awesome about this or its
really<00:01:50.820> cool<00:01:51.030> about<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.360> one<00:01:51.540> camera<00:01:52.320> is

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
really cool about this one camera is

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.399 
really cool about this one camera is
that<00:01:53.090> it's<00:01:54.090> completely<00:01:54.240> modular<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.259> can

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
that it's completely modular so you can

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.080 
that it's completely modular so you can
take<00:01:55.560> off<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.710> back<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.460> if<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.820> don't<00:01:57.030> know

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
take off the back and if you don't know

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.010 
take off the back and if you don't know
what<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:57.360> back<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.780> your<00:01:58.469> film<00:01:58.829> goes<00:01:59.009> in<00:01:59.189> here

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
what this back is your film goes in here

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.570 
what this back is your film goes in here
this<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.170> where<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.380> roll<00:02:01.560> your<00:02:01.680> film<00:02:01.950> in<00:02:02.070> and

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
this is where you roll your film in and

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.020 
this is where you roll your film in and
you<00:02:02.700> put<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:02.939> in<00:02:03.030> there<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:04.759> put<00:02:05.759> on<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.909> back

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
you put it in there and put on the back

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.280 
you put it in there and put on the back
of<00:02:06.150> your<00:02:06.210> camera<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.540> you're<00:02:06.750> good<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:06.960> go<00:02:06.990> and

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
of your camera and you're good to go and

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.010 
of your camera and you're good to go and
so<00:02:07.920> this<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.550> back<00:02:09.739> this<00:02:10.739> is<00:02:10.979> the

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
so this is the back this is the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.360 
so this is the back this is the
viewfinder<00:02:13.020> and<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.590> can<00:02:13.739> put<00:02:13.890> different

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
viewfinder and you can put different

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.250 
viewfinder and you can put different
view<00:02:14.700> finders<00:02:15.000> on<00:02:15.120> this<00:02:15.270> camera<00:02:15.480> one<00:02:16.050> that's<00:02:16.200> a

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
view finders on this camera one that's a

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.500 
view finders on this camera one that's a
waist<00:02:16.440> level<00:02:16.650> that<00:02:16.890> you<00:02:16.980> can<00:02:17.209> look<00:02:18.209> at<00:02:18.330> like

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
waist level that you can look at like

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.229 
waist level that you can look at like
this<00:02:18.890> or<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:20.040> can<00:02:20.130> just<00:02:20.250> they<00:02:20.819> have<00:02:20.970> some

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
this or you can just they have some

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.750 
this or you can just they have some
other<00:02:21.800> similar<00:02:22.800> view<00:02:23.130> finders<00:02:23.400> like<00:02:23.550> this

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
other similar view finders like this

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.090 
other similar view finders like this
that<00:02:23.940> have<00:02:24.060> different<00:02:24.660> features<00:02:24.840> on<00:02:25.140> them<00:02:25.260> and

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
that have different features on them and

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.770 
that have different features on them and
then<00:02:26.220> this<00:02:26.400> is<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:27.120> can<00:02:27.239> take<00:02:27.270> off<00:02:27.450> your<00:02:27.600> lines

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
then this is you can take off your lines

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.180 
then this is you can take off your lines
you<00:02:28.110> know<00:02:28.200> just<00:02:28.590> like<00:02:28.650> you<00:02:28.770> can<00:02:28.920> with<00:02:28.950> any

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
simple it has a multi exposure feature

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.140 
simple it has a multi exposure feature
on<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.200> which<00:02:55.200> lets<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.130> take<00:02:56.190> several

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
on it which lets you take several

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.530 
on it which lets you take several
exposures<00:02:58.019> on<00:02:58.350> one<00:02:58.760> frame<00:02:59.760> and<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.420> has<00:03:00.510> a

exposures on one frame and it has a

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.479 
exposures on one frame and it has a
mirror<00:03:00.870> up<00:03:01.049> in<00:03:01.350> case<00:03:01.470> you<00:03:01.650> have<00:03:01.830> lunges<00:03:02.400> that

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
mirror up in case you have lunges that

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.170 
mirror up in case you have lunges that
have<00:03:02.870> that<00:03:03.870> require<00:03:04.200> mirror<00:03:04.500> up<00:03:04.970> never<00:03:05.970> shot

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
have that require mirror up never shot

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.930 
have that require mirror up never shot
with<00:03:06.329> those<00:03:06.450> kind<00:03:07.350> of<00:03:07.549> confusing<00:03:08.549> as<00:03:08.670> far<00:03:08.850> as

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
with those kind of confusing as far as

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:09.979 
with those kind of confusing as far as
you<00:03:09.030> know<00:03:09.120> how<00:03:09.269> they<00:03:09.390> work<00:03:09.570> and<00:03:09.660> how<00:03:09.780> you<00:03:09.810> would

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
you know how they work and how you would

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.590 
you know how they work and how you would
focus<00:03:10.230> but<00:03:11.190> I<00:03:11.220> mean<00:03:11.700> you<00:03:12.209> know<00:03:12.299> if<00:03:12.390> that's<00:03:12.480> what

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
focus but I mean you know if that's what

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.110 
focus but I mean you know if that's what
you're<00:03:12.810> going<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:13.019> go<00:03:13.260> for<00:03:13.470> it

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
you're going to go for it

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.930 
you're going to go for it
and<00:03:15.120> this<00:03:15.299> viewfinder<00:03:15.570> has<00:03:16.370> different<00:03:17.370> as

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
and this viewfinder has different as

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.150 
and this viewfinder has different as
your<00:03:18.690> exposure<00:03:19.019> compensation<00:03:19.200> which

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
your exposure compensation which

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.009 
your exposure compensation which
basically<00:03:20.609> I<00:03:20.640> believe<00:03:21.359> your<00:03:21.450> meter<00:03:21.660> is<00:03:21.870> in

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
basically I believe your meter is in

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.990 
basically I believe your meter is in
here<00:03:22.200> because<00:03:22.440> when<00:03:22.620> I<00:03:22.650> look<00:03:22.859> inside<00:03:23.100> of<00:03:23.160> it<00:03:23.400> on

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
here because when I look inside of it on

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.750 
here because when I look inside of it on
the<00:03:24.150> left<00:03:24.390> is<00:03:24.510> a<00:03:24.540> little<00:03:25.100> indicator<00:03:26.100> of<00:03:26.459> your

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
the left is a little indicator of your

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.199 
the left is a little indicator of your
shutter<00:03:27.000> speed<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.450> your<00:03:27.540> aperture<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:29.209> it

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
shutter speed and your aperture and it

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.819 
shutter speed and your aperture and it
blinks<00:03:30.600> whenever<00:03:30.870> it's<00:03:31.019> either<00:03:31.230> underexposed

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
blinks whenever it's either underexposed

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.979 
blinks whenever it's either underexposed
or<00:03:31.950> overexposed<00:03:32.010> and<00:03:32.880> so<00:03:33.570> that's<00:03:33.750> a<00:03:33.840> really

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
or overexposed and so that's a really

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.470 
or overexposed and so that's a really
cool<00:03:34.200> thing<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.470> have<00:03:34.820> this<00:03:35.820> camera<00:03:36.090> cost<00:03:36.359> me

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
cool thing to have this camera cost me

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.690 
cool thing to have this camera cost me
$400<00:03:37.350> which<00:03:37.769> you<00:03:38.160> know<00:03:38.250> if<00:03:38.370> you<00:03:38.459> think<00:03:38.609> about

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
$400 which you know if you think about

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.060 
$400 which you know if you think about
how<00:03:39.030> much<00:03:39.180> it<00:03:39.359> costs<00:03:39.600> back<00:03:39.780> in<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.049> day<00:03:40.260> that

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
how much it costs back in the day that
