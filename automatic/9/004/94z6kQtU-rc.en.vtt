00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:46.460 
good ice we've had events there already
with<00:05:45.000> you<00:05:45.210> know<00:05:45.330> skating<00:05:45.630> and<00:05:45.930> games<00:05:46.199> and

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
with you know skating and games and

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.570 
with you know skating and games and
things<00:05:46.680> like<00:05:46.830> that<00:05:46.889> where<00:05:47.310> I<00:05:47.340> think<00:05:47.430> you're

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
things like that where I think you're

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.129 
things like that where I think you're
gonna<00:05:47.669> have<00:05:47.849> a<00:05:47.880> real<00:05:48.120> good<00:05:48.150> source<00:05:48.570> of<00:05:48.720> surface

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 
gonna have a real good source of surface

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:51.439 
gonna have a real good source of surface
that's<00:05:49.460> maintained<00:05:50.460> the<00:05:50.610> proper<00:05:51.030> way<00:05:51.180> and<00:05:51.360> I

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:51.449 
that's maintained the proper way and I

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:53.000 
that's maintained the proper way and I
think<00:05:51.510> the<00:05:51.720> temperature<00:05:52.169> outside<00:05:52.349> will<00:05:52.770> allow

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.010 
think the temperature outside will allow

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.490 
think the temperature outside will allow
it<00:05:53.190> to<00:05:53.310> be<00:05:53.490> in<00:05:54.030> a<00:05:54.330> situation<00:05:55.110> we're<00:05:55.199> gonna<00:05:55.320> have

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
it to be in a situation we're gonna have

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.379 
it to be in a situation we're gonna have
good<00:05:55.650> ice<00:05:55.830> and<00:05:56.159> and<00:05:56.310> hopefully<00:05:56.789> it's<00:05:57.090> a<00:05:57.180> great

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:57.389 
good ice and and hopefully it's a great

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:58.790 
good ice and and hopefully it's a great
game<00:05:57.630> and<00:05:57.780> it<00:05:57.870> adds<00:05:58.020> to<00:05:58.169> the<00:05:58.260> game<00:05:58.409> and<00:05:58.530> doesn't

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
game and it adds to the game and doesn't

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.230

take<00:05:58.889> away<00:05:59.070> from<00:05:59.190> any<00:05:59.520> of<00:05:59.669> the<00:05:59.760> skill<00:06:00.030> and<00:06:00.150> the

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:20.450 
cool it was the atmosphere and

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:21.640 
cool it was the atmosphere and
everything<00:06:20.660> so<00:06:20.990> that's<00:06:21.140> one<00:06:21.290> thing<00:06:21.440> I'm<00:06:21.560> gonna

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
everything so that's one thing I'm gonna

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.140 
everything so that's one thing I'm gonna
do<00:06:21.770> when<00:06:21.890> I<00:06:21.950> first<00:06:22.220> step<00:06:22.430> always<00:06:22.670> kind<00:06:22.940> of<00:06:23.030> look

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
do when I first step always kind of look

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.540 
do when I first step always kind of look
around<00:06:23.300> really<00:06:23.750> appreciate<00:06:24.200> the<00:06:24.920> situation

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.550 
around really appreciate the situation

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.180 
around really appreciate the situation
that<00:06:26.030> we<00:06:26.180> have<00:06:26.330> as<00:06:26.570> a<00:06:26.600> team<00:06:26.870> and<00:06:27.140> the<00:06:27.260> Hall

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190 
that we have as a team and the Hall

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.290 
that we have as a team and the Hall
Street<00:06:28.340> actually<00:06:28.670> is<00:06:28.940> there<00:06:29.060> gonna<00:06:29.210> be

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:29.300 
Street actually is there gonna be

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.970 
Street actually is there gonna be
something<00:06:29.720> like<00:06:29.840> that<00:06:30.020> I<00:06:30.230> mean<00:06:30.440> I<00:06:30.710> think<00:06:30.740> we

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:30.980 
something like that I mean I think we

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.620 
something like that I mean I think we
learned<00:06:31.190> a<00:06:31.280> valuable<00:06:31.400> lesson<00:06:31.670> last<00:06:32.090> year<00:06:32.300> that

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 
learned a valuable lesson last year that

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.300 
learned a valuable lesson last year that
when<00:06:33.140> you<00:06:33.230> just<00:06:33.380> play<00:06:33.590> straight<00:06:33.890> ahead<00:06:34.160> you

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.310 
when you just play straight ahead you

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.980 
when you just play straight ahead you
have<00:06:34.460> that<00:06:34.670> mentality<00:06:34.850> of<00:06:35.420> getting<00:06:35.660> pucks<00:06:35.870> to

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:35.990 
have that mentality of getting pucks to

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.600 
have that mentality of getting pucks to
the<00:06:36.080> net<00:06:36.170> and<00:06:36.350> Humber<00:06:36.950> in<00:06:37.070> front<00:06:37.310> of<00:06:37.370> the<00:06:37.430> net

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
the net and Humber in front of the net

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.430 
the net and Humber in front of the net
and<00:06:37.760> that<00:06:37.910> was<00:06:38.030> a<00:06:38.060> net<00:06:38.360> presence<00:06:38.810> you<00:06:39.290> have<00:06:39.350> a

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 
and that was a net presence you have a

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.560 
and that was a net presence you have a
chance<00:06:39.710> to<00:06:39.830> be<00:06:39.890> successful<00:06:40.040> we<00:06:40.610> outshot<00:06:41.000> our

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:41.570 
chance to be successful we outshot our

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.330

three<00:06:43.580> to<00:06:43.670> two<00:06:43.850> because<00:06:44.090> they<00:06:44.330> did<00:06:44.450> a<00:06:44.480> better

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:44.630
