00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.930
 all 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:14.480
 Hi there , I met you today. 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.129
 I have a test drive Hyundai Genesis Genesis affair so that common 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.300
 You could think of it. 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:22.010
 Actually it is not. This car is not usually Genesis, but lpg 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.999
 It's Genesis. 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:28.519
 Let's take a look at what's different. 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:31.999
 Once the look is exactly the same 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:35.600
 It's exactly the same, even in the lower body . 

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:40.010
 I can not tell. It's different when you open the trunk. 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.330
 There is no distinction between normal auto and ordinary cars. 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.310
 transparent 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:47.990
 This plastic should not be made . Ian lpg tank does not exist. 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:52.490
 It's very characteristic that it does not 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:56.840
 Instead of the lpg tank being present, the donor experience sex tank 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:59.980
 In place of Spare Tire, Gasson instead of Spare Tire 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.980
 It's made to disappear. 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:12.430
 I do not have anything else in the engine room. It looks the same. 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:18.240
 Oh, there's a little difference here. 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.240
 There is a slight difference in the extent of adding a little wind here. 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:32.200
 lpg ds any of these six are very cheap 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:33.730
 Everyone knows that it's very economically advantageous, but lpg 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.110
 Some disadvantages 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:42.010
 For example, if the output is low or fuel economy is acceptable 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.450
 What I'm more concerned about the fact that this way also look at once grungy 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:48.220
 I'll do it 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:51.220
 But if you do not trust the lpg car and distinguish it from a regular gasoline car 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.460
 It 's almost the same. 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:59.560
 Uh, there's one button here. 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:02.020
 Mr. spot where the seed was made taking a single button, so instead of arrowroot 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.530
 Press this button 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.229
 You can drive in gasoline mode Press the button again 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:13.600
 You will go this way in apes mode 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:18.310
 When you're in fps mode, this is lp's capacity. 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:24.760
 The remaining capacity is displayed. In lps mode 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:29.980
 If you turn it off, you have to look at the fuel in this gasoline fuel tank in the second instrument cluster . 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:33.519
 So, you can use both raw materials and lps Hibari Biofuel 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:37.870
 The system will be mounted on this car. 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:40.239
 I tried to feel the difference between lp and gas mode and gas mode 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:45.459
 I rarely feel it. 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:49.480
 Uh 1lp ds also control the intake manifold Yes, but that's so pumped 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:55.269
 Actually, the same thing as gdi 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:03:00.000
 Because the injection of the shoulder sudekesu directly into the engine cylinder 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:03.870
 So utterly so that it sounds and can not be distinguished 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.080
 That's how I feel. I really can not tell. 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.110
 Actually, when you step on the accelerator pedal 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.110
 U 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.819
 Now this is the lp yes part. 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.819
 U 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:26.950
 So much like this gasoline and 12 can not be distinguished at all 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:31.049
 It's made so well. 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.049
 Let's take a look at how the output goes down. 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.430
 222 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.430
 Out 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.819
 we 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:06.860
 And in case of acting , I worry a lot. The fuel economy of this car is gasoline 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:10.760
 Because of the til computer machine made on the basis of the car, 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:15.020
 Put reported ll repeat these things, I will be able to know the exact mileage 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:19.900
 Anyway, it's a bit hard to say clearly about fuel economy, but at least 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:23.560
 At the output, the volatile second 5006 is so great that it can not be distinguished 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.560
 I can see something powerful. 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:34.990
 4 So far I have tried the Genesis lpg model. 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:39.310
 In fact, gonna give it a mod that is not made from car manufacturers 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.300
 So what disabled car rental Toka Toka what it could only be used for this purpose 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:45.610
 There will be. 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:50.950
 But looking at the product itself, performance, fuel economy and 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:54.570
 I've heard about such a car that has everything from cheap fuel to gas. 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.570
 So far, the motor graph was Kim Han - yong . 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.060
 222 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.530
 wee
