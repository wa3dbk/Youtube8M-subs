00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:09.700
 today we have prepared a transplant a lot 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:11.260
 most original for this hydrangea not what 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.719
 we are going to do in a pot, we are going to 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.750
 do in this glass vase and to 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.970
 we are going to use these as a basis 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.240
 decorative sands a little bit of moss and 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.539
 the earth and it's that simple we're going to 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.539
 put 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:32.100
 the sand at the base of the vase 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.100
 and it will also help us 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.740
 to monitor the watering of the plant to be 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.860
 transparent this base 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:45.370
 let's know where the water goes 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.370
 to avoid 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.770
 we are going to avoid puddling 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.770
 plant 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.730
 and we are going to have it very well taken care of 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.079
 much more decorative for being a 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.999
 glass container 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.369
 much more original that we can also 

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:07.649
 take advantage to give it away we can do it 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.350
 At home we can recycle some vase 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:12.350
 that we are already bored of seeing it 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.810
 You can find this material here 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:22.170
 in nurseries the mosque 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.820
 the mosses the sands the crystals yes 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.620
 you need some new piece 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.300
 and finally is reaching the 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.810
 spring 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.820
 there is a game of lovely hydrangeas 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.380
 let's leave the hole with the moss 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.900
 the moss simply to dress the 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.910
 vase 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.910
 Now we need a little bit of land 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.810
 the lands also come well 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.130
 prepared we will not need in the 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.240
 transplant nothing more 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.240
 from this cool black earth 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.340
 we move a little 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.130
 the root of the hydrangea 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.380
 a lot of root is a plant that needs 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.360
 a certain humidity but never 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.989
 waterlogging please 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.569
 that's why the stones and the sands are going to 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.599
 come very well to give us an idea of 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.830
 where the water goes to be crystalline 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:22.230
 per colar not to lose the water that remains 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.989
 you have to be careful and water it justito 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.380
 Well, we have it fixed now 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:31.190
 simply a decoration with a 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.190
 butterfly 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.730
 some twigs 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:52.430
 and the arrangement is finished 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.430
 and ready to give
