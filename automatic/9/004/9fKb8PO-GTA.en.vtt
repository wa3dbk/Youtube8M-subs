00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 
to start breaking up the body parts a

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.880 
to start breaking up the body parts a
little<00:00:22.420> differently<00:00:22.810> and<00:00:23.140> how<00:00:23.529> do<00:00:23.590> you<00:00:23.710> know

little differently and how do you know
sometimes<00:00:24.460> when<00:00:25.080> you're<00:00:26.080> not<00:00:26.230> making

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
sometimes when you're not making

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.440 
sometimes when you're not making
progress<00:00:26.800> how<00:00:27.550> do<00:00:27.610> you<00:00:27.730> know<00:00:27.849> if<00:00:27.970> it's<00:00:28.090> diet

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.450 
progress how do you know if it's diet

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.690 
progress how do you know if it's diet
related<00:00:28.599> or<00:00:29.020> not<00:00:29.080> so<00:00:29.800> let's<00:00:30.040> talk<00:00:30.399> a<00:00:30.460> little

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:30.700 
related or not so let's talk a little

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.979 
related or not so let's talk a little
bit<00:00:31.029> about<00:00:31.060> that<00:00:31.509> so<00:00:32.439> the<00:00:32.590> obvious<00:00:32.770> answer<00:00:33.579> is

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
bit about that so the obvious answer is

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.510 
bit about that so the obvious answer is
when<00:00:34.989> you<00:00:35.110> stop<00:00:35.320> making<00:00:35.560> progress<00:00:36.010> would<00:00:36.370> be<00:00:36.430> a

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
when you stop making progress would be a

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.580 
when you stop making progress would be a
good<00:00:36.790> time<00:00:37.120> to<00:00:37.149> start<00:00:37.660> assessing<00:00:38.230> what<00:00:38.440> you've

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
good time to start assessing what you've

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.040 
good time to start assessing what you've
been<00:00:38.770> doing<00:00:39.160> but<00:00:39.970> think<00:00:40.360> about<00:00:40.450> this<00:00:40.750> for<00:00:40.960> a

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
been doing but think about this for a

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.840 
been doing but think about this for a
minute<00:00:41.200> if<00:00:41.530> you've<00:00:41.980> been<00:00:42.220> coming<00:00:42.430> into<00:00:42.670> the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
minute if you've been coming into the

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.389 
minute if you've been coming into the
gym<00:00:43.090> day<00:00:43.660> in<00:00:43.870> and<00:00:44.079> day<00:00:44.110> out<00:00:44.230> for<00:00:44.710> a<00:00:45.040> year

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
gym day in and day out for a year

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.120 
gym day in and day out for a year
sometimes<00:00:45.670> doing<00:00:46.149> the<00:00:46.270> same<00:00:46.570> routine<00:00:46.960> and<00:00:47.320> you

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130 
sometimes doing the same routine and you

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.120 
sometimes doing the same routine and you
do<00:00:48.310> the<00:00:49.090> same<00:00:49.270> exercises<00:00:49.750> in<00:00:50.140> the<00:00:50.350> same<00:00:50.650> manner

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.130 
do the same exercises in the same manner

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.070 
do the same exercises in the same manner
the<00:00:51.460> same<00:00:51.670> form<00:00:52.060> with<00:00:52.270> the<00:00:52.390> same<00:00:52.600> weight<00:00:52.870> in

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.080 
the same form with the same weight in

the same form with the same weight in
the<00:00:53.560> same<00:00:53.770> direction<00:00:53.980> almost<00:00:54.520> standing<00:00:55.330> in

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
the same direction almost standing in

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.620 
the same direction almost standing in
the<00:00:55.570> same<00:00:55.750> spot<00:00:55.810> of<00:00:56.440> the<00:00:56.710> gym<00:00:57.360> there's<00:00:58.360> a<00:00:58.420> good

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.630 
the same spot of the gym there's a good

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.020 
the same spot of the gym there's a good
chance<00:00:58.870> that<00:00:59.140> you<00:00:59.530> have<00:00:59.560> tuckered<00:01:00.130> out<00:01:00.280> that

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
chance that you have tuckered out that

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.450 
chance that you have tuckered out that
particular<00:01:01.410> area<00:01:02.410> of<00:01:02.620> the<00:01:02.770> body<00:01:02.950> when<00:01:03.340> you're

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
particular area of the body when you're

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.850 
particular area of the body when you're
doing<00:01:03.700> those<00:01:03.910> exercises<00:01:03.940> you<00:01:04.869> have<00:01:05.110> really

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
doing those exercises you have really

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.249 
doing those exercises you have really
focused<00:01:06.100> on<00:01:06.490> those<00:01:07.119> vectors<00:01:07.750> of<00:01:07.780> the<00:01:08.049> body

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
focused on those vectors of the body

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:10.200 
focused on those vectors of the body
because<00:01:08.619> when<00:01:08.740> you're<00:01:08.890> training<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.970> weights

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
because when you're training the weights

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.469 
because when you're training the weights
hit<00:01:10.979> particularly<00:01:11.979> of<00:01:12.670> the<00:01:12.759> body<00:01:12.939> depending

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
hit particularly of the body depending

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.270 
hit particularly of the body depending
upon<00:01:13.600> how<00:01:14.079> you<00:01:14.640> exercise<00:01:15.689> if<00:01:16.689> I'm<00:01:17.130> standing<00:01:18.130> in

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
upon how you exercise if I'm standing in

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.430 
upon how you exercise if I'm standing in
this<00:01:18.370> direction<00:01:19.030> and<00:01:19.210> I'm<00:01:19.659> pulling<00:01:20.020> up<00:01:20.140> and<00:01:20.350> my

of the body in other words you've

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.930 
of the body in other words you've
trained<00:01:52.990> that<00:01:53.409> area<00:01:54.040> or<00:01:54.250> that<00:01:54.369> line<00:01:54.670> of<00:01:54.850> the

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
trained that area or that line of the

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.469 
trained that area or that line of the
body<00:01:55.090> so<00:01:55.960> much<00:01:56.140> that<00:01:56.440> it<00:01:56.530> no<00:01:56.619> longer<00:01:57.010> responds

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
body so much that it no longer responds

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.760 
body so much that it no longer responds
and<00:01:58.479> there's<00:01:58.689> two<00:01:58.810> things<00:01:58.990> that's<00:01:59.260> that<00:01:59.650> are

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
and there's two things that's that are

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.560 
and there's two things that's that are
wrong<00:01:59.920> with<00:02:00.070> that<00:02:00.220> number<00:02:00.850> one<00:02:01.119> you<00:02:01.240> have<00:02:01.270> that

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
wrong with that number one you have that

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.660 
wrong with that number one you have that
area<00:02:01.810> that's<00:02:02.110> not<00:02:02.290> responding<00:02:02.920> and<00:02:03.070> number

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
area that's not responding and number

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.450 
area that's not responding and number
two<00:02:03.880> you<00:02:04.270> have<00:02:04.299> all<00:02:04.780> this<00:02:05.080> other<00:02:05.409> area<00:02:05.770> of<00:02:06.189> the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
two you have all this other area of the

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.809 
two you have all this other area of the
body<00:02:06.670> that<00:02:07.330> has<00:02:07.600> yet<00:02:07.810> to<00:02:07.869> be<00:02:08.519> exercised<00:02:09.519> that

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
body that has yet to be exercised that

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.789 
body that has yet to be exercised that
has<00:02:09.970> yet<00:02:10.179> to<00:02:10.299> be<00:02:10.450> tapped<00:02:10.720> into<00:02:10.929> so<00:02:11.590> you<00:02:11.680> can

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:11.799 
has yet to be tapped into so you can

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:14.039 
has yet to be tapped into so you can
look<00:02:11.920> at<00:02:12.040> that<00:02:12.220> as<00:02:12.430> an<00:02:12.549> opportunity<00:02:12.849> so<00:02:13.840> here's

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
look at that as an opportunity so here's

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.140 
look at that as an opportunity so here's
the<00:02:14.200> deal<00:02:14.349> if<00:02:14.650> you're<00:02:15.189> not<00:02:15.370> progressing<00:02:15.610> and

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
the deal if you're not progressing and

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.030 
the deal if you're not progressing and
you're<00:02:16.330> doing<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.659> same<00:02:16.870> exercises<00:02:17.409> day<00:02:17.860> in

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
you're doing the same exercises day in

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.740 
you're doing the same exercises day in
and<00:02:18.189> day<00:02:18.220> out<00:02:18.310> for<00:02:18.700> a<00:02:18.730> very<00:02:19.030> long<00:02:19.299> period<00:02:19.599> of

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
and day out for a very long period of

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.300 
and day out for a very long period of
time<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:21.250> probably<00:02:21.700> have<00:02:22.239> over<00:02:22.870> trained<00:02:23.469> that

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
time you probably have over trained that

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.099 
time you probably have over trained that
particular<00:02:24.879> line<00:02:25.180> of<00:02:25.419> the<00:02:25.510> body<00:02:25.719> or<00:02:25.930> you've

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:26.109 
particular line of the body or you've

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:27.580 
particular line of the body or you've
gotten<00:02:26.319> as<00:02:26.499> much<00:02:26.529> out<00:02:26.859> of<00:02:26.919> as<00:02:27.189> you

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
gotten as much out of as you

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.380 
gotten as much out of as you
we<00:02:27.770> can<00:02:27.980> it's<00:02:28.400> time<00:02:28.670> to<00:02:28.910> maybe<00:02:29.120> start

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
we can it's time to maybe start

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.229 
we can it's time to maybe start
exploring<00:02:29.900> some<00:02:30.349> different<00:02:31.340> lines<00:02:31.880> of<00:02:32.150> the

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
exploring some different lines of the

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.449 
exploring some different lines of the
body<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:32.750> different<00:02:32.989> vectors<00:02:33.890> of<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.220> body

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
body and different vectors of the body

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.490 
body and different vectors of the body
and<00:02:34.730> that<00:02:35.180> doesn't<00:02:35.510> necessarily<00:02:35.599> mean<00:02:36.290> that

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
and that doesn't necessarily mean that

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.920 
and that doesn't necessarily mean that
you<00:02:36.950> throw<00:02:37.220> exercises<00:02:37.880> away<00:02:38.150> that<00:02:38.569> means<00:02:38.780> you

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
you throw exercises away that means you

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.720 
you throw exercises away that means you
can<00:02:39.080> start<00:02:39.260> maybe<00:02:39.500> doing<00:02:39.620> them<00:02:40.069> with<00:02:40.700> a

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
can start maybe doing them with a

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.520 
can start maybe doing them with a
different<00:02:41.150> technique<00:02:41.599> maybe<00:02:42.140> if<00:02:42.290> you<00:02:42.410> were

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
different technique maybe if you were

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.339 
different technique maybe if you were
using<00:02:43.040> free<00:02:43.280> weights<00:02:43.430> you<00:02:43.640> can<00:02:43.790> try<00:02:44.060> a<00:02:44.540> machine

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
using free weights you can try a machine

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:46.830 
using free weights you can try a machine
that<00:02:45.560> puts<00:02:45.680> your<00:02:45.830> body<00:02:45.980> at<00:02:46.250> a<00:02:46.310> different<00:02:46.640> angle

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
that puts your body at a different angle

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.420 
that puts your body at a different angle
but<00:02:47.840> one<00:02:48.019> way<00:02:48.170> to<00:02:48.200> be<00:02:48.410> sensitive<00:02:48.920> to<00:02:48.980> that<00:02:49.250> is

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
but one way to be sensitive to that is

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.210 
but one way to be sensitive to that is
to<00:02:50.150> when<00:02:50.450> you<00:02:50.540> grab<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:50.840> weights<00:02:51.170> and<00:02:51.800> you

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
to when you grab the weights and you

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.610 
to when you grab the weights and you
know<00:02:52.489> the<00:02:53.000> familiar<00:02:53.599> feeling<00:02:54.410> that<00:02:54.560> you

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
know the familiar feeling that you

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.290 
know the familiar feeling that you
normally<00:02:54.769> have<00:02:55.069> that<00:02:55.580> you<00:02:55.670> know<00:02:55.730> that<00:02:56.120> you're

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
normally have that you know that you're

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.030 
normally have that you know that you're
know<00:02:56.690> when<00:02:56.870> you're<00:02:56.989> normally<00:02:57.410> training<00:02:57.830> you

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
know when you're normally training you

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.770 
know when you're normally training you
know<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.370> area<00:02:58.730> and<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.120> line<00:02:59.360> of<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.660> body

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
know the area and the line of the body

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.720 
know the area and the line of the body
that<00:03:00.590> it<00:03:00.769> hits<00:03:01.040> when<00:03:01.370> you're<00:03:01.519> really

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
that it hits when you're really

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.000 
that it hits when you're really
sensitive<00:03:02.000> to<00:03:02.420> it<00:03:02.600> what<00:03:03.140> you<00:03:03.200> try<00:03:03.410> to<00:03:03.470> do<00:03:03.680> is

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
sensitive to it what you try to do is

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.490 
sensitive to it what you try to do is
try<00:03:04.220> to<00:03:04.280> shift<00:03:04.700> that<00:03:04.910> energy<00:03:05.420> from<00:03:05.989> that

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
try to shift that energy from that

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.350 
try to shift that energy from that
particular<00:03:06.799> line<00:03:07.519> of<00:03:07.549> the<00:03:07.850> body<00:03:08.060> that<00:03:08.239> you

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
particular line of the body that you

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.979 
particular line of the body that you
normally<00:03:08.510> hit<00:03:08.989> to<00:03:09.530> some<00:03:09.769> other<00:03:10.069> line

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
normally hit to some other line

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.210 
normally hit to some other line
relatively<00:03:11.989> close<00:03:12.230> by<00:03:12.470> within<00:03:12.799> the<00:03:13.010> same

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
relatively close by within the same

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.800 
relatively close by within the same
muscle<00:03:13.580> group<00:03:13.790> so<00:03:14.269> if<00:03:14.330> I'm<00:03:14.450> used<00:03:14.630> to<00:03:14.660> doing

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
muscle group so if I'm used to doing

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.229 
muscle group so if I'm used to doing
curls<00:03:15.110> like<00:03:15.290> this<00:03:15.610> maybe<00:03:16.610> all<00:03:16.819> of<00:03:16.849> a<00:03:16.970> sudden<00:03:17.180> I

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
curls like this maybe all of a sudden I

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.180 
curls like this maybe all of a sudden I
want<00:03:17.390> to<00:03:17.450> adjust<00:03:17.569> my<00:03:17.870> grip<00:03:18.110> maybe<00:03:18.739> change<00:03:19.040> the

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
want to adjust my grip maybe change the

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.130 
want to adjust my grip maybe change the
direction<00:03:19.340> of<00:03:19.849> those<00:03:20.150> weight<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:20.599> weight<00:03:20.810> the

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
direction of those weight the weight the

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.809 
direction of those weight the weight the
way<00:03:21.319> the<00:03:21.650> direction<00:03:21.890> of<00:03:22.280> where<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:22.640> weights

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
way the direction of where the weights

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.150 
way the direction of where the weights
are<00:03:23.030> coming<00:03:23.299> onto<00:03:23.510> my<00:03:23.810> body<00:03:24.019> and<00:03:24.380> I'm<00:03:24.799> going<00:03:25.069> to

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
are coming onto my body and I'm going to

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.120 
are coming onto my body and I'm going to
be<00:03:25.580> touching<00:03:26.540> different<00:03:27.140> areas<00:03:27.500> and<00:03:27.650> vectors

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
be touching different areas and vectors

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.110 
be touching different areas and vectors
of<00:03:28.400> the<00:03:28.700> same<00:03:29.000> body<00:03:29.959> part<00:03:30.319> so<00:03:31.010> I'm<00:03:31.700> going<00:03:32.030> to

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
of the same body part so I'm going to

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.759 
of the same body part so I'm going to
explore<00:03:32.480> those<00:03:32.660> other<00:03:32.870> areas<00:03:33.320> so<00:03:33.440> if<00:03:33.530> that's

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
explore those other areas so if that's

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.199 
explore those other areas so if that's
not<00:03:33.950> working<00:03:34.190> when<00:03:34.579> you've<00:03:34.730> been<00:03:34.880> doing<00:03:35.090> the

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
not working when you've been doing the

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:36.789 
not working when you've been doing the
same<00:03:35.420> training<00:03:35.750> day<00:03:36.079> in<00:03:36.230> and<00:03:36.350> day<00:03:36.380> out<00:03:36.470> just

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
same training day in and day out just

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.500 
same training day in and day out just
explore<00:03:37.310> some<00:03:37.519> different<00:03:37.549> vectors<00:03:38.299> of<00:03:38.329> the

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
explore some different vectors of the

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.479 
explore some different vectors of the
body<00:03:38.690> some<00:03:38.930> different<00:03:39.230> lines<00:03:39.470> of<00:03:39.620> the<00:03:39.709> body<00:03:39.890> by

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
body some different lines of the body by

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.720 
body some different lines of the body by
shifting<00:03:40.970> up<00:03:41.320> maybe<00:03:42.320> your<00:03:42.560> techniques<00:03:43.069> by

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
shifting up maybe your techniques by

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.729 
shifting up maybe your techniques by
putting<00:03:44.269> your<00:03:44.359> grip<00:03:44.630> either<00:03:44.780> closer<00:03:45.170> or<00:03:45.500> wider

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
putting your grip either closer or wider

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.280 
putting your grip either closer or wider
using<00:03:46.190> heavier<00:03:46.519> or<00:03:46.850> lighter<00:03:46.880> weight<00:03:47.480> shifting

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
using heavier or lighter weight shifting

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.650 
using heavier or lighter weight shifting
from<00:03:48.440> a<00:03:48.530> machine<00:03:48.799> to<00:03:49.549> a<00:03:49.579> free<00:03:50.030> weight<00:03:50.239> or<00:03:50.420> vice

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
from a machine to a free weight or vice

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.410 
from a machine to a free weight or vice
versa<00:03:51.040> and<00:03:52.040> so<00:03:52.100> the<00:03:52.790> same<00:03:52.970> thing<00:03:53.209> with<00:03:53.299> the

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
versa and so the same thing with the

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.180 
versa and so the same thing with the
chest<00:03:53.690> if<00:03:53.900> you<00:03:53.930> feel<00:03:54.260> as<00:03:54.440> though<00:03:54.620> you've

chest if you feel as though you've
already<00:03:55.340> maxed<00:03:56.000> out<00:03:56.150> a<00:03:56.389> particular<00:03:57.170> vector<00:03:57.440> or

easy with bench pressing you can always

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.170 
easy with bench pressing you can always
adjust<00:04:05.709> the<00:04:06.709> benches<00:04:07.069> relatively<00:04:07.609> easily<00:04:07.790> and

doing that already if you've been kind

possible<00:04:17.030> there's<00:04:17.630> a<00:04:17.690> possibility<00:04:18.410> and<00:04:18.500> I've

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
possible there's a possibility and I've

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.199 
possible there's a possibility and I've
said<00:04:18.799> this<00:04:18.829> before<00:04:19.100> that<00:04:19.519> you<00:04:19.669> have<00:04:19.910> kind<00:04:20.180> of

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
said this before that you have kind of

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.050 
said this before that you have kind of
touched<00:04:20.510> on<00:04:20.750> every<00:04:21.289> area<00:04:21.919> of<00:04:22.250> the<00:04:22.550> body<00:04:22.580> but

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
touched on every area of the body but

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.409 
touched on every area of the body but
you<00:04:23.150> haven't<00:04:23.360> trained<00:04:23.870> any<00:04:24.260> of<00:04:24.680> it<00:04:24.860> so<00:04:25.460> it

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
you haven't trained any of it so it

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.810 
you haven't trained any of it so it
sounds<00:04:26.810> like<00:04:26.900> a<00:04:26.930> lot<00:04:27.169> of<00:04:27.200> work<00:04:27.470> and<00:04:27.820> nothing's

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
sounds like a lot of work and nothing's

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.640 
sounds like a lot of work and nothing's
happening<00:04:29.300> because<00:04:29.780> you're<00:04:29.990> not<00:04:30.320> spending

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
happening because you're not spending

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.110 
happening because you're not spending
enough<00:04:30.979> time<00:04:31.310> or<00:04:31.520> building<00:04:31.820> enough

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
enough time or building enough

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.719 
enough time or building enough
connection<00:04:32.660> or<00:04:32.780> relationship<00:04:33.380> with<00:04:34.070> any<00:04:34.400> one

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
connection or relationship with any one

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:36.550 
connection or relationship with any one
particular<00:04:34.970> vector<00:04:35.750> of<00:04:35.870> the<00:04:36.020> body<00:04:36.200> I<00:04:36.320> hope

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
particular vector of the body I hope

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.790 
particular vector of the body I hope
that<00:04:36.740> makes<00:04:36.890> a<00:04:37.010> lot<00:04:37.130> of<00:04:37.159> sense<00:04:37.460> so<00:04:38.260> the<00:04:39.260> idea<00:04:39.590> is

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
that makes a lot of sense so the idea is

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.450 
that makes a lot of sense so the idea is
if<00:04:40.070> you're<00:04:40.370> putting<00:04:40.760> too<00:04:40.909> much<00:04:40.940> time

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
if you're putting too much time

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.240 
if you're putting too much time
into<00:04:41.760> one<00:04:41.970> line<00:04:42.240> or<00:04:42.900> giving<00:04:43.350> not<00:04:43.560> enough<00:04:43.860> time

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
into one line or giving not enough time

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.210 
into one line or giving not enough time
to<00:04:44.580> any<00:04:45.210> particular<00:04:45.810> line<00:04:46.050> or<00:04:46.560> vector<00:04:46.770> of<00:04:47.070> the

to train you know what you've been doing
for<00:05:28.320> a<00:05:28.440> long<00:05:28.500> time<00:05:28.890> then<00:05:29.640> maybe<00:05:29.940> it's<00:05:30.120> not

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
for a long time then maybe it's not

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
necessarily time to change the routine

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.510 
necessarily time to change the routine
it<00:05:33.360> could<00:05:33.570> be<00:05:33.720> time<00:05:33.990> to<00:05:34.230> change<00:05:34.470> your<00:05:34.620> diet<00:05:34.950> and

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
it could be time to change your diet and

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.130 
it could be time to change your diet and
what<00:05:35.700> you<00:05:35.790> don't<00:05:35.940> want<00:05:36.090> to<00:05:36.180> do<00:05:36.330> is<00:05:36.540> do<00:05:36.810> all<00:05:37.110> of

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
what you don't want to do is do all of

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.930 
what you don't want to do is do all of
this<00:05:37.410> at<00:05:37.560> the<00:05:37.650> same<00:05:37.860> time<00:05:38.250> because<00:05:38.670> then<00:05:38.820> it

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
this at the same time because then it

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.820 
this at the same time because then it
becomes<00:05:39.210> a<00:05:39.330> confound<00:05:39.780> you're<00:05:40.080> not<00:05:40.230> sure<00:05:40.470> what

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
becomes a confound you're not sure what

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.310 
becomes a confound you're not sure what
was<00:05:41.070> working<00:05:41.310> and<00:05:41.670> what<00:05:41.760> wasn't<00:05:42.300> you<00:05:43.110> might

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
was working and what wasn't you might

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.080 
was working and what wasn't you might
have<00:05:43.470> had<00:05:43.590> a<00:05:43.620> perfect<00:05:44.250> routine<00:05:44.460> you<00:05:44.880> just

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
have had a perfect routine you just

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.030 
have had a perfect routine you just
weren't<00:05:45.240> being<00:05:45.480> fueled<00:05:45.960> by<00:05:46.110> the<00:05:46.800> diet

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.040 
weren't being fueled by the diet

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.660 
weren't being fueled by the diet
properly<00:05:47.430> or<00:05:47.910> your<00:05:48.600> diet<00:05:48.840> might<00:05:49.170> be<00:05:49.670> really

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:50.670 
properly or your diet might be really

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.740 
properly or your diet might be really
bad<00:05:50.910> but<00:05:51.120> your<00:05:51.270> routine<00:05:51.690> was<00:05:51.990> perfect<00:05:52.710> so

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
bad but your routine was perfect so

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.820 
bad but your routine was perfect so
these<00:05:54.750> are<00:05:54.900> a<00:05:54.930> bunch<00:05:54.990> of<00:05:55.200> things<00:05:55.380> to<00:05:55.530> keep<00:05:55.650> in

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
these are a bunch of things to keep in

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.370 
these are a bunch of things to keep in
mind<00:05:55.860> so<00:05:56.220> if<00:05:56.310> you've<00:05:56.430> hit<00:05:56.610> a<00:05:56.640> wall<00:05:57.230> figure<00:05:58.230> out

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
mind so if you've hit a wall figure out

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.440 
mind so if you've hit a wall figure out
how<00:05:58.530> to<00:05:58.590> kind<00:05:58.890> of<00:05:58.950> go<00:05:59.070> around<00:05:59.220> it<00:05:59.670> okay<00:06:00.060> start

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:00.450 
how to kind of go around it okay start

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.210 
how to kind of go around it okay start
by<00:06:00.630> maybe<00:06:00.900> paying<00:06:01.410> attention<00:06:01.920> to<00:06:02.070> some

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
by maybe paying attention to some

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.470 
by maybe paying attention to some
different<00:06:02.520> lines<00:06:02.730> of<00:06:02.910> the<00:06:03.030> body<00:06:03.210> and

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:03.480 
different lines of the body and

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.820 
different lines of the body and
different<00:06:03.780> vectors<00:06:04.110> of<00:06:04.140> the<00:06:04.320> body<00:06:04.530> which

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
different vectors of the body which

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.280 
different vectors of the body which
means<00:06:05.130> you<00:06:05.820> don't<00:06:05.970> necessarily<00:06:06.180> throw<00:06:06.900> curls

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.290 
means you don't necessarily throw curls

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:08.780 
means you don't necessarily throw curls
out<00:06:07.470> or<00:06:07.710> you<00:06:07.830> don't<00:06:07.950> necessarily<00:06:08.580> throw<00:06:08.760> a

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:08.790 
out or you don't necessarily throw a

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.940 
out or you don't necessarily throw a
bench<00:06:09.030> press<00:06:09.300> out<00:06:09.540> you<00:06:10.050> start<00:06:10.290> approaching<00:06:10.590> it

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
bench press out you start approaching it

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.470 
bench press out you start approaching it
maybe<00:06:11.130> from<00:06:11.340> a<00:06:11.490> different<00:06:11.670> direction<00:06:11.910> or<00:06:12.450> a

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480 
maybe from a different direction or a

maybe from a different direction or a
