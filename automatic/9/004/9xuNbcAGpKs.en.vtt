00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.770
 Hello 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.480
 cheers the espresso coffee blog 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.450
 italian this is my personal spot 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.280
 so it is certainly to be read and thank you 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.520
 then for the opportunity to introduce 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.710
 talk about new extraction systems 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.949
 in particular we talk about the concept 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.230
 brewing system or coffee 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.480
 extracted differently from ours 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.849
 beloved very differently expressed 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.250
 also to see the coffee so we talk 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.620
 to simplify the infusion thing a little 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.510
 coffee infusions are different techniques 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.570
 different recipes 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.170
 definitely here today in partnership with 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:47.309
 ary we can present you some of them 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:49.559
 first let's take this from the sixty ok ok 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.700
 small object here in a conical shape 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.500
 funnel 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.469
 it is so called xvi because it goes to 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.859
 to emphasize precisely the angle of 60 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:03.120
 this product's grades is the 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.159
 as you can see below there is a 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.229
 balance because one of the most things 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.979
 important is to be able to have 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.950
 a calculation between the coffee then the solid 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.659
 put and the water used to have one 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.549
 correct extraction recipe then 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.740
 a fair extraction of the usual 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.840
 inside the water of the liquid for 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.930
 just follow a good coffee infusion 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.479
 this coffee provides a timing that 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.369
 is around three minutes for the 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.350
 final customer service someone's 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.450
 you can say too many are not 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.290
 absolutely not because to take a 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.420
 good coffee 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.939
 you have to take and spend time a 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.080
 yourself therefore the vix is ​​one of the methods 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.000
 what advice 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.310
 absolute for that for the people who 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.950
 they want to taste to perceive 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.610
 something different in terms of taste 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:53.280
 yes for example taking a good coffee 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.540
 today we have extracted a colombia tolima 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.580
 glide that a small cooperative 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.560
 Colombian what we are and what we have 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.110
 decided to use this situation 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.600
 because it exalted the taste aspect 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.370
 fruity then came out 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:09.390
 intensely the notes of wild berries 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.580
 red as can be raspberry and ne 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.300
 in fact he emphasized the acidity of malika 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.920
 this coffee then we have another method 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.890
 fun and very scenic for sure 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.470
 the client is fascinated by that 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.610
 siphon or is put 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.470
 the water under the ampoule is brought to 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:34.170
 boil once the water goes to 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:36.630
 go up you put the coffee inside and 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.480
 with an infusion lasting from the minute e 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.580
 half to a minute and a half may be more 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.190
 that we will have enough infusion 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.100
 because why when it will be deactivated 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.560
 the heat source what happens to 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.750
 different thermal abatement then 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.860
 for lowering temperature 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.760
 will begin to suffer the force of gravity 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.440
 which will bring the infused water to the coffee 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.440
 in the ampoule where it was prepared before 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.680
 but filtered as here 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:09.900
 as you can see there is a filter that now 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:12.200
 I disassemble so at least there is a filter that 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.520
 blocks the coffee 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:19.680
 this is called koffice iphone then 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.569
 let's move on this is one of the methods 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.970
 that I use almost every morning at 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.099
 my awakening because it is fast there 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.810
 need is very simple as 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.810
 what we have to do is simply 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.290
 put the coffee in here 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.100
 pour hot water 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.400
 here are the various cleats that do 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.720
 then indicate the content however to have 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.549
 greater precision 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.630
 we tell you a recipe that 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.080
 recommend and 15 grams for 220 g of 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.140
 water 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.540
 once the first pre-infusion is done 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.580
 30 seconds poured water for 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.599
 complete 222 g 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.470
 let's not do anything else but add 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:10.349
 this plunger and start applying 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.080
 a force to press and to push 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:18.060
 water and infusion infusion of 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:20.669
 coffee towards the jug below for 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.520
 then serve the coffee about a minute e 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:26.340
 preparation medium 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.350
 then we have another gem here is the 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.620
 cold brio or here it happens 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.479
 cold water extraction and 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.070
 timing is longer because here 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:38.990
 we talk about extracting 500 g of water 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.750
 about eight hours 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:45.900
 this however I consider it an object that 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.850
 helps to communicate to the customer that it is done 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.270
 something different that therefore begins 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:53.310
 to ask a question mark for what purpose 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.180
 this is because it is a thing completely 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.310
 different 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.610
 then this can be put on display 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:02.760
 and is always preparing the union in 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:05.280
 differently the quantities over and over 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.190
 high then what you do and only 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.919
 serve the call drew with ice 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.900
 therefore a very fresh product that it 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.590
 increases 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:17.449
 while the fruity sensations of coffee 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.460
 well the important objects in the 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:21.380
 processing of all these products 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.960
 especially for the 2 sicsi collins 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.130
 iphone and airplane presses are objects 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.130
 like this one 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.990
 this is a spilled kettle then 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.840
 is a castle or this one 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:35.449
 predisposition of this spout that 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.240
 helps pouring you can 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:42.370
 check the spill keeping 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:45.740
 always a constant strength and flow 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.760
 then we need the various filters of 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.949
 paper 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:53.150
 this is the filter used for the aero 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:57.380
 press rather than this that the filter 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:59.479
 which is used for the xvi busi while for the 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:02.990
 siphon we have seen and already prepared 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:05.389
 you can then use a cotton filter 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:08.389
 change there are refills anyway 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:10.009
 to replace this title and this is 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:13.009
 this system that we like to call 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:16.780
 slow book and then taking the 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:19.220
 concept that food taken in a manner 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:22.250
 slowly as a known association 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.750
 that slow food communicates can be 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.550
 something different something 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:29.050
 exciting but what I want 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:32.840
 launch thanks to you my message is 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:34.389
 the one to start seeing coffee in 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:38.680
 different way to start 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:41.030
 differentiate start serving 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.820
 any origin of coffee or any 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.250
 type of coffee with different 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.690
 different equipment equipment 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:49.310
 definitely with more knowledge with more 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.960
 value 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.010
 so thanks to you for espresso 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.250
 Italian 

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:56.870
 then to continue ours 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:59.780
 partnership with gabriele for 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:01.400
 try to spread and even do 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.349
 more knowledge about these products 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.949
 here then to the next episode 

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:05.949
 Hello
