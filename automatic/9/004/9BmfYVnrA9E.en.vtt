front of it we can get to come off

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.970 
front of it we can get to come off
downrange<00:00:39.320> also<00:00:40.320> we're<00:00:40.469> shooting<00:00:40.800> with

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
downrange also we're shooting with

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.610 
downrange also we're shooting with
tracer<00:00:41.760> knocks<00:00:42.000> from<00:00:42.870> Eastern<00:00:43.320> Aeros<00:00:43.500> that

tracer knocks from Eastern Aeros that

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.060 
tracer knocks from Eastern Aeros that
way<00:00:43.890> we<00:00:44.040> can<00:00:44.190> see<00:00:44.370> our<00:00:44.489> arrows<00:00:44.820> going<00:00:44.879> down

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
way we can see our arrows going down

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.139 
way we can see our arrows going down
last<00:00:47.070> thing<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.340> we're<00:00:47.579> going<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.760> do<00:00:47.940> to

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
last thing that we're going to do to

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.000 
last thing that we're going to do to
really<00:00:48.480> help<00:00:48.690> us<00:00:48.809> shoot<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.140> dark<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.620> I'm

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
really help us shoot in the dark is I'm

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.889 
really help us shoot in the dark is I'm
gonna<00:00:50.129> shoot<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.340> true<00:00:50.610> glow<00:00:50.820> site<00:00:51.149> with<00:00:51.870> a

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
gonna shoot a true glow site with a

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.740 
gonna shoot a true glow site with a
single<00:00:52.320> pin<00:00:52.879> multiple<00:00:53.879> pins<00:00:54.180> when<00:00:54.600> they're

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
single pin multiple pins when they're

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.110 
single pin multiple pins when they're
lit<00:00:55.020> up<00:00:55.199> have<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.920> tendency<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.340> blur<00:00:56.610> out<00:00:56.640> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
lit up have a tendency to blur out the

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.639 
lit up have a tendency to blur out the
target<00:00:57.629> it's<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> lot<00:00:57.960> harder<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.379> see<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
target it's a lot harder to see the

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.240 
target it's a lot harder to see the
target<00:00:58.829> downrange<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.640> dark<00:01:00.170> also<00:01:01.250> we're

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
target downrange in the dark also we're

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.570 
target downrange in the dark also we're
using<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.640> point<00:01:02.940> 0<00:01:03.300> 10<00:01:03.960> pin<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:04.979> smallest

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
using a point 0 10 pin of the smallest

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.910 
using a point 0 10 pin of the smallest
pin<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:06.000> can<00:01:06.150> possibly<00:01:06.540> get<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:07.500> way<00:01:07.740> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
pin we can possibly get that way the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.550 
pin we can possibly get that way the
halo<00:01:08.400> when<00:01:08.670> we<00:01:08.820> light<00:01:09.060> this<00:01:09.210> pin<00:01:09.479> up<00:01:09.689> there's

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
halo when we light this pin up there's

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.700 
halo when we light this pin up there's
not<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.770> big<00:01:11.010> halo<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.850> cover<00:01:12.060> up<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.270> target

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
not a big halo to cover up the target

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.920 
not a big halo to cover up the target
and<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:14.250> just<00:01:14.400> makes<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.670> easier<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.000> see<00:01:15.210> so

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
and it just makes it easier to see so

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.960 
and it just makes it easier to see so
anyway<00:01:16.200> we're<00:01:16.680> going<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.860> try<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.130> out<00:01:17.310> rest

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
anyway we're going to try it out rest

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.520 
anyway we're going to try it out rest
see<00:01:18.090> how<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.360> all<00:01:18.479> works<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.930> dark<00:01:19.170> trout

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
see how it all works in the dark trout

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.800 
see how it all works in the dark trout
the<00:01:19.710> infrared<00:01:20.159> shoot<00:01:20.880> some<00:01:21.060> arrows<00:01:21.180> downrange

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
the infrared shoot some arrows downrange

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.300 
the infrared shoot some arrows downrange
hopefully<00:01:22.259> get<00:01:22.409> some<00:01:22.439> good<00:01:22.650> footage<00:01:22.860> for<00:01:23.250> you

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
hopefully get some good footage for you

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.499 
hopefully get some good footage for you
guys<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.580> see<00:01:23.729> how<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.000> all<00:01:24.090> works<00:01:24.299> out

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
guys to see how it all works out

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.020 
guys to see how it all works out
hopefully<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.470> works<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:25.979> first<00:01:26.340> first

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
hopefully it works this is first first

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.690 
hopefully it works this is first first
test<00:01:27.240> run<00:01:27.420> for<00:01:27.600> us<00:01:27.720> also<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.470> we'll<00:01:29.430> see<00:01:29.579> how<00:01:29.610> it

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
test run for us also so we'll see how it

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:53.440 
test run for us also so we'll see how it
goes

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.020 

hey<00:01:54.020> folks<00:01:54.320> there<00:01:54.530> you<00:01:54.590> go<00:01:54.710> steam<00:01:55.670> all<00:01:55.850> out

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
hey folks there you go steam all out

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.940 
hey folks there you go steam all out
shooting<00:01:56.390> in<00:01:56.479> the<00:01:56.539> dark<00:01:56.689> hope<00:01:57.439> this<00:01:57.619> helps<00:01:57.890> you

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
shooting in the dark hope this helps you

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.910 
shooting in the dark hope this helps you
out<00:01:58.689> we're<00:01:59.689> learning<00:01:59.840> a<00:02:00.110> lot<00:02:00.259> on<00:02:00.530> how<00:02:00.649> to<00:02:00.710> get

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
out we're learning a lot on how to get

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.350 
out we're learning a lot on how to get
this<00:02:01.070> better<00:02:01.310> we're<00:02:01.759> going<00:02:01.939> to<00:02:02.000> probably<00:02:02.179> get

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
this better we're going to probably get

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.389 
this better we're going to probably get
some<00:02:02.539> more<00:02:02.750> infrared<00:02:03.170> lights<00:02:03.409> try<00:02:04.100> to<00:02:04.159> make<00:02:04.369> it

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
some more infrared lights try to make it

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.240 
some more infrared lights try to make it
a<00:02:04.520> little<00:02:04.640> bit<00:02:04.850> brighter<00:02:05.350> downrange<00:02:06.350> as<00:02:07.130> you

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
a little bit brighter downrange as you

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.479 
a little bit brighter downrange as you

all<00:02:14.930> on<00:02:14.959> tape<00:02:15.519> we're<00:02:16.519> kind<00:02:16.760> of<00:02:16.790> wanting<00:02:17.060> to

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
all on tape we're kind of wanting to

have a little more light for the

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:20.800

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
infrared lights will probably get one

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.170 
infrared lights will probably get one
more<00:02:20.870> though<00:02:21.290> so<00:02:21.560> my<00:02:21.680> next<00:02:21.860> tape<00:02:22.099> will<00:02:22.879> be<00:02:23.000> with
