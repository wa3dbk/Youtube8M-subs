00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:08.230 
you know like I say the dancers that

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.970 
you know like I say the dancers that
come<00:00:09.130> to<00:00:09.250> spectrum<00:00:09.730> I<00:00:10.000> say<00:00:10.180> this<00:00:10.709> what<00:00:11.709> we<00:00:11.860> were

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:11.980 
come to spectrum I say this what we were

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.090 
come to spectrum I say this what we were
about<00:00:12.219> we're<00:00:12.549> about<00:00:12.700> to<00:00:12.910> work<00:00:13.680> it's<00:00:14.680> not<00:00:14.889> about

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:15.100 
about we're about to work it's not about

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.890 
about we're about to work it's not about
having<00:00:15.309> a<00:00:15.520> social<00:00:15.730> life<00:00:16.090> it's<00:00:16.449> not<00:00:16.600> about<00:00:16.840> I

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:19.449 
mean it's great if you can but you know

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:21.179 
mean it's great if you can but you know
when<00:00:19.930> you<00:00:20.020> come<00:00:20.260> here<00:00:20.560> and<00:00:20.680> has<00:00:20.800> to<00:00:20.920> be<00:00:20.980> about

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:21.189 
when you come here and has to be about

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:22.710 
when you come here and has to be about
the<00:00:21.340> work<00:00:21.550> and<00:00:21.820> kind<00:00:22.029> of<00:00:22.090> being<00:00:22.330> really

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
the work and kind of being really

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.930 
the work and kind of being really
engaged<00:00:23.410> and<00:00:24.180> by<00:00:25.180> the<00:00:25.840> kinds<00:00:26.590> of<00:00:26.940> experiments

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:27.940 
engaged and by the kinds of experiments

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.560 
engaged and by the kinds of experiments
that<00:00:28.270> we<00:00:28.480> are<00:00:28.920> doing<00:00:29.920> and<00:00:30.400> that<00:00:31.060> has<00:00:31.360> to<00:00:31.539> be

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
that we are doing and that has to be

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.049 
that we are doing and that has to be
important<00:00:32.050> dancing<00:00:32.500> has<00:00:32.890> for<00:00:33.309> that's<00:00:33.610> this

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:34.059 
important dancing has for that's this

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:35.639 
important dancing has for that's this
amount<00:00:34.390> of<00:00:34.480> time<00:00:34.719> that<00:00:34.989> has<00:00:35.110> to<00:00:35.230> be<00:00:35.350> really

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:35.649 
amount of time that has to be really

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:36.660 
amount of time that has to be really
important<00:00:36.190> to<00:00:36.309> you

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
important to you

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.939 
important to you
and<00:00:37.409> I<00:00:38.699> believe<00:00:39.699> it<00:00:39.850> that<00:00:40.480> with<00:00:41.319> dancing<00:00:41.800> with

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:41.949 
and I believe it that with dancing with

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:43.919 
and I believe it that with dancing with
art<00:00:42.159> in<00:00:42.309> general<00:00:42.339> that<00:00:42.850> art<00:00:43.089> communicates<00:00:43.780> in

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:43.929 
art in general that art communicates in

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:46.979 
art in general that art communicates in
a<00:00:44.019> really<00:00:44.350> unique<00:00:44.530> way<00:00:45.100> and<00:00:46.089> it<00:00:46.510> can<00:00:46.719> it<00:00:46.929> can

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
a really unique way and it can it can

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:49.319 
a really unique way and it can it can
reach<00:00:47.499> us<00:00:47.829> too<00:00:48.159> can<00:00:48.339> reach<00:00:48.550> people<00:00:48.969> in<00:00:49.089> a<00:00:49.149> way

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
reach us too can reach people in a way

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.930 
reach us too can reach people in a way
that<00:00:49.359> news<00:00:50.170> and<00:00:50.440> information<00:00:50.679> can<00:00:51.280> it<00:00:51.729> can

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
that news and information can it can

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.639 
that news and information can it can
tell<00:00:52.149> you<00:00:52.269> all<00:00:52.449> kinds<00:00:52.839> of<00:00:52.899> things<00:00:53.139> again<00:00:53.469> give

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
tell you all kinds of things again give

tell you all kinds of things again give
you<00:00:53.739> all<00:00:53.829> kinds<00:00:54.039> of<00:00:54.100> insights<00:00:54.489> it<00:00:54.789> can<00:00:54.909> it<00:00:55.179> is

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
you all kinds of insights it can it is

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.750 
you all kinds of insights it can it is
it's<00:00:55.960> just<00:00:56.260> a<00:00:56.379> kind<00:00:56.530> of<00:00:56.649> unique<00:00:57.069> and<00:00:57.339> special

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
it's just a kind of unique and special

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.389 
it's just a kind of unique and special
way<00:00:57.789> of<00:00:57.999> communicating<00:00:58.629> and<00:00:59.109> I<00:00:59.620> and<00:00:59.859> I<00:01:00.069> think

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
way of communicating and I and I think

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.219 
way of communicating and I and I think
that<00:01:00.639> it's<00:01:00.879> an<00:01:01.059> you<00:01:01.539> know<00:01:01.629> and<00:01:01.839> sometimes<00:01:02.019> I'm

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:02.229 
that it's an you know and sometimes I'm

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:03.599 
that it's an you know and sometimes I'm
really<00:01:02.469> frustrated<00:01:02.799> by<00:01:03.159> the<00:01:03.219> fact<00:01:03.460> that

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
really frustrated by the fact that

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:05.369 
really frustrated by the fact that
scientists<00:01:04.390> can<00:01:04.750> come<00:01:04.960> up<00:01:05.080> with<00:01:05.110> these

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
scientists can come up with these

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.620 
scientists can come up with these
analogies<00:01:05.979> and<00:01:06.250> metaphors<00:01:06.310> for<00:01:06.970> for

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
analogies and metaphors for for

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.630 
analogies and metaphors for for
explaining<00:01:08.500> these<00:01:08.620> really<00:01:08.920> complex

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
explaining these really complex

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.910 
explaining these really complex
scientific<00:01:10.509> theories<00:01:11.170> and<00:01:11.320> stuff<00:01:11.530> and<00:01:11.770> in

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
scientific theories and stuff and in

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.620 
scientific theories and stuff and in
dance<00:01:12.189> we<00:01:12.460> can't<00:01:12.759> come<00:01:12.969> up<00:01:13.119> with<00:01:13.149> any<00:01:13.420> way<00:01:13.509> to

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
dance we can't come up with any way to

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.480 
dance we can't come up with any way to
talk<00:01:13.899> about<00:01:14.170> it<00:01:14.289> in<00:01:14.560> a<00:01:14.619> way<00:01:14.740> that<00:01:14.920> people<00:01:15.070> get

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
talk about it in a way that people get

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.480 
talk about it in a way that people get
you<00:01:16.210> know<00:01:16.240> and<00:01:16.689> that<00:01:16.810> we<00:01:16.960> have<00:01:17.079> to<00:01:17.200> do<00:01:17.320> more<00:01:17.649> to

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
you know and that we have to do more to

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.730 
you know and that we have to do more to
do<00:01:18.700> that<00:01:18.939> we<00:01:19.360> also<00:01:19.390> have<00:01:19.810> to<00:01:19.960> let<00:01:20.170> people<00:01:20.530> know

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
do that we also have to let people know

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.219 
do that we also have to let people know
that<00:01:21.280> that<00:01:22.090> that<00:01:22.450> there's<00:01:22.719> a<00:01:22.810> lot<00:01:23.049> of

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
that that that there's a lot of

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.590

different ways a lot of different kinds

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.870 
different ways a lot of different kinds
of<00:01:25.689> dancing<00:01:26.229> that<00:01:26.649> all<00:01:26.859> dancing<00:01:27.430> isn't<00:01:27.579> about

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
of dancing that all dancing isn't about

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.050 
of dancing that all dancing isn't about
being<00:01:28.210> happy<00:01:28.509> and<00:01:29.049> like<00:01:29.229> that<00:01:29.500> that<00:01:30.070> it<00:01:30.490> that

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
being happy and like that that it that

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.389 
being happy and like that that it that
that<00:01:31.119> dance<00:01:31.719> can<00:01:32.020> express<00:01:32.500> any<00:01:32.890> of<00:01:33.250> the

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
that dance can express any of the

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:35.010 
that dance can express any of the
emotions<00:01:33.939> that<00:01:34.060> you<00:01:34.359> have<00:01:34.539> any<00:01:34.840> of<00:01:34.960> the

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
feelings that you have the complexity of

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.990 
feelings that you have the complexity of
them<00:01:37.990> and<00:01:38.289> that<00:01:38.710> it<00:01:38.859> can<00:01:39.070> do<00:01:39.310> it<00:01:39.460> in<00:01:39.549> a<00:01:39.640> way<00:01:39.789> that

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
them and that it can do it in a way that

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.620 
them and that it can do it in a way that
gets<00:01:40.299> passed<00:01:41.250> usually<00:01:42.250> the<00:01:42.700> kind<00:01:42.850> of<00:01:42.969> barriers

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
gets passed usually the kind of barriers

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.319 
gets passed usually the kind of barriers
that<00:01:43.659> we<00:01:44.200> put<00:01:44.530> up<00:01:44.560> to<00:01:44.979> stop<00:01:45.280> us<00:01:45.520> like<00:01:45.909> that

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
that we put up to stop us like that

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:49.349 
that we put up to stop us like that
words<00:01:46.659> have<00:01:47.049> for<00:01:47.289> example<00:01:47.380> that<00:01:48.310> of<00:01:48.789> reaching

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:49.359 
words have for example that of reaching

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:51.989 
words have for example that of reaching
us<00:01:49.539> and<00:01:49.899> and<00:01:50.770> you<00:01:51.399> know<00:01:51.520> that<00:01:51.729> it's<00:01:51.850> always

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:51.999 
us and and you know that it's always

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:53.730 
us and and you know that it's always
test<00:01:52.329> can<00:01:52.509> be<00:01:52.630> insidious<00:01:53.380> in<00:01:53.590> its

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
test can be insidious in its

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.679
