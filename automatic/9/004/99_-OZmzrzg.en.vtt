 not playable yet and I pay 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.660
 catch now with the first 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.739
 have skills before we get here 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:49.010
 keep watching the normal game guys 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.620
 passive is get excited every time 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.379
 jens an opposing champion without 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.019
 Property gets destroyed a massive 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.480
 Movement bonus for four seconds 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:02.390
 and for 04 seconds this will be massive 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.750
 movement bonus also less and less 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.250
 first craft is switching itself 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.280
 can be between the league and her 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.020
 rocket launcher virus is a seminar mode 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.080
 she gets a stack of up to three 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.120
 times high day about 25 seconds long and 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.760
 It shoots much faster 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.460
 she grows to the rocket launcher she gets 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.830
 more reach causes more harm 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.530
 and all cause your car attacks 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.050
 and can hurt them 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.040
 Cribs every shot costs but mine 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.410
 Boys second craft is sepp jeans 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.150
 itself shoots an electric ball 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.740
 forward causes physical 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.720
 damage reduces that 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.330
 movement speed of the opponent 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.780
 for two seconds by 40 percent 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.820
 and reveals the opponent at this time 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.330
 on the left third craft is the flame 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:56.240
 tom cruise itself litter of three compass 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.980
 which activate themselves and over five 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.130
 seconds then stay active 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.530
 every champion that goes through there 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.320
 for 15 seconds on the ground 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.209
 arrested and gets at 15 seconds 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.209
 long Nordic damage inflicted 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.240
 James Ultimate is the super mega of the 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.120
 The ultimate is over 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.620
 complete map and if you are on one 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.810
 champion hits her 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.120
 physical damage the longer the 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.360
 The flown rocket is the more damaging 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.940
 she also gets 30 more 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.700
 percent of the lost life of the 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.670
 opponents on the damage counted on and 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.890
 Opponents who hurt the impact of 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.980
 the rocket gets 80 percent 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.890
 damage and its chain can only 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.720
 be held by champions minions 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.490
 are not affected by it as well 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.660
 determined us here now in the normal 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.970
 play and I still have to play 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.650
 Sat one and think how explain 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.200
 you now a champion like me that he 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.520
 usually also always do and 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.450
 the only thing that comes to my mind is 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.700
 This champion is totally therefore so must 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.590
 who does not leave the ppi in 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.960
 Normally I already hold myself now 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.580
 always say very very strong back 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.260
 give shares because I already have many 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.870
 champions participated in the release 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.810
 im in front of the julis and noticed though 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.650
 that they never leave the pp like they did 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.350
 have come to it 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.160
 but especially with jeans I have to say 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.860
 holla the forest fairy 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.800
 So there's a lot I have to do 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.310
 I rarely have such a state camping 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.250
 seen 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.900
 The last time was with Senger and Diana 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.140
 and we all know what's happening there 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.910
 in the beginning it was not funny walked's 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.580
 actually has everything you need them 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.280
 has a slow she once got closer 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.810
 she had hurt and damned and 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.080
 She has a strong ability to drive 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.330
 sync target auto attack she has a team 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.690
 something about the whole card every minute 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.689
 can fire later and what me 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:02.150
 caused massive damage to the opponents 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:06.650
 she is just divine especially 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:09.170
 content the way this change from 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.359
 manage and rocket launcher is on 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.639
 very strong at the beginning because of her 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:16.849
 Attack speed look too crass 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:18.440
 that increases you already in the beginning one 

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:20.599
 the feeling she got fendt around 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.220
 dancer or something in the inventory though you 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:24.680
 now does not own it but attacks 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.080
 just as fast with that and that is 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.860
 just in low level area real 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.509
 So hard cannes necessarily bored 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:36.550
 Doing a lot and as I said that 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:39.259
 ultimate if you can pull with it 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.590
 very very deadly so everyone with one 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:46.789
 Scissors can handle the multimedia 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:48.940
 will not have any problems here and will 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:51.919
 to dust some kids 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.979
 and yes as I said it is currently nothing 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:57.740
 other than totally powered there must be 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:00.949
 definitely ran otherwise she has very much 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.169
 a lot of fun and yes that was it 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:05.240
 first with the champions I have something 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.340
 I liked you and I hope we see 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.370
 then bite us again next time 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.370
 then
