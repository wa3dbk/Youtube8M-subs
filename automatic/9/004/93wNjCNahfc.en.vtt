00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
chair I can just kind of peek over the

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.459 
chair I can just kind of peek over the
wall<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.420> enemies<00:00:36.870> can<00:00:37.050> only<00:00:37.170> see<00:00:37.379> the

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
wall and the enemies can only see the

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.889 
wall and the enemies can only see the
tip<00:00:37.620> in<00:00:37.800> my<00:00:37.890> head<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:38.910> works<00:00:39.239> for<00:00:39.600> both

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
tip in my head and this works for both

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.630 
tip in my head and this works for both
sides<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.530> map<00:00:40.710> now<00:00:41.040> over<00:00:41.309> on<00:00:41.370> this<00:00:41.520> other

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
sides of the map now over on this other

sides of the map now over on this other
side<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:42.180> not<00:00:42.600> quite<00:00:43.050> as<00:00:43.230> good<00:00:43.379> but<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.800> is

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
side it's not quite as good but it is

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.290 
side it's not quite as good but it is
still<00:00:44.160> pretty<00:00:44.399> good<00:00:44.699> and<00:00:44.879> as<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.149> can<00:00:45.269> see

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
still pretty good and as you can see

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.239 
still pretty good and as you can see
from<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.839> third<00:00:46.050> person<00:00:46.260> view<00:00:46.620> coming<00:00:47.070> up

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:47.249 
from the third person view coming up

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:51.500 
from the third person view coming up
right<00:00:47.609> now<00:00:48.409> now<00:00:49.409> you<00:00:49.469> can<00:00:49.739> see<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.280> yes<00:00:50.969> at

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510

first I'm very very open to to get shot
at<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.719> then<00:00:55.050> I'm<00:00:55.379> not<00:00:55.589> as<00:00:55.739> much<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.249> I

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
at and then I'm not as much so I

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.369 
at and then I'm not as much so I
definitely<00:00:56.940> take<00:00:57.390> out<00:00:57.539> those<00:00:57.690> campers<00:00:58.170> that

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
definitely take out those campers that

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.139 
definitely take out those campers that
set<00:00:58.559> up<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.800> those<00:00:58.920> windows<00:00:59.429> with<00:00:59.699> this<00:00:59.940> little

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
set up in those windows with this little

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.750 
set up in those windows with this little
strategy<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.079> now<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.829> very<00:01:02.309> very

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
strategy and now this is a very very

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.080 
strategy and now this is a very very
very<00:01:02.940> good<00:01:03.479> line<00:01:03.839> of<00:01:03.870> sight<00:01:04.940> people<00:01:05.940> will

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
very good line of sight people will

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.880 
very good line of sight people will
spawn<00:01:06.450> over<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.080> main<00:01:07.320> building<00:01:07.740> they'll

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
spawn over in that main building they'll

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.530 
spawn over in that main building they'll
come<00:01:08.100> running<00:01:08.340> out<00:01:08.580> through<00:01:08.880> here<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.360> you

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
come running out through here and you

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.120 
come running out through here and you
can<00:01:09.690> just<00:01:09.840> take<00:01:10.050> them<00:01:10.229> out<00:01:10.350> all<00:01:10.590> day<00:01:10.740> long<00:01:10.950> I

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
can just take them out all day long I

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.740 
can just take them out all day long I
think<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.370> went<00:01:11.550> on<00:01:11.610> like<00:01:11.760> an<00:01:11.880> 11<00:01:12.240> killstreak

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
think I went on like an 11 killstreak

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.139 
think I went on like an 11 killstreak
just<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.500> spot<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:14.040> couldn't<00:01:14.729> find<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
just in this spot I couldn't find the

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:16.429 
just in this spot I couldn't find the
game<00:01:15.299> on<00:01:15.329> my<00:01:15.570> file<00:01:15.750> share<00:01:15.780> though<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.170> don't

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439

know<00:01:16.530> if<00:01:16.649> it<00:01:16.740> messed<00:01:16.920> up<00:01:17.130> or<00:01:17.340> something<00:01:17.670> and

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
know if it messed up or something and

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.719
