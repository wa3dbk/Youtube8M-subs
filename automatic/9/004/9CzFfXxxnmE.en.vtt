00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.730 
being with someone but not putting the
effort<00:02:13.840> in<00:02:14.230> that<00:02:15.069> it<00:02:15.220> would<00:02:15.370> take<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:16.630> have<00:02:17.440> a

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
effort in that it would take to have a

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.350 
effort in that it would take to have a
very<00:02:18.459> good<00:02:19.390> solid<00:02:20.200> consistent<00:02:21.360> relationship

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
very good solid consistent relationship

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.080 
very good solid consistent relationship
so<00:02:22.900> that's<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.410> crummy<00:02:23.680> answer<00:02:24.250> but<00:02:24.819> it<00:02:24.910> does

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
so that's the crummy answer but it does

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.240 
so that's the crummy answer but it does
happen<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.170> thing<00:02:26.319> I<00:02:26.440> think<00:02:26.680> it's<00:02:26.770> that's

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
happen the the thing I think it's that's

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.949 
happen the the thing I think it's that's
good<00:02:27.550> for<00:02:27.910> you<00:02:28.030> Nora<00:02:28.239> is<00:02:28.450> that<00:02:28.630> you're<00:02:28.720> seeing

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
good for you Nora is that you're seeing

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.660 
good for you Nora is that you're seeing
things<00:02:29.170> as<00:02:29.410> they<00:02:29.440> really<00:02:29.800> are<00:02:29.830> you're<00:02:30.520> not

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
things as they really are you're not

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.780 
things as they really are you're not
wearing<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.270> Rose<00:02:31.450> tinted<00:02:32.050> glasses<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:32.950> just

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
wearing the Rose tinted glasses and just

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.140 
wearing the Rose tinted glasses and just
looking<00:02:34.600> at<00:02:34.720> things<00:02:34.989> as<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.709> want<00:02:35.920> them<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:36.250> be
