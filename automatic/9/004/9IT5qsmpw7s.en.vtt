lot of other companies are working on

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.120 
lot of other companies are working on
other<00:02:54.330> variants<00:02:54.989> of<00:02:55.050> this<00:02:55.200> one<00:02:55.440> in<00:02:55.560> particular

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
other variants of this one in particular

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
other variants of this one in particular
is<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.640> new<00:02:56.940> Lexus<00:02:57.680> lx570<00:02:58.680> has<00:02:59.550> a<00:02:59.580> similar

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
is the new Lexus lx570 has a similar

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.180 
is the new Lexus lx570 has a similar
camera<00:03:01.020> setup<00:03:01.470> that<00:03:01.620> can<00:03:01.739> actually<00:03:01.860> look

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
camera setup that can actually look

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.760 
camera setup that can actually look
around<00:03:02.370> corners<00:03:02.940> so<00:03:03.390> we're<00:03:04.200> getting<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:04.500> lot<00:03:04.620> of

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
around corners so we're getting a lot of

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.440 
around corners so we're getting a lot of
electronics<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:05.550> a<00:03:05.580> lot<00:03:05.730> of<00:03:05.820> technologies

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
electronics and a lot of technologies

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.360 
electronics and a lot of technologies
and<00:03:06.630> cars<00:03:06.840> which<00:03:07.110> is<00:03:07.140> fantastic<00:03:07.500> because<00:03:08.160> I

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
and cars which is fantastic because I

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.490 
and cars which is fantastic because I
think<00:03:08.520> it<00:03:08.610> makes<00:03:08.790> just<00:03:09.060> driving<00:03:09.870> safer<00:03:10.380> and

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
think it makes just driving safer and

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.530 
think it makes just driving safer and
easier<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:11.130> why<00:03:11.310> not<00:03:11.520> we<00:03:11.700> have<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:12.090> cameras

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
easier and why not we have the cameras

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.449 
easier and why not we have the cameras
they're<00:03:12.720> very<00:03:12.959> inexpensive<00:03:13.250> let's<00:03:14.250> take

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
they're very inexpensive let's take

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.300 
they're very inexpensive let's take
advantage<00:03:14.580> of<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.090> also<00:03:15.780> in<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.200> car<00:03:16.440> it's<00:03:17.070> got

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
advantage of it also in the car it's got

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.690 
advantage of it also in the car it's got
a<00:03:17.489> really<00:03:17.790> really<00:03:18.209> nice<00:03:18.890> swoopy<00:03:19.890> coupe<00:03:20.670> like

Lexus is you know this is something you
might<00:03:37.350> want<00:03:37.530> to<00:03:37.590> consider<00:03:37.890> it's<00:03:38.130> a<00:03:38.190> little<00:03:38.370> bit

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
might want to consider it's a little bit

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.759 
might want to consider it's a little bit
bigger<00:03:38.700> than<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:38.940> sedan<00:03:39.360> but<00:03:40.260> it's<00:03:40.410> got<00:03:40.560> a<00:03:40.590> lot

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
bigger than a sedan but it's got a lot

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.009 
bigger than a sedan but it's got a lot
more<00:03:40.880> functionality<00:03:41.880> in<00:03:42.000> size<00:03:42.269> and<00:03:42.600> features

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
more functionality in size and features

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.949 
more functionality in size and features
performs<00:03:43.709> kind<00:03:44.010> of<00:03:44.100> like<00:03:44.220> a<00:03:44.250> sport<00:03:44.700> coupe<00:03:45.030> so<00:03:45.930> I

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
performs kind of like a sport coupe so I

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.690 
performs kind of like a sport coupe so I
think<00:03:46.410> this<00:03:46.500> is<00:03:46.620> going<00:03:46.769> to<00:03:46.830> be<00:03:46.950> a<00:03:46.980> really<00:03:47.489> big

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
think this is going to be a really big

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:56.690 
think this is going to be a really big
success<00:03:48.209> for<00:03:48.239> infiniti<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:48.959> infiniti<00:03:49.440> e^x

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.979 

think<00:03:57.299> you're<00:03:57.390> going<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.570> see<00:03:57.720> a<00:03:57.750> lot<00:03:57.959> of

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
think you're going to see a lot of

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.140 
think you're going to see a lot of
manufacturers<00:03:58.830> follow<00:03:59.130> we<00:03:59.370> saw<00:03:59.519> the<00:03:59.580> x6

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
obviously in Frankfurt which I would say

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.759 
obviously in Frankfurt which I would say
is<00:04:02.459> a<00:04:02.489> bigger<00:04:02.820> version<00:04:03.180> of<00:04:03.390> this<00:04:03.600> but<00:04:04.170> I<00:04:04.470> would

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769
