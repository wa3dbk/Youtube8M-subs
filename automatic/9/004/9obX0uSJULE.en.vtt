00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
hey guys this is Nick again from HTC

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.440 
hey guys this is Nick again from HTC
source<00:00:03.840> we<00:00:04.080> have<00:00:04.290> the<00:00:04.529> HTC<00:00:04.819> inspire<00:00:05.819> 4G<00:00:06.420> and

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450

source we have the HTC inspire 4G and
we're<00:00:06.960> going<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.109> give<00:00:07.290> you<00:00:07.379> a<00:00:07.440> quick<00:00:07.649> look<00:00:07.950> at

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:08.570 
we're going to give you a quick look at

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.430 
we're going to give you a quick look at
speed<00:00:09.570> tests<00:00:10.019> with<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:11.070> tease<00:00:11.969> first<00:00:12.420> 4g<00:00:13.410> phone

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
speed tests with a tease first 4g phone

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.150 
speed tests with a tease first 4g phone
for<00:00:13.920> their<00:00:14.040> hspa+<00:00:14.880> network<00:00:15.859> we<00:00:16.859> have<00:00:16.949> two

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
for their hspa+ network we have two

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.880 
for their hspa+ network we have two
locations<00:00:17.369> here<00:00:18.060> we<00:00:18.210> have<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.390> FCC<00:00:19.320> test<00:00:19.619> and

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
locations here we have the FCC test and

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.779 
locations here we have the FCC test and
then<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.460> speedtest.net<00:00:22.189> application<00:00:23.189> which

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
then the speedtest.net application which

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.779 
then the speedtest.net application which
most<00:00:24.029> people<00:00:24.150> are<00:00:24.570> familiar<00:00:24.600> with<00:00:25.550> speed<00:00:26.550> so

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
most people are familiar with speed so

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.540 
most people are familiar with speed so
far<00:00:27.029> looked<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.480> be<00:00:28.010> comparable<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.160> what

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
far looked to be comparable to what

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.190 
far looked to be comparable to what
we're<00:00:29.730> getting<00:00:29.849> with<00:00:31.340> t-mobile's<00:00:32.340> hspa+<00:00:33.239> here

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
with a ping of 224 when I run it a

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.790 
with a ping of 224 when I run it a
second<00:00:56.789> time<00:00:56.820> since<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.899> numbers<00:00:58.050> do<00:00:58.440> vary

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
second time since the numbers do vary

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:10.870

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.569 

and<00:01:11.060> here<00:01:12.020> we<00:01:12.079> go<00:01:12.170> the<00:01:12.619> second<00:01:13.399> time<00:01:13.549> around

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:13.579 
and here we go the second time around

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:16.810 
and here we go the second time around
which<00:01:14.119> is<00:01:14.270> typically<00:01:14.659> the<00:01:15.250> faster<00:01:16.250> one<00:01:16.460> seems

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
which is typically the faster one seems

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.219 
which is typically the faster one seems
to<00:01:16.939> be<00:01:17.060> a<00:01:17.090> little<00:01:17.270> bit<00:01:17.390> slower<00:01:17.780> we're<00:01:18.079> just

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
to be a little bit slower we're just

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.069 
to be a little bit slower we're just
going<00:01:18.350> to<00:01:18.380> run<00:01:18.530> that<00:01:18.680> one<00:01:19.100> more<00:01:19.310> time<00:01:19.869> to<00:01:20.869> see

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.079 
going to run that one more time to see

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:23.160 
going to run that one more time to see
if<00:01:21.170> we<00:01:21.289> get<00:01:21.470> some<00:01:21.649> different<00:01:21.979> numbers<00:01:22.280> and

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
if we get some different numbers and

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.929 
if we get some different numbers and
there<00:01:24.170> you<00:01:24.289> go<00:01:24.320> you<00:01:24.470> can<00:01:24.799> see<00:01:25.009> there<00:01:25.250> this<00:01:25.909> time

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
there you go you can see there this time

back to home screen here and use the

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.749 
back to home screen here and use the
FCC's<00:01:49.149> speed<00:01:50.149> test<00:01:50.950> see<00:01:51.950> if<00:01:51.979> our<00:01:52.340> number<00:01:52.670> is

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
FCC's speed test see if our number is

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.760 
FCC's speed test see if our number is
very<00:01:53.000> any<00:01:53.299> with<00:01:53.539> that<00:01:56.049> we<00:01:57.049> actually<00:01:57.200> use<00:01:57.530> this

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
very any with that we actually use this

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.469 
very any with that we actually use this
earlier<00:01:58.310> this<00:01:58.549> afternoon<00:01:58.759> to<00:01:59.149> upload<00:01:59.450> our

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
earlier this afternoon to upload our

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.399 
earlier this afternoon to upload our
first<00:01:59.950> hands<00:02:00.950> on<00:02:01.099> it<00:02:01.280> unboxing<00:02:02.000> video<00:02:02.409> since

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
first hands on it unboxing video since

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.460 
first hands on it unboxing video since
our<00:02:04.250> Wi-Fi<00:02:05.090> network<00:02:05.420> here<00:02:05.599> at<00:02:05.720> home<00:02:05.840> wasn't

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
our Wi-Fi network here at home wasn't

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.289 
our Wi-Fi network here at home wasn't
working<00:02:06.740> so<00:02:06.770> well<00:02:07.069> so<00:02:07.369> we've<00:02:07.970> been<00:02:08.119> testing

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:08.299 
working so well so we've been testing

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:09.850 
working so well so we've been testing
this<00:02:08.569> out<00:02:08.750> we've<00:02:08.929> used<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.259> hotspot<00:02:09.679> the

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
this out we've used the hotspot the

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.530 
this out we've used the hotspot the
speeds<00:02:10.099> went<00:02:10.310> pretty<00:02:10.429> good<00:02:10.640> it's<00:02:11.269> actually

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
speeds went pretty good it's actually

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.600 
speeds went pretty good it's actually
faster<00:02:11.750> than<00:02:12.110> our<00:02:12.319> comcast<00:02:12.590> for<00:02:13.099> some<00:02:13.250> reason

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
faster than our comcast for some reason

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.759 
faster than our comcast for some reason
since<00:02:13.989> it<00:02:14.989> seems<00:02:15.260> like<00:02:15.380> they<00:02:15.530> were<00:02:15.590> having

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
since it seems like they were having

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.340 
since it seems like they were having
some<00:02:16.100> network<00:02:16.400> issues<00:02:16.760> so<00:02:17.390> first<00:02:17.870> test<00:02:18.140> here

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
some network issues so first test here

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.590 
some network issues so first test here

I mean so far the speeds haven't been
terribly<00:02:41.790> impressive<00:02:42.270> but<00:02:43.340> using<00:02:44.390> hspa+<00:02:45.590> it's

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
terribly impressive but using hspa+ it's

terribly impressive but using hspa+ it's
pretty<00:02:46.860> much<00:02:47.010> on<00:02:47.190> par<00:02:47.220> with<00:02:47.459> what<00:02:47.640> we've<00:02:47.970> seen

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
with t-mobile's supposed 4G network so

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.250 
with t-mobile's supposed 4G network so
you're<00:02:53.160> not<00:02:53.250> going<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.489> get<00:02:53.610> any<00:02:53.849> 4g<00:02:54.540> LTE

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
you're not going to get any 4g LTE
