roll<00:02:17.930> up<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.260> picture<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.650> what<00:02:18.890> I<00:02:18.920> did<00:02:19.160> is

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
roll up the picture and what I did is

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.920 
roll up the picture and what I did is
just<00:02:19.280> put<00:02:19.580> little<00:02:19.700> slices<00:02:20.209> in<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.599> picture

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
just put little slices in the picture

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.180 
just put little slices in the picture
four<00:02:21.200> of<00:02:21.319> them<00:02:21.530> just<00:02:22.280> so<00:02:22.730> it's<00:02:23.269> not<00:02:23.450> bubbling

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
four of them just so it's not bubbling

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.650 
four of them just so it's not bubbling
because<00:02:25.190> it<00:02:25.340> is<00:02:25.459> slightly<00:02:25.700> a<00:02:25.880> round<00:02:26.180> bulb<00:02:26.390> if

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
because it is slightly a round bulb if

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.720 
because it is slightly a round bulb if
you're<00:02:27.140> using<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.590> big<00:02:27.830> round<00:02:28.069> bulbs<00:02:28.519> which

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
you're using the big round bulbs which

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.339 
you're using the big round bulbs which
are<00:02:28.849> also<00:02:28.970> very<00:02:29.300> pretty<00:02:29.630> but<00:02:29.900> there<00:02:30.050> are<00:02:30.140> a<00:02:30.170> lot

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
are also very pretty but there are a lot

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.199 
are also very pretty but there are a lot
more<00:02:30.380> tedious<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:31.730> you<00:02:31.819> have<00:02:31.940> to<00:02:32.060> put<00:02:32.180> a

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
more tedious and you have to put a

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.820 
more tedious and you have to put a
little<00:02:32.390> bit<00:02:32.510> more<00:02:32.599> slices<00:02:33.019> in<00:02:33.290> them<00:02:33.440> you<00:02:33.680> might

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
little bit more slices in them you might

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.240 
little bit more slices in them you might
also<00:02:34.010> want<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:34.400> put<00:02:34.580> a<00:02:34.610> couple<00:02:34.760> um<00:02:36.069> put<00:02:37.069> a

also want to put a couple um put a

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.949 
also want to put a couple um put a
couple<00:02:37.640> pin<00:02:37.819> holes<00:02:38.090> in<00:02:38.269> them<00:02:38.420> pricks<00:02:38.660> to<00:02:38.840> get

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
couple pin holes in them pricks to get

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.080 
couple pin holes in them pricks to get
the<00:02:39.080> bubbles<00:02:39.260> out<00:02:39.530> so<00:02:40.519> what<00:02:40.670> I'm<00:02:40.760> doing<00:02:40.970> with

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
the bubbles out so what I'm doing with

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.270 
the bubbles out so what I'm doing with
my<00:02:41.120> paintbrush<00:02:41.600> is<00:02:41.959> just<00:02:42.350> making<00:02:42.890> sure<00:02:43.100> all

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
my paintbrush is just making sure all

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.030 
my paintbrush is just making sure all
the<00:02:43.549> edges<00:02:43.750> I'm<00:02:44.750> getting<00:02:45.560> it<00:02:45.650> straight<00:02:45.830> and

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
the edges I'm getting it straight and

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.410 
the edges I'm getting it straight and
then<00:02:46.190> making<00:02:46.370> sure<00:02:46.519> all<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:47.000> edges<00:02:47.090> are

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
then making sure all the edges are

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.300 
then making sure all the edges are
laying<00:02:47.569> flat<00:02:47.870> if<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.680> edges<00:02:48.980> aren't<00:02:49.160> laying

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
laying flat if the edges aren't laying

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.360 
laying flat if the edges aren't laying
flat<00:02:49.640> what<00:02:50.060> happens<00:02:50.569> is<00:02:50.810> um<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.920> sparkles

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
flat what happens is um the sparkles

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.190 
flat what happens is um the sparkles
again<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:52.819> sprinkles<00:02:53.299> like<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.780> sparkles

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
again the sprinkles like the sparkles

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.650 
again the sprinkles like the sparkles
the<00:02:55.069> spread<00:02:55.340> goats<00:02:55.519> that<00:02:56.060> you<00:02:56.239> put<00:02:56.450> in<00:02:56.540> will

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
the spread goats that you put in will

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.780 
the spread goats that you put in will
get<00:02:56.780> underneath<00:02:57.080> and<00:02:57.350> it'll<00:02:57.709> look<00:02:57.860> like<00:02:58.040> kife

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
get underneath and it'll look like kife

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.030 
get underneath and it'll look like kife
so<00:02:59.569> then<00:02:59.870> I'm<00:02:59.959> using<00:03:00.049> this<00:03:00.380> bottle<00:03:00.860> brush

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
so then I'm using this bottle brush

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.650 
so then I'm using this bottle brush
because<00:03:01.459> I<00:03:01.819> don't<00:03:02.030> have<00:03:02.150> anything<00:03:02.360> else

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
because I don't have anything else

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.650 
because I don't have anything else
because<00:03:02.870> it<00:03:03.019> really<00:03:03.830> gets<00:03:04.040> in<00:03:04.310> there<00:03:04.549> and<00:03:05.540> you

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
because it really gets in there and you

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.259 
because it really gets in there and you
just<00:03:05.690> want<00:03:05.930> to<00:03:06.140> go<00:03:06.890> from<00:03:07.130> the<00:03:07.370> middle<00:03:07.700> work

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.620 
your way to the edges and make sure as
best<00:03:10.280> as<00:03:10.519> you<00:03:10.549> can<00:03:10.940> you're<00:03:11.239> going<00:03:11.359> to<00:03:11.420> get<00:03:11.540> it
