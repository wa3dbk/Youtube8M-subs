one which I'm not keeping the recording

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.190 
one which I'm not keeping the recording
for<00:02:38.510> because<00:02:38.660> they<00:02:38.750> gave<00:02:38.900> up<00:02:39.080> 110<00:02:39.950> um

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200

Butterfree<00:02:42.200> has<00:02:42.440> compound<00:02:42.890> eyes<00:02:43.070> so<00:02:44.030> it's

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
Butterfree has compound eyes so it's

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.050 
Butterfree has compound eyes so it's
just<00:02:44.600> as<00:02:45.130> effective<00:02:46.130> is<00:02:46.370> no<00:02:46.610> time<00:02:46.760> some

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
accuracy of sleep powder just like

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.050

Yammer<00:02:48.950> is<00:02:49.270> with<00:02:50.270> hypnosis<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.880> only

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
Yammer is with hypnosis and the only

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.479 
Yammer is with hypnosis and the only
slight<00:02:53.630> problem<00:02:53.959> is<00:02:54.110> that<00:02:54.620> it's<00:02:54.800> a<00:02:54.980> lot<00:02:55.220> slower

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
slight problem is that it's a lot slower

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.690 
slight problem is that it's a lot slower
than<00:02:55.700> Yammer<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:57.070> probably<00:02:58.070> of<00:02:58.190> em<00:02:58.340> I<00:02:58.519> think

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
than Yammer and probably of em I think

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.690 
than Yammer and probably of em I think
ski<00:02:58.910> powder<00:02:59.150> kind<00:02:59.450> of<00:02:59.570> looks<00:02:59.780> nicer<00:03:00.190> so<00:03:01.190> yeah

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
ski powder kind of looks nicer so yeah

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.009 
ski powder kind of looks nicer so yeah
those<00:03:02.630> advantages<00:03:03.019> there<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:05.000> so<00:03:05.630> prim<00:03:05.840> put

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
those advantages there and so prim put

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.410 
those advantages there and so prim put

my<00:03:41.110> best<00:03:41.500> pass<00:03:41.770> comes<00:03:42.040> up<00:03:42.220> first<00:03:42.430> because<00:03:42.850> a

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
my best pass comes up first because a

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.400 
my best pass comes up first because a
bike<00:03:43.720> on<00:03:43.900> is<00:03:44.260> how<00:03:44.620> much<00:03:44.800> a<00:03:44.830> speed<00:03:45.220> machine<00:03:45.700> and

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
bike on is how much a speed machine and

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.370 
bike on is how much a speed machine and
dugong<00:03:47.410> comes<00:03:47.650> out<00:03:47.890> and<00:03:48.160> two<00:03:48.550> guns<00:03:48.790> I<00:03:49.210> can<00:03:50.170> use

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
dugong comes out and two guns I can use

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.160 
dugong comes out and two guns I can use
as<00:03:50.560> a<00:03:50.590> wall<00:03:50.890> and<00:03:51.270> it's<00:03:52.270> got<00:03:52.450> hydration<00:03:52.900> and

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
as a wall and it's got hydration and

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.470 
as a wall and it's got hydration and
damp<00:03:53.410> rock<00:03:53.680> and<00:03:54.030> rest<00:03:55.030> and<00:03:55.900> rained<00:03:56.320> out<00:03:56.850> so<00:03:57.850> its

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
damp rock and rest and rained out so its

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.420 
damp rock and rest and rained out so its
status<00:03:59.440> is<00:03:59.620> restored<00:04:00.100> after<00:04:00.730> it<00:04:01.210> sleeps<00:04:02.370> so<00:04:03.370> I

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
status is restored after it sleeps so I

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.550 
status is restored after it sleeps so I
status<00:04:04.000> restored<00:04:04.420> as<00:04:04.660> long<00:04:04.900> as<00:04:04.990> it's<00:04:05.140> raining

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
status restored as long as it's raining

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.730 
status restored as long as it's raining
and<00:04:06.690> and<00:04:07.690> it<00:04:08.110> sleeps<00:04:09.720> with<00:04:10.720> rest<00:04:11.020> and<00:04:11.230> then

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
and and it sleeps with rest and then

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.290 
and and it sleeps with rest and then
gets<00:04:11.950> woken<00:04:12.130> up<00:04:12.370> my<00:04:12.490> hydration<00:04:12.880> that's<00:04:13.209> the

gets woken up my hydration that's the

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.330 
gets woken up my hydration that's the
way<00:04:13.390> it<00:04:13.450> works<00:04:13.630> ok<00:04:14.050> I<00:04:14.290> know<00:04:14.860> what<00:04:15.130> I'm<00:04:15.190> talking

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
useful so dragon pulse counter again

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:09.189 
useful so dragon pulse counter again
this<00:05:05.159> very<00:05:05.999> good<00:05:06.210> damage<00:05:06.979> and<00:05:07.979> ice<00:05:08.490> beam<00:05:08.819> which

ferno's so yeah I don't really want to
use<00:05:40.830> sir<00:05:42.020> so<00:05:43.020> I'm<00:05:43.289> just<00:05:43.529> going<00:05:43.680> to<00:05:43.770> show<00:05:43.830> them

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
use sir so I'm just going to show them

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:46.010 
use sir so I'm just going to show them
exactly<00:05:44.550> what<00:05:44.789> they<00:05:44.849> did<00:05:45.210> by<00:05:45.539> doing<00:05:45.810> brain

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
exactly what they did by doing brain

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.529 
exactly what they did by doing brain
parts<00:05:46.909> and<00:05:48.169> that's<00:05:49.169> why<00:05:49.319> I<00:05:49.349> canine<00:05:50.039> I've<00:05:50.849> got<00:05:51.509> a

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
parts and that's why I canine I've got a

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:55.519 
parts and that's why I canine I've got a
few<00:05:51.750> moves<00:05:52.020> I<00:05:52.589> could<00:05:53.339> use<00:05:53.759> but<00:05:54.360> I<00:05:54.389> think<00:05:55.020> the

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:55.529 
few moves I could use but I think the

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:58.790 
few moves I could use but I think the
biggest<00:05:55.680> threat<00:05:56.189> is<00:05:56.639> going<00:05:57.029> to<00:05:57.210> be<00:05:57.800> entering

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
biggest threat is going to be entering

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.010 
biggest threat is going to be entering
club<00:05:59.099> so<00:05:59.339> I'm<00:05:59.400> going<00:05:59.580> to<00:05:59.610> extreme<00:06:00.089> speed<00:06:00.629> and

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
club so I'm going to extreme speed and

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.719 
club so I'm going to extreme speed and
primp<00:06:01.349> and<00:06:03.770> while<00:06:04.770> the<00:06:04.889> disadvantage<00:06:05.520> of<00:06:05.610> the

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:05.729 
primp and while the disadvantage of the

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:07.939 
primp and while the disadvantage of the
Duke<00:06:05.939> on<00:06:06.089> as<00:06:06.240> a<00:06:06.270> wall<00:06:06.509> is<00:06:06.779> it's<00:06:07.650> actually

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:07.949 
Duke on as a wall is it's actually

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:12.279 
Duke on as a wall is it's actually
normally<00:06:08.960> normally<00:06:09.960> affected<00:06:10.710> by<00:06:11.550> fire<00:06:11.819> moves

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:12.289 
normally normally affected by fire moves

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:15.679 
normally normally affected by fire moves
so<00:06:13.289> it's<00:06:13.710> not<00:06:14.069> actually<00:06:14.279> as<00:06:14.879> resilient<00:06:15.389> as<00:06:15.539> it

00:06:15.679 --> 00:06:15.689 
so it's not actually as resilient as it

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:18.679 
so it's not actually as resilient as it
could<00:06:15.870> be<00:06:16.020> the<00:06:16.169> fire<00:06:16.379> okay<00:06:16.939> it's<00:06:17.939> also<00:06:18.180> not<00:06:18.389> as

00:06:18.679 --> 00:06:18.689 
could be the fire okay it's also not as

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:22.730 
could be the fire okay it's also not as
super<00:06:19.110> effective<00:06:19.669> attacks<00:06:20.669> by<00:06:21.449> and<00:06:21.899> biting

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
super effective attacks by and biting

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.219 
super effective attacks by and biting
because<00:06:23.069> its<00:06:23.219> place<00:06:23.460> but<00:06:23.819> yeah<00:06:24.659> now<00:06:25.020> I'm<00:06:25.080> going

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:25.229 
because its place but yeah now I'm going

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:27.050 
because its place but yeah now I'm going
to<00:06:25.289> get<00:06:25.409> red<00:06:25.620> stuff<00:06:25.919> so<00:06:26.250> back<00:06:26.580> up<00:06:26.610> the<00:06:26.849> phone
