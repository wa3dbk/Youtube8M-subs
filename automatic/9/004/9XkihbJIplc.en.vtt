00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.959
 I used my patch fps mod edition 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.970
 very interesting thing this is done for 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.489
 so that you can record beautiful 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:38.269

 frags are often class people on the tab 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.709
 Naturally all this is in a haze shown here 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.060
 This patch disables the entire invoice table. 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:55.099
 advertising plugins which are displayed on 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.030

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.819
 in public 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.269
 disable chat leaves only you and 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.549

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.640
 recovery 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:09.860
 besides this buy menu buy menu 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.780
 modified beautiful and standard 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.920
 classic both will not turn on 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.299
 through the menu commands on the letter x in the game I 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.350
 already demonstrated there are many 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:24.430
 interesting settings such as let's say 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:28.120
 game detailing is also a setting for 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:32.389
 weak pc there shut off and on 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.400
 effects of blood there haze there stains from 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:37.190
 bullets and so on and so forth 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.440
 3d mode well in general many different 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:43.160
 modifications which can be included 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:46.040
 and also disconnect we go further and the main thing 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.340
 the game menu here we see 4 styles 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.650
 menu is blue transparent red black 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.840
 and yellow and blue so lightovy which 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.630
 will stand in the assembly itself by 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.299
 standards here we will add more 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.980
 voice acting which was in this assembly and 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.930
 We put the classic so you can 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.700
 choose 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.900
 use voice acting there very 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.049
 Interesting dubbing light from the CCS also with 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.209
 of contrast 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.579
 strike global offencive ie, the goal of 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.200
 And in my opinion even with some kind of assembly 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:17.250
 to be a conditioner zero I don't know exactly 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.930
 general sculpted 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.810
 on anyway, but nevertheless not bad 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.910
 It turned out the voice acting is interesting for those who are not 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.650
 support modified voice acting 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.340
 will be able to put a classic voice acting 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:32.550
 ks16 here besides that maybe we 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.830
 add another panel for modifications 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.550
 maybe something else here 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:41.460
 Flippin finalize the patch data for all 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:44.870
 collection version collection counter strike 1 6 but 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:48.090
 steam walls and release naturally already 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.450
 long-awaited counter strike 1 6 buy he's 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.970
 about 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.980
 and in addition to these programs 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.210
 you can order your ads from 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:59.520
 me 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:02.070
 to be exact you can order 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.260
 this panel for yourself to extend it 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.180
 either I will distribute it and 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.850
 click on one of the panels 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.860
 the link will open let's say with 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.080
 your video or your group 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.190
 it's very effective because you can 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.630
 will stuff views and also 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:24.240
 become popular popular in 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:27.919
 principle, that's how this is such a garbage 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:32.750
 she will be done will be ready and 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:35.550
 given to Vlad and Vlad I already hope 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.560

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.350
 this will be a poll ask him 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:44.669
 answer if something is missing 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:47.490
 you can write in the comments what 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:49.560
 if you are supported we will add this 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.570
 the modification that you will come offered 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:55.020
 either on the line if it is not in this 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:57.390
 assembly here answer immediately to those who are not 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.979

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:03.390
 already built in via menu commands 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:06.840
 Launched in 2014 2015 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:09.690
 also there is a config on fps lowering 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:12.150
 fps also shooting there and much fame 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.979
 many different interesting configurations 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.680
 which you can enable either 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:18.600
 turn off here and so put Like 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.460
