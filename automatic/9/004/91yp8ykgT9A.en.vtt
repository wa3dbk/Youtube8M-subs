mean it doesn't know it doesn't work a
hundred<00:03:05.269> percent<00:03:05.389> obviously<00:03:06.230> but<00:03:06.409> you<00:03:07.370> know

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
hundred percent obviously but you know

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.940 
hundred percent obviously but you know
it's<00:03:07.609> something<00:03:08.510> more<00:03:08.810> chains<00:03:09.200> I<00:03:09.500> tried<00:03:09.799> it

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
it's something more chains I tried it

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.009 
it's something more chains I tried it
and<00:03:09.980> I<00:03:10.370> got<00:03:10.669> there<00:03:10.849> I<00:03:10.879> got<00:03:11.090> really<00:03:11.389> lucky<00:03:11.659> there

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
and I got there I got really lucky there

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.949 
and I got there I got really lucky there
I<00:03:12.409> mean<00:03:13.310> I<00:03:13.370> feel<00:03:13.609> it<00:03:13.730> just<00:03:14.239> came<00:03:14.510> out<00:03:14.569> to<00:03:14.870> the

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
I mean I feel it just came out to the

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.440 
I mean I feel it just came out to the
middle<00:03:15.109> I<00:03:15.439> mean<00:03:15.799> that's<00:03:15.950> those<00:03:16.639> tapes<00:03:16.939> I<00:03:17.120> panel

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
middle I mean that's those tapes I panel

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.439 
middle I mean that's those tapes I panel
is<00:03:17.540> I<00:03:17.569> think<00:03:17.780> a<00:03:17.959> great<00:03:18.199> and<00:03:19.090> so<00:03:20.090> I<00:03:20.120> can<00:03:20.419> i

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:20.449 
is I think a great and so I can i

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:24.159 
is I think a great and so I can i
exploit<00:03:21.079> it<00:03:21.379> and<00:03:21.500> I<00:03:21.680> really<00:03:22.069> not<00:03:22.819> too<00:03:23.810> far<00:03:24.139> out

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:24.169 
exploit it and I really not too far out

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:25.930 
exploit it and I really not too far out
so<00:03:24.470> even<00:03:24.680> if<00:03:24.769> a<00:03:24.859> keeper<00:03:25.159> gases<00:03:25.579> are<00:03:25.699> like<00:03:25.819> me

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
so even if a keeper gases are like me

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.689 
so even if a keeper gases are like me
probably<00:03:26.449> won't<00:03:26.569> save<00:03:26.900> them<00:03:27.109> now<00:03:27.290> that<00:03:28.220> I<00:03:28.459> mean

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:28.699 
probably won't save them now that I mean

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:33.219 
probably won't save them now that I mean
the<00:03:29.599> cheeky<00:03:30.019> chap<00:03:30.290> may<00:03:30.470> mean<00:03:31.810> just<00:03:32.810> that<00:03:32.930> joke

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:33.229
