want<00:02:33.569> to<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:33.900> can<00:02:34.019> pass<00:02:34.830> over<00:02:35.069> the<00:02:35.190> moment<00:02:35.549> of

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
want to you can pass over the moment of

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.539 
want to you can pass over the moment of
the<00:02:35.700> game<00:02:35.730> so<00:02:36.090> that<00:02:36.209> got<00:02:36.420> bolder<00:02:37.430> a<00:02:39.200> stop

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
the game so that got bolder a stop

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.960 
the game so that got bolder a stop
basically<00:02:42.500> like<00:02:43.500> width<00:02:43.799> of<00:02:44.099> the<00:02:44.489> stars<00:02:44.790> if

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
basically like width of the stars if

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.520 
basically like width of the stars if
you're<00:02:45.450> going<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.599> drag<00:02:45.870> them<00:02:46.110> will<00:02:46.290> spread

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
you're going to drag them will spread

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.199 
you're going to drag them will spread
them<00:02:46.680> around<00:02:46.769> I<00:02:47.130> think<00:02:47.310> this<00:02:47.400> is<00:02:47.459> leaves<00:02:47.910> i'm

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
them around I think this is leaves i'm

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.300 
them around I think this is leaves i'm
not<00:02:48.360> sure<00:02:48.540> i<00:02:48.870> haven't<00:02:49.530> really<00:02:49.799> use<00:02:49.980> this<00:02:50.100> one

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
not sure i haven't really use this one

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.870 
not sure i haven't really use this one
before<00:02:50.930> you<00:02:51.930> just<00:02:52.079> click<00:02:52.380> one<00:02:52.650> set<00:02:52.950> us<00:02:53.069> there

it's<00:02:56.880> like<00:02:57.000> clovelly<00:02:57.630> as<00:02:57.750> i<00:02:57.870> think<00:03:00.260> this<00:03:01.260> is<00:03:01.470> a

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
it's like clovelly as i think this is a

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.240 
it's like clovelly as i think this is a
really<00:03:01.799> good<00:03:02.069> one<00:03:02.280> it's<00:03:02.459> a<00:03:03.109> salt<00:03:04.109> like<00:03:04.290> a<00:03:04.319> bush

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
really good one it's a salt like a bush

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:12.949 
really good one it's a salt like a bush
type<00:03:05.959> tool<00:03:07.069> it's<00:03:08.069> really<00:03:08.340> nice<00:03:11.900> don't<00:03:12.900> know

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
type tool it's really nice don't know

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.610 
type tool it's really nice don't know
what<00:03:13.079> else<00:03:13.139> to<00:03:13.290> say<00:03:13.560> really<00:03:14.569> on<00:03:15.569> the<00:03:15.900> pit<00:03:16.290> bush

comments again I'll so you can see they

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.650 
comments again I'll so you can see they
get<00:03:21.420> pretty<00:03:21.630> full<00:03:22.910> so<00:03:23.910> we'll<00:03:24.209> go<00:03:24.299> up<00:03:24.359> a<00:03:24.450> pencil

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
get pretty full so we'll go up a pencil

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.289 
get pretty full so we'll go up a pencil
to<00:03:24.900> ammo<00:03:25.340> this<00:03:26.340> is<00:03:26.549> the<00:03:26.639> same<00:03:26.880> with<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.090> pencil

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
to ammo this is the same with the pencil

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.199 
to ammo this is the same with the pencil
really<00:03:27.810> are<00:03:27.930> lost<00:03:28.139> a<00:03:28.230> little<00:03:28.440> bit<00:03:29.569> more<00:03:30.569> jagged

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
really are lost a little bit more jagged

there you go you can have that one
that's<00:03:34.650> just<00:03:34.829> the<00:03:34.889> pencil<00:03:35.310> tools<00:03:35.900> not<00:03:36.900> really

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
that's just the pencil tools not really

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.430 
that's just the pencil tools not really
much<00:03:37.380> different<00:03:37.440> to<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.040> papers<00:03:38.430> too

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440

I think really need that one little
thing<00:04:09.490> a<00:04:09.520> lot<00:04:09.760> this<00:04:10.450> is<00:04:10.630> not<00:04:10.990> i'm<00:04:12.180> strictly

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
thing a lot this is not i'm strictly

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.120 
thing a lot this is not i'm strictly
you're<00:04:13.450> doing<00:04:13.630> with<00:04:13.750> a<00:04:13.780> fan<00:04:14.020> brush<00:04:14.200> but<00:04:14.620> this

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
you're doing with a fan brush but this

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.830 
you're doing with a fan brush but this
is<00:04:15.280> a<00:04:15.340> spot<00:04:15.580> healing<00:04:15.820> brush<00:04:15.970> till<00:04:16.390> what<00:04:16.720> you

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
is a spot healing brush till what you

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.590 
is a spot healing brush till what you
can<00:04:16.959> do<00:04:17.110> this<00:04:17.380> is<00:04:17.560> just<00:04:17.799> basically<00:04:18.270> like<00:04:19.270> a<00:04:19.420> row

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
can do this is just basically like a row

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.890 
can do this is just basically like a row
level<00:04:19.750> is<00:04:20.140> a<00:04:20.290> bit<00:04:20.410> effects<00:04:20.830> of<00:04:21.010> your<00:04:21.130> line<00:04:21.900> it

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
level is a bit effects of your line it

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.810 
level is a bit effects of your line it
smudges<00:04:23.380> it<00:04:23.710> so<00:04:24.460> it<00:04:24.550> makes<00:04:24.700> a<00:04:24.820> good<00:04:24.940> effect

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
smudges it so it makes a good effect

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.960 
smudges it so it makes a good effect
like<00:04:27.820> that<00:04:28.030> and<00:04:28.690> if<00:04:29.530> you<00:04:29.800> were<00:04:30.010> a<00:04:30.370> lot<00:04:30.580> of<00:04:30.610> times

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
like that and if you were a lot of times

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.470 
like that and if you were a lot of times
eventually<00:04:31.330> just<00:04:31.660> rubs<00:04:31.900> out<00:04:32.110> I<00:04:33.210> try<00:04:34.210> it<00:04:34.270> with

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
eventually just rubs out I try it with

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.430 
eventually just rubs out I try it with
this<00:04:34.600> one<00:04:34.840> here<00:04:35.080> till<00:04:35.380> this<00:04:35.500> is<00:04:35.560> done<00:04:37.440> there

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
this one here till this is done there

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.460 
this one here till this is done there
