00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.220 
thing you know I would say at least or
around<00:01:29.190> 100<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.940> 200<00:01:30.390> people<00:01:30.510> could<00:01:30.810> see<00:01:31.050> you<00:01:31.200> I

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
around 100 to 200 people could see you I

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.960 
around 100 to 200 people could see you I
think<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.530> would<00:01:31.620> provide<00:01:32.190> an<00:01:32.460> adequate

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
think that would provide an adequate

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.510 
think that would provide an adequate
audience<00:01:33.570> for<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.900> zanpakuto<00:01:34.110> spirit<00:01:35.040> okay

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
audience for the zanpakuto spirit okay

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.550 
audience for the zanpakuto spirit okay
so<00:01:35.850> after<00:01:36.300> you<00:01:36.390> do<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.600> you're<00:01:37.380> just

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
so after you do that you're just

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.870 
so after you do that you're just
basically<00:01:37.950> going<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.370> want<00:01:38.580> to<00:01:38.640> start

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
basically going to want to start

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.230 
basically going to want to start
shouting<00:01:39.300> bankai<00:01:40.230> and<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:41.040> really<00:01:42.030> more

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
shouting bankai and this is really more

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.910 
shouting bankai and this is really more
problematic<00:01:42.870> than<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.110> sounds<00:01:43.500> because<00:01:43.530> you

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
problematic than it sounds because you

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.350 
problematic than it sounds because you
have<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.220> really<00:01:44.490> get<00:01:44.730> in<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.000> diaphragm

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
have to really get in that diaphragm

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.450 
have to really get in that diaphragm
okay<00:01:45.870> if<00:01:45.960> you're<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.140> fan<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.380> scream<00:01:46.830> oh<00:01:46.980> that's
