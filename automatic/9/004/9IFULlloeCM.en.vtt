that first all right I'm gonna go in at

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.470 
that first all right I'm gonna go in at
the<00:00:46.649> power<00:00:46.890> button<00:00:47.280> on<00:00:47.309> both<00:00:47.520> phones<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.360> it

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
the power button on both phones so it

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.600 
the power button on both phones so it
brings<00:00:48.690> up<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.960> slide<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.440> unlock<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:50.010> we're

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
brings up the slide to unlock and we're

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.150 
brings up the slide to unlock and we're
going<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.090> slide<00:00:51.570> at<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.870> same<00:00:52.410> time<00:00:52.770> I'm<00:00:53.039> not

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
going to slide at the same time I'm not

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.389 
going to slide at the same time I'm not
gonna<00:00:53.250> release<00:00:53.550> yet<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.260> three<00:00:55.260> two<00:00:55.739> one<00:00:56.160> and

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
gonna release yet and three two one and

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.010 
gonna release yet and three two one and
this<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:56.969> pretty<00:00:57.149> much<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.600> going<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.840> be<00:00:57.989> a

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
this is pretty much it's going to be a

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.799 
this is pretty much it's going to be a
look<00:00:58.469> at<00:00:58.739> how<00:00:59.010> fast<00:00:59.370> both<00:00:59.969> phones<00:01:00.329> turned<00:01:00.660> off

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
look at how fast both phones turned off

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.810 
look at how fast both phones turned off
now<00:01:01.289> let's<00:01:01.620> see<00:01:01.770> if<00:01:01.949> there's<00:01:02.129> actually<00:01:02.640> a

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
now let's see if there's actually a

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.479 
now let's see if there's actually a
difference<00:01:03.629> if<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.229> 64-bit<00:01:04.979> chip<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.339> going

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
difference if that 64-bit chip is going

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.020 
difference if that 64-bit chip is going
to<00:01:05.670> help<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.000> turn<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.330> off<00:01:06.450> faster<00:01:07.850> so<00:01:08.850> we're

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
to help it turn it off faster so we're

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.810 
to help it turn it off faster so we're
getting<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.270> spinning-wheel<00:01:09.659> right<00:01:10.110> now

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
getting a spinning-wheel right now

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.649 
getting a spinning-wheel right now
nothing<00:01:11.820> yet<00:01:12.060> nothing<00:01:13.549> yet<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:15.360> taking<00:01:15.630> a

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
nothing yet nothing yet it's taking a

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.710 
nothing yet nothing yet it's taking a
long<00:01:15.780> time<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.020> turn<00:01:16.229> off<00:01:17.150> and<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.420> look<00:01:18.509> like<00:01:18.689> a

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
long time to turn off and it look like a

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.530 
long time to turn off and it look like a
5s<00:01:19.200> was<00:01:19.409> just<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.830> hair<00:01:20.159> faster<00:01:20.460> not<00:01:21.240> really

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
5s was just a hair faster not really

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.120 
5s was just a hair faster not really
much<00:01:21.689> that's<00:01:21.869> gonna<00:01:21.930> make<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> difference<00:01:22.259> but

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
much that's gonna make a difference but

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.160 
much that's gonna make a difference but
it<00:01:23.280> was<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> tiny<00:01:24.030> tiny<00:01:24.180> bit<00:01:24.420> faster<00:01:24.659> but<00:01:24.960> again

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
it was a tiny tiny bit faster but again

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.660 
it was a tiny tiny bit faster but again
that's<00:01:25.380> just<00:01:25.560> turning<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.009> phone<00:01:26.159> off<00:01:26.340> now

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
that's just turning the phone off now

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.060 
that's just turning the phone off now
let's<00:01:27.270> actually<00:01:27.390> turn<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.080> phones<00:01:28.290> on<00:01:28.560> and

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
let's actually turn the phones on and

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.859 
let's actually turn the phones on and
see<00:01:29.490> if<00:01:29.520> there's<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.850> big<00:01:30.000> difference<00:01:30.180> there<00:01:30.630> I

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
see if there's a big difference there I

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.569 
see if there's a big difference there I

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
was actually even doing it faster

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.480 
was actually even doing it faster
earlier<00:04:34.230> so<00:04:34.470> there's<00:04:34.650> a<00:04:34.710> little<00:04:34.890> out<00:04:35.070> ok<00:04:35.400> and

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
right there again not much of a

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.140 
right there again not much of a
difference<00:04:40.800> it's<00:04:41.100> going<00:04:41.310> to<00:04:41.490> like<00:04:41.820> just

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
probably only notice it if you've

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
probably only notice it if you've
actually<00:04:45.090> put<00:04:45.419> them<00:04:45.510> right<00:04:45.600> beside<00:04:45.900> each

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
that

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.310 
that
three<00:05:19.229> two<00:05:19.680> one<00:05:20.130> now<00:05:21.020> this<00:05:22.020> will<00:05:22.200> depend

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
three two one now this will depend

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.530 
three two one now this will depend
really<00:05:22.770> what's<00:05:22.950> in<00:05:23.070> our<00:05:23.160> feeds<00:05:23.540> differently

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
really what's in our feeds differently

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.670 
really what's in our feeds differently
because<00:05:24.630> there<00:05:24.840> may<00:05:24.930> be<00:05:24.960> some<00:05:25.080> pictures<00:05:25.530> on

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
because there may be some pictures on

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.890 
because there may be some pictures on
her<00:05:25.860> is<00:05:26.040> not<00:05:26.250> a<00:05:26.280> picture<00:05:26.490> on<00:05:26.700> mine<00:05:26.910> I<00:05:27.240> sort<00:05:27.870> of

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
her is not a picture on mine I sort of

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.210 
her is not a picture on mine I sort of
looked<00:05:28.080> like<00:05:28.200> it<00:05:28.350> was<00:05:28.470> pretty<00:05:28.770> much<00:05:28.950> about<00:05:29.160> the

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
looked like it was pretty much about the

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.390 
looked like it was pretty much about the
same<00:05:29.400> maybe<00:05:30.270> the<00:05:30.479> 5s<00:05:30.900> was

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
same maybe the 5s was

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.990 
same maybe the 5s was
hair<00:05:31.970> faster<00:05:32.720> but<00:05:33.560> yeah<00:05:34.040> not<00:05:34.550> really<00:05:34.820> much<00:05:34.970> of

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
hair faster but yeah not really much of

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.550 
hair faster but yeah not really much of
a<00:05:35.150> difference<00:05:35.240> there<00:05:35.630> but<00:05:36.080> also<00:05:36.199> up<00:05:36.440> in

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
a difference there but also up in

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.749 
a difference there but also up in
YouTube<00:05:36.830> since<00:05:37.040> there<00:05:37.190> wasn't<00:05:37.490> much<00:05:37.610> of<00:05:37.639> a

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 
YouTube since there wasn't much of a

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:39.670 
YouTube since there wasn't much of a
difference<00:05:38.060> with<00:05:38.180> those<00:05:38.270> two<00:05:38.540> so<00:05:39.020> three<00:05:39.320> two

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
difference with those two so three two

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.420 
difference with those two so three two
one<00:05:40.990> see<00:05:41.990> which<00:05:42.139> YouTube<00:05:42.740> app<00:05:42.889> loads<00:05:43.160> a<00:05:43.280> little

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
one see which YouTube app loads a little

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.749 
one see which YouTube app loads a little
bit<00:05:43.520> faster<00:05:44.050> and<00:05:45.050> again<00:05:45.680> pretty<00:05:46.400> much<00:05:46.610> about

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:46.759 
bit faster and again pretty much about

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:48.370 
bit faster and again pretty much about
the<00:05:46.820> same<00:05:46.940> actually<00:05:47.270> look<00:05:47.630> like<00:05:47.780> the<00:05:47.870> iPhone<00:05:48.139> 5

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
the same actually look like the iPhone 5

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.980 
the same actually look like the iPhone 5
was<00:05:48.590> a<00:05:48.710> hair<00:05:48.979> bit<00:05:49.190> faster<00:05:49.550> there<00:05:49.789> so<00:05:50.479> really

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
was a hair bit faster there so really

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.240 
was a hair bit faster there so really
not<00:05:51.169> much<00:05:51.320> of<00:05:51.470> difference<00:05:51.500> in<00:05:51.919> opening

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
not much of difference in opening

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.520 
not much of difference in opening
opening<00:05:52.729> basic<00:05:53.120> apps<00:05:53.270> but<00:05:53.900> as<00:05:53.990> far<00:05:54.169> as<00:05:54.199> games

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.530 
opening basic apps but as far as games

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.499 
opening basic apps but as far as games
is<00:05:54.770> actually<00:05:54.919> going<00:05:55.280> to<00:05:55.520> take<00:05:56.120> it<00:05:56.240> so<00:05:56.330> on<00:05:56.479> the

00:05:56.499 --> 00:05:56.509 
is actually going to take it so on the

00:05:56.509 --> 00:05:58.779 
is actually going to take it so on the
processor<00:05:57.110> it<00:05:57.289> looks<00:05:57.500> like<00:05:57.650> the<00:05:57.800> 5s<00:05:58.370> eyes

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:58.789 
processor it looks like the 5s eyes

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:00.790 
processor it looks like the 5s eyes
definitely<00:05:59.330> want<00:05:59.509> to<00:05:59.600> beat<00:05:59.840> it<00:06:00.020> by<00:06:00.500> a<00:06:00.530> few

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
definitely want to beat it by a few

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.379 
definitely want to beat it by a few
seconds<00:06:01.340> and<00:06:01.669> finally<00:06:02.030> we're<00:06:02.150> gonna<00:06:02.240> do<00:06:02.360> a

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:02.389 
seconds and finally we're gonna do a

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:04.150 
seconds and finally we're gonna do a
safari<00:06:02.870> test<00:06:03.139> and<00:06:03.289> actually<00:06:03.380> see<00:06:03.680> how<00:06:03.710> fast

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
safari test and actually see how fast

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.040 
safari test and actually see how fast
websites<00:06:04.639> load<00:06:04.880> on<00:06:05.060> both<00:06:05.210> phones<00:06:05.419> I<00:06:05.750> don't

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
websites load on both phones I don't

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.180 
websites load on both phones I don't
really<00:06:06.350> expect<00:06:06.470> to<00:06:06.710> see<00:06:06.860> much<00:06:06.979> of<00:06:07.039> a

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
really expect to see much of a

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.860 
really expect to see much of a
difference<00:06:07.310> here<00:06:07.639> but<00:06:07.850> we<00:06:08.000> will<00:06:08.180> see<00:06:08.419> I'm

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
difference here but we will see I'm

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.420 
difference here but we will see I'm
gonna<00:06:09.050> go<00:06:09.169> ahead<00:06:09.260> and<00:06:09.590> click<00:06:10.130> on<00:06:10.310> these

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
gonna go ahead and click on these

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.710 
gonna go ahead and click on these
bookmarks<00:06:10.880> right<00:06:11.030> here<00:06:11.210> I'll<00:06:11.300> start<00:06:11.449> out<00:06:11.630> with

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 
bookmarks right here I'll start out with

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.960 
bookmarks right here I'll start out with
YouTube<00:06:12.139> so<00:06:12.320> you<00:06:12.680> tap<00:06:12.860> on<00:06:12.979> that<00:06:13.220> tap<00:06:13.760> on<00:06:13.789> that

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:13.970 
YouTube so you tap on that tap on that

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.560 
YouTube so you tap on that tap on that
and<00:06:14.330> three<00:06:14.780> two<00:06:15.080> one<00:06:15.380> and<00:06:16.370> let's<00:06:16.610> see<00:06:16.820> which

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:17.570 
and three two one and let's see which

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.840 
and three two one and let's see which
one<00:06:17.750> loads<00:06:17.930> faster<00:06:18.380> again<00:06:18.740> about<00:06:19.490> the<00:06:19.639> same

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:19.850 
one loads faster again about the same

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.270 
one loads faster again about the same
thing<00:06:20.150> good<00:06:20.600> tap<00:06:20.840> bookmarks<00:06:21.020> I<00:06:21.560> will<00:06:21.949> load<00:06:22.100> up

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 
thing good tap bookmarks I will load up

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.129 
thing good tap bookmarks I will load up
my<00:06:22.340> actual<00:06:22.820> YouTube<00:06:23.150> channel<00:06:23.479> page<00:06:23.630> let's<00:06:24.050> do

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:24.139 
my actual YouTube channel page let's do

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:29.020 
my actual YouTube channel page let's do
that<00:06:24.260> three<00:06:25.010> two<00:06:25.370> one<00:06:25.849> and<00:06:27.699> again<00:06:28.699> about<00:06:28.880> the

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.030 
that three two one and again about the

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.219 
that three two one and again about the
same<00:06:29.210> speed<00:06:29.509> so<00:06:29.660> it<00:06:29.750> doesn't<00:06:29.990> look<00:06:30.080> like

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:30.229 
same speed so it doesn't look like

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:31.719 
same speed so it doesn't look like
there's<00:06:30.470> much<00:06:30.590> of<00:06:30.650> a<00:06:30.800> difference<00:06:31.070> here<00:06:31.250> both

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:31.729 
there's much of a difference here both

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:33.339 
there's much of a difference here both
phones<00:06:32.000> are<00:06:32.240> on<00:06:32.419> Wi-Fi<00:06:32.599> this<00:06:32.870> one<00:06:33.229> actually

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:33.349 
phones are on Wi-Fi this one actually

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:35.260 
phones are on Wi-Fi this one actually
doesn't<00:06:33.710> have<00:06:33.800> service<00:06:34.250> so<00:06:34.340> I<00:06:34.400> can't<00:06:34.669> test<00:06:34.940> the

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 
doesn't have service so I can't test the

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.600 
doesn't have service so I can't test the
LTE<00:06:35.990> speeds<00:06:36.500> but<00:06:36.740> again<00:06:37.070> it<00:06:37.250> shouldn't<00:06:37.460> be

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
LTE speeds but again it shouldn't be

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.159 
LTE speeds but again it shouldn't be
much<00:06:37.789> different<00:06:38.330> all<00:06:38.660> right<00:06:38.840> here<00:06:38.960> we<00:06:39.050> go

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:39.169 
much different all right here we go

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:43.930 
much different all right here we go
three<00:06:39.560> two<00:06:39.590> one<00:06:42.220> and<00:06:43.220> I<00:06:43.430> thought<00:06:43.699> if<00:06:43.789> I've

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:43.940 
three two one and I thought if I've

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.790 
three two one and I thought if I've
actually<00:06:44.389> beat<00:06:44.570> it<00:06:44.690> right<00:06:44.900> there<00:06:45.169> I've<00:06:45.620> to

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800 
actually beat it right there I've to

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.960 
actually beat it right there I've to
load<00:06:45.949> up<00:06:46.099> the<00:06:46.190> page<00:06:46.340> Wow

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:46.970 
load up the page Wow

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.219 
load up the page Wow
so<00:06:47.090> there<00:06:47.210> you<00:06:47.240> go<00:06:47.360> there's<00:06:47.630> a<00:06:47.750> quick<00:06:47.990> speed

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:48.229 
so there you go there's a quick speed

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:50.379 
so there you go there's a quick speed
test<00:06:48.500> comparison<00:06:48.979> of<00:06:49.099> the<00:06:49.220> iPhone<00:06:49.550> 5s<00:06:49.970> versus

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:50.389 
test comparison of the iPhone 5s versus

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:53.050 
test comparison of the iPhone 5s versus
the<00:06:50.510> five<00:06:50.780> or<00:06:51.110> 5c<00:06:51.710> I<00:06:51.949> now<00:06:52.310> take<00:06:52.370> into<00:06:52.699> account

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:53.060 
the five or 5c I now take into account

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.939 
the five or 5c I now take into account
when<00:06:53.810> you're<00:06:53.900> using<00:06:54.139> these<00:06:54.320> phones<00:06:54.620> the

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:54.949 
when you're using these phones the

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:57.520 
when you're using these phones the
iPhone<00:06:54.979> 5s<00:06:55.789> is<00:06:56.030> probably<00:06:56.539> going<00:06:56.720> to<00:06:56.870> perform<00:06:57.229> a

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:57.530 
iPhone 5s is probably going to perform a

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.620 
iPhone 5s is probably going to perform a
lot<00:06:57.740> better<00:06:57.979> over<00:06:58.280> time<00:06:58.430> than<00:06:58.970> the<00:06:59.030> iPhone<00:06:59.360> 5

00:06:59.620 --> 00:06:59.630 
lot better over time than the iPhone 5

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.960 
lot better over time than the iPhone 5
well<00:06:59.930> so<00:07:00.560> maybe<00:07:00.740> you'll<00:07:00.949> get<00:07:01.099> like<00:07:01.340> and<00:07:01.820> a

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:01.970 
well so maybe you'll get like and a

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.790 
well so maybe you'll get like and a
little<00:07:02.449> bit<00:07:02.570> of<00:07:02.659> slowness<00:07:03.080> on<00:07:03.260> my<00:07:03.380> phone<00:07:03.590> five

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:03.800 
little bit of slowness on my phone five

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.980 
little bit of slowness on my phone five
where<00:07:04.099> you<00:07:04.220> won't<00:07:04.430> see<00:07:04.580> that<00:07:04.610> on<00:07:04.849> the<00:07:04.940> 5s<00:07:05.389> which

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:05.990 
where you won't see that on the 5s which

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:07.510 
where you won't see that on the 5s which
I<00:07:06.139> can't<00:07:06.349> really<00:07:06.470> demonstrate<00:07:06.680> in<00:07:07.220> this<00:07:07.340> video

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 
I can't really demonstrate in this video

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.760 
I can't really demonstrate in this video
because<00:07:08.300> I<00:07:08.539> can't<00:07:08.750> show<00:07:08.960> myself<00:07:09.380> using<00:07:09.620> my

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:09.770 
because I can't show myself using my

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.189 
because I can't show myself using my
phones<00:07:10.220> over<00:07:10.400> a<00:07:10.520> long<00:07:10.669> period<00:07:11.210> of<00:07:11.240> time<00:07:11.449> but

00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:12.199 
phones over a long period of time but

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:14.290 
phones over a long period of time but
take<00:07:12.380> that<00:07:12.590> into<00:07:12.800> account<00:07:12.849> that<00:07:13.849> doesn't<00:07:14.180> mean

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:14.300 
take that into account that doesn't mean

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.180 
take that into account that doesn't mean
the<00:07:14.419> iPhone<00:07:14.750> 5s<00:07:15.139> is<00:07:15.289> a<00:07:15.320> faster<00:07:15.800> just<00:07:15.979> because

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:16.190 
the iPhone 5s is a faster just because

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:18.580 
the iPhone 5s is a faster just because
on<00:07:16.460> every<00:07:16.849> occasion<00:07:17.090> it<00:07:17.360> didn't<00:07:17.630> seem<00:07:18.320> to<00:07:18.470> be<00:07:18.560> a

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:18.590 
on every occasion it didn't seem to be a

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:20.140 
on every occasion it didn't seem to be a
little<00:07:18.740> bit<00:07:18.830> faster<00:07:19.190> there<00:07:19.400> because<00:07:19.880> in<00:07:20.030> the

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:20.150 
little bit faster there because in the

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.360 
little bit faster there because in the
long<00:07:20.330> run<00:07:20.599> it<00:07:20.780> probably<00:07:21.320> will<00:07:21.530> if<00:07:21.979> you<00:07:22.130> enjoyed
