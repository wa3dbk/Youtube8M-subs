00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello everyone hello and you will not believe 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.620
 but today we are playing the clash game again 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.230
 of clans and i thought for a long time about 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.870
 do this video generally record 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.719
 save these passages altogether something 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.600
 somehow edit and still decided 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.480
 show the real situation which 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.359
 going on stole and more precisely in the champ 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.529
 leagues because I think many will 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.930
 interesting 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.660
 not like some top channels will show us 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.750
 so yo yo we're cool there two stars 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.010
 we take yo chiki-puki here all rise 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.010
 Donatti guys 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.219
 that's it's it's cool clear at the 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.489
 Deal here is a complete fucking ass shny 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.610
 random fuck and no one here you believe 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.760
 that the game is built on what skills there 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:55.020
 on some skills and so on in the game in 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.090
 full random as in all games and here 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.969
 the same lure as in trains you know 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.390
 throws away when you play cards 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.250
 first two winnings then guys 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.810
 start really act you start 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.330
 play here just the same for you 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.939
 Donatello grandmother you do not fucking know how you 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.990
 you let all the warriors in one place and you 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.560
 win attack 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.330
 it's not something that I have this bombanulo 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.060
 based on the statistics that I really 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.420
 the food itself that I see already for 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.549
 so much juice time i'm playing here and 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.920
 believe that I have accumulated here only 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.320
 Improvement of 1 mortar, that is, the format 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.950
 just don't have it and just forget what 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.549
 there is a farm, and here you are tormented 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.229
 I will say go spec for those who are 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.820
 plays his pleasure namely farmit 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.430
 that is, someone as you like someone 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.549
 really like somebody's cups 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.659
 can not play here like me but the essence 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.700
 video is what's really happening here I 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.740
 I will show you the real situation which 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.229
 occurred on boost during this 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.439
 time is actually very simple 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.320
 you knock down your shield in two hours 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.009
 you have time to pick up the cups better 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.629
 you accelerate all that you can 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.510
 I donâ€™t know everything there 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.849
 speed up the heroes there the barracks 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.250
 well, the resources are clear all accelerated you 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:20.250
 everything is accelerating and thinking damn now 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.909
 I will find everything there 5 attacks in two hours I will pass 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.670
 and 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:26.790
 what we see is the main problem this 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.040
 problem with finding players found here 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.319
 player from which you can pick up at least 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.349
 Cup I'm not talking about the arrangements there 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:37.079
 and pumping any problems here as 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.569
 see full base on screens about this i 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:42.989
 fucking don't say i'm talking to just 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.930
 pick up 20 plus cups with three stars 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:49.890
 to do this you need to look for order 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.480
 more than 20 minutes 20 minutes is the best 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.670
 the case that is, I have not spoken somewhere 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.760
 you find about ten minutes later 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.680
 all 50 that is to reach the 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.420
 champion to 3 200 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.280
 this is a real situation because 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.659
 most players get what to get 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.200
 gems and then merge 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:11.340
 and those who go further this I talked about 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:15.019
 three 400 3400 plus begins here 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.790
 full name and the situation is such that 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:22.709
 as you understand by the name of the video is a plus 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:25.319
 0 what is + 0 is when you hit the shield 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.810
 you attack you strike and you end up 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:31.379
 plus 0 beeps in the end stay 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.239
 the same burdock that you spent shield 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:36.180
 who you had that did not spend 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.109
 no cups increased but worse 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.079
 case even 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:42.510
 and and added that the most interesting in 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:45.359
 This day is not said lucky in these videos 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:49.459
 stood two attacks sapin rivals with 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:52.290
 which can take more than 50 cups and 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:55.500
 konfu knowing the situation here 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:58.440
 when the bases are really the same all the bases 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:02.639
 are the same taken from the internet from youtube there 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:05.250
 so on and when you can them 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:07.139
 calm two stars in half an hour yet 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.720
 since such was found on two stars and 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:12.239
 in just 3 hours or even on 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.609
 the next day you're on innings for this 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.909
 this percentage did not finish the base did not reach 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:19.889
 quietly or completely lost although the situation is 

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:23.010
 Essentially that strange, that is, you take 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.360
 the same warriors you take the same 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.870
 the hero slept too 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.780
 the same bases are purely the same you act 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.780
 by the same tactics you entice the court 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:37.560
 clan caste here 5 2 apparently ubivashka to 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:40.650
 and let your troops into the same places and 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.870
 what turns out all depends literally on 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.389
 one centimeter a little to the left you let 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.430
 a little to the right a second later did not 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:51.090
 Sang precisely this not annoying game the 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:53.280
 what is there such a random which is being built 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.979
 literally here on the small things 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.800
 a little bit you canâ€™t do that 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:01.500
 lure out a little later the time will pass in 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.500
 overall the game is really annoying in this 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.319
 sense and i don't deny we are all different people 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.689
 Someone likes to search a little longer, but 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:12.300
 frankly I advise you to do so but 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:14.789
 I really have a problem with time and if 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.039
 I am the first who I can 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:18.930
 pick up the cup I really wo n't leave despite 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:19.680
 on the arrangement because on the other 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.509
 parties 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.219
 it is interesting to see how it is demolished 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:25.650
 damn how does such an arrangement demolish 

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:27.300
 Yes, and download honestly I do not want 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.539
 who really wants to get some 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.659
 the glory of honor there quietly seeks for five hours 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:36.719
 a day so two cups miserable 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:39.180
 please pick up but I have a game plan 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:41.879
 such and when you attack were on such 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.830
 do you want to show your subscribers something 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:45.690
 rose high and show already 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:49.500
 what's going on there on higher 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:53.250
 cups and when you're talking about your two attacks 3 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:56.419
 merge it turns out if he I you 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:59.939
 honestly not a good situation 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:01.800
 more even offended like that in small 

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:04.349
 things are built all you spend two 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:07.469
 hours of your precious time and in 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:11.009
 the result is the same in general 

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:12.479
 Soon there will be a very tough video on 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:15.389
 about this random 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:17.490
 a little bit with black humor in general 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:20.099
 subscribe to the channel put likes on 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:25.879
 video if you liked it shorter and 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:25.879
 wait surely the video will be soon
