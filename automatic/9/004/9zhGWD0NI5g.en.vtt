the more delicate lightweight fabrics
such<00:00:15.189> as<00:00:15.250> shears<00:00:15.639> or<00:00:15.910> Ganz's<00:00:16.390> and<00:00:16.600> chiffons<00:00:16.990> it

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:41.289 
sides together instead of right sides

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:43.680 
sides together instead of right sides
together<00:00:41.469> that<00:00:41.859> we<00:00:42.010> normally<00:00:42.429> do<00:00:42.609> so<00:00:43.300> the<00:00:43.510> side

to my machine and do a regular width

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.219 
to my machine and do a regular width
stitch<00:00:59.229> down<00:00:59.739> here<00:01:00.159> only<00:01:00.780> 3/8<00:01:01.780> of<00:01:02.019> an<00:01:02.139> inch

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:02.229 
stitch down here only 3/8 of an inch

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.530 
stitch down here only 3/8 of an inch
apart<00:01:02.729> because<00:01:03.729> later<00:01:04.030> we're<00:01:04.269> going<00:01:04.420> to<00:01:04.479> be

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
apart because later we're going to be

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.270 
apart because later we're going to be
folding<00:01:05.019> it<00:01:05.170> and<00:01:05.350> it's<00:01:05.440> going<00:01:05.590> to<00:01:05.650> equal<00:01:05.740> 5/8

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
folding it and it's going to equal 5/8

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.730

allowance not much you're only trimming

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.410

to go ahead and press your seam open

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.060 
to go ahead and press your seam open
next<00:02:07.840> you're<00:02:07.930> going<00:02:08.020> to<00:02:08.080> take<00:02:08.320> your<00:02:08.500> piece<00:02:08.740> and

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
you're going to fold it so now the right

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
sides are going to be together and you

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.430 
sides are going to be together and you
want<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.820> seam<00:02:13.090> line<00:02:13.300> to<00:02:13.570> be<00:02:13.690> right<00:02:14.020> on<00:02:14.050> the

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
want the seam line to be right on the

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.390 
want the seam line to be right on the
fold<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:19.200> then<00:02:20.200> I'm<00:02:20.260> going<00:02:20.380> to<00:02:20.440> go<00:02:20.590> back<00:02:20.800> to<00:02:20.830> my

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
fold and then I'm going to go back to my

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.370 
fold and then I'm going to go back to my
ironing<00:02:21.820> board<00:02:22.030> and<00:02:22.239> I'm<00:02:22.810> going<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:23.050> press

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
ironing board and I'm going to press

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.010 
ironing board and I'm going to press
this<00:02:23.620> area<00:02:23.950> so<00:02:24.070> I<00:02:24.130> have<00:02:24.220> a<00:02:24.280> nice<00:02:24.520> crease<00:02:25.030> right

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
this area so I have a nice crease right

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.110 
this area so I have a nice crease right
where<00:02:26.350> my<00:02:26.680> seam<00:02:26.980> line<00:02:27.190> is<00:02:27.430> again<00:02:27.730> that<00:02:27.910> seam

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
where my seam line is again that seam

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.660 
where my seam line is again that seam
line<00:02:28.150> is<00:02:28.510> right<00:02:28.810> on<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.080> fold<00:02:29.400> right<00:02:30.400> there

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
line is right on the fold right there

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.800 
line is right on the fold right there
and<00:02:32.160> if<00:02:33.160> you're<00:02:33.310> using<00:02:33.550> very<00:02:33.880> delicate<00:02:34.300> fabric

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
and if you're using very delicate fabric

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.930 
and if you're using very delicate fabric
it's<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.320> good<00:02:35.470> idea<00:02:35.800> to<00:02:36.040> use<00:02:36.190> a<00:02:36.220> pressing<00:02:36.820> cloth

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
it's a good idea to use a pressing cloth

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.820 
it's a good idea to use a pressing cloth
to<00:02:37.239> protect<00:02:37.420> your<00:02:37.780> fabric<00:02:38.140> as<00:02:38.260> your<00:02:38.410> iron<00:02:38.590> in

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
to protect your fabric as your iron in

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:39.900 
to protect your fabric as your iron in
it<00:02:38.920> so<00:02:39.070> that's<00:02:39.250> what's<00:02:39.459> something<00:02:39.640> that<00:02:39.760> you

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
it so that's what's something that you

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.010 
it so that's what's something that you
want<00:02:40.150> to<00:02:40.239> keep<00:02:40.300> in<00:02:40.450> mind<00:02:40.630> so<00:02:40.720> I'm<00:02:40.780> going<00:02:40.900> to<00:02:40.930> go

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
want to keep in mind so I'm going to go

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.960 
want to keep in mind so I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:41.110> and<00:02:41.350> press<00:02:41.560> this<00:02:41.830> and<00:02:42.070> then<00:02:42.820> we're

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
ahead and press this and then we're

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.430 
ahead and press this and then we're
going<00:02:43.090> to<00:02:43.150> do<00:02:43.420> from<00:02:43.810> this<00:02:43.989> edge<00:02:44.230> a

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
going to do from this edge a

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.600 
going to do from this edge a
quarter-inch<00:02:45.220> seam<00:02:46.590> from<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:48.040> fold<00:02:48.340> line

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
quarter-inch seam from the fold line

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:49.949 
quarter-inch seam from the fold line
right<00:02:48.850> here<00:02:49.180> so<00:02:49.360> you're<00:02:49.600> just<00:02:49.660> going<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:49.900> go

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
right here so you're just going to go

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.360 
right here so you're just going to go
down<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.230> quarter<00:02:50.680> of<00:02:50.770> an<00:02:50.860> inch<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:51.160> that's

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
down a quarter of an inch and that's

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.710 
down a quarter of an inch and that's
going<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.910> enclose<00:02:53.640> our<00:02:54.640> seam<00:02:55.360> allowance

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
going to enclose our seam allowance

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.900 
going to enclose our seam allowance
right<00:02:55.870> in<00:02:56.200> that<00:02:56.350> seam<00:02:56.620> so<00:02:56.980> if<00:02:57.220> you<00:02:57.370> do<00:02:57.519> it<00:02:57.640> right

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
right in that seam so if you do it right

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.030 
right in that seam so if you do it right
when<00:02:58.840> you<00:02:58.930> open<00:02:59.230> it<00:02:59.290> up<00:02:59.410> you're<00:02:59.680> not<00:02:59.830> going<00:02:59.980> to

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
when you open it up you're not going to

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.620 
when you open it up you're not going to
be<00:03:00.130> able<00:03:00.250> to<00:03:00.370> see<00:03:00.549> that<00:03:00.730> seam<00:03:01.000> anymore<00:03:01.360> and<00:03:01.540> if

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
be able to see that seam anymore and if

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:02.880 
be able to see that seam anymore and if
you<00:03:01.720> can't<00:03:01.959> see<00:03:02.140> it<00:03:02.170> it<00:03:02.350> probably<00:03:02.500> just<00:03:02.769> means

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
you can't see it it probably just means

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.710 
you can't see it it probably just means
you<00:03:03.190> need<00:03:03.340> to<00:03:03.400> trim<00:03:03.850> your<00:03:04.000> seam<00:03:04.209> allowance

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
you need to trim your seam allowance

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.850 
you need to trim your seam allowance
down<00:03:04.900> a<00:03:04.930> little<00:03:05.200> bit<00:03:05.320> more<00:03:05.470> so<00:03:05.650> I'm<00:03:05.709> going<00:03:05.739> to

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
down a little bit more so I'm going to

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.080 
down a little bit more so I'm going to
go<00:03:05.950> ahead<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:06.280> press<00:03:06.459> this<00:03:06.670> and<00:03:06.880> then<00:03:07.030> I'm

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
go ahead and press this and then I'm

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.370 
go ahead and press this and then I'm
going<00:03:07.209> to<00:03:07.239> take<00:03:07.420> it<00:03:07.540> to<00:03:07.630> my<00:03:07.690> machine<00:03:07.870> so<00:03:08.230> I<00:03:08.260> can

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
going to take it to my machine so I can

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.110 
going to take it to my machine so I can
stitch<00:03:08.709> that<00:03:08.890> quarter<00:03:09.190> inch<00:03:09.310> seam<00:03:09.489> allowance

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.720 

so<00:03:13.120> now<00:03:13.239> I'm<00:03:13.360> going<00:03:13.510> to<00:03:13.570> do<00:03:13.720> my<00:03:13.959> quarter<00:03:14.320> inch

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
so now I'm going to do my quarter inch

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.640 
so now I'm going to do my quarter inch
seam<00:03:15.730> just<00:03:16.060> to<00:03:16.239> finish<00:03:16.420> it<00:03:16.570> off<00:03:16.810> and<00:03:17.200> I'm<00:03:17.440> just

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
seam just to finish it off and I'm just

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.650 
seam just to finish it off and I'm just
again<00:03:18.160> using<00:03:18.489> a<00:03:18.580> regular<00:03:18.880> stitch<00:03:19.120> and<00:03:19.390> back

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
again using a regular stitch and back

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.610 
again using a regular stitch and back
stitching<00:03:20.110> at<00:03:20.230> both<00:03:20.410> sides

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
stitching at both sides

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.979 
stitching at both sides
and<00:03:22.770> then<00:03:23.340> after<00:03:23.580> this<00:03:23.730> your<00:03:24.360> front<00:03:24.630> seam<00:03:24.840> is

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
and then after this your front seam is

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.710 
and then after this your front seam is
complete<00:03:28.099> here's<00:03:29.099> the<00:03:29.310> right<00:03:29.520> side<00:03:29.849> of<00:03:30.209> our

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
complete here's the right side of our

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.059 
complete here's the right side of our
French<00:03:31.050> seam<00:03:31.349> and<00:03:31.560> you<00:03:31.620> can<00:03:31.739> see<00:03:31.860> it's<00:03:32.040> just

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
French seam and you can see it's just

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.370 
French seam and you can see it's just
the<00:03:32.250> same<00:03:32.430> line<00:03:32.640> just<00:03:32.880> as<00:03:33.030> normal<00:03:33.300> if<00:03:33.810> you<00:03:34.140> flip

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
the same line just as normal if you flip

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.979 
the same line just as normal if you flip
it<00:03:34.410> over<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:35.069> the<00:03:35.250> wrong<00:03:35.489> side<00:03:35.819> this<00:03:36.630> is<00:03:36.840> what

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
it over to the wrong side this is what

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.050 
it over to the wrong side this is what
it<00:03:37.080> looks<00:03:37.260> like<00:03:37.319> so<00:03:37.680> because<00:03:37.920> we're<00:03:38.520> stitching

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
it looks like so because we're stitching

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.270 
it looks like so because we're stitching
in<00:03:39.330> our<00:03:39.599> raw<00:03:40.110> edge<00:03:40.410> it's<00:03:40.709> kind<00:03:40.920> of<00:03:41.010> kind<00:03:41.190> of

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
in our raw edge it's kind of kind of

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.759 
in our raw edge it's kind of kind of
help<00:03:41.550> control<00:03:42.360> the<00:03:42.720> frame<00:03:43.050> that<00:03:43.410> these<00:03:43.590> type

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
help control the frame that these type

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.559 
help control the frame that these type
of<00:03:43.800> fabrics<00:03:44.250> normally<00:03:44.580> have<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:45.000> chiffon<00:03:45.330> and

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
of fabrics normally have the chiffon and

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:46.610 
of fabrics normally have the chiffon and
the<00:03:45.630> right<00:03:45.750> hands<00:03:45.989> and<00:03:46.230> those<00:03:46.349> type<00:03:46.590> of

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
the right hands and those type of

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.410 
the right hands and those type of
fabrics<00:03:47.099> so<00:03:47.250> that's<00:03:47.430> what<00:03:47.700> really<00:03:47.910> helps<00:03:48.269> it

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
fabrics so that's what really helps it

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.690 
fabrics so that's what really helps it
it<00:03:48.569> makes<00:03:49.080> it<00:03:49.200> look<00:03:49.349> really<00:03:49.680> nice<00:03:50.069> and<00:03:50.430> neat

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
it makes it look really nice and neat

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.610 
it makes it look really nice and neat
the<00:03:51.300> thing<00:03:51.480> is<00:03:51.599> about<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.930> French<00:03:52.170> seam<00:03:52.380> it's

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
the thing is about the French seam it's

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.259 
the thing is about the French seam it's
really<00:03:52.980> only<00:03:53.099> done<00:03:53.430> if<00:03:53.670> you're<00:03:53.819> doing<00:03:54.120> a

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
really only done if you're doing a

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:55.820 
really only done if you're doing a
straight<00:03:54.690> edge<00:03:54.900> seam<00:03:55.230> if<00:03:55.440> you're<00:03:55.620> working

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
straight edge seam if you're working

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.530 
straight edge seam if you're working
with<00:03:55.980> curves<00:03:56.370> it<00:03:56.610> doesn't<00:03:56.970> really<00:03:57.060> work<00:03:57.299> so

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
with curves it doesn't really work so

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.449 
with curves it doesn't really work so
well<00:03:57.720> so<00:03:57.959> next<00:03:58.560> I'm<00:03:58.650> going<00:03:58.799> to<00:03:58.860> show<00:03:59.069> you<00:03:59.130> how

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
well so next I'm going to show you how

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.160 
well so next I'm going to show you how
to<00:03:59.489> do<00:03:59.760> the<00:03:59.910> mock<00:04:00.120> French<00:04:00.360> seam<00:04:00.750> which<00:04:01.019> is

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
to do the mock French seam which is

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.050 
to do the mock French seam which is
better<00:04:01.350> for<00:04:01.769> doing<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.130> straight<00:04:02.430> edges<00:04:02.640> and

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
better for doing the straight edges and

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.370 
better for doing the straight edges and
also<00:04:03.420> for<00:04:03.600> doing<00:04:03.630> curves<00:04:06.080> for<00:04:07.080> the<00:04:07.200> mock

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
also for doing curves for the mock

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.960 
also for doing curves for the mock
French<00:04:07.590> seam<00:04:07.980> you're<00:04:08.280> going<00:04:08.400> to<00:04:08.459> start<00:04:08.700> it<00:04:08.849> as

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
French seam you're going to start it as

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.400 
French seam you're going to start it as
you<00:04:09.150> would<00:04:09.299> any<00:04:09.540> other<00:04:09.720> seam<00:04:10.140> that<00:04:10.170> you're

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
you would any other seam that you're

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.660 
you would any other seam that you're
doing<00:04:10.709> so<00:04:11.750> unlike<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:13.349> French<00:04:13.590> seam<00:04:13.920> you're

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
doing so unlike the French seam you're

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.580 
doing so unlike the French seam you're
actually<00:04:15.120> in<00:04:15.209> this<00:04:15.360> case<00:04:15.420> going<00:04:16.019> to<00:04:16.320> place

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
actually in this case going to place

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.430 
actually in this case going to place
right<00:04:17.280> sides<00:04:17.639> together<00:04:18.079> so<00:04:19.079> you<00:04:19.169> have<00:04:19.320> the

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
right sides together so you have the

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.810 
right sides together so you have the
wrong<00:04:19.620> side<00:04:19.889> sticking<00:04:20.250> out<00:04:20.400> and<00:04:20.579> you're<00:04:20.729> going

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
wrong side sticking out and you're going

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.310 
wrong side sticking out and you're going
to<00:04:20.880> place<00:04:21.090> your<00:04:21.269> pins<00:04:21.510> where<00:04:21.840> you<00:04:21.959> want<00:04:22.139> to<00:04:22.229> do

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
to place your pins where you want to do

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.340 
to place your pins where you want to do
your<00:04:22.470> seam<00:04:22.770> and<00:04:23.060> if<00:04:24.060> you<00:04:24.180> want<00:04:24.450> to<00:04:24.540> do<00:04:24.690> a<00:04:24.720> 5/8

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
your seam and if you want to do a 5/8

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.590 
your seam and if you want to do a 5/8
inch<00:04:25.470> seam<00:04:26.160> allowance<00:04:26.190> then<00:04:27.180> you're<00:04:27.390> going<00:04:27.539> to

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
inch seam allowance then you're going to

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.310 
inch seam allowance then you're going to
stitch<00:04:27.870> 5/8<00:04:28.650> inch<00:04:28.950> seam<00:04:29.300> so<00:04:30.300> whatever<00:04:30.780> type<00:04:31.289> of

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
stitch 5/8 inch seam so whatever type of

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.840 
stitch 5/8 inch seam so whatever type of
seam<00:04:31.590> allowance<00:04:31.860> you<00:04:31.950> want<00:04:32.220> that<00:04:32.460> is<00:04:32.640> what

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
seam allowance you want that is what

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.130 
seam allowance you want that is what
you're<00:04:33.030> going<00:04:33.240> to<00:04:33.479> stitch<00:04:33.750> so<00:04:33.900> I'm<00:04:33.960> going<00:04:34.080> to

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
you're going to stitch so I'm going to

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.080 
you're going to stitch so I'm going to
go<00:04:34.229> ahead<00:04:34.320> and<00:04:34.530> pin<00:04:34.680> this<00:04:34.890> and<00:04:35.190> then<00:04:35.729> I'm<00:04:36.030> going

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
go ahead and pin this and then I'm going

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.820 
go ahead and pin this and then I'm going
to<00:04:36.240> do<00:04:36.390> a<00:04:36.419> 5/8<00:04:36.870> inch<00:04:36.900> because<00:04:37.440> that's<00:04:37.680> what<00:04:37.800> I

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
to do a 5/8 inch because that's what I

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.900 
to do a 5/8 inch because that's what I
want<00:04:38.160> and<00:04:38.660> then<00:04:39.660> after<00:04:40.229> that<00:04:40.380> is<00:04:40.530> stitched<00:04:40.910> we

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
want and then after that is stitched we

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.360 
want and then after that is stitched we
can<00:04:42.180> move<00:04:42.300> on<00:04:42.479> to<00:04:42.690> the<00:04:42.810> pressing<00:04:46.280> after<00:04:47.280> you

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
can move on to the pressing after you

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.830 
can move on to the pressing after you
finish<00:04:47.580> doing<00:04:47.760> your<00:04:47.940> seam<00:04:48.210> you<00:04:48.419> can<00:04:48.600> trim<00:04:48.810> a

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
finish doing your seam you can trim a

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.360 
finish doing your seam you can trim a
little<00:04:49.080> bit<00:04:49.229> off<00:04:49.320> your<00:04:49.530> seam<00:04:49.800> allowance<00:04:50.190> if

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
little bit off your seam allowance if

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.920 
little bit off your seam allowance if
you<00:04:50.550> want<00:04:50.850> I'm<00:04:51.090> going<00:04:51.120> to<00:04:51.270> keep<00:04:51.450> mine<00:04:51.660> the<00:04:51.810> way

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
you want I'm going to keep mine the way

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.760 
you want I'm going to keep mine the way
it<00:04:52.080> is<00:04:52.260> so<00:04:53.250> I<00:04:53.520> pressed<00:04:53.970> it<00:04:54.150> open<00:04:54.570> just<00:04:55.410> like<00:04:55.560> I

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
it is so I pressed it open just like I

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.460 
it is so I pressed it open just like I
did<00:04:55.950> with<00:04:56.100> my<00:04:56.280> other<00:04:56.310> same<00:04:56.820> and<00:04:57.090> on<00:04:57.870> each<00:04:58.169> side

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
did with my other same and on each side

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.960 
did with my other same and on each side
of<00:04:58.740> my<00:04:58.860> seam<00:04:59.070> allowance<00:04:59.340> I'm<00:04:59.460> going<00:04:59.639> to<00:04:59.700> take

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
of my seam allowance I'm going to take

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.990 
of my seam allowance I'm going to take
my<00:05:00.630> raw<00:05:01.229> edge<00:05:01.530> and<00:05:01.860> I'm<00:05:02.340> going<00:05:02.550> to<00:05:02.580> fold<00:05:02.820> it

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
my raw edge and I'm going to fold it

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.550 
my raw edge and I'm going to fold it
over<00:05:03.180> so<00:05:03.950> that<00:05:04.950> it<00:05:05.130> meets<00:05:05.400> my<00:05:05.789> seam<00:05:06.510> my<00:05:07.289> seam

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
over so that it meets my seam my seam

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.890 
over so that it meets my seam my seam
line<00:05:07.740> in<00:05:07.919> the<00:05:08.039> middle<00:05:08.360> so<00:05:09.360> if<00:05:09.450> you<00:05:09.539> need<00:05:09.690> to<00:05:09.780> use

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
line in the middle so if you need to use

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.270 
line in the middle so if you need to use
pins<00:05:10.200> you<00:05:10.320> can<00:05:10.380> use<00:05:10.590> pins<00:05:10.860> and<00:05:11.010> I'm<00:05:11.070> going<00:05:11.190> to

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
pins you can use pins and I'm going to

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.840 
pins you can use pins and I'm going to
do<00:05:11.340> the<00:05:11.460> same<00:05:11.639> thing<00:05:11.940> on<00:05:12.120> this<00:05:12.360> side<00:05:13.460> so<00:05:14.460> once<00:05:14.700> I

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
do the same thing on this side so once I

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.580 
do the same thing on this side so once I
have<00:05:15.060> that<00:05:15.090> done<00:05:15.300> it's<00:05:15.630> actually<00:05:15.750> easier<00:05:16.289> if

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
have that done it's actually easier if

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.980 
have that done it's actually easier if
you<00:05:16.889> put<00:05:17.100> off<00:05:17.190> right<00:05:17.400> sides<00:05:17.669> together<00:05:17.990> because

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
you put off right sides together because

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.460 
you put off right sides together because
you're<00:05:19.320> going<00:05:19.740> to<00:05:20.419> take<00:05:21.419> both<00:05:21.780> sides<00:05:22.139> if<00:05:22.320> your

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
you're going to take both sides if your

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.830 
you're going to take both sides if your
folds<00:05:22.979> and<00:05:23.160> you're<00:05:23.820> going<00:05:24.000> to<00:05:24.060> have<00:05:24.240> them<00:05:24.479> meet

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
folds and you're going to have them meet

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.890 
folds and you're going to have them meet
up<00:05:24.990> together<00:05:25.380> like<00:05:26.340> this<00:05:26.580> and<00:05:27.330> once<00:05:27.539> you<00:05:27.660> have

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
up together like this and once you have

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.370 
up together like this and once you have
that<00:05:28.639> done<00:05:29.639> then<00:05:30.360> you're<00:05:30.539> going<00:05:30.720> to<00:05:30.960> press<00:05:31.200> it

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
that done then you're going to press it

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.480 
that done then you're going to press it
again<00:05:32.479> I'm<00:05:33.560> going<00:05:34.560> to<00:05:34.680> again<00:05:34.919> use<00:05:35.130> a<00:05:35.159> regular

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
again I'm going to again use a regular

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
again I'm going to again use a regular
width<00:05:35.849> stitch

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
width stitch

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.720 
width stitch
I'm<00:05:36.570> get<00:05:36.720> a<00:05:36.750> stitch<00:05:37.050> as<00:05:37.320> close<00:05:37.740> as<00:05:37.950> I<00:05:38.070> can<00:05:38.130> to

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:38.730 
I'm get a stitch as close as I can to

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.150 
I'm get a stitch as close as I can to
that<00:05:38.910> fold<00:05:39.450> that<00:05:39.720> I<00:05:39.750> just<00:05:40.050> press<00:05:40.470> so<00:05:41.070> I'm

that fold that I just press so I'm

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.280 
that fold that I just press so I'm
essentially<00:05:41.520> sewing<00:05:42.060> the<00:05:42.300> two<00:05:42.510> folded<00:05:43.020> sides

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
essentially sewing the two folded sides

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.920 
essentially sewing the two folded sides
together<00:05:43.650> and<00:05:44.130> enclosing<00:05:45.120> them<00:05:45.270> in<00:05:45.450> my<00:05:45.630> stitch

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
want to get as close as you can to that

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.800

fold without going over and then after

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:00.610 
fold without going over and then after
that<00:05:54.960> your<00:05:55.530> mock<00:05:55.830> French<00:05:56.040> seam<00:05:56.400> is<00:05:56.580> done

the only difference is it has this extra

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.200 
the only difference is it has this extra
