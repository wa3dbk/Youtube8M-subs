00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.740
 nights of our life 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.410
 Today, Monday, May 28, 2007, we invite you to a trip through the 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.529
 insecurity and the determination of a young actress 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.550
 who suffers from the unbearable lightness of waiting 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.039
 the opportunity of his life that call from some famous director who took it from 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.430
 a restless anonymity is about to arrive 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.040
 rest of your pretty thing this new show of santa marta dinner 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.620
 that madriz premieres next July 4, we already save digital company here 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.620
 puntocom a sandra welcome hello thank you very much 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.090
 is expected to be a new assembly of July 4 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.770
 by the way since dove ampo for madonna reminds independence not 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.010
 but 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.209
 here you tell us about your play of a woman who is looking 

00:00:58.209 --> 00:01:01.629
 that work you want independence they also use can be 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.160
 that we are also talking about debt 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.210
 person a young actress a young professional 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.530
 that seeks its independence somehow not 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.650
 Well yes it is very well expressed 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.720
 and if that is the wait for the call as you said at the beginning of no of parker 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.290
 director 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.800
 if the elector that she likes the most 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.829
 and how 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:25.079
 is always aware of that I have been able to achieve independence from 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:28.709
 that is like an obsession that already has many times in this sense 

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:32.399
 because it's after the call of a major casino there maybe they smoke them 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.289
 and well a very bad and the breaks did not happen clearing pointed 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.550
 the work revolves around waiting for the call 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.850
 of a casting after the movie of Pedro Almodóvar 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.570
 p in addition to his three as the song says 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.180
 sands wants to be an almodóvar girl if they throw a cartier inspire the order in 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.920
 that song in that song precisely 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.400
 and all this percent and we achieve in the beginning in the presence of a dream not 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.870
 a dream of someone 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.120
 who wants to stand out in his world but 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.380
 percent 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.800
 For you, what danger can dreams have? 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.599
 Well, it's a danger 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.640
 yes I think that yes you forget sometimes the French that is said to be 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:14.959
 like is the way 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.139
 and I think it's true 

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:17.629
 that when for example 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.460
 I elche this work 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.760
 partly to draw attention the same time follows some low and 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.010
 has many katyn directors to cover as expected philologist 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.679
 what market panchana the work 

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:33.719
 and finally I think that this is the moment here and now for many years the 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:34.129
 Inc 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:37.389
 things to get others and I think that's a mistake 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:41.519
 because and what you are doing you are already growing and I am going to the other one surely 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:42.140
 tico 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.449
 of the budget 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:47.719
 you have to start investing almost takes you average almodóvar and how important 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:49.540
 on the side of vélez and the sixth 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.470
 because I've been tired of getting miners sign directors 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.900
 in the scenography the little music is the history of the sira motion of the 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.819
 premiere 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:59.680
 that day 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.299
 that's how the most important thing maybe means with this that is to live the 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.439
 draft text as well as better way to expose it to the world we have 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:12.069
 drawn and so maybe if it is other things but thinking alone and the other 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.499
 thing that still does not come that's like a mobile 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:18.010
 so before it was very expensive very expensive and one is a play that is this 

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:21.050
 billboard was no longer viable on Telemadrid but not 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.150
 protest harold of what we say now in the theater great via madrid have been 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.770
 distributed 4 200 in the small room of the small theater great way that they 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:29.659
 do well 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:34.219
 that time face of disoriented a country and not think about the next 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.999
 percent makes think that his show that an English man qin 

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:40.859
 as dyn 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:42.940
 when I made a like this one 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.160
 how is the name given to the show yes because its monologue 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.069
 really no second is a play walter session 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.749
 this is bad because it crashes solar 

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:53.989
 but it is a miniature work 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.619
 of theater performed by a single person with the personal history of 

00:03:57.619 --> 00:04:01.609
 background through sketches vignettes where there are and cain many characters and 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:05.059
 also when the musical number and traditions is an option 

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:08.629
 but in theory the weight of the game before his eyes and his play 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:10.180
 interpreted by a single person 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.639
 stands out from the monologue 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:15.780
 in caión or other an outcome different spaces characters 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.620
 from the past to the present and a common space in the background that would be the home of the 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.850
 protagonist and then he already imagines citations in other parts of his past 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.080
 of your present and your future where you think 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.479
 believe that it can take you sd 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.870
 that trip to the spectator rests from your pretty 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.659
 then to adolescence 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:40.569
 to the attachment 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:41.629
 adn 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:42.629
 poetry 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:47.669
 to couple situations a little bit added that these of each 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:49.310
 for me as if the person who fights 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.820
 so you want something to the profession that you have percent of 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.230
 spectators what frustrations mean dreams and 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.140
 illusions in the premiums to 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.670
 China is waiting for a call for a few days to pay a job of 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.880
 pick up the phone to see if the phone works has not called 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.350
 I had to start the wealth 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:08.509
 what you can not 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:12.729
 music and try to be like this the land distribution and your world world 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.770

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.249

 He also detailed rest of the river, said that 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.190
 at what moments of this he says of the piolas waits if for example in 

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:30.880
 for granted some bracelets this work because it will not be so important for you and what 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:34.380
 better in flames than the signage for example the flight rests there is no 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:35.219
 hurry table 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:37.959
 although this was not present because two weeks before the hour 

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:40.959
 do not want to think about a sad ending these scares 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:43.389
 from here i 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:47.910

 the 

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:55.490
 this country 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.020
 there was a boom of monologues a few years ago 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.479
 believes that the wedding of the monologist has been left a little in something 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:06.560
 beyond the normal because a baby is already a time in which topal and 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.260
 he stole on television he had to feel in the monologue not with you this from the 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:13.319
 world of monologues moment and in what situation this nothing 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:17.300
