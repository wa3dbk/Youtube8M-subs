00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:18.940
 hi people youtube also subscribers well 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:21.520
 just passers by those who are interested 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:29.260
 computer technology 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:31.400
 today i purchased a hard disk 2 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:35.810
 western digital 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:40.489
 it's black and green and also 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:42.760
 purchased a memory card so let's start 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:49.309
 give us other memory cards let's start 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:53.570
 I took a set of two cards why 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:55.510
 just so because the motherboard 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.850
 which I took support 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:02.860
 two-channel connection that is, he 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:06.319
 apply successively to two 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:09.340
 form increases speed 

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:13.340
 access but chose 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:18.109
 Kingston he and the price principle is quite good 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:21.759
 but his testimony is good as well 

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:24.789
 You see a radiator so solid 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:27.770
 speed he certainly is not a super-duper 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:34.369
 1600 megahertz 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:40.130
 but I think it will be quite enough for 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:44.919
 my needs look closer as you 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:51.520
 show lighting not really sorry 

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:51.520
 the light bulb was burning 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:03.560
 That's how it looks tough radiator 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:07.640
 certainly powerful that is the plank ends 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:11.590
 that's here why bending is all 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:16.040
 the rest is already going for the bar 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:20.540
 well, why exactly is she having 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:25.850
 overclocking that is, its food 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:32.390
 a half volt and can be increased to 165 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:39.190
 Volt can be said to 16 so again 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:43.090
 Nakleechki here as always with us 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:47.330
 stop how not to install 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:52.970
 because some people do not manage 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:55.190
 paying attention to this key here they 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.370
 still manage to stick EV 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:01.330
 wrong thereby flies sunbathes 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.620
 and somehow the memory of people the motherboard itself 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:09.380
 I have a copy here 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:12.470
 so don't be so surprised by the memory in 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:16.540
 Basically, all the link I leave in 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.769
 description read the description do not forget 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:24.799
 so now hard drive 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:29.380
 move the hard drive as you see on 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.380
 Green I have already installed the guides 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:39.880
 came back later so i am here with you and 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:43.340
 you unpack so silica gel 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.590
 what can be said for them in as you can see 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.840
 him 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.989
 terabyte disk by one terabyte 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.180
 this one I plan to split in half 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:57.469
 I will have one half 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.870
 window to stand but on program 2 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:03.769
 programs are different software 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:06.709
 ensure on green drives too 1 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:09.439
 Terabytes I have the bare necessities 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.510
 but not often used there may be 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:16.370
 music any distros 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:21.019
 Anything video any more such here 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:26.210
 I will have it just for the system for 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:29.389
 work means black why black here 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:32.770
 I wonder what's in this digital 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:35.210
 class division of hard drives 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:40.729
 black is the most aggressive 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:44.270
 in what sense he has 7200 turns then 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:47.240
 there is a write transfer rate and 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.520
 readings are very high so and 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.979
 It is advised that it is black to put on 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:56.810
 system, I do not say ssd ssd 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:05:01.370
 maybe there will put it in the future but 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:02.440
 while I will be content with this 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.139
 green 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:08.949
 this particular model has a speed of 5,400 though 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:12.680
 There are already models but not more expensive and 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:18.349
 it turns out they have speeds ranging from 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:21.710
 5 5 400 in my opinion up to 7 200 dependencies 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:25.030
 whether the program itself is shorter 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:29.659
 determines what cases what speed 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:34.250
 overclock as you can see this as if 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:40.310
 considered such an economical option here 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:42.740
 probably hard drives and all 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.610
 reviewed now I will be the whole thing 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:48.409
 set 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:50.659
 Well, it is natural to run install 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:52.990
 windows test and so on and so 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:56.000
 like that so who cares 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:58.240
 continue subscribe to the channel 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.770
 put questions also ask questions 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.220
 about the video card is not yet 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:11.120
 decided but some thoughts on 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:14.360
 about there is, well, it seems to be all I will 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:18.220
 finish up new meetings all good luck and 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.220
 good mood all bye bye
