00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
that's apt entik Filatova has that so

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.430

i'd<00:01:52.429> like<00:01:52.700> to<00:01:52.759> have<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:53.840> texture<00:01:54.289> if<00:01:54.409> you

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.399 
i'd like to have the texture if you
don't<00:01:54.679> want<00:01:54.979> to<00:01:55.159> have<00:01:55.459> the<00:01:55.640> texture<00:01:56.380> you<00:01:57.380> can

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
don't want to have the texture you can

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.260 
don't want to have the texture you can
just<00:01:57.709> omit<00:01:57.860> it<00:01:58.159> but<00:01:58.580> I<00:01:58.700> highly<00:01:59.060> recommend

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
just omit it but I highly recommend

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.580 
just omit it but I highly recommend
using<00:02:00.080> it<00:02:00.379> for<00:02:01.190> that<00:02:01.340> texture<00:02:01.849> especially

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
using it for that texture especially

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.050 
using it for that texture especially
otherwise<00:02:03.590> it<00:02:03.830> will<00:02:03.950> be<00:02:04.129> pasty<00:02:04.700> and<00:02:04.879> I<00:02:05.000> don't

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
otherwise it will be pasty and I don't

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.029 
otherwise it will be pasty and I don't
like<00:02:05.450> that<00:02:05.479> so<00:02:06.020> 2<00:02:06.229> tablespoons<00:02:06.830> of<00:02:06.890> yogurt

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
like that so 2 tablespoons of yogurt

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.570 
like that so 2 tablespoons of yogurt
goes<00:02:07.520> in<00:02:08.319> I'm<00:02:09.319> not<00:02:09.560> using<00:02:09.769> the<00:02:10.009> thin<00:02:10.250> part<00:02:10.489> of

strands and I can mix it well this goes
into<00:02:50.239> the<00:02:50.330> microwave<00:02:50.780> for<00:02:50.870> 2<00:02:51.230> minutes<00:02:51.590> on<00:02:51.680> high

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
into the microwave for 2 minutes on high

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.030 
into the microwave for 2 minutes on high
power<00:02:52.099> as<00:02:52.540> you<00:02:53.540> can<00:02:53.720> see<00:02:53.900> I<00:02:54.080> have<00:02:54.260> taken<00:02:54.590> a<00:02:54.830> very

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
power as you can see I have taken a very

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.369 
power as you can see I have taken a very
big<00:02:55.340> bowl<00:02:55.550> which<00:02:55.909> is<00:02:56.060> very<00:02:56.750> nice<00:02:56.959> and<00:02:57.019> deep

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:57.379 
big bowl which is very nice and deep

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:59.890 
big bowl which is very nice and deep
otherwise<00:02:57.950> it<00:02:58.129> is<00:02:58.250> going<00:02:58.489> to<00:02:58.730> spill<00:02:59.659> all<00:02:59.690> over

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
otherwise it is going to spill all over

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.259 
otherwise it is going to spill all over
because<00:03:00.470> you<00:03:00.590> don't<00:03:00.739> want<00:03:01.010> that<00:03:01.190> so<00:03:01.700> take<00:03:02.090> a

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
because you don't want that so take a

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.199 
because you don't want that so take a
tall<00:03:02.719> and<00:03:03.049> the<00:03:03.680> bow<00:03:03.920> so<00:03:04.609> I'm<00:03:04.700> just<00:03:04.879> going<00:03:05.150> to

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
tall and the bow so I'm just going to

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.750 
tall and the bow so I'm just going to
put<00:03:05.810> it<00:03:05.959> into<00:03:06.319> the<00:03:06.409> microwave<00:03:06.530> for<00:03:07.010> 2<00:03:07.219> minutes

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
put it into the microwave for 2 minutes

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.199 
put it into the microwave for 2 minutes
and<00:03:07.879> make<00:03:08.780> sure<00:03:08.930> that<00:03:09.140> it<00:03:09.410> doesn't<00:03:09.560> overflow

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
and make sure that it doesn't overflow

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:18.460 
and make sure that it doesn't overflow
so<00:03:11.209> take<00:03:11.480> care<00:03:11.660> about<00:03:11.750> it

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.280 

it's<00:03:19.220> been<00:03:19.430> about<00:03:19.640> two<00:03:19.970> minutes<00:03:20.150> as<00:03:20.900> you<00:03:21.110> can

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
it's been about two minutes as you can

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.440 
it's been about two minutes as you can
see<00:03:21.470> it<00:03:21.590> has<00:03:21.740> become<00:03:21.980> lighter<00:03:22.340> we<00:03:23.150> are<00:03:23.240> looking

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
see it has become lighter we are looking

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.970 
see it has become lighter we are looking
for<00:03:23.690> a<00:03:23.720> thick<00:03:24.110> and<00:03:24.380> grainy<00:03:25.310> texture<00:03:25.790> from<00:03:26.330> this

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
for a thick and grainy texture from this

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.740 
for a thick and grainy texture from this
milk<00:03:27.980> mixtures<00:03:28.520> so<00:03:28.880> this<00:03:29.090> is<00:03:29.210> going<00:03:29.450> to<00:03:29.600> go

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
milk mixtures so this is going to go

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.270 
milk mixtures so this is going to go
back<00:03:29.990> into<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.350> microwave<00:03:30.500> for<00:03:30.800> 2<00:03:31.130> more

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
back into the microwave for 2 more

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.850 
back into the microwave for 2 more
minutes<00:03:31.340> after<00:03:32.270> 1<00:03:32.660> minute<00:03:32.930> I'm<00:03:33.380> just<00:03:33.410> going<00:03:33.800> to

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
minutes after 1 minute I'm just going to

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.920 
minutes after 1 minute I'm just going to
pull<00:03:34.160> it<00:03:34.280> back<00:03:34.460> give<00:03:34.910> it<00:03:35.000> a<00:03:35.060> very<00:03:35.270> good<00:03:35.360> mix<00:03:35.720> and

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
pull it back give it a very good mix and

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.260 
pull it back give it a very good mix and
then<00:03:36.410> pop<00:03:36.650> it<00:03:36.800> back<00:03:36.830> into<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:37.340> microwave<00:03:37.640> for

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
then pop it back into the microwave for

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.450 
then pop it back into the microwave for
another<00:03:38.660> minute<00:03:38.870> and<00:03:39.110> I'll<00:03:39.620> show<00:03:39.650> you<00:03:39.920> the

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.460 
another minute and I'll show you the

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.330 
another minute and I'll show you the
final<00:03:40.820> results<00:03:41.300> so<00:03:41.720> after<00:03:42.170> 2<00:03:42.500> more<00:03:42.830> minutes

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
final results so after 2 more minutes

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.790 
final results so after 2 more minutes
this<00:03:43.730> is<00:03:43.910> how<00:03:44.060> it<00:03:44.210> looks<00:03:44.450> like<00:03:44.690> it<00:03:44.930> has<00:03:45.350> become

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
this is how it looks like it has become

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.270 
this is how it looks like it has become
like<00:03:46.010> a<00:03:46.450> curdled<00:03:47.450> milk<00:03:47.690> this<00:03:48.350> is<00:03:48.410> how<00:03:48.800> you<00:03:48.860> want

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
like a curdled milk this is how you want

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.220 
like a curdled milk this is how you want
it<00:03:49.490> and<00:03:49.700> it<00:03:50.180> comes<00:03:50.420> to<00:03:50.600> the<00:03:50.690> perfect

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
it and it comes to the perfect

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.380 
it and it comes to the perfect
consistency<00:03:52.130> once<00:03:52.790> it<00:03:52.970> cools<00:03:53.240> down

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
consistency once it cools down

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.350 
consistency once it cools down
completely<00:03:54.310> now<00:03:55.310> this<00:03:55.640> is<00:03:55.820> already<00:03:56.060> looking

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
completely now this is already looking

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.070 
completely now this is already looking
yummy

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
yummy

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.130 
yummy
it<00:03:57.530> might<00:03:57.830> look<00:03:58.010> pasty<00:03:58.640> right<00:03:59.150> now<00:03:59.360> but<00:04:00.020> it

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
it might look pasty right now but it

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.260 
it might look pasty right now but it
comes<00:04:00.470> to<00:04:00.680> the<00:04:00.770> perfect<00:04:01.220> consistency<00:04:01.460> and<00:04:02.180> the

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
comes to the perfect consistency and the

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.790 
comes to the perfect consistency and the
texture<00:04:02.600> once<00:04:02.900> it<00:04:03.080> cools<00:04:03.320> down<00:04:03.440> completely

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
texture once it cools down completely

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.000 
texture once it cools down completely
and<00:04:04.430> after<00:04:04.970> microwaving<00:04:05.660> for<00:04:06.380> the<00:04:06.470> total<00:04:06.830> time

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
and after microwaving for the total time

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.190 
and after microwaving for the total time
this<00:04:07.280> should<00:04:07.550> be<00:04:07.670> the<00:04:07.790> consistency<00:04:08.120> it<00:04:08.930> should
