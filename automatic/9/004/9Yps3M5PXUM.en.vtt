00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.810 
can't move your head thing is just
remember<00:01:46.590> like<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:46.979> was<00:01:47.100> saying<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.549> know<00:01:47.640> just

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
remember like I was saying you know just

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.040 
remember like I was saying you know just
try<00:01:48.090> not<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.450> move<00:01:48.570> your

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
try not to move your

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.660 
try not to move your
when<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.260> say<00:01:49.440> yeah<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.220> move<00:01:50.370> your<00:01:50.520> mouth

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
when you say yeah you move your mouth

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.820 
when you say yeah you move your mouth
but<00:01:50.940> it's<00:01:51.060> tough<00:01:51.270> because<00:01:52.140> if<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.470> move<00:01:52.650> your

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
but it's tough because if you move your

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.460 
but it's tough because if you move your
head<00:01:53.070> it's<00:01:53.760> you<00:01:54.360> might<00:01:54.510> make<00:01:54.690> a<00:01:55.080> be<00:01:55.230> a<00:01:55.260> problem

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
head it's you might make a be a problem

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.260 
head it's you might make a be a problem
as<00:01:57.860> well<00:01:58.860> yeah<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.520> makes<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.820> really<00:01:59.910> hard<00:02:00.030> to

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
as well yeah it makes it really hard to

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.180 
as well yeah it makes it really hard to
actually<00:02:00.600> composite<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.680> mouth<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.160> the

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
actually composite the mouth and the

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.940 
actually composite the mouth and the
eyes<00:02:02.250> onto<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.880> fruit<00:02:03.120> so<00:02:03.600> it's<00:02:04.200> all<00:02:04.500> in<00:02:04.860> the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
eyes onto the fruit so it's all in the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.260 
eyes onto the fruit so it's all in the
mouth<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.340> eyes<00:02:05.400> and<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:05.880> have<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.180> be

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
mouth and the eyes and you have to be

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.970 
mouth and the eyes and you have to be
very<00:02:06.300> expressive<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.320> just<00:02:07.500> use<00:02:07.650> like<00:02:07.740> your

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
very expressive and just use like your

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.930 
very expressive and just use like your
eye<00:02:08.010> muscles<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:10.040> its<00:02:11.040> really<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.550> scales

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
eye muscles and its really the scales

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.520 
eye muscles and its really the scales
yeah<00:02:12.210> it<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.630> actually<00:02:13.050> they<00:02:13.230> takes<00:02:13.440> a

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
yeah it is it actually they takes a

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.260 
yeah it is it actually they takes a
little<00:02:13.650> bit<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:13.920> learning<00:02:14.340> not<00:02:14.550> of<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:15.120> know

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
little bit to learning not of you know

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.300 
little bit to learning not of you know
cuz<00:02:15.690> usually<00:02:15.840> when<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.230> act<00:02:16.440> it's<00:02:16.740> totally

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
cuz usually when you act it's totally

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.770 
cuz usually when you act it's totally
natural<00:02:17.460> to<00:02:17.880> move<00:02:18.030> your<00:02:18.180> head<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.570> move<00:02:18.690> your

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
natural to move your head to move your

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.080 
natural to move your head to move your
hands<00:02:19.020> and<00:02:19.320> yeah<00:02:19.470> move<00:02:20.010> around<00:02:20.250> but<00:02:20.580> with<00:02:20.910> this

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
hands and yeah move around but with this

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.730 
hands and yeah move around but with this
you<00:02:21.390> don't<00:02:21.720> want<00:02:21.990> to<00:02:22.080> move<00:02:22.170> you<00:02:22.470> have<00:02:22.620> the

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
you don't want to move you have the

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.630 
you don't want to move you have the
background<00:02:22.890> in<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.190> kitchen<00:02:23.490> with<00:02:23.610> the

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
background in the kitchen with the

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.880 
background in the kitchen with the
fruits<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.330> have<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.720> video<00:02:25.110> of<00:02:25.620> all<00:02:25.770> the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
fruits you have the video of all the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.100 
fruits you have the video of all the
characters<00:02:26.280> then<00:02:26.490> you<00:02:26.610> go<00:02:26.760> into<00:02:27.000> edit<00:02:27.120> yes<00:02:27.870> and

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
characters then you go into edit yes and

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.990 
characters then you go into edit yes and
what's<00:02:28.500> that<00:02:28.560> process<00:02:29.010> that's<00:02:29.430> that's<00:02:29.910> the

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
what's that process that's that's the

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.030 
what's that process that's that's the
most<00:02:30.150> time<00:02:30.450> intensive<00:02:30.900> process<00:02:31.620> because<00:02:32.010> the

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
most time intensive process because the

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.700 
most time intensive process because the
actual<00:02:32.430> filming<00:02:33.080> literally<00:02:34.080> takes<00:02:34.320> maybe<00:02:34.590> a

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
actual filming literally takes maybe a

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.280 
actual filming literally takes maybe a
couple<00:02:34.950> hours<00:02:35.310> it's<00:02:36.030> it's<00:02:36.360> sitting<00:02:36.720> down<00:02:36.930> and

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
couple hours it's it's sitting down and

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.530 
couple hours it's it's sitting down and
importing<00:02:38.130> all<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.340> footage<00:02:38.640> into<00:02:38.850> After

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
importing all the footage into After

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.750 
importing all the footage into After
Effects<00:02:40.310> stabilizing<00:02:41.310> all<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.520> footage

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
Effects stabilizing all the footage

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.700 
Effects stabilizing all the footage
which<00:02:41.880> basically<00:02:42.360> that's<00:02:42.870> if<00:02:43.080> you<00:02:43.350> move<00:02:43.530> your

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
which basically that's if you move your

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.740 
which basically that's if you move your
head<00:02:43.830> around<00:02:44.070> I<00:02:44.370> have<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:44.880> stabilize<00:02:45.480> the

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
head around I have to stabilize the

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.450 
head around I have to stabilize the
footage<00:02:46.320> so<00:02:46.500> then<00:02:46.620> your<00:02:46.740> mouth<00:02:46.890> doesn't<00:02:47.220> move

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
footage so then your mouth doesn't move

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.790 
footage so then your mouth doesn't move
around<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:48.390> then<00:02:48.600> you<00:02:48.840> know<00:02:49.020> basically<00:02:49.530> cut

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
around and then you know basically cut

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.890 
around and then you know basically cut
out<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.100> mouth<00:02:50.280> cut<00:02:50.640> out<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.760> eyes<00:02:50.970> put<00:02:51.630> it<00:02:51.720> on

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
out the mouth cut out the eyes put it on

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.110 
out the mouth cut out the eyes put it on
the<00:02:52.200> fruit<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.860> you<00:02:53.280> know<00:02:53.370> color<00:02:53.640> correct<00:02:54.000> the

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
the fruit and you know color correct the

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.270 
the fruit and you know color correct the
skin<00:02:54.450> make<00:02:54.870> sure<00:02:55.080> it's<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.410> same<00:02:55.470> color<00:02:55.890> as

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
skin make sure it's the same color as

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.910 
skin make sure it's the same color as
the<00:02:56.420> fruit<00:02:57.420> it's<00:02:57.630> it's<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:58.020> time<00:02:58.200> it's<00:02:58.410> like<00:02:58.890> I

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
the fruit it's it's a time it's like I

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.350 
the fruit it's it's a time it's like I
said<00:02:59.130> it's<00:02:59.250> a<00:02:59.310> time<00:02:59.489> intensive<00:02:59.730> process<00:03:00.239> and

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
said it's a time intensive process and

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.760 
said it's a time intensive process and
you<00:03:00.450> do<00:03:00.600> this<00:03:00.720> once<00:03:01.050> a<00:03:01.200> week<00:03:01.320> so<00:03:01.470> what<00:03:01.590> was<00:03:01.680> the

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
you do this once a week so what was the

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.860 
you do this once a week so what was the
decision<00:03:02.010> of<00:03:02.280> in<00:03:02.940> terms<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.510> amount<00:03:03.720> of

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
decision of in terms of the amount of

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.440 
decision of in terms of the amount of
times<00:03:04.110> you<00:03:04.410> post<00:03:04.650> an<00:03:04.800> episode<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.910> timing<00:03:06.360> of

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
times you post an episode the timing of

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
the week what went into that basically

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.150 
the week what went into that basically
well<00:03:08.640> if<00:03:08.820> it<00:03:09.060> first<00:03:09.300> started<00:03:09.690> out<00:03:09.870> as<00:03:10.170> an

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
well if it first started out as an

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.180 
well if it first started out as an
episode<00:03:11.610> once<00:03:11.880> every<00:03:12.150> two<00:03:12.480> or<00:03:12.660> three<00:03:12.690> weeks

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
but youtube has kind of changed in that

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.520 
but youtube has kind of changed in that
to<00:03:16.920> be<00:03:17.040> able<00:03:17.130> to<00:03:17.400> succeed<00:03:18.300> you<00:03:18.660> really<00:03:19.140> have<00:03:19.350> to
