on it is a top loader so I'm just

again on that at the back here the main
difference<00:02:03.930> is<00:02:04.079> these<00:02:04.829> little<00:02:05.130> things<00:02:05.640> that

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
difference is these little things that

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.169 
difference is these little things that
they<00:02:05.880> clip<00:02:06.119> into<00:02:06.420> these<00:02:06.570> little<00:02:07.069> square<00:02:08.179> clips

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
they clip into these little square clips

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.440 
they clip into these little square clips
and<00:02:09.420> they're<00:02:09.989> different<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.800> US<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:12.150> think

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
and they're different the US and I think

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.970 
and they're different the US and I think
that<00:02:12.629> Japan<00:02:13.020> models<00:02:13.200> as<00:02:13.500> well<00:02:13.680> so

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
that Japan models as well so

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.050 
that Japan models as well so
you<00:02:14.640> can't<00:02:14.879> actually<00:02:15.180> play<00:02:15.709> Japanese<00:02:16.709> and<00:02:17.099> US

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
you can't actually play Japanese and US

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.339 
you can't actually play Japanese and US

just clicks in and looks a bit bulky at

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.180 
just clicks in and looks a bit bulky at
the<00:02:58.709> back<00:02:58.890> but<00:02:59.760> the<00:03:00.209> end<00:03:00.329> of<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.540> day<00:03:01.160> it<00:03:02.160> just

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
the back but the end of the day it just

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.490 
the back but the end of the day it just
has<00:03:02.579> a<00:03:02.730> regular<00:03:03.180> plug<00:03:03.390> which<00:03:03.989> doesn't<00:03:04.319> smell

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
has a regular plug which doesn't smell

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.530 
has a regular plug which doesn't smell
bad<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:05.190> also<00:03:06.650> this<00:03:07.650> cable<00:03:08.299> which<00:03:09.299> goes<00:03:09.510> on

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
bad and also this cable which goes on

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.619 
bad and also this cable which goes on
the<00:03:09.720> back<00:03:09.870> here<00:03:10.109> for<00:03:10.440> ya<00:03:11.069> AV<00:03:11.459> and<00:03:13.040> just<00:03:14.629> exactly

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629 
the back here for ya AV and just exactly

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:17.720 
the back here for ya AV and just exactly
the<00:03:16.019> same<00:03:16.230> as<00:03:16.379> the<00:03:16.470> Gamecube<00:03:16.890> as<00:03:17.010> well<00:03:17.220> so<00:03:17.519> it

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
the same as the Gamecube as well so it

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.390 
the same as the Gamecube as well so it
works<00:03:17.940> exactly<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.630> same<00:03:19.220> just<00:03:20.220> keep

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
works exactly the same just keep

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.670 
works exactly the same just keep
swapping<00:03:20.880> them<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.419> and<00:03:21.569> from<00:03:21.599> I<00:03:21.989> think<00:03:22.500> this

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
swapping them to and from I think this

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.409 
swapping them to and from I think this
may<00:03:22.889> even<00:03:23.099> be<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.310> same<00:03:23.489> for<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.790> Super

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
may even be the same for the Super

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:26.690 
may even be the same for the Super
Nintendo<00:03:24.480> but<00:03:25.049> on<00:03:25.349> my<00:03:25.769> entire<00:03:25.980> but<00:03:26.459> I<00:03:26.519> don't

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
to the year 2000 is looking at a date

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.339 
to the year 2000 is looking at a date
especially<00:04:11.519> with<00:04:12.000> the<00:04:12.120> new<00:04:12.359> release<00:04:12.750> console

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
especially with the new release console

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:14.119 
especially with the new release console
the<00:04:13.500> Dreamcast

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
the Dreamcast

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:17.300 
the Dreamcast
so<00:04:14.609> I<00:04:14.639> would<00:04:14.819> internally<00:04:15.419> they<00:04:16.320> upgraded<00:04:16.709> its

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
so I would internally they upgraded its

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.210 
so I would internally they upgraded its

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.370 
expansion pack with a key eight
megabytes<00:04:20.760> even<00:04:21.120> akiko<00:04:21.510> pipes<00:04:21.750> that<00:04:22.109> would<00:04:22.229> be

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
megabytes even akiko pipes that would be

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.969 
megabytes even akiko pipes that would be
a<00:04:22.409> little<00:04:22.830> bit<00:04:23.039> excessive<00:04:24.380> eight<00:04:25.380> megabytes

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
a little bit excessive eight megabytes

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.270 
a little bit excessive eight megabytes
of<00:04:26.280> memory<00:04:26.340> here

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
of memory here

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.800 
of memory here
and<00:04:27.370> you<00:04:28.240> receive<00:04:28.570> that<00:04:29.160> back-in-the-day

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
and you receive that back-in-the-day

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.500 
and you receive that back-in-the-day
with<00:04:31.810> perfect<00:04:32.290> art<00:04:32.470> because<00:04:32.889> it<00:04:33.370> it<00:04:34.240> made<00:04:34.420> the

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
with perfect art because it it made the

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.870 
with perfect art because it it made the
textures<00:04:34.900> better<00:04:35.110> it<00:04:35.440> had<00:04:35.650> more<00:04:35.860> memory<00:04:36.280> it

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
textures better it had more memory it

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.330 
textures better it had more memory it
could<00:04:37.120> do<00:04:37.270> well<00:04:37.990> it<00:04:38.530> could<00:04:38.650> hold<00:04:38.860> twice<00:04:39.130> as

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
could do well it could hold twice as

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.580 
could do well it could hold twice as
much<00:04:39.490> pretty<00:04:39.820> much<00:04:40.290> yeah

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
much pretty much yeah

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.650 
much pretty much yeah
more<00:04:41.830> simpler<00:04:42.250> time<00:04:42.490> as<00:04:42.790> well<00:04:43.480> as<00:04:43.570> an

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
more simpler time as well as an

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.280 
more simpler time as well as an
expansion<00:04:44.050> back<00:04:44.520> it<00:04:45.520> was<00:04:45.669> also<00:04:45.850> an<00:04:46.300> external

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
expansion back it was also an external

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.770 
expansion back it was also an external
expansion<00:04:48.250> up<00:04:48.580> front<00:04:48.790> Neath<00:04:49.000> here<00:04:49.240> this<00:04:49.570> was

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
expansion up front Neath here this was

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.820 
expansion up front Neath here this was
used<00:04:50.080> for<00:04:50.380> the<00:04:51.300> 64dd<00:04:52.300> or<00:04:52.690> the<00:04:53.139> dynamic<00:04:53.620> drive

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
used for the 64dd or the dynamic drive

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.690 
used for the 64dd or the dynamic drive
and<00:04:54.130> it<00:04:54.760> would<00:04:54.880> sit<00:04:55.090> on<00:04:55.150> this<00:04:55.360> platform<00:04:56.700> about

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
and it would sit on this platform about

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.880 
and it would sit on this platform about
an<00:04:57.880> inch<00:04:58.030> and<00:04:58.180> a<00:04:58.210> half<00:04:58.240> thick<00:04:58.720> and<00:04:59.020> it<00:04:59.800> would

an inch and a half thick and it would

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.730

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
special magnetic disks and it was only

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.620 
special magnetic disks and it was only
ever<00:05:05.470> used<00:05:05.650> in<00:05:05.770> Japan<00:05:06.100> so<00:05:06.400> it<00:05:07.240> was<00:05:07.390> never
