then you separate it just go carefully
doing<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.470> because<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.860> can<00:01:01.980> actually<00:01:02.190> crack

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
doing this because it can actually crack

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.109 
doing this because it can actually crack
the<00:01:04.140> plastic<00:01:06.290> so<00:01:07.290> I'm<00:01:07.380> going<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.729> move<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.940> like

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
the plastic so I'm going to move it like

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.820 
the plastic so I'm going to move it like
this<00:01:10.760> and<00:01:11.760> always<00:01:12.030> be<00:01:12.300> careful<00:01:12.600> because<00:01:13.020> some

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
this and always be careful because some

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.870 
this and always be careful because some
plastics<00:01:14.550> pretty<00:01:14.850> thin<00:01:16.520> because<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.670> whole

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
plastics pretty thin because the whole

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.760 
plastics pretty thin because the whole
plastic<00:01:18.600> thing<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:18.990> connected<00:01:19.290> underneath

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
plastic thing is connected underneath

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:28.130 
plastic thing is connected underneath
the<00:01:19.890> grip<00:01:20.250> there<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.729> handle<00:01:21.060> grip<00:01:22.220> so

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.750 

and<00:01:28.710> I'll<00:01:28.920> just<00:01:29.130> grab<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.370> flat<00:01:29.940> screwdriver

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
and I'll just grab a flat screwdriver

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.310 
and I'll just grab a flat screwdriver
just<00:01:32.760> going<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.090> carefully<00:01:33.480> pry<00:01:34.200> this

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
just going to carefully pry this

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:44.980 
just going to carefully pry this
something<00:01:35.040> there<00:01:35.610> we<00:01:35.700> go

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.250 

and<00:01:45.940> if<00:01:46.940> you<00:01:47.060> loosen<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.570> screw<00:01:47.900> in<00:01:48.110> the

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
and if you loosen the screw in the

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.580 
and if you loosen the screw in the
center<00:01:48.770> here<00:01:49.600> what<00:01:50.600> that<00:01:50.780> allows<00:01:51.049> you<00:01:51.260> to<00:01:51.380> do

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
center here what that allows you to do

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.420 
center here what that allows you to do
is<00:01:51.650> that<00:01:51.979> slide<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.640> whole<00:01:52.820> thing<00:01:53.150> back<00:01:54.430> with

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
is that slide the whole thing back with

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.820 
is that slide the whole thing back with
the<00:01:55.550> cable<00:01:56.000> and<00:01:56.119> all<00:01:56.300> which<00:01:57.050> you<00:01:57.470> don't<00:01:57.710> need

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
the cable and all which you don't need

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.249 
the cable and all which you don't need
to<00:01:57.950> take<00:01:58.130> it<00:01:58.310> off<00:01:58.430> the<00:01:58.460> whole<00:01:58.850> way<00:02:01.990> so<00:02:02.990> I'm<00:02:03.080> just

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
to take it off the whole way so I'm just

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.240 
to take it off the whole way so I'm just
going<00:02:03.440> to<00:02:03.500> pry<00:02:04.460> this<00:02:04.520> open<00:02:04.970> like<00:02:05.390> that<00:02:06.250> without

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
going to pry this open like that without

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.180 
going to pry this open like that without
forcing<00:02:07.670> it<00:02:07.909> too<00:02:08.149> too<00:02:08.360> much<00:02:08.860> and<00:02:09.860> there<00:02:10.069> you

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
forcing it too too much and there you

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.290 
forcing it too too much and there you
can<00:02:10.369> see<00:02:10.640> inside<00:02:11.030> their<00:02:12.430> vehicles<00:02:13.430> in<00:02:13.670> there

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.759 

so<00:02:17.300> when<00:02:17.420> you<00:02:17.450> pry<00:02:17.720> it<00:02:17.750> open<00:02:17.900> you<00:02:18.230> can<00:02:18.410> see<00:02:18.650> how

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
so when you pry it open you can see how

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.860 
so when you pry it open you can see how
the<00:02:18.830> cable<00:02:19.190> is<00:02:20.920> on<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.160> trigger<00:02:22.780> there's<00:02:23.780> a

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
the cable is on the trigger there's a

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.160 
the cable is on the trigger there's a
little<00:02:24.200> spring<00:02:24.530> in<00:02:24.650> there<00:02:24.980> too<00:02:25.870> this<00:02:26.870> little

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
little spring in there too this little

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.150 
little spring in there too this little
spring<00:02:27.530> right<00:02:27.709> here<00:02:28.900> right<00:02:29.900> here<00:02:29.930> you<00:02:30.890> want<00:02:31.100> to

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
spring right here right here you want to

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.130 
spring right here right here you want to
make<00:02:31.220> sure<00:02:31.519> you<00:02:31.700> see<00:02:31.940> how<00:02:32.090> it's<00:02:32.660> in<00:02:32.870> place

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
make sure you see how it's in place

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.560 
make sure you see how it's in place
before<00:02:33.590> you<00:02:33.739> take<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.070> trigger<00:02:34.370> off<00:02:34.610> because

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
before you take the trigger off because

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:36.940 
before you take the trigger off because
you're<00:02:35.750> going<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:35.900> need<00:02:36.050> to<00:02:36.230> put<00:02:36.440> that<00:02:36.620> spring

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
you're going to need to put that spring

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.470 
you're going to need to put that spring
back

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.000 

so<00:02:41.989> I'm<00:02:42.110> going<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:42.319> pull<00:02:42.620> up<00:02:42.830> on<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.160> trigger

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
so I'm going to pull up on the trigger

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.190 
so I'm going to pull up on the trigger
this<00:02:46.010> and<00:02:46.400> just<00:02:46.580> pull<00:02:46.819> that<00:02:46.849> out<00:02:47.030> so<00:02:47.930> I've<00:02:48.019> got

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
this and just pull that out so I've got

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.740 
this and just pull that out so I've got
another<00:02:48.470> trigger<00:02:48.890> here<00:02:49.250> it's<00:02:49.849> already<00:02:50.269> got<00:02:50.569> to

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
another trigger here it's already got to

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.160 
another trigger here it's already got to
spring<00:02:51.140> on<00:02:51.849> so<00:02:52.849> I'm<00:02:53.209> just<00:02:53.239> going<00:02:53.540> to<00:02:53.629> reinsert

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
spring on so I'm just going to reinsert

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:01.210 
spring on so I'm just going to reinsert
the<00:02:54.319> cable<00:02:54.739> first<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:58.150> then<00:02:59.739> go<00:03:00.739> like<00:03:00.920> this

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
the cable first and then go like this

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.699 
the cable first and then go like this
and<00:03:01.550> there's<00:03:02.510> a<00:03:02.630> little<00:03:02.930> slot<00:03:04.989> for<00:03:05.989> this<00:03:06.380> to<00:03:06.590> go

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
and there's a little slot for this to go

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:16.430 
and there's a little slot for this to go
in<00:03:07.239> I'm<00:03:08.239> going<00:03:08.360> to<00:03:08.480> insert<00:03:09.110> that<00:03:09.380> in<00:03:09.590> there

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.020 

so<00:03:17.440> you<00:03:17.530> can<00:03:17.770> see<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:18.100> little<00:03:18.250> spring<00:03:18.790> there

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
so you can see the little spring there

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.530 
so you can see the little spring there
it<00:03:19.360> goes<00:03:19.600> here<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:20.850> it<00:03:21.850> goes<00:03:22.030> down<00:03:22.300> on<00:03:22.510> the

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
it goes here and it goes down on the

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.780 
it goes here and it goes down on the
other<00:03:22.690> and<00:03:22.960> it's<00:03:23.230> pretty<00:03:23.590> simple<00:03:24.130> make<00:03:24.640> sure

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
other and it's pretty simple make sure

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.190 
other and it's pretty simple make sure
you've<00:03:24.940> got<00:03:24.970> the<00:03:25.150> spring<00:03:25.600> on<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:25.960> trigger

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
you've got the spring on the trigger

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.370 
you've got the spring on the trigger
when<00:03:26.380> you<00:03:26.500> put<00:03:26.710> it<00:03:26.800> in<00:03:26.950> and<00:03:27.960> I'm<00:03:28.960> just<00:03:29.170> going<00:03:29.320> to

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
when you put it in and I'm just going to

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.120 
when you put it in and I'm just going to
close<00:03:29.620> er<00:03:29.680> up<00:03:30.010> now<00:03:31.140> you<00:03:32.140> can<00:03:32.170> actually<00:03:32.470> grease

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
close er up now you can actually grease

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.130 
close er up now you can actually grease
it<00:03:33.310> up<00:03:33.400> a<00:03:33.550> bit<00:03:33.580> in<00:03:33.850> there<00:03:34.060> you<00:03:34.390> can<00:03:34.600> just<00:03:34.960> put<00:03:35.110> a

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
it up a bit in there you can just put a

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.230 
it up a bit in there you can just put a
bit<00:03:35.320> of<00:03:35.410> grease<00:03:35.620> on<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:36.160> pivots<00:03:36.520> here<00:03:36.760> and<00:03:37.150> all

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
bit of grease on the pivots here and all

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.590 
bit of grease on the pivots here and all
that

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
that

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.470 
that
and<00:03:38.100> maybe<00:03:39.100> a<00:03:39.250> bit<00:03:39.400> of<00:03:39.430> liquid<00:03:39.730> wrench<00:03:40.060> down<00:03:40.240> in

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
and maybe a bit of liquid wrench down in

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:57.309 
and maybe a bit of liquid wrench down in
the<00:03:40.570> cable<00:03:40.990> it'll<00:03:41.290> just<00:03:41.500> make<00:03:41.650> it<00:03:41.710> easier

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.199 

the<00:03:58.010> click<00:03:58.250> in<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.459> middle<00:03:58.580> here<00:03:58.879> you<00:03:58.909> want<00:03:59.120> to

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
the click in the middle here you want to

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:00.869 
the click in the middle here you want to
make<00:03:59.330> sure<00:03:59.360> sure<00:04:00.019> it's<00:04:00.170> kind<00:04:00.439> of<00:04:00.530> horizontal

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 
make sure sure it's kind of horizontal

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:04.059 
make sure sure it's kind of horizontal
right<00:04:01.879> here<00:04:02.209> or<00:04:02.840> else<00:04:03.140> it<00:04:03.349> might<00:04:03.680> be<00:04:03.829> hard<00:04:04.010> to

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
right here or else it might be hard to

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.050 
right here or else it might be hard to
put<00:04:04.310> this<00:04:04.430> back<00:04:04.670> in<00:04:04.970> together<00:04:06.610> just<00:04:07.610> gently

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
put this back in together just gently

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:15.720 
put this back in together just gently
kind<00:04:08.390> of<00:04:08.870> squeeze<00:04:09.170> it<00:04:09.200> back<00:04:09.500> together

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.340 

and<00:04:15.819> then<00:04:16.540> on<00:04:16.750> this<00:04:16.930> side<00:04:17.350> to<00:04:18.280> the<00:04:18.459> top<00:04:19.350> you

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
and then on this side to the top you

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.720 
and then on this side to the top you
just<00:04:20.410> want<00:04:20.769> to<00:04:20.829> make<00:04:21.010> sure<00:04:21.040> that<00:04:21.340> the<00:04:21.459> switch

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
just want to make sure that the switch

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:30.540 
just want to make sure that the switch
is<00:04:21.790> lined<00:04:22.360> up<00:04:22.510> properly

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.170 

it's<00:04:31.240> clippers<00:04:31.780> getting<00:04:32.139> caught<00:04:32.440> there<00:04:33.180> there

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
it's clippers getting caught there there

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.129 
it's clippers getting caught there there
we<00:04:34.300> go<00:04:34.479> so<00:04:34.960> I<00:04:35.020> did<00:04:35.199> this<00:04:35.470> clip<00:04:36.160> in<00:04:36.310> the<00:04:36.400> center

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
we go so I did this clip in the center

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.430 
we go so I did this clip in the center
it<00:04:38.139> can<00:04:39.060> prevent<00:04:40.060> you<00:04:40.240> from<00:04:40.349> shutting<00:04:41.349> the

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
it can prevent you from shutting the

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.860 
it can prevent you from shutting the
cover<00:04:41.680> properly<00:04:42.009> so<00:04:42.580> just<00:04:43.479> keep<00:04:43.599> an<00:04:43.750> eye<00:04:43.840> on

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
cover properly so just keep an eye on

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:49.050 
cover properly so just keep an eye on
that<00:04:44.759> and<00:04:45.759> then<00:04:47.280> just<00:04:48.280> put<00:04:48.490> the<00:04:48.610> nuts<00:04:48.819> back

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
that and then just put the nuts back

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
that and then just put the nuts back
underneath<00:04:50.550> nice<00:04:51.550> and<00:04:51.909> nuts<00:04:52.180> lot<00:04:52.449> it<00:04:52.629> old<00:04:52.840> for

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
underneath nice and nuts lot it old for

going to slide the grip back so that
seems<00:05:27.190> pretty<00:05:27.460> good<00:05:27.729> I'll<00:05:27.940> make<00:05:28.150> sure<00:05:28.330> it's

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
seems pretty good I'll make sure it's

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.770 
seems pretty good I'll make sure it's
lined<00:05:28.780> up<00:05:29.110> straight<00:05:29.440> with<00:05:29.830> the<00:05:29.949> machine<00:05:30.370> there

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:36.099 
and this clip here goes right over the

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:40.219 
and this clip here goes right over the
plastic<00:05:36.819> and<00:05:37.620> you<00:05:38.620> can<00:05:38.650> kind<00:05:39.069> of<00:05:39.190> spread<00:05:39.669> it

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229

and don't forget the center through here
which<00:05:54.840> holds<00:05:55.290> the<00:05:56.270> throttle<00:05:57.270> mechanism<00:05:57.870> to

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
which holds the throttle mechanism to

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:03.560 
which holds the throttle mechanism to
the<00:05:58.080> handle<00:05:58.560> and<00:05:59.510> the<00:06:00.510> last<00:06:00.750> one<00:06:01.110> is<00:06:01.440> the<00:06:02.570> clamp

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
the handle and the last one is the clamp

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:08.120 
the handle and the last one is the clamp
here<00:06:04.400> and<00:06:05.930> the<00:06:06.930> little<00:06:07.080> nut<00:06:07.380> again<00:06:07.680> goes<00:06:07.890> on

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
here and the little nut again goes on

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:20.080 
here and the little nut again goes on
one<00:06:08.400> side<00:06:09.140> and<00:06:11.660> there<00:06:12.660> we<00:06:12.840> go

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.090 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.310 

so<00:06:20.690> you<00:06:20.810> can<00:06:21.320> tighten<00:06:21.560> these<00:06:21.830> fairly<00:06:22.490> tight

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
so you can tighten these fairly tight

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.140 
so you can tighten these fairly tight
see<00:06:24.320> it<00:06:24.380> all<00:06:24.470> want<00:06:24.680> the<00:06:24.889> handle<00:06:25.490> to<00:06:25.669> slide<00:06:25.940> off

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.150 
see it all want the handle to slide off

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.770 
see it all want the handle to slide off
the<00:06:26.180> shaft<00:06:27.760> so<00:06:28.760> I'll<00:06:28.880> just<00:06:29.090> double<00:06:29.570> check

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
the shaft so I'll just double check

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:37.830 
the shaft so I'll just double check
these<00:06:30.020> that's<00:06:30.680> good<00:06:31.930> and<00:06:33.970> the<00:06:34.970> throttle<00:06:35.389> works

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:43.270 

and<00:06:40.389> again<00:06:41.389> you<00:06:41.570> can<00:06:41.750> kind<00:06:41.990> of<00:06:42.169> line<00:06:42.770> this<00:06:42.980> up

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 
and again you can kind of line this up

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.320 
and again you can kind of line this up
with<00:06:43.520> the<00:06:43.669> engine<00:06:44.080> vertically<00:06:45.080> like<00:06:45.290> that<00:06:46.330> and

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:47.330 
with the engine vertically like that and

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:48.820 
with the engine vertically like that and
you<00:06:47.630> can<00:06:47.810> see<00:06:48.050> here<00:06:48.230> from<00:06:48.350> the<00:06:48.530> carburetor

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830 
you can see here from the carburetor

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.000 
you can see here from the carburetor
that<00:06:49.220> the<00:06:49.340> throttle<00:06:50.410> trigger<00:06:51.410> doesn't<00:06:51.919> work

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.010 
that the throttle trigger doesn't work

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.180 
that the throttle trigger doesn't work
well<00:06:53.139> so<00:06:54.139> I'm<00:06:54.229> going<00:06:54.380> to<00:06:54.440> give<00:06:54.620> it<00:06:54.770> a<00:06:54.830> start

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:55.190 
well so I'm going to give it a start

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.010 
well so I'm going to give it a start
just<00:06:55.490> before<00:06:56.060> I<00:06:56.240> give<00:06:56.389> it<00:06:56.419> back<00:06:56.660> to<00:06:56.900> my

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:57.020 
just before I give it back to my

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:06.760 
just before I give it back to my
neighbor<00:07:01.090> okay<00:07:03.100> that's<00:07:04.100> fine
