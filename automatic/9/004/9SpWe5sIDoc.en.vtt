a music video today with Andrew st.
James<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:38.500> one<00:00:38.620> of<00:00:38.649> the<00:00:38.770> things<00:00:38.890> that's<00:00:39.040> really

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
James so one of the things that's really

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.350 
James so one of the things that's really
important<00:00:39.550> for<00:00:39.579> shooting<00:00:39.910> video<00:00:40.180> is

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
important for shooting video is

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.210 
important for shooting video is
pre-production<00:00:40.989> you<00:00:41.530> have<00:00:41.649> to<00:00:41.800> know<00:00:41.950> what

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
pre-production you have to know what

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.260 
pre-production you have to know what
you're<00:00:42.340> going<00:00:42.430> to<00:00:42.489> shoot<00:00:42.700> before<00:00:43.149> you

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
you're going to shoot before you

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.150 
you're going to shoot before you
actually<00:00:43.480> are<00:00:43.750> shooting<00:00:44.200> it<00:00:44.350> and<00:00:44.530> so<00:00:44.800> me<00:00:45.040> and

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
actually are shooting it and so me and

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.680 
actually are shooting it and so me and
Andrew<00:00:45.430> met<00:00:45.640> up<00:00:45.760> and<00:00:45.970> we<00:00:46.059> started<00:00:46.540> talking

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
Andrew met up and we started talking

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.330 
Andrew met up and we started talking
about<00:00:46.899> the<00:00:47.140> different<00:00:47.410> concepts<00:00:47.950> that<00:00:48.070> I<00:00:48.130> had

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
about the different concepts that I had

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.550 
about the different concepts that I had
in<00:00:48.460> mind<00:00:48.660> while<00:00:49.660> shooting<00:00:49.840> this<00:00:50.050> I<00:00:50.200> wanted<00:00:50.470> to

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:50.560 
in mind while shooting this I wanted to

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.100 
in mind while shooting this I wanted to
create<00:00:50.920> this<00:00:51.270> shifting<00:00:52.270> kind<00:00:52.540> of<00:00:52.630> sensation

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
create this shifting kind of sensation

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.450 
create this shifting kind of sensation
with<00:00:53.260> the<00:00:53.350> light<00:00:53.530> so<00:00:53.770> I<00:00:53.800> wanted<00:00:54.130> to<00:00:54.190> have<00:00:54.340> the

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
with the light so I wanted to have the

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.710 
with the light so I wanted to have the
lights<00:00:54.670> moving<00:00:54.970> around<00:00:55.150> to<00:00:55.330> kind<00:00:55.450> of<00:00:55.570> play

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
lights moving around to kind of play

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.940 
lights moving around to kind of play
with<00:00:55.750> a<00:00:55.900> little<00:00:56.110> bit<00:00:56.200> of<00:00:56.290> the<00:00:56.350> shadows<00:00:56.740> and

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950 
with a little bit of the shadows and

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.220 
with a little bit of the shadows and
also<00:00:57.700> with<00:00:57.910> the<00:00:58.090> mirrors<00:00:58.450> to<00:00:58.480> be<00:00:58.780> able<00:00:58.840> to<00:00:58.960> cut

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
also with the mirrors to be able to cut

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.840 
also with the mirrors to be able to cut
those<00:00:59.410> in<00:00:59.650> back<00:01:00.040> and<00:01:00.220> forth<00:01:00.400> between<00:01:00.610> each

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
those in back and forth between each

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.730 
those in back and forth between each
other<00:01:01.030> what<00:01:01.630> makes<00:01:01.810> the<00:01:01.930> even<00:01:02.140> five<00:01:02.350> mark<00:01:02.620> too

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:02.740 
other what makes the even five mark too

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.530 
other what makes the even five mark too
great<00:01:03.130> is<00:01:03.310> that<00:01:03.520> it<00:01:03.700> can<00:01:03.850> shoot<00:01:04.059> in<00:01:04.210> these<00:01:04.390> low

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
great is that it can shoot in these low

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.719 
great is that it can shoot in these low
light<00:01:04.720> situations<00:01:05.320> very<00:01:05.439> easily<00:01:05.710> I<00:01:06.100> chose<00:01:06.549> to

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
light situations very easily I chose to

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.039 
light situations very easily I chose to
use<00:01:06.759> mainly<00:01:07.180> primes

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
use mainly primes

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:09.780 
use mainly primes
for<00:01:08.409> this<00:01:08.530> shoot<00:01:08.770> what<00:01:09.009> the<00:01:09.100> difference<00:01:09.400> is<00:01:09.549> is

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
for this shoot what the difference is is

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.149 
for this shoot what the difference is is
a<00:01:09.970> prime<00:01:10.540> lens<00:01:10.750> is<00:01:10.930> a<00:01:10.960> fixed<00:01:11.350> lens<00:01:11.530> versus<00:01:12.009> a

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
a prime lens is a fixed lens versus a

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:13.649 
a prime lens is a fixed lens versus a
zoom<00:01:12.430> lens<00:01:12.670> which<00:01:12.790> allows<00:01:13.119> me<00:01:13.299> to<00:01:13.329> kind<00:01:13.540> of

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
zoom lens which allows me to kind of

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.660 
zoom lens which allows me to kind of
change<00:01:13.990> from<00:01:14.259> a<00:01:14.500> wide<00:01:14.890> angle<00:01:15.070> to<00:01:15.369> a<00:01:15.400> tighter

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
change from a wide angle to a tighter

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.910 
change from a wide angle to a tighter
angle<00:01:16.060> and<00:01:16.240> with<00:01:16.720> these<00:01:16.869> prime<00:01:17.140> lenses<00:01:17.500> you

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
angle and with these prime lenses you

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.520 
angle and with these prime lenses you
can<00:01:18.100> get<00:01:18.460> down<00:01:18.640> to<00:01:18.670> a<00:01:18.939> 1.8<00:01:19.600> f-stop<00:01:20.049> and<00:01:20.319> it

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
can get down to a 1.8 f-stop and it

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.529 
can get down to a 1.8 f-stop and it
allows<00:01:20.710> a<00:01:20.740> lot<00:01:20.920> of<00:01:21.219> light<00:01:21.399> in<00:01:21.549> so<00:01:22.329> I<00:01:22.359> could

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
allows a lot of light in so I could

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:23.760 
allows a lot of light in so I could
shoot<00:01:22.780> with<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.140> low<00:01:23.259> light<00:01:23.469> and<00:01:23.619> I<00:01:23.649> could

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
shoot with the low light and I could

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.679 
shoot with the low light and I could
also<00:01:23.890> obtain<00:01:24.310> that<00:01:24.520> really<00:01:25.149> shallow<00:01:25.359> depth<00:01:25.600> of

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689 
also obtain that really shallow depth of

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:26.880 
also obtain that really shallow depth of
field

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
field

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.700 
field
I<00:01:27.090> was<00:01:28.090> mainly<00:01:28.270> using<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:28.659> 45<00:01:29.080> millimeter<00:01:29.500> the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
I was mainly using the 45 millimeter the

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.160 
I was mainly using the 45 millimeter the
17<00:01:30.159> millimeter<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:30.850> 75<00:01:31.450> and<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:31.930> 12

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
17 millimeter the 75 and the 12

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.140 
17 millimeter the 75 and the 12
millimeter<00:01:32.409> which<00:01:33.310> gave<00:01:33.520> me<00:01:33.610> a<00:01:33.670> really<00:01:34.000> nice

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
millimeter which gave me a really nice

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.880 
millimeter which gave me a really nice
spectrum<00:01:34.840> of<00:01:35.020> being<00:01:35.260> able<00:01:35.350> to<00:01:35.500> get<00:01:35.619> some<00:01:35.740> wide

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
spectrum of being able to get some wide

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.050 
spectrum of being able to get some wide
shots<00:01:35.920> being<00:01:36.400> able<00:01:36.490> to<00:01:36.610> eat<00:01:36.670> some<00:01:36.790> really

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
shots being able to eat some really

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.910 
shots being able to eat some really
tight<00:01:37.240> shots<00:01:37.570> these<00:01:38.229> prime<00:01:38.440> lenses<00:01:38.740> are<00:01:38.890> great

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
tight shots these prime lenses are great

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.320 
tight shots these prime lenses are great
because<00:01:39.159> they're<00:01:39.430> really<00:01:39.729> portable<00:01:40.119> they're

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
because they're really portable they're

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.090 
because they're really portable they're
really<00:01:40.510> small<00:01:40.750> I<00:01:40.810> can<00:01:41.050> fit<00:01:41.200> two<00:01:41.440> in<00:01:41.470> my<00:01:41.680> pocket

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
really small I can fit two in my pocket

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.590 
really small I can fit two in my pocket
I<00:01:42.220> can<00:01:42.430> change<00:01:42.640> them<00:01:42.820> out<00:01:42.910> really<00:01:43.090> quickly<00:01:43.390> in

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
I can change them out really quickly in

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.450 
I can change them out really quickly in
the<00:01:43.660> middle<00:01:43.900> of<00:01:43.960> the<00:01:44.050> take<00:01:44.290> if<00:01:44.740> I<00:01:44.830> need<00:01:45.009> to<00:01:45.190> and

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
the middle of the take if I need to and

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.100 
the middle of the take if I need to and
then<00:01:45.520> get<00:01:45.820> two<00:01:46.000> different<00:01:46.119> options<00:01:46.600> before

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
then get two different options before

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.340 
then get two different options before
the<00:01:47.229> song<00:01:47.710> has<00:01:47.890> even<00:01:48.070> finished<00:01:49.050> one<00:01:50.050> thing<00:01:50.229> to

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
the song has even finished one thing to

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.300 
the song has even finished one thing to
think<00:01:50.470> about<00:01:50.619> when<00:01:50.830> you're<00:01:50.979> shooting<00:01:51.070> a<00:01:51.250> music

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
think about when you're shooting a music

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.399 
think about when you're shooting a music
video<00:01:51.580> is<00:01:51.940> they're<00:01:52.150> not<00:01:52.270> generally<00:01:52.810> shot<00:01:53.050> in<00:01:53.290> a

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
video is they're not generally shot in a

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.440 
video is they're not generally shot in a
linear<00:01:53.619> order<00:01:53.770> so<00:01:54.610> I'm<00:01:54.729> jumping<00:01:54.940> around<00:01:55.180> from

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
linear order so I'm jumping around from

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.090 
linear order so I'm jumping around from
different<00:01:55.690> scenes<00:01:56.140> in<00:01:56.350> different<00:01:56.619> locations

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
different scenes in different locations

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.770 
different scenes in different locations
and<00:01:57.310> every<00:01:57.550> time<00:01:57.729> we<00:01:57.940> shoot<00:01:58.119> in<00:01:58.450> a<00:01:58.509> different

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
and every time we shoot in a different

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.969 
and every time we shoot in a different
location<00:01:58.840> we<00:01:59.229> have<00:01:59.410> them<00:01:59.530> play<00:01:59.680> the<00:01:59.830> whole

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
location we have them play the whole

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.160 
location we have them play the whole
song<00:02:00.009> and<00:02:00.430> then<00:02:01.030> we've<00:02:01.180> sync<00:02:01.539> those<00:02:01.720> all<00:02:01.930> later

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
song and then we've sync those all later

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.719 
song and then we've sync those all later
in<00:02:02.410> post-production<00:02:02.830> so<00:02:03.340> I'm<00:02:03.430> going<00:02:03.580> to<00:02:03.610> be

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
in post-production so I'm going to be

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.550 
in post-production so I'm going to be
taking<00:02:04.149> it<00:02:04.240> in<00:02:04.360> the<00:02:04.450> edit<00:02:04.720> and<00:02:05.020> I'm<00:02:05.289> gonna<00:02:05.410> be

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
taking it in the edit and I'm gonna be

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.109 
taking it in the edit and I'm gonna be
syncing<00:02:05.920> them<00:02:06.009> all<00:02:06.190> up<00:02:06.369> and<00:02:06.550> then<00:02:06.670> jumping

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
syncing them all up and then jumping

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.790 
syncing them all up and then jumping
back<00:02:07.270> and<00:02:07.300> forth<00:02:07.690> to<00:02:08.140> what<00:02:08.320> I<00:02:08.350> want<00:02:08.590> to<00:02:08.649> use

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
back and forth to what I want to use

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:18.650 
back and forth to what I want to use
where

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.300 

you<00:02:19.660> can<00:02:19.810> actually<00:02:19.960> adjust<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.590> audio<00:02:20.770> or<00:02:21.280> the

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
you can actually adjust the audio or the

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.070 
you can actually adjust the audio or the
shutter<00:02:21.640> or<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.970> aperture<00:02:22.240> through<00:02:22.930> the

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
shutter or the aperture through the

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.210 
shutter or the aperture through the
touchscreen<00:02:23.290> while<00:02:23.860> you're<00:02:24.040> shooting

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
touchscreen while you're shooting

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.680 
touchscreen while you're shooting
without<00:02:24.490> having<00:02:24.820> to<00:02:24.910> cut<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.150> camera<00:02:25.480> but

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
without having to cut the camera but

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.180 
without having to cut the camera but
that<00:02:25.810> was<00:02:25.930> a<00:02:25.960> really<00:02:26.110> great<00:02:26.440> option<00:02:26.980> to<00:02:27.010> be

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
that was a really great option to be

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.800 
that was a really great option to be
able<00:02:27.280> to<00:02:27.400> change<00:02:28.030> that<00:02:28.270> while<00:02:28.510> I<00:02:28.540> was<00:02:28.630> on<00:02:28.780> the

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
able to change that while I was on the

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.830 
able to change that while I was on the
fly<00:02:29.050> so<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:30.700> flip<00:02:30.910> monitor<00:02:31.270> came<00:02:31.450> in<00:02:31.570> handy<00:02:31.810> a

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
fly so the flip monitor came in handy a

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.300 
fly so the flip monitor came in handy a
lot<00:02:31.870> for<00:02:32.350> this<00:02:32.470> shoot<00:02:32.710> because<00:02:32.980> I<00:02:33.010> was<00:02:33.160> moving
