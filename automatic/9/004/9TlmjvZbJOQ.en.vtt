00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 friends, people who are philologists 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.400
 people who are not philologists I have a 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.500
 problem picked up my room makes a 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.300
 week but that's not the problem the 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.800
 problem is that it was about a year 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.090
 that did not pick it up that's not the 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.099
 problem the problem is that when 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.780
 I pick up in depth sometimes they come out 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.520
 spiders of my room do you know the 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.680
 spiders these little domestic ones these 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.289
 Not that my skin has a thing 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.180
 so the most special fish that attracts 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.340
 spiders spiders themselves I do not think 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.590
 they come to bother me zoo there they stay 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.929
 without close and such and then yes I half of 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.679
 the night he hit him 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.620
 be 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.550
 they get angry it stings me and then well then 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.550
 well well 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.210
 and here the normal thing that throughout my life 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.220
 go to about 10 times of these times 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.199
 of having to go to the emergency room here 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.090
 can see the video where I go 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.699
 with the red line it's reaching 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.339
 the ganglionic groups of these that 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.949

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.890
 there sleeping for 10 hours a day 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.540
 until the next day at the time 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.369
 that when it's 7 o'clock in the morning when 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.930
 the house is quieter and everything is 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:19.899
 more relaxed nica as it itches again 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.430
 the spider in the hand is very cool is very 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:23.259

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.030
 a video of spiderman without powers and a 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.530
 video in the life of what happened next 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.690
 that they bit me in the hand and in the 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.220
 neck and you left me spiderman without power 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.260
 a good life continue from spiderman without 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.300
 power e everything started a day to two points 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.590
 in which I woke up everything started on 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.450
 day in which I take off the bandage after 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.989
 to go to the doctor I discovered no error 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.610
 that oh my god had no powers what 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.650
 we had wanted viewer is that my 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.209
 life was going to change so radically not 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.680
 I was touched by parts of my body that 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.150
 they developed strangely I came out 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.739
 hair for some parts I started to notice 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.180
 that my muscles developed from a 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.640
 strange way a way completely 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.650
 different from any human being 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.650
 I had super strength 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.870
 my hands my hands adhered to 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.060
 any surface that he touched was a 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:50.650
 strange situation was it was weird 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.690
 then I washed but I still noticed that 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.910
 something was wrong inside me 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.610
 senses my senses were becoming more 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.170
 strong could have without glasses too 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.030
 I could have without glasses before but from this 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.980
 that gave me the feeling that I could 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.050
 see more without glasses more than other people 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.000
 I could see things that later my mother 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.950
 said seriously nacho yo yes yes mom not you 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.989
 you could not believe the house 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.819
 it was small I had to try my 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.130
 powers somewhere in málaga had 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.650
 to go out to the streets to show the world 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.480
 what was spiderman without powers because 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.700
 if at that moment I started to call 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.940
 spiderman without power spiderman without 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:28.510
 powers can not do this 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.840
 spiderman without seemingly all power 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.840
 neither 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:39.660
 can climb a little 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:43.570
 dt so bad sometimes 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:46.650
 Spiderman without power is his only problem 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:52.300
 in spiderman self-esteem without power 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:54.820

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.290

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.500
 spiderman without power 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:04.549
 can do things in real life like 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:07.280
 a job or spiderman without being able to know 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:12.530

 theater of málaga 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.890
 but in the end I fell into one thing 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.290
 violence does not solve anything the powers 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.150
