I announced the transmode competition
was<00:02:17.319> a<00:02:17.350> rough<00:02:17.530> idea<00:02:17.740> and<00:02:18.209> probably<00:02:19.209> within<00:02:19.630> the

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
was a rough idea and probably within the

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.660 
was a rough idea and probably within the
next<00:02:19.870> month<00:02:20.110> I<00:02:20.530> will<00:02:20.709> get<00:02:20.920> that<00:02:21.130> going<00:02:21.400> and

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
next month I will get that going and

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.250 
next month I will get that going and
we'll<00:02:21.910> be<00:02:22.060> doing<00:02:22.300> some<00:02:22.510> really<00:02:22.840> cool<00:02:23.200> stuff

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
we'll be doing some really cool stuff

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.860 
we'll be doing some really cool stuff
with<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.190> editing<00:02:24.550> so<00:02:24.730> it<00:02:24.880> can<00:02:25.060> basically<00:02:25.390> be

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
with the editing so it can basically be

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.900 
with the editing so it can basically be
kind<00:02:26.110> like<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:26.260> real<00:02:26.470> treat<00:02:26.830> to<00:02:27.010> watch<00:02:27.040> anyway

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
kind like a real treat to watch anyway

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.610 
kind like a real treat to watch anyway
