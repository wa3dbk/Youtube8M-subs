when<00:00:12.090> someone<00:00:12.450> comes<00:00:12.660> in<00:00:12.960> with<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.320> clock<00:00:13.650> that

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
when someone comes in with a clock that

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.210 
when someone comes in with a clock that
they<00:00:14.280> want<00:00:14.700> repaired<00:00:15.619> first<00:00:16.619> off<00:00:16.859> we're<00:00:17.070> going

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
they want repaired first off we're going

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.980 
they want repaired first off we're going
to<00:00:17.310> look<00:00:17.460> over<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.240> clock<00:00:18.510> while<00:00:18.779> they're

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
to look over the clock while they're

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.170 
to look over the clock while they're
here<00:00:19.289> if<00:00:19.439> they<00:00:19.619> have<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.949> time<00:00:20.160> we<00:00:20.820> would<00:00:21.000> like

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
here if they have the time we would like

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.090 
here if they have the time we would like
to<00:00:21.210> do<00:00:21.539> this<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:21.990> we<00:00:22.140> can<00:00:22.289> take<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.680> movement

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
to do this so we can take the movement

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.679 
to do this so we can take the movement
out<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.369> we<00:00:23.460> can<00:00:23.609> show<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.000> people<00:00:24.359> exactly

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
out and we can show the people exactly

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.689 
out and we can show the people exactly
what<00:00:25.109> goes<00:00:25.380> wrong<00:00:25.619> with<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.980> clock<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.490> why

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
what goes wrong with the clock and why

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.929 
what goes wrong with the clock and why
it<00:00:26.760> needs<00:00:26.910> whatever<00:00:27.599> service<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.769> needs<00:00:29.160> some

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
it needs whatever service it needs some

that<00:00:59.789> needs<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.239> be<00:01:00.270> made<00:01:00.629> we<00:01:01.109> have<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
that needs to be made we have the

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.390 
that needs to be made we have the
capability<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.190> making<00:01:03.229> the<00:01:04.229> people<00:01:04.979> who<00:01:05.220> work

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
capability of making the people who work

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.310 
capability of making the people who work
for<00:01:05.430> me<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.180> know<00:01:06.299> over<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.659> years<00:01:06.689> they<00:01:07.290> have

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
for me you know over the years they have

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.620 
for me you know over the years they have
become<00:01:08.010> very<00:01:08.340> good<00:01:08.520> at<00:01:08.850> what<00:01:08.970> they<00:01:09.150> do<00:01:09.330> they

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
become very good at what they do they

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.050 
become very good at what they do they
learned<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.530> profession<00:01:11.520> essentially<00:01:11.970> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
learned the profession essentially the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.450 
learned the profession essentially the
same<00:01:12.240> way<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.600> learned<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.710> through

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
same way that I learned that is through

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.820 
same way that I learned that is through
apprenticeship<00:01:15.030> which<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:16.110> my<00:01:16.290> opinion

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
apprenticeship which is in my opinion

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.899 
apprenticeship which is in my opinion
the<00:01:17.250> best<00:01:17.490> way<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.820> learn<00:01:18.210> about<00:01:18.479> clock<00:01:19.170> making

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
the best way to learn about clock making

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.649 
the best way to learn about clock making
we<00:01:20.909> have<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.570> very<00:01:21.960> good<00:01:22.590> selection<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.670> German

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
we have a very good selection of German

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.780 
we have a very good selection of German
made<00:01:24.869> Black<00:01:25.170> Forest<00:01:25.470> cuckoo<00:01:25.890> clocks<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.700> let

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
made Black Forest cuckoo clocks and let

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.929 
made Black Forest cuckoo clocks and let
me<00:01:26.909> tell<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.450> cuckoo<00:01:28.080> clock<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.680> an<00:01:29.490> item

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
me tell you a cuckoo clock is an item

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.510 
me tell you a cuckoo clock is an item
that<00:01:30.150> as<00:01:30.810> soon<00:01:31.079> as<00:01:31.320> it's<00:01:31.740> purchased<00:01:32.310> it

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
that as soon as it's purchased it

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.660 
that as soon as it's purchased it
becomes<00:01:32.880> an<00:01:33.060> error<00:01:33.360> we<00:01:34.290> are<00:01:34.590> very<00:01:34.979> dedicated

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
becomes an error we are very dedicated

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.679 
becomes an error we are very dedicated
to<00:01:36.710> doing<00:01:37.710> things<00:01:37.890> right<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.939> we<00:01:39.270> don't<00:01:39.479> rush

we're<00:01:39.930> not<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.290> hurry<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.799> get<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.100> clock

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
we're not in a hurry to get the clock

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.060 
we're not in a hurry to get the clock
out<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.060> we<00:01:42.150> will<00:01:42.210> get<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.540> money<00:01:42.780> in

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
out so that we will get the money in

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.130 
out so that we will get the money in
it's<00:01:44.070> our<00:01:44.250> reputation<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:45.450> goes<00:01:45.720> out<00:01:45.960> the

it's our reputation that goes out the
door<00:01:46.350> with<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.710> clock<00:01:46.970> so<00:01:47.970> we<00:01:48.600> don't<00:01:48.899> we<00:01:49.320> just

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
door with the clock so we don't we just

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.190 
door with the clock so we don't we just
don't<00:01:49.560> want<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.009> rush<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.790> we<00:01:51.540> want<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:51.990> do<00:01:52.079> it
