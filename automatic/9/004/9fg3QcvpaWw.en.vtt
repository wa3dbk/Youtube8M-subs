came out in 1990 at this point in time

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.900 
came out in 1990 at this point in time
as<00:00:13.559> we<00:00:13.769> mentioned<00:00:14.130> with<00:00:14.190> practice<00:00:14.639> what<00:00:14.790> you

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
as we mentioned with practice what you

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.939 
as we mentioned with practice what you
preach<00:00:14.940> really<00:00:15.780> seemed<00:00:16.049> as<00:00:16.199> though<00:00:16.410> that<00:00:16.710> was

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
preach really seemed as though that was

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.680 
preach really seemed as though that was
the<00:00:17.100> weakest<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.640> three<00:00:17.789> albums<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.570> then

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
the weakest of the three albums and then

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.779 
the weakest of the three albums and then
souls<00:00:18.990> black<00:00:19.320> came<00:00:19.560> out<00:00:19.710> in<00:00:19.830> 90<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.279> kind<00:00:20.640> of

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
souls black came out in 90 and kind of

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.730 
souls black came out in 90 and kind of
incorporated<00:00:21.689> some<00:00:21.869> new<00:00:22.020> elements<00:00:22.439> as<00:00:22.560> well

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
incorporated some new elements as well

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.590 
incorporated some new elements as well
as<00:00:22.800> practices<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.760> preach<00:00:23.970> had<00:00:24.300> done

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
as practices you preach had done

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.439 
as practices you preach had done
previously<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.830> was<00:00:26.430> so<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:26.760> black<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.330> an

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
previously I was so so black this is an

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.509 
previously I was so so black this is an
album<00:00:27.630> where<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.349> didn't<00:00:28.650> even<00:00:28.769> span<00:00:29.130> 40

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
album where it didn't even span 40

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.189 
album where it didn't even span 40
minutes<00:00:29.760> in<00:00:29.880> length<00:00:30.060> for<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.390> 10<00:00:30.599> tracks<00:00:30.869> so

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
minutes in length for the 10 tracks so

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.229 
minutes in length for the 10 tracks so
you<00:00:31.410> haven't<00:00:31.920> track<00:00:32.160> length<00:00:32.489> average<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.120> less

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
you haven't track length average of less

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.030 
you haven't track length average of less
than<00:00:33.300> four<00:00:33.719> minutes<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.200> this<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.469> definitely

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
than four minutes so this is definitely

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.010 
than four minutes so this is definitely
quick<00:00:35.309> now<00:00:35.640> for<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.940> thrash<00:00:36.239> album<00:00:36.660> that's<00:00:36.809> not

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
quick now for a thrash album that's not

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.510 
quick now for a thrash album that's not
something<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.410> necessarily<00:00:37.559> means<00:00:38.309> that

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
something that necessarily means that

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.100 
something that necessarily means that
it's<00:00:38.670> short<00:00:38.969> by<00:00:39.120> any<00:00:39.270> means<00:00:39.570> considering

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
it's short by any means considering

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.420 
it's short by any means considering
there's<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.379> lot<00:00:40.530> being<00:00:40.739> packed<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.250> one

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
there's a lot being packed in the one

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.369 
there's a lot being packed in the one
however<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.540> certainly<00:00:42.899> something

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
however this is certainly something

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.560 
however this is certainly something
where<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.219> tracks<00:00:44.640> seem<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.090> be<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.239> little<00:00:45.390> bit

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
where the tracks seem to be a little bit

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.049 
where the tracks seem to be a little bit
more<00:00:45.690> neatly<00:00:45.960> compacted<00:00:46.950> as<00:00:47.100> opposed<00:00:47.850> to

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
more neatly compacted as opposed to

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.430 
more neatly compacted as opposed to
being<00:00:48.539> allowed<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.809> breathe<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.140> little<00:00:49.320> bit

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
being allowed to breathe a little bit

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.920 
being allowed to breathe a little bit
and<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.670> actually<00:00:51.059> did<00:00:51.239> cause<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.690> out<00:00:51.840> in

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
and this actually did cause this out in

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.299 
and this actually did cause this out in
the<00:00:52.020> suffer<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.379> little<00:00:52.469> bit<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.710> my<00:00:52.920> opinion

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
the suffer a little bit in my opinion

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.250 
the suffer a little bit in my opinion
and<00:00:53.520> that's<00:00:53.760> just<00:00:54.090> me<00:00:54.390> just<00:00:54.809> cover<00:00:54.989> kill<00:00:55.230> a

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
and that's just me just cover kill a

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.200 
and that's just me just cover kill a
nation<00:00:55.680> personally<00:00:56.250> because<00:00:56.579> as<00:00:56.820> practice

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
nation personally because as practice

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.000 
nation personally because as practice
with<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.480> preach<00:00:57.690> was<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.020> worst<00:00:58.230> out<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
with to preach was the worst out of the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.560 
with to preach was the worst out of the
first<00:00:59.219> three<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.520> think<00:00:59.640> souls<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.210> black<00:01:00.300> is

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
first three I think souls of black is

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.299 
first three I think souls of black is
probably<00:01:00.930> one<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.469> weakest<00:01:01.800> if<00:01:01.949> not<00:01:02.129> the

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
probably one of the weakest if not the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.369 
probably one of the weakest if not the
weakest<00:01:02.670> out<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.969> first<00:01:03.180> four<00:01:03.600> it's<00:01:04.199> not

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
weakest out of the first four it's not

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.440 
weakest out of the first four it's not
necessarily<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> negative<00:01:06.150> or<00:01:06.420> a

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
necessarily that this is a negative or a

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.480 
necessarily that this is a negative or a
bad<00:01:06.689> album<00:01:07.020> Ness<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.159> isn't<00:01:08.340> necessarily

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
bad album Ness and it isn't necessarily

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.990 
bad album Ness and it isn't necessarily
that<00:01:09.060> it's<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.720> real<00:01:10.650> far<00:01:11.040> difference<00:01:11.549> compared

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
that it's a real far difference compared

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.570 
that it's a real far difference compared
to<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.930> legacy<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.680> new<00:01:14.100> order<00:01:14.430> it's

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
to the legacy and the new order it's

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.160 
to the legacy and the new order it's
just<00:01:14.820> something<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.210> doesn't<00:01:15.360> exactly<00:01:15.840> have

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
just something that doesn't exactly have

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.929 
just something that doesn't exactly have
the<00:01:16.380> same<00:01:16.560> element<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.610> something

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
the same element to it this is something

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.820 
the same element to it this is something
where<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.360> construction<00:01:19.170> process<00:01:19.500> has

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
where the construction process has

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.109 
where the construction process has
certainly<00:01:20.070> become<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.430> little<00:01:20.729> bit<00:01:20.880> more

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
certainly become a little bit more

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:21.859 
certainly become a little bit more
simplistic

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
simplistic

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.499 
simplistic
and<00:01:22.049> one<00:01:22.979> where<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.670> drum<00:01:23.909> definitely

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
and one where the drum definitely

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.940 
and one where the drum definitely
interferes<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:25.020> little<00:01:25.290> bit<00:01:25.380> with<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.560> overall

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
interferes a little bit with the overall

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.080 
interferes a little bit with the overall
experience<00:01:26.340> there's<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> little<00:01:26.880> bit<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.060> a

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
experience there's a little bit of a

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.789 
experience there's a little bit of a
jangle<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.960> it's<00:01:28.110> something<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.560> doesn't

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
jangle to it it's something that doesn't

jangle to it it's something that doesn't
exactly<00:01:29.220> register<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.939> same<00:01:30.150> way<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.659> I

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
exactly register the same way and I

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.539 
exactly register the same way and I
can't<00:01:31.020> quite<00:01:31.290> put<00:01:31.470> my<00:01:31.500> finger<00:01:31.650> on<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.159> but<00:01:32.310> it

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
can't quite put my finger on it but it

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.270 
can't quite put my finger on it but it
is<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.790> mild<00:01:33.270> nuisance<00:01:33.920> this<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.070> also

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
is a mild nuisance this is also

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.160 
is a mild nuisance this is also
something<00:01:35.670> where<00:01:36.150> Alex<00:01:36.509> Skolnick<00:01:36.960> though

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
something where Alex Skolnick though

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.800 
something where Alex Skolnick though
really<00:01:37.890> really<00:01:38.159> saves<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:38.670> out<00:01:38.909> his<00:01:39.210> soloing

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
really really saves this out his soloing

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.450 
really really saves this out his soloing
and<00:01:39.990> his<00:01:40.200> guitar<00:01:40.320> work<00:01:40.740> on<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.070> disc<00:01:41.280> is

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
and his guitar work on this disc is

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.340 
and his guitar work on this disc is
absolutely<00:01:42.090> phenomenal<00:01:42.210> now<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:42.869> understand

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
absolutely phenomenal now I understand

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.359 
absolutely phenomenal now I understand
it<00:01:43.439> seems<00:01:43.619> like<00:01:43.770> we've<00:01:43.890> been<00:01:43.979> saying<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.280> for

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
it seems like we've been saying that for

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.130 
it seems like we've been saying that for
each<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.880> every<00:01:45.060> one<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.329> these<00:01:45.540> Testament

discs however on souls of black this is
certainly<00:01:48.990> one<00:01:49.290> where<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.920> really<00:01:50.280> seems<00:01:50.640> to

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
certainly one where it really seems to

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.660 
certainly one where it really seems to
illuminate<00:01:51.299> itself<00:01:51.689> even<00:01:52.079> further<00:01:52.490> now<00:01:53.490> this

illuminate itself even further now this

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.370 
illuminate itself even further now this
is<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.790> disc<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.180> definitely<00:01:54.689> doesn't<00:01:55.110> have

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
is a disc that definitely doesn't have

however whenever you look at it at face

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.859

value<00:01:59.340> this<00:01:59.759> is<00:01:59.939> certainly<00:02:00.180> one<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.659> doesn't

stands out to me on this album because

it not to mention it gave the band a

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
with some slower material and whenever I

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.400 
with some slower material and whenever I
heard<00:02:23.910> this<00:02:24.210> knowing<00:02:24.780> where<00:02:24.960> we're<00:02:25.110> heading

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
heard this knowing where we're heading

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.980 
heard this knowing where we're heading
after<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.890> after<00:02:26.310> this<00:02:26.730> album<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.510> kind<00:02:27.900> of

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
after the after this album it kind of

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.980 
after the after this album it kind of
made<00:02:28.170> sense<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:29.670> band<00:02:30.150> went<00:02:30.390> into<00:02:30.480> the

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
made sense that the band went into the

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.870 
made sense that the band went into the
direction<00:02:31.440> that<00:02:31.560> they<00:02:31.740> did<00:02:32.010> with<00:02:32.460> their<00:02:32.670> fifth

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880

that idea and that glow to them

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.450 
that idea and that glow to them
especially<00:03:03.000> once<00:03:03.600> you<00:03:03.750> hear<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.650> fifth<00:03:05.010> album

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
especially once you hear the fifth album

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.070 
especially once you hear the fifth album
it's<00:03:05.670> something<00:03:06.000> that<00:03:06.150> definitely<00:03:06.600> happens<00:03:06.960> a

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
it's something that definitely happens a

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.140 
it's something that definitely happens a
little<00:03:07.200> bit<00:03:07.410> more<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:08.550> experimentation

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
little bit more the experimentation

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.390 
little bit more the experimentation
however<00:03:09.630> with<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.900> legacy<00:03:10.200> definitely<00:03:10.890> is<00:03:11.070> a

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
however with the legacy definitely is a

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.400

coming it's time for us to talk about

coming it's time for us to talk about
that<00:03:52.230> album<00:03:52.440> I<00:03:52.650> understand<00:03:53.070> that<00:03:53.190> this<00:03:53.280> was

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
that album I understand that this was

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.040 
that album I understand that this was
kind<00:03:53.760> of<00:03:53.850> short<00:03:54.120> but<00:03:54.450> that's<00:03:54.600> principally

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
kind of short but that's principally

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.570 
kind of short but that's principally
because<00:03:55.170> this<00:03:55.500> is<00:03:55.620> an<00:03:55.740> album<00:03:55.890> that<00:03:56.070> is<00:03:56.280> kind<00:03:56.520> of

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
because this is an album that is kind of

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.430 
because this is an album that is kind of
short<00:03:56.790> and<00:03:57.090> one<00:03:57.300> that<00:03:57.420> really<00:03:57.630> doesn't<00:03:58.050> have

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
short and one that really doesn't have

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.410 
short and one that really doesn't have
that<00:03:58.680> much<00:03:59.010> going<00:03:59.310> for<00:03:59.700> it<00:03:59.760> at<00:03:59.910> least<00:03:59.940> in<00:04:00.240> my

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
that much going for it at least in my

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.210 
that much going for it at least in my
opinion<00:04:00.540> with<00:04:01.290> a<00:04:01.320> lone<00:04:01.560> exception<00:04:01.740> of<00:04:02.160> the

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
opinion with a lone exception of the

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.890 
opinion with a lone exception of the
fact<00:04:02.400> that<00:04:02.459> it's<00:04:02.640> a<00:04:02.700> hell<00:04:02.970> of<00:04:03.000> a<00:04:03.180> guitar<00:04:03.330> album

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
fact that it's a hell of a guitar album

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.170 
fact that it's a hell of a guitar album
I<00:04:04.050> can't<00:04:04.740> say<00:04:04.980> Alex's<00:04:05.490> name<00:04:05.640> enough<00:04:05.940> whenever

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
I can't say Alex's name enough whenever

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.760 
I can't say Alex's name enough whenever
it<00:04:06.420> comes<00:04:06.600> to<00:04:06.750> this<00:04:06.870> release<00:04:07.230> because<00:04:07.590> it

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
it comes to this release because it

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.490 
it comes to this release because it
truly<00:04:07.980> saves<00:04:08.370> it<00:04:08.550> seven<00:04:09.390> days<00:04:09.510> in<00:04:09.690> May<00:04:09.720> it's<00:04:10.170> a
