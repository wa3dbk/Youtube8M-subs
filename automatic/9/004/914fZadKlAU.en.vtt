00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
said it before and I'll said again dice

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.630 
said it before and I'll said again dice
tower<00:03:51.380> we<00:03:51.950> like<00:03:52.190> dice<00:03:53.770> like<00:03:54.770> Roland<00:03:55.250> I<00:03:55.370> since

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
tower we like dice like Roland I since

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.250 
tower we like dice like Roland I since
well<00:03:55.790> we<00:03:55.940> haven't<00:03:56.120> so<00:03:56.480> there's<00:03:56.690> some<00:03:56.870> fun<00:03:57.140> in

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
well we haven't so there's some fun in

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.080 
well we haven't so there's some fun in
this<00:03:57.440> game<00:03:57.650> and<00:03:57.830> kids<00:03:58.070> certainly<00:03:58.670> seem<00:03:59.060> to

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
this game and kids certainly seem to

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.510 
this game and kids certainly seem to
enjoy<00:03:59.300> it<00:03:59.510> my<00:04:00.080> problem<00:04:00.380> as<00:04:00.680> an<00:04:00.830> adult<00:04:01.160> was<00:04:01.490> I

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
enjoy it my problem as an adult was I

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.060 
enjoy it my problem as an adult was I
did<00:04:01.970> not<00:04:02.210> like<00:04:02.540> how<00:04:03.230> we<00:04:03.290> dealt<00:04:03.680> out<00:04:03.890> the

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
did not like how we dealt out the

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.520 
did not like how we dealt out the
dinosaurs<00:04:04.510> because<00:04:05.510> some<00:04:05.870> of<00:04:05.900> the<00:04:06.020> dinosaurs

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
dinosaurs because some of the dinosaurs

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.680 
dinosaurs because some of the dinosaurs
are<00:04:06.740> just<00:04:07.520> obviously<00:04:07.970> more<00:04:08.120> powerful<00:04:08.570> than

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
are just obviously more powerful than

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.480 
are just obviously more powerful than
other<00:04:08.840> ones<00:04:09.140> and<00:04:09.470> so<00:04:09.770> I<00:04:09.800> would<00:04:09.890> prefer<00:04:10.100> to<00:04:10.250> more

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
other ones and so I would prefer to more

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.400 
other ones and so I would prefer to more
even<00:04:10.880> distribution<00:04:11.000> and<00:04:11.690> so<00:04:11.840> that<00:04:12.140> would<00:04:12.290> add

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
even distribution and so that would add

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.770 
even distribution and so that would add
some<00:04:12.620> strategy<00:04:13.070> to<00:04:13.190> the<00:04:13.370> game<00:04:13.520> as<00:04:14.060> to<00:04:14.390> when<00:04:14.630> you

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
some strategy to the game as to when you

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.330 
some strategy to the game as to when you
play<00:04:15.020> your<00:04:15.200> week<00:04:15.350> dinosaur<00:04:15.830> when<00:04:16.010> do<00:04:16.100> you<00:04:16.190> play

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
play your week dinosaur when do you play

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.610 
play your week dinosaur when do you play
your<00:04:16.520> strong<00:04:16.790> one<00:04:17.170> look<00:04:18.170> what<00:04:18.320> your<00:04:18.440> opponent

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
your strong one look what your opponent

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.400 
your strong one look what your opponent
through<00:04:19.040> what<00:04:19.489> are<00:04:19.580> you<00:04:19.669> going<00:04:19.880> to<00:04:19.970> throw<00:04:20.410> but

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
through what are you going to throw but

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.350 
through what are you going to throw but
other<00:04:21.530> than<00:04:21.680> that<00:04:21.739> it's<00:04:22.310> basically<00:04:22.580> roll<00:04:22.880> try

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
other than that it's basically roll try

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.120 
other than that it's basically roll try
to<00:04:23.419> eat<00:04:23.570> out

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
to eat out

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.650 
to eat out
eat<00:04:24.280> the<00:04:24.610> other<00:04:24.670> person<00:04:25.060> play<00:04:25.240> your<00:04:25.360> combat

cards<00:04:25.900> at<00:04:25.960> the<00:04:25.990> right<00:04:26.140> time<00:04:26.350> it's<00:04:26.800> a<00:04:26.830> very<00:04:27.040> very

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
cards at the right time it's a very very

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.520 
cards at the right time it's a very very
very<00:04:27.280> light<00:04:28.090> game<00:04:28.510> and<00:04:28.780> it<00:04:29.170> has<00:04:29.290> play

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
very light game and it has play

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.930 
very light game and it has play
domination<00:04:29.890> but<00:04:30.130> it's<00:04:30.280> quick<00:04:30.460> enough<00:04:30.670> i<00:04:30.760> don't

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
domination but it's quick enough i don't

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.330 
domination but it's quick enough i don't
see<00:04:31.030> that<00:04:31.060> that<00:04:31.300> really<00:04:31.450> matters<00:04:31.930> so<00:04:32.410> I<00:04:32.440> it's

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
see that that really matters so I it's

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.520 
see that that really matters so I it's
fun<00:04:33.670> but<00:04:33.970> I<00:04:34.030> again<00:04:34.810> it<00:04:34.990> definitely<00:04:35.380> has<00:04:35.500> a

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
fun but I again it definitely has a

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.070 
fun but I again it definitely has a
specific<00:04:35.800> audience<00:04:36.190> I<00:04:36.610> would<00:04:37.390> say<00:04:37.630> boys<00:04:37.900> who

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
specific audience I would say boys who

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.450 
specific audience I would say boys who
like<00:04:38.200> dinosaurs<00:04:38.740> or<00:04:38.890> girls<00:04:39.220> who<00:04:39.310> like
