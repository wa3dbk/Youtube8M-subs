 observe do everything to understand 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.559
 our smaller brothers 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.020
 they make us more tolerant 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.410
 and most importantly reveals the potential 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.950
 man but I will tell you about it 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.750
 next time today is my story 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.809
 Moscow Central Hippodrome 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.460
 I passionately love horses from speed 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:59.039
 no wonder that my choice fell exactly 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:02.550
 Moscow on him khodynskom 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.559
 more opened in 1834 and is considered 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.080
 Europe's oldest change here 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.820
 sure to happen but for now still 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.490
 have the opportunity to feel the atmosphere 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.070
 the past is a real museum under 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.430
 open sky 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.409
 The main building by Droma was built in 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.360
 1894 by the project of architects take 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.060
 on the ecology and at that time was called 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.549
 very simple Moscow arbor 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.890
 Initially there were two race tracks with 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.630
 what a racist vast territory in 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.810
 the neighborhoods of running they lay exactly 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.450
 they covered them all this area 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.280
 the flesh to the Belarus station then you 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.500
 thinking there was no paid square and 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.240
 cleverly you are on your own initiative 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.950
 went for a walk around the city does not fly 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.110
 caught even in campsites 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.960
 animals know where to go to this day 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.290
 every Sunday on the racetrack passes 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.540
 running 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.790
 despite the fact that all gambling 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.869
 us banned here on legal rights a 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.619
 since 1877 the tote is probably 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.240
 I will risk 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:08.009
 and i will bet hopefully iâ€™m not lucky 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.080
 hit the jackpot not only win on 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.420
 make your dream what exactly you 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.590
 probably guessed but not 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.590
 executive luck
