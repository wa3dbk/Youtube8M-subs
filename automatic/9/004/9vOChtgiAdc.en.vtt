woke up in the morning no why why why
well<00:00:21.210> we<00:00:21.420> didn't<00:00:21.600> have<00:00:21.720> any<00:00:21.869> help<00:00:22.170> my<00:00:23.039> pilot

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
well we didn't have any help my pilot

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.580 
well we didn't have any help my pilot
was<00:00:23.490> out<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.699> had<00:00:23.939> no<00:00:24.150> my<00:00:24.449> burner<00:00:24.900> was<00:00:25.140> not<00:00:25.289> was

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
was out I had no my burner was not was

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.300 
was out I had no my burner was not was
not<00:00:25.619> operate<00:00:26.070> so<00:00:26.760> what<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.630> did<00:00:27.779> was<00:00:28.289> I<00:00:28.769> have<00:00:29.250> a

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
not operate so what I did was I have a

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.609 
not operate so what I did was I have a
control<00:00:29.760> unit<00:00:29.789> here<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.560> a

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
control unit here that is a

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.160 
control unit here that is a
state-of-the-art<00:00:32.390> electronic<00:00:33.390> real<00:00:33.690> fancy<00:00:34.140> I

state-of-the-art electronic real fancy I

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.790 
state-of-the-art electronic real fancy I
like<00:00:34.440> my<00:00:34.590> old<00:00:34.770> one<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.250> unfortunately<00:00:36.800> it's

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
like my old one and unfortunately it's

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.350 
like my old one and unfortunately it's
fail<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.550> what<00:00:38.700> occurred<00:00:39.500> was<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:41.120> we<00:00:42.120> can<00:00:42.270> do

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
fail so what occurred was that we can do

their<00:00:46.739> tech<00:00:46.950> support<00:00:47.100> we<00:00:47.730> tested<00:00:48.120> out

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
their tech support we tested out

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.270 
their tech support we tested out
everything<00:00:48.690> we<00:00:49.140> tested<00:00:49.620> out<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.920> make<00:00:50.070> sure

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
everything we tested out to make sure

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.720 
everything we tested out to make sure
that<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:51.379> thermocouple<00:00:52.379> was<00:00:53.010> operating

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
that the thermocouple was operating

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.819 
that the thermocouple was operating
properly<00:00:53.969> in<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.420> thermocouple<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.260> unit

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
properly in the thermocouple is unit

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.590 
properly in the thermocouple is unit
this<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.160> here<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.520> after<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.300> like<00:00:57.449> the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
this in here and after you like the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.360 
this in here and after you like the
pilot<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.140> pilot<00:00:58.289> needs<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.890> burn<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.100> couple

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
pilot the pilot needs to burn a couple

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.619 
pilot the pilot needs to burn a couple
and<00:00:59.760> you<00:01:00.629> can<00:01:00.809> measure<00:01:01.250> the<00:01:02.250> voltage<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.969> the

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
and you can measure the voltage on the

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.140 
and you can measure the voltage on the
thermocouple<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.439> needs<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.920> be<00:01:05.010> between<00:01:05.220> 350

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
thermocouple it needs to be between 350

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.250 
thermocouple it needs to be between 350
and<00:01:06.360> 500<00:01:06.979> well<00:01:07.979> at<00:01:08.130> 600<00:01:08.580> millivolts<00:01:09.479> in<00:01:09.900> order

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
and 500 well at 600 millivolts in order

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.740 
and 500 well at 600 millivolts in order
to<00:01:10.409> fire<00:01:11.250> off<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.640> system<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.119> tell<00:01:12.330> me<00:01:12.450> that

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
to fire off the system to tell me that

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.810 
to fire off the system to tell me that
you<00:01:12.869> know<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.110> heat<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.680> good<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.430> this

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
you know the heat is good so this

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.580 
you know the heat is good so this
function<00:01:15.390> correctly<00:01:15.600> put<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> multimeter<00:01:16.500> on

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
function correctly put a multimeter on

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.560 
function correctly put a multimeter on
there<00:01:16.830> he<00:01:16.890> did<00:01:17.070> everything<00:01:17.310> was<00:01:17.610> close<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.000> no

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
there he did everything was close to no

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.109 
there he did everything was close to no
good<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:19.470> tested<00:01:19.860> for<00:01:19.979> any<00:01:20.040> blockage<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
good we tested for any blockage in the

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.370 
good we tested for any blockage in the
in<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.049> gas<00:01:23.060> sensor<00:01:24.060> no<00:01:24.659> problems<00:01:25.170> there

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
in the gas sensor no problems there

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.980 
in the gas sensor no problems there
everything<00:01:25.860> seems<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.189> work<00:01:26.280> fine<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.990> our

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
everything seems to work fine and our

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.410 
everything seems to work fine and our
pzo<00:01:30.229> igniter<00:01:31.229> works<00:01:32.009> perfectly<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.610> can<00:01:33.000> get<00:01:33.210> a

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
pzo igniter works perfectly I can get a

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.480 
pzo igniter works perfectly I can get a
pilot<00:01:34.170> light<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.439> go<00:01:34.530> on<00:01:34.680> all<00:01:34.860> day<00:01:34.920> long<00:01:35.280> no

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
pilot light to go on all day long no

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.760 
pilot light to go on all day long no
problem<00:01:35.820> there<00:01:36.030> but<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.720> problem<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.170> this

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
problem there but the problem is this

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.240 
problem there but the problem is this
system<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.729> unit<00:01:39.090> never<00:01:40.130> recognizes<00:01:41.130> that

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
system this unit never recognizes that

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.990 
system this unit never recognizes that
everything's<00:01:41.610> good

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
everything's good

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.600 
everything's good
so<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.890> they're<00:01:43.890> going<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.100> ship<00:01:44.280> out<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.460> new

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
so I they're going to ship out a new

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.510 
so I they're going to ship out a new
unit<00:01:44.939> we<00:01:45.119> have<00:01:45.240> no<00:01:45.450> hot<00:01:45.659> water<00:01:45.840> for<00:01:46.140> two<00:01:46.290> days

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
unit we have no hot water for two days
