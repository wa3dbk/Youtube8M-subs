00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
middle of the loop so that I can pick

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.990 
middle of the loop so that I can pick
them<00:01:56.690> through<00:01:57.050> with<00:01:57.860> my<00:01:58.070> whip<00:01:58.280> finisher<00:01:58.760> so

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
the tips of the pheasant tail through

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.450 
the tips of the pheasant tail through
the<00:02:05.330> loop<00:02:05.420> then<00:02:06.290> before<00:02:06.440> I<00:02:06.650> let<00:02:06.920> go<00:02:07.100> I'm<00:02:07.310> going

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
the loop then before I let go I'm going

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
and I want it to be towards the tip

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.750 
and I want it to be towards the tip
basically<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:30.990> back<00:02:31.200> 30%<00:02:32.010> of<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.490> feather

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
to superglue the tip so you can see

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.160 
to superglue the tip so you can see
these<00:02:38.670> tips<00:02:39.000> are<00:02:39.180> kind<00:02:39.360> of<00:02:39.390> all<00:02:39.480> frazzled<00:02:39.840> and

once they are all dried I'm going to

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.470 
once they are all dried I'm going to
just<00:03:33.209> kind<00:03:33.360> of<00:03:33.450> speed<00:03:33.720> up<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.989> process<00:03:34.470> here

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
just kind of speed up the process here

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:42.320 
just kind of speed up the process here
you're<00:03:36.480> going<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:36.900> want<00:03:37.170> to<00:03:37.230> clip<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:41.330> back

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
you're going to want to clip the back

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.350 
you're going to want to clip the back
part<00:03:42.660> of<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:42.810> legs<00:03:43.880> it's<00:03:44.880> not<00:03:45.030> going<00:03:45.209> to<00:03:45.270> be

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
part of the legs it's not going to be

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.970 
part of the legs it's not going to be
perfect<00:03:45.810> from<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.050> get-go<00:03:46.260> because<00:03:46.620> what<00:03:46.890> we

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
perfect from the get-go because what we

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.130 
perfect from the get-go because what we
have<00:03:47.160> now<00:03:47.190> is<00:03:47.580> we<00:03:47.610> have<00:03:47.730> a<00:03:47.910> leg<00:03:48.239> but<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:48.959> back

have now is we have a leg but the back
half<00:03:49.410> here<00:03:49.709> is<00:03:49.830> way<00:03:50.130> too<00:03:50.190> long<00:03:50.550> so<00:03:50.970> what<00:03:51.209> we're

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
half here is way too long so what we're

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.290 
half here is way too long so what we're
going<00:03:51.420> to<00:03:51.480> do<00:03:51.630> is<00:03:51.780> we're<00:03:51.900> going<00:03:51.989> to<00:03:52.050> clip<00:03:52.290> these

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
going to do is we're going to clip these

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.510 
going to do is we're going to clip these
and<00:03:54.300> I<00:03:54.330> usually<00:03:54.690> clip<00:03:54.959> them<00:03:55.200> so<00:03:56.070> that<00:03:56.280> they're

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
and I usually clip them so that they're

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.500 
and I usually clip them so that they're
about<00:03:56.760> half<00:03:57.570> an<00:03:57.720> inch<00:03:57.840> to<00:03:58.260> a<00:03:59.220> quarter<00:04:00.180> of<00:04:00.330> an

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
about half an inch to a quarter of an

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.949 
about half an inch to a quarter of an
inch

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
inch

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.270 
inch
I<00:04:00.989> don't<00:04:01.230> usually<00:04:01.440> want<00:04:01.770> to<00:04:01.800> make<00:04:01.950> them<00:04:02.040> too

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
I don't usually want to make them too

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.830 
I don't usually want to make them too
much<00:04:02.400> longer<00:04:02.820> than<00:04:03.030> three<00:04:03.300> quarters<00:04:03.630> of<00:04:03.750> an

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
much longer than three quarters of an
