for some of these trees what we've done
at<00:00:49.620> different<00:00:49.920> times<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.309> year<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.789> will

of cal- around the base of each tree
just<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.750> help<00:01:06.869> put<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.229> little<00:01:07.439> bit<00:01:07.619> more<00:01:07.830> back

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280

you<00:05:18.970> know<00:05:19.060> an<00:05:19.180> extension<00:05:19.630> lat<00:05:19.840> excuse<00:05:20.410> me<00:05:20.560> a

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
you know an extension lat excuse me a

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.250 
you know an extension lat excuse me a
stepladder<00:05:21.330> the<00:05:22.330> other<00:05:22.449> thing<00:05:22.690> you<00:05:22.930> can<00:05:22.960> do

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
stepladder the other thing you can do

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260 
stepladder the other thing you can do
too<00:05:23.470> is<00:05:23.500> when<00:05:23.860> they<00:05:24.039> get<00:05:24.280> closer<00:05:24.639> to<00:05:24.970> being

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
too is when they get closer to being

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.180 
too is when they get closer to being
dead<00:05:25.510> ripe<00:05:26.199> you<00:05:26.410> can<00:05:26.560> actually<00:05:26.860> knock<00:05:27.010> them

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
dead ripe you can actually knock them

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.140 
dead ripe you can actually knock them
off<00:05:27.340> with<00:05:27.520> a<00:05:27.550> stick<00:05:28.680> and<00:05:29.820> again<00:05:30.820> this<00:05:30.970> is

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
off with a stick and again this is

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.250 
off with a stick and again this is
something<00:05:31.270> you'll<00:05:31.510> just<00:05:31.690> have<00:05:31.870> to<00:05:32.020> kind<00:05:32.229> of

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.260 
fact that like the Russians used to say

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.290 
fact that like the Russians used to say
there<00:06:02.530> is<00:06:02.650> a<00:06:02.680> certain<00:06:03.099> quality<00:06:03.460> about

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
there is a certain quality about

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.500 
there is a certain quality about
quantity<00:06:05.250> our<00:06:06.250> family<00:06:06.789> has<00:06:06.820> just<00:06:07.300> three

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:07.510 
quantity our family has just three

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.640 
quantity our family has just three
people<00:06:07.870> in<00:06:07.990> them<00:06:08.280> but<00:06:09.280> we<00:06:09.430> have<00:06:10.289> like<00:06:11.289> I<00:06:11.440> said

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
figs and the orchards as well you'll

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.339 
figs and the orchards as well you'll
notice<00:06:24.849> here<00:06:25.120> at<00:06:25.210> the<00:06:25.300> base<00:06:25.510> of<00:06:25.570> the<00:06:26.050> tree

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:26.349 
notice here at the base of the tree

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:29.939 
notice here at the base of the tree
there's<00:06:27.070> some<00:06:27.340> white<00:06:27.580> paint<00:06:28.650> typically<00:06:29.650> we<00:06:29.770> do

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:29.949 
there's some white paint typically we do

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:31.529 
there's some white paint typically we do
this<00:06:30.130> with<00:06:30.340> the<00:06:30.460> younger<00:06:30.789> trees<00:06:31.030> the<00:06:31.330> first

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:31.539 
this with the younger trees the first

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:36.870 
this with the younger trees the first
year<00:06:31.870> or<00:06:31.960> so<00:06:32.370> wild<00:06:33.370> rabbits<00:06:33.760> love<00:06:35.039> bark<00:06:36.039> of<00:06:36.280> new

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 
year or so wild rabbits love bark of new

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.779 
year or so wild rabbits love bark of new
trees<00:06:37.210> especially<00:06:38.050> in<00:06:38.650> the<00:06:38.770> winter<00:06:39.010> time<00:06:39.190> now

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:39.789 
trees especially in the winter time now

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:41.279 
trees especially in the winter time now
in<00:06:39.940> an<00:06:40.060> older<00:06:40.330> tree<00:06:40.539> like<00:06:40.719> some<00:06:40.900> of<00:06:40.960> the<00:06:41.020> ones

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:41.289 
in an older tree like some of the ones

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:43.980 
in an older tree like some of the ones
shown<00:06:41.649> you<00:06:41.860> they<00:06:42.430> can<00:06:42.639> they<00:06:42.879> can<00:06:42.909> you<00:06:43.719> can<00:06:43.869> eat

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:43.990 
shown you they can they can you can eat

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.019 
shown you they can they can you can eat
a<00:06:44.020> good<00:06:44.770> bit<00:06:44.949> of<00:06:44.979> the<00:06:45.129> bark<00:06:45.369> off<00:06:45.550> and<00:06:45.789> it<00:06:45.849> won't

00:06:46.019 --> 00:06:46.029 
a good bit of the bark off and it won't

00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:47.339 
a good bit of the bark off and it won't
really<00:06:46.149> affect<00:06:46.270> the<00:06:46.629> trees<00:06:46.930> but<00:06:47.169> it<00:06:47.259> can

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:47.349 
really affect the trees but it can

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:51.480 
really affect the trees but it can
really<00:06:47.529> tear<00:06:47.919> up<00:06:48.129> a<00:06:48.279> small<00:06:48.580> tree<00:06:48.849> like<00:06:49.089> this<00:06:50.490> so

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.490 
really tear up a small tree like this so

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:52.889 
really tear up a small tree like this so
if<00:06:51.580> you<00:06:51.669> paint<00:06:51.939> it<00:06:52.059> white<00:06:52.210> there<00:06:52.479> at<00:06:52.599> the<00:06:52.689> base

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:52.899 
if you paint it white there at the base

00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:55.139 
if you paint it white there at the base
for<00:06:53.889> whatever<00:06:54.159> reasons<00:06:54.550> the<00:06:54.729> bunnies<00:06:54.999> don't

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:55.149 
for whatever reasons the bunnies don't

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:57.719 
for whatever reasons the bunnies don't
seem<00:06:55.419> to<00:06:55.509> like<00:06:55.689> that
