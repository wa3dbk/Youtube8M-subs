back to evolving you know he wasn't
played<00:03:16.070> in<00:03:16.190> a<00:03:16.220> while<00:03:16.400> so<00:03:16.730> I'm<00:03:16.850> sure<00:03:17.090> it's<00:03:17.269> gonna

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
played in a while so I'm sure it's gonna

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.920 
played in a while so I'm sure it's gonna
be<00:03:17.570> an<00:03:17.660> adjustment<00:03:17.720> from<00:03:18.440> practice<00:03:18.980> to<00:03:19.100> games

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
be an adjustment from practice to games

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.270 
be an adjustment from practice to games
but<00:03:20.930> we're<00:03:21.530> looking<00:03:21.620> for<00:03:21.920> him<00:03:22.010> to<00:03:22.070> have<00:03:22.190> an

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
but we're looking for him to have an

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.840 
but we're looking for him to have an
impact<00:03:22.730> to<00:03:23.079> expect<00:03:24.079> him<00:03:24.230> to<00:03:24.290> be<00:03:24.530> playoff<00:03:25.459> form

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
impact to expect him to be playoff form

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.560 
impact to expect him to be playoff form
is<00:03:26.630> not<00:03:27.049> fair<00:03:27.350> to<00:03:27.500> him<00:03:27.730> that<00:03:28.730> being<00:03:29.000> said<00:03:29.269> I

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
is not fair to him that being said I

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.370 
is not fair to him that being said I
think<00:03:30.170> his<00:03:30.350> energy<00:03:31.070> and<00:03:31.280> his<00:03:31.850> leadership<00:03:32.780> will

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
think his energy and his leadership will

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.300 
think his energy and his leadership will
lift<00:03:33.590> our<00:03:33.769> team<00:03:34.010> but<00:03:34.840> but<00:03:35.840> I<00:03:35.870> don't<00:03:35.959> I<00:03:36.410> don't

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
lift our team but but I don't I don't

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.009
