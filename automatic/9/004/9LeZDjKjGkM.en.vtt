00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.799
 So after I burg to the newly 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.270
 he has unpacked what he already has a few 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.079
 But it does not take days to do that 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.020
 knowledge 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:34.479
 I will now show you what you are 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.539
 actually can do everything with it yes 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:41.049
 So that 's the practical bag this 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:44.500
 I think that looks very cool 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:47.409
 once simply has up here yet 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.939
 such a small ribbon there you can 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.280
 bowl pendant or something else 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.470
 However, you can attach directly to 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.240
 I would but the device down here 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.119
 not recommend because I think who that 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.750
 uses internal microphone and once here 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.369
 Something rumbles then the thing is 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.390
 by contrast, you pop and you become one 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.110
 small bang on the on the soundtrack 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.299
 to have 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.620
 that means I would not be me 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:15.310
 recommend something to do right here 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.200
 but if then to the bag so me 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.440
 I have already tested the internal microphone 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.680
 and also have an external microphone 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.700
 tested so we have here 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.100
 headphone jack and microphone jack 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.920
 via the micro internal microphone 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:34.480
 if there are two stages on which you have it 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:37.390
 can once set to high and 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.819
 once on low that is once you hear 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.790
 pretty much everything at all on high 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:46.510
 somewhere in the area is 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.549
 Recommended if you tell me one 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.200
 orchestra or something like that 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.989
 however, the whole is online too 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.609
 hall and everything in it 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.780
 but if you are a simple one 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:57.790
 I would recommend voice recording 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.260
 to put the thing on low and directly 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:05.980
 to fix in front of your mouth who my 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:08.500
 recommendation so easily we built 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.290
 we stop poor 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.320
 recording we have a menu and we 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.530
 have scenes in calendar in the middle 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:22.240
 before back or fast forward worth it 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:24.130
 stay bare - play or the 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.310
 of course then have confirmation button 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.810
 here we polder so you can in the 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.760
 change folders there is abcde 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.140
 I tried them by name to 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.459
 Change did not work for me 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.500
 maybe there is a possibility 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.750
 however 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:44.739
 I use now for other b for 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:47.709
 sound effects cd and e for movies when 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.540
 I then have to record a sound and 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.739
 Here we have the key with which we 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:56.850
 delete data again 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:59.410
 on the side we have a mini usb 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.650
 a power switch works that way 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:06.780
 to stay on it for a short while 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.950
 picking up again naturally 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.480
 would like a shot and not on 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.930
 Any button may want to come 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.690
 use 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.790
 Here we have a flap I am whole 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.760
 honestly I do not need that for what 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.130
 I have to put down my recording device 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:26.979
 So this is totally for me 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:29.370
 useless but yes and on the other side 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:32.440
 we have the input for the sd card 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.890
 I have an 8 gigabyte in it and 8 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.870
 gb 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.600
 You can live quite well with that if that 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.330
 part and something recognizes the internal 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.729
 loudspeaker is of course a bit 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:45.700
 rattling but who thus no problem 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:49.120
 has and when it traded for himself 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.130
 as a note uses absolutely suitable find 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.110
 I think I'm super top I can only 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.650
 recommend and as a recording device has it 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.240
 so far absolutely proven I switch 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.120
 again briefly that you can see for a moment 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.470
 what happened there olympus are there 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.750
 Now my shot is up there 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.780
 folder stands as many recording the 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.550
 get the first of two in the folder 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.990
 how long I've been there already 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.160
 Play pressed so I switch now 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.240
 once a second then comes the 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:19.820
 next 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:23.570
 50 seconds battery which quality mp3 192 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:29.170
 and now when I here today to fully 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:32.600
 press as does my team cdg and again 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:34.610
 so very briefly in the menu because we have there 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.940
 a menu recording menu bla bla bla bla 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.700
 blah, not necessarily everyone has to 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.080
 know here we have filters etc 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:44.300
 have to play a bit myself because 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.210
 I'm completely honest I'm here now 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.800
 not yet pressed big and the 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.790
 scene calendar can be seen when 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.380
 I made what sound recording so that 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.400
 That's it, I can only do good things 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.760
 can only recommend it to others 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.900
 for the price a top recording device one 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.040
 Of course it can also increase with 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.320
 I will use my microphone 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.480
 someday he 'll buy a lot of it 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.640
 fun 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:10.430
 Recording and then microphone on so 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:13.100
 my recording device is set to me 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:18.910
 I will move it to my dog 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:21.800
 so now you have to hear everything about mine 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:25.580
 super great recording device i am 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:27.230
 satisfied and have fun on the video 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.880
 look at the other videos 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.490
 my other unboxing sun and who 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.169
 interest in sounds has that of this 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.680
 However, I will get the recording device 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:39.620
 there with an external microphone 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:41.150
 I can only say that I have a lot of fun 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.070
 Get up to date and have a look 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.270
 my other channels and ours 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:48.850
 to other channels 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.850
 have fun thank you and end
