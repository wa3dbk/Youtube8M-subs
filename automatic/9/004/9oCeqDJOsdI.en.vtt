there you go

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.300 
there you go
so<00:01:30.800> nice<00:01:31.400> a<00:01:31.760> nice<00:01:32.360> deep<00:01:32.720> sound<00:01:33.110> I<00:01:33.860> think

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
so nice a nice deep sound I think

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.860 
so nice a nice deep sound I think
they're<00:01:34.490> on<00:01:34.580> the<00:01:34.670> same<00:01:34.910> par<00:01:35.120> as<00:01:35.150> the<00:01:35.390> Predators

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
they're on the same par as the Predators

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.190 
they're on the same par as the Predators
they're<00:01:36.380> definitely<00:01:36.560> louder<00:01:36.980> than<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:37.340> BCS

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
they're definitely louder than the BCS

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.690 
they're definitely louder than the BCS
but<00:01:39.200> they're<00:01:39.350> probably<00:01:39.530> at<00:01:40.070> maybe<00:01:40.280> a<00:01:40.370> decibel

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
but they're probably at maybe a decibel

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.070 
but they're probably at maybe a decibel
less<00:01:41.030> than<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:41.270> Predators<00:01:41.540> but<00:01:41.870> they<00:01:41.960> were<00:01:42.020> a

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
less than the Predators but they were a

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.650 
less than the Predators but they were a
crisp<00:01:42.440> noise<00:01:42.740> you<00:01:43.490> don't<00:01:43.640> have<00:01:43.729> to<00:01:43.820> remap<00:01:44.210> it<00:01:44.240> I

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
crisp noise you don't have to remap it I

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.420 
crisp noise you don't have to remap it I
got<00:01:45.110> into<00:01:45.380> it<00:01:45.470> on<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:45.650> freeway<00:01:45.830> up<00:01:46.250> to<00:01:46.400> a

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
got into it on the freeway up to a

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.830 
got into it on the freeway up to a
hundred<00:01:46.640> mile<00:01:46.820> an<00:01:46.850> hour<00:01:47.030> and<00:01:47.210> at<00:01:47.300> no<00:01:47.450> problem

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
hundred mile an hour and at no problem

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.170 
hundred mile an hour and at no problem
