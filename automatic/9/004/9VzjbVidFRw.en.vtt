00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
the blue and black now the battery

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.569 
the blue and black now the battery
itself<00:02:49.689> is<00:02:49.989> right<00:02:50.169> here<00:02:50.500> you<00:02:50.680> have<00:02:50.889> a<00:02:50.919> single

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
itself is right here you have a single

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.670 
itself is right here you have a single
button<00:02:51.939> on<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.389> back<00:02:52.569> one<00:02:53.079> press<00:02:53.379> of<00:02:53.409> that

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
button on the back one press of that

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.140 
button on the back one press of that
it's<00:02:53.859> going<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.069> show<00:02:54.250> you<00:02:54.310> how<00:02:54.609> much<00:02:54.790> charge

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
it's going to show you how much charge

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.599 
it's going to show you how much charge
is<00:02:55.269> left<00:02:55.480> in<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.079> battery<00:02:56.439> case<00:02:56.650> in<00:02:56.889> this<00:02:57.340> case

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
is left in the battery case in this case

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.860 
is left in the battery case in this case
it's<00:02:57.879> green<00:02:58.239> so<00:02:58.269> we've<00:02:58.750> got<00:02:59.019> right<00:02:59.409> around<00:02:59.819> 70%

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
it's green so we've got right around 70%

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.240 
it's green so we've got right around 70%
so<00:03:01.870> if<00:03:01.989> you<00:03:02.079> look<00:03:02.319> at<00:03:02.439> the<00:03:02.530> different<00:03:02.919> colors

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
so if you look at the different colors

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.360 
so if you look at the different colors
you<00:03:03.400> have<00:03:03.549> white<00:03:03.879> which<00:03:04.659> is<00:03:04.840> 72<00:03:05.230> 100%<00:03:06.010> green

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
you have white which is 72 100% green

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.439 
you have white which is 72 100% green
which<00:03:06.699> is<00:03:06.879> 35<00:03:07.419> to<00:03:07.689> 70<00:03:08.109> percent<00:03:08.260> red<00:03:08.949> is<00:03:09.609> 15<00:03:10.269> to

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:10.449 
which is 35 to 70 percent red is 15 to

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:15.270 
which is 35 to 70 percent red is 15 to
35%<00:03:11.459> flashing<00:03:12.459> is<00:03:12.639> 0<00:03:12.909> to<00:03:13.030> 15<00:03:13.599> percent<00:03:14.109> now<00:03:15.010> as<00:03:15.250> I

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
35% flashing is 0 to 15 percent now as I

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.849 
35% flashing is 0 to 15 percent now as I
mentioned<00:03:16.060> this<00:03:16.359> is<00:03:16.419> a<00:03:16.659> 32<00:03:17.139> hundred<00:03:17.530> million

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
mentioned this is a 32 hundred million

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:21.330 
mentioned this is a 32 hundred million
power<00:03:18.040> battery<00:03:18.129> it<00:03:18.699> does<00:03:18.939> charge<00:03:19.449> at<00:03:19.810> 1<00:03:20.229> amp<00:03:20.590> so

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
power battery it does charge at 1 amp so

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.039 
power battery it does charge at 1 amp so
it<00:03:21.489> does<00:03:21.669> take<00:03:21.879> a<00:03:21.909> little<00:03:22.209> while<00:03:22.389> to<00:03:22.419> recharge

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
it does take a little while to recharge

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.199 
it does take a little while to recharge
your<00:03:23.199> phone<00:03:23.439> but<00:03:23.739> in<00:03:23.889> my<00:03:24.129> testing<00:03:24.729> you're<00:03:25.030> able
