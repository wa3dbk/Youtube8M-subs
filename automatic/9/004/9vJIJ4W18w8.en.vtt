time<00:01:30.900> with<00:01:30.960> my<00:01:31.170> planner<00:01:31.470> which<00:01:31.710> sounds<00:01:31.979> kind

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
time with my planner which sounds kind

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.819 
time with my planner which sounds kind
of<00:01:32.220> corny<00:01:32.400> but<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.790> really<00:01:33.090> do<00:01:33.240> like<00:01:33.360> doing<00:01:33.689> that

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
of corny but I really do like doing that

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.410 
of corny but I really do like doing that
but<00:01:34.829> it's<00:01:35.009> annoying<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.729> have<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.090> do<00:01:36.240> that

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
but it's annoying that I have to do that

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.899 
but it's annoying that I have to do that
and<00:01:36.659> it's<00:01:37.619> time-consuming<00:01:37.920> when<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.790> whole

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
and it's time-consuming when the whole

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.060 
and it's time-consuming when the whole
point<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.240> planner<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:40.020> kind<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.439> save<00:01:40.680> me

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
point of a planner is to kind of save me

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.359 
point of a planner is to kind of save me
time<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.420> took<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.560> implement<00:01:44.280> it

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
time so I took this and I implement it

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
this is because sometimes I am just

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:48.020 
this is because sometimes I am just
curious<00:02:45.930> when<00:02:46.680> somebody's<00:02:47.189> birthday<00:02:47.459> is<00:02:47.790> or

curious when somebody's birthday is or

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.059 
curious when somebody's birthday is or
when<00:02:48.449> an<00:02:48.569> anniversary<00:02:49.169> is<00:02:49.290> when<00:02:49.439> I<00:02:49.469> forget<00:02:49.889> and

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
when an anniversary is when I forget and

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.099 
when an anniversary is when I forget and
instead<00:02:50.699> of<00:02:50.790> having<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.120> go<00:02:51.299> through<00:02:51.689> and<00:02:52.079> look

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
instead of having to go through and look

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:55.490 
instead of having to go through and look
through<00:02:52.889> each<00:02:53.189> and<00:02:53.549> every<00:02:53.909> month<00:02:54.409> for<00:02:55.409> the

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
person's name which I might glass over I

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:00.080 
person's name which I might glass over I
can<00:02:58.650> just<00:02:58.799> go<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.069> the<00:02:59.549> letter<00:02:59.760> of<00:02:59.849> the

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
can just go to the letter of the

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.439 
can just go to the letter of the
alphabet<00:03:00.120> that<00:03:00.719> there's<00:03:00.930> falls<00:03:01.349> under<00:03:01.859> and

that<00:03:05.189> i<00:03:05.459> can<00:03:05.819> take<00:03:06.150> this<00:03:06.299> out<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:06.750> then<00:03:06.840> i'll

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:07.199 
that i can take this out and then i'll

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:08.659 
that i can take this out and then i'll
use<00:03:07.230> it<00:03:07.590> again<00:03:07.829> next<00:03:07.980> year<00:03:08.189> and<00:03:08.519> the<00:03:08.639> year

much space because i can add to these

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:14.749 
much space because i can add to these
over<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.169> years<00:03:13.379> and<00:03:13.590> I<00:03:14.189> never<00:03:14.250> have<00:03:14.639> to

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:14.759 
over the years and I never have to

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:17.479 
over the years and I never have to
rewrite<00:03:15.569> again<00:03:15.930> unless<00:03:16.199> all<00:03:16.769> the<00:03:16.979> papers<00:03:17.280> get

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
rewrite again unless all the papers get

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.149 
rewrite again unless all the papers get
on<00:03:18.239> fire<00:03:18.479> or<00:03:18.720> something<00:03:18.870> crazy<00:03:19.349> like<00:03:19.620> that<00:03:19.739> but

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 
on fire or something crazy like that but

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.849 
on fire or something crazy like that but
that<00:03:20.819> would<00:03:21.000> be<00:03:21.030> only<00:03:21.959> really<00:03:22.439> an<00:03:22.530> extreme

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
that would be only really an extreme

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.189 
that would be only really an extreme
case<00:03:23.040> when<00:03:23.280> I<00:03:23.310> need<00:03:23.579> to<00:03:23.900> rewrite<00:03:24.900> it<00:03:25.079> all

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:25.199 
case when I need to rewrite it all

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:27.679 
case when I need to rewrite it all
unless<00:03:25.409> I<00:03:25.620> wanted<00:03:25.949> to<00:03:26.299> so<00:03:27.299> that's<00:03:27.359> the<00:03:27.540> first

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:27.689 
unless I wanted to so that's the first

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:30.920 
unless I wanted to so that's the first
part<00:03:27.930> of<00:03:28.109> the<00:03:28.259> second<00:03:28.620> half<00:03:28.909> the<00:03:29.909> rest<00:03:30.239> of<00:03:30.569> this

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
part of the second half the rest of this

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.920 
part of the second half the rest of this
is<00:03:31.259> kind<00:03:31.799> of<00:03:31.889> like<00:03:32.359> it's<00:03:33.359> kind<00:03:33.419> of<00:03:33.629> like<00:03:33.780> my

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
is kind of like it's kind of like my

ideas<00:03:53.519> house<00:03:54.000> to<00:03:54.359> do<00:03:54.509> because<00:03:54.870> we<00:03:55.019> just<00:03:55.229> bought

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
ideas house to do because we just bought

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.949 
ideas house to do because we just bought
a<00:03:55.799> house<00:03:56.040> or<00:03:56.400> we're<00:03:56.579> about<00:03:57.359> to<00:03:57.509> close<00:03:57.629> on<00:03:57.930> a

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
a house or we're about to close on a

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.969 
a house or we're about to close on a
house<00:03:58.169> in<00:03:58.349> about<00:03:58.439> a<00:03:58.560> month<00:03:58.769> and<00:03:58.949> then

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:00.979 
house in about a month and then

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:03.050 
house in about a month and then
passwords<00:04:01.979> is<00:04:02.159> pretty<00:04:02.400> much<00:04:02.519> what<00:04:02.729> this<00:04:02.879> is

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
passwords is pretty much what this is

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.289 
passwords is pretty much what this is
but<00:04:03.659> there's<00:04:03.870> three<00:04:04.079> main<00:04:04.319> sections<00:04:04.620> i<00:04:04.949> guess

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
but there's three main sections i guess

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.689 
but there's three main sections i guess
so<00:04:06.299> the<00:04:06.689> trackers<00:04:06.989> and<00:04:07.169> list<00:04:07.530> includes<00:04:08.400> things

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:08.699 
so the trackers and list includes things

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:11.390 
so the trackers and list includes things
that<00:04:08.969> i<00:04:09.000> need<00:04:09.120> to<00:04:09.269> keep<00:04:09.419> track<00:04:09.629> of<00:04:09.689> and<00:04:10.159> list<00:04:11.159> of
