00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.120
Water is essential to
all living organisms.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.600
The movement of water from the
atmosphere through the biosphere

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.360
and below into the soil, streams,
groundwater, and ultimately the oceans

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.030
is called the hydrologic cycle.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.450
Water's the primary agent for
moving different compounds

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.350
through the biosphere,
both those that are

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.010
essential to life and
those that are toxic.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.430
On Earth, about 97% of our water
is in the oceans, and less than 3%

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.840
is fresh water.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.350
Of fresh water on Earth,
slightly more than 3/4 of that

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.490
is stored in ice or glaciers.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.480
So less than 1% of water on
Earth is unfrozen, fresh water

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.090
that is potentially readily
available for human use.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.770
The sun is one of the drivers
of the hydrologic cycle.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.400
Energy from the sun evaporates water
from the oceans, rivers, lakes,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.530
and soil.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.230
During photosynthesis,
water is lost from leaves

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.440
in a process called transpiration.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.730
Together, these two processes are
referred to as evapotranspiration.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.180
Evaporated water in the
atmosphere condenses into clouds.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.790
Water returns to the
earth as precipitation,

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.720
for example, rain and snow.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.010
Precipitation falling on
land is taken up by plants,

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.605
runs off along the land's surface,
or percolates into the soil

00:01:23.605 --> 00:01:24.740
and enters the groundwater.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.530
We can describe these events through the
hydrological equation-- precipitation

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:41.140
equals evapotranspiration plus storage
plus runoff-- precip equals ET plus S

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.010
plus RO.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.230
The earth is a closed system
with regards to matter,

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.020
so water never leaves it.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.230
However, human activities can alter
the hydrologic cycle and water

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.790
availability.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.590
When we pave land over for a road, we
impede the flow of water into the soil,

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.890
affecting the hydrologic cycle by
increasing runoff or increasing

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.490
evaporation.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.070
When we water our lawns or use
water for pools and fountains,

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.170
we increase the amount of
evaporation that might take place.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.970
When we remove vegetation, we
decrease the amount of transpiration

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.530
that might take place.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.860
All of these actions affect
the hydrologic cycle.
