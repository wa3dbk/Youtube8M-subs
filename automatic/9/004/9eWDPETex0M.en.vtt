00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
be produced in the skin as well we know

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.779 
be produced in the skin as well we know
that<00:00:27.060> with<00:00:27.390> aging<00:00:27.920> the<00:00:28.920> sculpture<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.400> skin

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
that with aging the sculpture the skin

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.749 
that with aging the sculpture the skin
decreases<00:00:30.230> the<00:00:31.230> content<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.769> collagen

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
decreases the content of collagen
