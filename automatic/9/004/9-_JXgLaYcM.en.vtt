00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
give it a stir and kind of see where

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.390 
give it a stir and kind of see where
we're<00:02:27.030> at<00:02:27.090> with<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:28.040> so<00:02:29.040> I'm<00:02:29.100> going<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.250> go

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
we're at with that so I'm going to go

00:02:29.400 --> 00:03:00.020 
we're at with that so I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:29.460> and<00:02:29.640> give<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.970> stir<00:02:58.880> so<00:02:59.880> that's

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
ahead and give that a stir so that's

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.080 
ahead and give that a stir so that's
what<00:03:00.180> we<00:03:00.300> have<00:03:00.480> so<00:03:00.780> far<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:01.790> think<00:03:02.790> I'm<00:03:02.910> going<00:03:03.030> to

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
what we have so far I think I'm going to

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.190 
what we have so far I think I'm going to
also<00:03:03.270> add<00:03:03.660> some<00:03:04.140> purple<00:03:04.740> moons<00:03:05.250> to<00:03:05.730> that<00:03:06.200> just

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
also add some purple moons to that just

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.930 
also add some purple moons to that just
because<00:03:07.380> it<00:03:07.500> is<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.650> Halloween<00:03:08.070> mix<00:03:08.460> I'm<00:03:08.820> not

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
because it is a Halloween mix I'm not

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:24.300 
because it is a Halloween mix I'm not
going<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.120> add<00:03:09.240> too<00:03:09.450> many

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.430 

and<00:03:25.310> I<00:03:25.640> think<00:03:25.879> that's<00:03:26.030> about<00:03:26.269> it<00:03:26.330> I'm<00:03:27.230> gonna

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
and I think that's about it I'm gonna

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.990 
and I think that's about it I'm gonna
add<00:03:28.989> another<00:03:29.989> half<00:03:30.319> tablespoon<00:03:31.099> of<00:03:31.459> the<00:03:31.760> fine

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
add another half tablespoon of the fine

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:47.830 
add another half tablespoon of the fine
glitter<00:03:33.489> because<00:03:34.489> it<00:03:34.700> is<00:03:34.849> really<00:03:35.120> chunky<00:03:46.840> so

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
glitter because it is really chunky so

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.509 
glitter because it is really chunky so
I'm<00:03:47.989> gonna<00:03:48.140> go<00:03:48.349> ahead<00:03:48.470> and<00:03:48.709> stop<00:03:48.950> there<00:03:49.190> I'm

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
I'm gonna go ahead and stop there I'm

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.580 
I'm gonna go ahead and stop there I'm
going<00:03:49.819> to<00:03:49.970> mix<00:03:50.209> up<00:03:50.360> some<00:03:50.420> with<00:03:50.870> acrylic<00:03:51.379> and

hi guys so I'm back all I did was I mix

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.550 
hi guys so I'm back all I did was I mix
some<00:04:00.680> of<00:04:00.950> the<00:04:01.040> mix<00:04:02.079> because<00:04:03.079> this<00:04:03.230> is<00:04:03.379> such<00:04:03.530> a

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
some of the mix because this is such a

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.729 
some of the mix because this is such a
chunky<00:04:03.890> mix<00:04:04.250> what<00:04:04.430> I<00:04:04.459> did<00:04:04.700> was<00:04:04.910> I<00:04:04.940> took<00:04:05.870> one

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
chunky mix what I did was I took one

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.819 
chunky mix what I did was I took one
part<00:04:07.159> of<00:04:07.459> the<00:04:07.609> mix<00:04:07.879> to<00:04:08.209> two<00:04:08.480> parts<00:04:08.870> acrylic<00:04:10.569> so

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
part of the mix to two parts acrylic so

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:13.720 
part of the mix to two parts acrylic so
but<00:04:12.829> that's<00:04:12.920> just<00:04:13.159> because<00:04:13.250> that's<00:04:13.459> a<00:04:13.609> really

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
but that's just because that's a really

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.569 
but that's just because that's a really
chunky<00:04:14.030> mix<00:04:14.650> and<00:04:15.650> it<00:04:15.769> just<00:04:15.950> makes<00:04:16.100> it<00:04:16.220> easier

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
chunky mix and it just makes it easier

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.370 
chunky mix and it just makes it easier
to<00:04:16.639> work<00:04:16.910> with<00:04:17.120> and<00:04:17.299> then<00:04:17.389> I<00:04:17.419> just<00:04:17.690> have<00:04:17.840> a<00:04:17.870> fake

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380
