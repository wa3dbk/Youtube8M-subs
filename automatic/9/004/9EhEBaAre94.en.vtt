I<00:01:08.140> just<00:01:08.860> shaped<00:01:09.160> the<00:01:09.310> shoe<00:01:09.550> a<00:01:09.580> little<00:01:09.850> bit

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
I just shaped the shoe a little bit

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.470 
I just shaped the shoe a little bit
before<00:01:10.630> we<00:01:11.020> do<00:01:11.620> the<00:01:11.770> soap<00:01:12.040> and<00:01:12.370> it's<00:01:12.910> important

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:13.480 
before we do the soap and it's important

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.830 
before we do the soap and it's important
in<00:01:13.690> a<00:01:13.750> soap<00:01:14.080> to<00:01:14.410> use<00:01:14.560> a<00:01:14.590> bag<00:01:15.000> with<00:01:16.000> the<00:01:16.150> top<00:01:16.420> seal

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
in a soap to use a bag with the top seal

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.260 
in a soap to use a bag with the top seal
because<00:01:17.530> it<00:01:17.830> is<00:01:17.980> the<00:01:18.190> gases<00:01:18.670> that<00:01:18.850> are<00:01:18.910> having

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
because it is the gases that are having
