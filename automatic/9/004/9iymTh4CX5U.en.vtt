00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.690 
case is not like a hard case like the
mixers<00:04:07.840> and<00:04:08.140> a<00:04:09.010> couple<00:04:09.250> of<00:04:09.400> their<00:04:09.549> headphones

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
mixers and a couple of their headphones

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.899 
mixers and a couple of their headphones
I<00:04:10.090> think<00:04:10.890> it's<00:04:11.890> a<00:04:11.980> soft<00:04:12.250> case<00:04:12.810> kind<00:04:13.810> of<00:04:13.959> i<00:04:14.909> don't

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:15.909 
I think it's a soft case kind of i don't

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:18.240 
I think it's a soft case kind of i don't
like<00:04:16.389> the<00:04:16.509> case<00:04:16.690> that<00:04:16.900> much<00:04:17.109> but<00:04:17.650> it<00:04:17.889> does<00:04:18.100> have

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
like the case that much but it does have

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.759 
like the case that much but it does have
a<00:04:18.340> nice<00:04:18.720> little<00:04:19.720> handle<00:04:19.959> right<00:04:20.289> here<00:04:20.320> i<00:04:20.530> guess

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
a nice little handle right here i guess

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.350 
a nice little handle right here i guess
for<00:04:20.889> portability<00:04:21.519> hold<00:04:21.789> it<00:04:21.970> so<00:04:22.120> you<00:04:22.210> don't

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
for portability hold it so you don't

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.100 
for portability hold it so you don't
drop<00:04:22.479> it<00:04:22.630> or<00:04:22.810> anything<00:04:22.960> like<00:04:23.110> that<00:04:23.880> um<00:04:25.110> all
