00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 good guys welcome to a new 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.500
 online gt5 video as you are watching 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.180
 we are here in the fourth episode of the 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.529
 series that I still do not know what name he 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.120
 I'm going to put in since I'm recording all 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.410
 the episodes followed by some guys 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.150
 of the case as this video we are in the 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.980
 fourth lesson of the flight school of 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.089
 san andreas that I honestly am 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.830
 recording all of followers had 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.869
 thought or record each episode a 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.859
 any day 'what happens is that you know 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.720
 shooting all the episodes in a row 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.490
 because I love the challenges 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.990
 it's super cool so good in this 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.150
 case we go with the fourth lesson which 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.380
 it's called landing in town and good 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.789
 Well basically the information that we 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.740
 is that we have to land a titan 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.510
 in the city in bad weather and as you see 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.739
 to go the thumbnail of the image you see the 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.239
 image of a titan entering a 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.440
 city ​​so good good I guess it will be 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.640
 the city of saints I do not know why 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.770
 I say a city in plan as if it were a 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.360
 any city, so no, well, let's go 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.579
 pummeling to see how to see if 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.570
 It's hard for us to meditate, we already know that 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.219
 previous times word that has 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.660
 cost quite a lot I think to see the 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.840
 first it took me a long time to make it 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.180
 second I do not remember what mission was 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.100
 here we have the mission we have type 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.260
 little apprentice has clear climate of 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.329
 first that's how I fly and 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.760
 disastrous time of dogs the kind of 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.580
 climate in which we send something logical like that 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.630
 why do they speak so badly 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.630
 I understand it to see 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.670
 basically the titan with very very bad 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.890
 time and they want to put two of my 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.240
 my mother skills here I swallow 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.370
 bad weather in plan I came active but 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.560
 not in plan with rays and everything gave to see 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.180
 good to the point of control 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.100
 all told is in the fifth 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.500
 heck I say but good we go there 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.500
 towards what he tells us he is already busy 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.080
 palladio took the samples and killed 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.400
 I really love looking for love are 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.979
 paid that is popping stock lift 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.190
 villegas goes to the track and runs 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.690
 the procedures tells me okay I think that 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.070
 I do not know, I do not think we have to get to 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.479
 the city of clover not the 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.220
 clover airport I do not believe the truth 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.340
 but guessed we are going to take here 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.570
 flying half hour but hey Now 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.920
 that I take a team that here did not put 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.660
 nothing that he was going to lose power and he 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.190
 I put ticketek and it's going to cost me and there 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.660
 I was right there is the airport 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.660
 the saints is that with so many 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.879
 abandon the landing on the runway and 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:16.159
 pose the plane where where 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:17.930
 I have the track is perfectly but 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:19.640
 you do not want to use them just at 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.319
 side of the wheel what cool 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.579
 abel or what the fuck is worth chick where 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.689
 with this they stay in the 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.689
 water with sand 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.629
 landing area sighted young me 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.760
 I almost see it with the lightning 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.750
 It is worth worth little by little 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.099
 we already know that we have to leave it 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.440
 right in the middle to give us the 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.340
 maximum score 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.220
 OK 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.790
 advancing advanced is advanced age not 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.069
 I coleslaw but audio is the star above 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.180
 of silver I shit on all uncle have for 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.230
 we repeat that we have to go for the one in 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.569
 gold as you already know all the missions 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.800
 gold princesses more line let's make the o 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.569
 it's cool because I did not expect 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.040
 so much of others really if I had if 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.569
 it would have been a drizzle in plan like this 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.160
 little girl had not been so cool but 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.900
 flat and against the hospital is very very 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.129
 but how cute he is when we can 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.750
 repeat the mission since we have had 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.459
 until already silver and improves a little bit what 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.890
 that are given a little bit before then 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.390
 As you can see, we are going for the gold medal 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.470
 we go there good to see if this load 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.790
 we are there looking at the sky of the 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.950
 Saints know in plan with a lot of 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.870
 stars to see this I'm 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.950
 mobile landing oh my god two days 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.840
 that the next one we have to use a 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.739
 helicopter in a putty in the 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.180
 next we have to use a 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.819
 helicopter on top of an uncle truck 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.200
 flipa we send with this episode that is 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.860
 what are we when we go to it and go 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.860
 there when this is not so 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:49.799
 to pick them up to pick up the bad weather 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.069
 will affect your ability to control the 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.749
 airplane 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.219
 going to the track I enjoy the 

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:56.769
 normal landings procedures 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:59.109
 percent you have little fuel 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.700
 little fuel is one thing and another thing 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.769
 is that it bursts and petes me one the 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.599
 birds and something else because I have little 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.330
 fuel but good let's give it 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.920
 little cane come 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.430
 I have a feeling that it's going to 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:14.220
 be perfection god calls him petalada 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.570
 perfect because I do not know what it will have to do 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.940
 that with the fuel when what 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.230
 it does is burst very bad but good 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.209
 let's go there come to this checkpoint 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.560
 for me and my god gave this storm not 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.860
 It is normal 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.360
 my mother 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.800
 voucher voucher 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.240
 target landings on the beach 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.250
 follow the procedures worth voucher 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.990
 remember was the typical movie like this 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.150
 that you see a military plane reaching the 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.129
 city ​​does not remind me of the walking dead 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.289
 pod there is a goal scene who does not 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:40.849
 worked world war will be that the 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:43.639
 movie tivo reminds me of that movie 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:45.590
 a movie in that movie is one of 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.090
 the best stories of zombies and good 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.919
 I say that many cases did not ask about 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.169
 another uncle for the art field agreement 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:52.430
 of movies are going for this do not attribute 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.599
 the ray eaten from behind the overtones of 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.960
 Cervantes 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:59.960
 vale vale varied territory is already worth vale 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.520
 we use the snow braking vale hold 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.610
 pretty good 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.080
 we advance advanced they are advanced not me 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.990
 I can believe it, I tend to play it 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.580
 you're out there, dude, I already shit on everything 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.779
 anti silver star for being by 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.300
 ahead and already the silver star by 

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:15.379
 Be behind twist that flay body or 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.400
 come on let's go for the last one to see what 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:17.539
 such because this one is clear I wanted 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.599
 get those since now braked 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:23.330
 too tocateros that mother and 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:24.770
 girl said massa had come let's go to 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.530
 to get it 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.610
 oh my god this happens to me of film by 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.039
 whatever we are going to repeat another 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.389
 I tell the movie world war z a 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.680
 movie that is beautiful the 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:34.520
 I recommend seeing all of you from 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.169
 walking the is also pretty 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.000
 quite there will relate to the 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:39.560
 zombies and such is very cool then 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 when, as I say, the world war 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.830
 z I really do not remember very well how 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.169
 I was going but the cool thing is the movie and the 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.520
 little point of that movie and that is that 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:48.680
 zombies are not the typical zombies that 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.210
 they are going super slow with a medium 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.979
 teacher lost the cetera but those 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.419
 zombies are going in plan running to the 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:55.250
 speed of a human being is very very 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:56.629
 but how nice is there an agenda like 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.599
 I say it was the one that mentioned this 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:01.759
 that was children and older than us 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:03.169
 invites concluding among themselves achieves the 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:05.180
 grain in gazette or the one of working of 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:07.370
 noguera world war z first results 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.620
 that they had to go to an aircraft carrier 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:12.199
 that was in the sea since it was all 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.430
 the city plastered with zombies and such and 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:14.900
 then there was a plane and they have 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.490
 that from wise to the aircraft carrier to 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.199
 disembark there people and children and we 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.969
 It was very cool because they had come a 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:23.629
 bunch of zombies and they had to close the 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:25.300
 good plane let's find if I take me 

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:27.870
 with the nonsense 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:32.190
 ok, careful 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:32.190
 a lot of free scenes are 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:41.530
 but of course it was day and suddenly it 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.330
 infiltrates a zombie they start to throw 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:46.360
 grenades inside the plane the cargo does not 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.160
 it's beautiful, let's concentrate, we have 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.350
 there the control point to land 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.350
 what's coming is on the plane 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:57.510
 It's worth, it's worth, it's worth, it 's like that 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:57.510
 that there we are going to land it as 

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:05.760
 box 

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:08.250
 and I'm training little by little 

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.330
 there we are, we are landing, we are going super 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.560
 fast let's go to operatives we 're going to
