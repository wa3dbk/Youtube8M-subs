a top word and two Center dividers
they're<00:01:16.189> all<00:01:16.310> gonna<00:01:16.430> be<00:01:16.610> made<00:01:16.759> out<00:01:16.909> of<00:01:17.290> 3/4

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
they're all gonna be made out of 3/4

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.080 
they're all gonna be made out of 3/4
inch<00:01:18.439> thick<00:01:18.500> poplar<00:01:19.369> cuz<00:01:19.579> it's<00:01:19.729> paint<00:01:19.909> grade

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
inch thick poplar cuz it's paint grade

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
so you can see the two ways the two bees

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.410 
so you can see the two ways the two bees
and<00:01:21.649> the<00:01:21.710> two<00:01:21.829> c''s<00:01:22.040> the<00:01:22.579> A's<00:01:22.729> and<00:01:22.759> the<00:01:22.969> C's<00:01:23.149> or

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
and the two c''s the A's and the C's or

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.249 
and the two c''s the A's and the C's or
an<00:01:23.479> inch<00:01:23.570> and<00:01:23.689> a<00:01:23.719> half<00:01:23.780> wide

an inch and a half wide

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.740 
an inch and a half wide
the<00:01:24.649> bees<00:01:24.979> are<00:01:25.039> two<00:01:25.520> inches<00:01:25.759> wide<00:01:25.939> okay<00:01:26.689> so

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
the bees are two inches wide okay so

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.899 
the bees are two inches wide okay so
let's<00:01:27.110> take<00:01:27.350> the<00:01:27.530> 2a<00:01:27.710> boards<00:01:28.130> here<00:01:28.430> and<00:01:28.579> this

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
let's take the 2a boards here and this

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.639 
let's take the 2a boards here and this
is<00:01:29.060> how<00:01:29.149> I'm<00:01:29.210> gonna<00:01:29.299> cut<00:01:29.570> all<00:01:29.780> my<00:01:30.200> boards<00:01:30.469> to

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
is how I'm gonna cut all my boards to

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.160 
is how I'm gonna cut all my boards to
length<00:01:30.680> okay<00:01:31.520> I'm<00:01:31.820> gonna<00:01:32.270> stack<00:01:32.990> them

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
length okay I'm gonna stack them

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.630 
length okay I'm gonna stack them
together<00:01:33.259> I'm<00:01:33.710> gonna<00:01:34.039> clamp<00:01:34.369> them<00:01:34.520> together

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
together I'm gonna clamp them together

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.310 
together I'm gonna clamp them together
and<00:01:34.939> then<00:01:35.060> I'm<00:01:35.149> gonna<00:01:35.240> cut<00:01:35.750> them<00:01:35.869> to<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.020> same

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
and then I'm gonna cut them to the same

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.130 
and then I'm gonna cut them to the same
length<00:01:36.590> so<00:01:37.159> by<00:01:37.460> cutting<00:01:37.759> aids<00:01:38.479> together<00:01:38.990> and

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
length so by cutting aids together and

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.300 
length so by cutting aids together and
the<00:01:39.200> bees<00:01:39.380> together<00:01:39.649> and<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:39.829> C's<00:01:40.009> together

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
the bees together and the C's together

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.639 
the bees together and the C's together
at<00:01:40.430> the<00:01:40.490> same<00:01:40.640> time<00:01:40.909> I'm<00:01:41.210> ensuring<00:01:42.109> both<00:01:42.439> those

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
at the same time I'm ensuring both those

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.770 
at the same time I'm ensuring both those
boards<00:01:42.950> the<00:01:43.130> same<00:01:43.340> length<00:01:43.670> okay<00:01:44.299> so<00:01:44.359> then

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
boards the same length okay so then

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.080 
boards the same length okay so then
we'll<00:01:44.930> we<00:01:45.170> know<00:01:45.500> it's<00:01:46.250> better<00:01:46.430> than<00:01:46.640> measuring

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
we'll we know it's better than measuring

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.270 
we'll we know it's better than measuring
it<00:01:47.359> marking<00:01:47.750> it<00:01:47.899> and<00:01:48.079> then<00:01:48.259> then<00:01:48.920> doing<00:01:49.100> the

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
it marking it and then then doing the

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.740 
it marking it and then then doing the
next<00:01:49.460> board<00:01:49.670> cutting<00:01:50.119> them<00:01:50.270> together<00:01:50.359> works

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
next board cutting them together works

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.510 
next board cutting them together works
great<00:01:51.049> so<00:01:51.500> I'm<00:01:51.590> taking<00:01:51.799> these<00:01:52.039> two<00:01:52.219> clamp

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
great so I'm taking these two clamp

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.700 
great so I'm taking these two clamp
pieces<00:01:53.090> of<00:01:53.179> poplar<00:01:53.509> and<00:01:54.020> I'm<00:01:54.140> squaring<00:01:54.530> off

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
pieces of poplar and I'm squaring off

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.529 
pieces of poplar and I'm squaring off
one<00:01:54.920> of<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:55.070> ends<00:01:55.250> now<00:01:55.820> these<00:01:55.969> boards<00:01:56.240> are

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
one of the ends now these boards are

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:58.330 
one of the ends now these boards are
longer<00:01:57.200> than<00:01:57.320> I<00:01:57.409> need<00:01:57.560> them<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:57.799> be<00:01:57.890> for<00:01:58.219> this

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
longer than I need them to be for this

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.029 
longer than I need them to be for this
for<00:01:58.640> this<00:01:58.700> first<00:01:58.939> go<00:01:59.119> around<00:01:59.359> here<00:01:59.829> I'm<00:02:00.829> going

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
for this first go around here I'm going

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:02.499 
for this first go around here I'm going
to<00:02:01.159> square<00:02:01.490> off<00:02:01.609> one<00:02:01.759> of<00:02:01.789> these<00:02:01.880> with<00:02:02.359> the

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
to square off one of these with the

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.529 
to square off one of these with the
miter<00:02:03.109> saw<00:02:03.320> I'm<00:02:03.799> gonna<00:02:04.009> turn<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:04.609> the<00:02:04.640> stack

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
miter saw I'm gonna turn the the stack

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.090 
miter saw I'm gonna turn the the stack
wood<00:02:05.810> around<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:06.289> then<00:02:06.679> I'm<00:02:06.740> going<00:02:06.859> to<00:02:06.890> mark

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
wood around and then I'm going to mark

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.950 
wood around and then I'm going to mark
it<00:02:07.219> from<00:02:07.369> my<00:02:07.460> final<00:02:07.789> length<00:02:07.969> so<00:02:08.570> now<00:02:08.750> I<00:02:08.780> know

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
it from my final length so now I know

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.500 
it from my final length so now I know
those<00:02:09.289> two<00:02:09.320> boards<00:02:09.920> are<00:02:10.240> identical<00:02:11.240> in<00:02:11.330> length

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
those two boards are identical in length

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.210 
those two boards are identical in length
and<00:02:11.870> that's<00:02:12.110> I<00:02:12.410> think<00:02:12.560> that's<00:02:12.950> gonna<00:02:13.070> help

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
and that's I think that's gonna help

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.220 
and that's I think that's gonna help
with<00:02:13.400> our<00:02:13.610> finish<00:02:13.910> quality<00:02:14.090> we<00:02:14.780> won't<00:02:14.990> be<00:02:15.080> off

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
with our finish quality we won't be off

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.690 
with our finish quality we won't be off
here<00:02:15.560> or<00:02:15.680> there<00:02:15.920> there<00:02:16.340> won't<00:02:16.520> be<00:02:16.580> any

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
here or there there won't be any

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.449 
here or there there won't be any
mismatch<00:02:17.150> so<00:02:17.510> that<00:02:18.440> that's<00:02:18.680> a<00:02:18.800> big<00:02:18.950> help<00:02:19.129> I'm

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
mismatch so that that's a big help I'm

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:20.920 
mismatch so that that's a big help I'm
gonna<00:02:19.730> provide<00:02:19.970> plans<00:02:20.300> for<00:02:20.480> all<00:02:20.540> this<00:02:20.659> so<00:02:20.840> in

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
though it's a hardwood it's kind of a

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.030 
though it's a hardwood it's kind of a
soft<00:06:01.510> or<00:06:01.720> hardwood<00:06:02.080> so<00:06:02.410> I<00:06:02.440> think<00:06:02.680> you<00:06:02.890> can

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.040 
soft or hardwood so I think you can

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.290 
soft or hardwood so I think you can
really<00:06:03.250> use<00:06:03.400> either<00:06:03.580> for<00:06:03.910> this<00:06:04.000> but<00:06:04.180> in<00:06:04.270> case

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
really use either for this but in case

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.370 
really use either for this but in case
you're<00:06:04.540> wondering<00:06:04.630> it<00:06:04.930> I<00:06:04.990> think<00:06:05.170> they're<00:06:05.290> just

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
you're wondering it I think they're just

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.700 
you're wondering it I think they're just
regular<00:06:05.590> engine<00:06:06.430> to<00:06:06.520> quarter<00:06:06.850> core<00:06:07.690> screws<00:06:07.960> so

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
regular engine to quarter core screws so

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.110 
regular engine to quarter core screws so
let's<00:06:08.980> let<00:06:09.250> me<00:06:09.310> show<00:06:09.430> you<00:06:09.490> with<00:06:09.580> how<00:06:09.820> I<00:06:09.850> do<00:06:10.000> the

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
let's let me show you with how I do the

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.870 
let's let me show you with how I do the
center<00:06:10.480> boards<00:06:10.870> so<00:06:11.830> the<00:06:11.980> center<00:06:12.310> boards<00:06:12.670> I

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
center boards so the center boards I

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.320 
center boards so the center boards I
marked<00:06:13.600> in<00:06:13.810> on<00:06:14.800> that<00:06:14.980> top<00:06:15.190> board<00:06:15.460> there<00:06:15.760> where

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
marked in on that top board there where

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:17.790 
marked in on that top board there where
it<00:06:16.420> needs<00:06:16.570> to<00:06:16.660> be<00:06:16.720> and<00:06:17.020> I<00:06:17.080> also<00:06:17.110> put<00:06:17.440> a<00:06:17.470> line<00:06:17.770> in

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
it needs to be and I also put a line in

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.700 
it needs to be and I also put a line in
the<00:06:17.980> middle<00:06:18.130> of<00:06:18.400> where<00:06:18.550> that<00:06:19.170> middle<00:06:20.170> that<00:06:20.440> C

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
the middle of where that middle that C

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.080 
the middle of where that middle that C
board<00:06:20.950> there<00:06:21.220> so<00:06:21.400> I<00:06:21.460> know<00:06:21.550> where<00:06:21.730> the<00:06:21.790> center

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
board there so I know where the center

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.880 
board there so I know where the center
of<00:06:22.180> it<00:06:22.270> is<00:06:22.360> all<00:06:22.630> right<00:06:22.690> so<00:06:22.960> I'm<00:06:23.650> just<00:06:23.770> gonna

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:23.890 
of it is all right so I'm just gonna

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.710 
of it is all right so I'm just gonna
line<00:06:24.160> mark<00:06:24.490> the<00:06:24.580> line<00:06:24.850> those<00:06:25.030> two<00:06:25.060> lines<00:06:25.510> up

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 
line mark the line those two lines up

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.600 
line mark the line those two lines up
together<00:06:25.840> and<00:06:26.230> clamp<00:06:26.620> them<00:06:26.710> down<00:06:26.770> and<00:06:27.190> screw

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
together and clamp them down and screw

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.000 
together and clamp them down and screw
them<00:06:27.670> together<00:06:27.790> so<00:06:28.480> that's<00:06:28.780> really<00:06:29.770> pretty

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.010 
them together so that's really pretty

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.190 
them together so that's really pretty
basic<00:06:30.280> there<00:06:30.670> so<00:06:30.880> I<00:06:30.940> did<00:06:31.570> that<00:06:31.690> for<00:06:31.750> both<00:06:32.050> of

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:32.200 
basic there so I did that for both of

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.290 
basic there so I did that for both of
those<00:06:32.290> boards<00:06:32.650> both<00:06:33.280> C<00:06:33.760> boards

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300 
those boards both C boards

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.390 
those boards both C boards
and<00:06:34.690> like<00:06:34.990> I<00:06:35.080> said<00:06:35.260> now<00:06:35.380> after<00:06:35.980> this<00:06:36.070> I'll<00:06:36.280> do

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 
and like I said now after this I'll do

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.370 
and like I said now after this I'll do
my<00:06:36.520> bottom<00:06:36.880> board<00:06:37.090> but<00:06:37.720> that's<00:06:37.900> really<00:06:38.110> it

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:38.380 
my bottom board but that's really it

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.930 
my bottom board but that's really it
that's<00:06:38.620> all<00:06:38.890> there<00:06:39.160> is<00:06:39.190> to<00:06:39.400> this<00:06:39.520> face<00:06:39.730> frame

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:39.940 
that's all there is to this face frame

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.820 
that's all there is to this face frame
construction<00:06:40.210> okay<00:06:41.080> you<00:06:41.140> can<00:06:41.380> see<00:06:41.560> this<00:06:41.680> is

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:41.830 
construction okay you can see this is

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.880 
construction okay you can see this is
the<00:06:41.920> front<00:06:42.160> view<00:06:42.220> of<00:06:42.550> it<00:06:43.770> went<00:06:44.770> together

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:44.890 
the front view of it went together

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.219 
the front view of it went together
really<00:06:45.370> easy<00:06:45.550> okay<00:06:46.419> here's<00:06:46.630> the<00:06:46.750> backside<00:06:47.080> you

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:47.229 
really easy okay here's the backside you

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:48.270 
really easy okay here's the backside you
can<00:06:47.290> see<00:06:47.500> the<00:06:47.650> part<00:06:47.830> where<00:06:47.919> the<00:06:48.010> pocket

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 
can see the part where the pocket

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.500 
can see the part where the pocket
schools<00:06:48.490> were<00:06:48.580> located<00:06:48.970> again<00:06:49.120> those<00:06:49.330> side

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:49.510 
schools were located again those side

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:50.480 
schools were located again those side
boards<00:06:49.780> you<00:06:49.840> see<00:06:49.960> they<00:06:50.080> don't<00:06:50.229> have

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:50.490 
boards you see they don't have

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.550 
boards you see they don't have
since<00:06:50.970> the<00:06:51.180> top<00:06:51.389> bottom<00:06:51.870> and<00:06:52.080> this<00:06:52.199> in<00:06:52.470> the

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 
since the top bottom and this in the

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.290 
since the top bottom and this in the
middle<00:06:52.740> pieces<00:06:52.979> and<00:06:53.340> that's<00:06:53.490> it<00:06:53.639> so<00:06:54.180> that's

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:54.300 
middle pieces and that's it so that's
