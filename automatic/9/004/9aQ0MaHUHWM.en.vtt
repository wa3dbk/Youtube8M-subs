explanation of this organ this is a wix

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.580 
explanation of this organ this is a wix
organ<00:00:08.250> here<00:00:08.610> and<00:00:08.820> it's<00:00:09.059> in<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.660> church<00:00:10.080> prior

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
organ here and it's in the church prior

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.030 
organ here and it's in the church prior
to<00:00:11.040> us<00:00:11.219> disassembly<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.210> instrument<00:00:12.719> this

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040 
to us disassembly the instrument this

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.369 
to us disassembly the instrument this
area<00:00:14.040> which<00:00:14.280> we<00:00:14.549> are<00:00:14.670> in<00:00:14.820> right<00:00:15.030> now<00:00:15.089> is<00:00:15.660> the

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
area which we are in right now is the

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.890 
area which we are in right now is the
swell<00:00:16.740> because<00:00:17.100> your<00:00:17.340> unified<00:00:17.789> rank<00:00:18.240> so<00:00:18.810> you

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
swell because your unified rank so you

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.080 
swell because your unified rank so you
can<00:00:19.140> get<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.289> 16-8<00:00:20.090> 42<00:00:21.090> foot<00:00:21.330> out<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.630> this<00:00:23.090> next

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
can get a 16-8 42 foot out of this next

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.230 
can get a 16-8 42 foot out of this next
to<00:00:24.240> this<00:00:24.590> we<00:00:25.590> look<00:00:25.769> over<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.340> connecting<00:00:29.240> well

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
to this we look over the connecting well

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.060 
to this we look over the connecting well
coming<00:00:30.480> back<00:00:30.750> let's<00:00:31.080> look<00:00:31.230> at<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.439> deck<00:00:31.679> rank

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
coming back let's look at the deck rank

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.170 
coming back let's look at the deck rank
and<00:00:32.430> we<00:00:32.610> can<00:00:32.790> see<00:00:33.149> what<00:00:33.920> it<00:00:34.920> looks<00:00:35.130> like<00:00:35.610> I'm

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
and we can see what it looks like I'm

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.840 
and we can see what it looks like I'm
going<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.480> see<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.870> pipes<00:00:37.140> are<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.950> very<00:00:38.550> good

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
going to see the pipes are in very good

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.369 
going to see the pipes are in very good
condition<00:00:41.120> this<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.239> an<00:00:42.329> example<00:00:42.600> one<00:00:42.930> random

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
condition this is an example one random

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.350 
condition this is an example one random
picked<00:00:43.950> pipe<00:00:45.289> the<00:00:46.289> stoppers<00:00:46.860> are<00:00:47.070> very<00:00:47.879> tight

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
picked pipe the stoppers are very tight

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.610 
picked pipe the stoppers are very tight
so<00:00:49.079> these<00:00:49.590> pipes<00:00:49.890> are<00:00:50.420> in<00:00:51.420> good<00:00:51.690> tuning

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
so these pipes are in good tuning

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.389 
so these pipes are in good tuning
stability<00:00:55.670> so<00:00:56.670> they<00:00:56.820> are<00:00:57.030> snug<00:00:58.399> probably

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
stability so they are snug probably

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.010 
stability so they are snug probably
don't<00:00:59.520> have<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.730> worry<00:01:00.030> about<00:01:00.090> packing<00:01:00.600> too

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
don't have to worry about packing too

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.070 
don't have to worry about packing too
many<00:01:01.199> pipes<00:01:01.550> the<00:01:02.550> next<00:01:02.910> rank<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.390> pipes<00:01:03.629> you

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
many pipes the next rank of pipes you

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.719 
many pipes the next rank of pipes you
can<00:01:04.229> see<00:01:04.439> here<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.400> solution

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
can see here this is the solution

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.840 
can see here this is the solution

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
already at the pipes the pipes are of

already at the pipes the pipes are of

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.510 

now<00:03:25.900> we're<00:03:26.170> in<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:26.500> great<00:03:26.710> division<00:03:27.250> of<00:03:27.370> this

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
now we're in the great division of this

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.540 
now we're in the great division of this
wicks<00:03:27.790> pipe<00:03:28.330> organ<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.050> in<00:03:29.980> this<00:03:30.100> great

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
wicks pipe organ and in this great

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.000 
wicks pipe organ and in this great
division<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.750> components<00:03:32.230> that<00:03:32.290> are<00:03:32.410> in<00:03:32.710> here

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
division the components that are in here

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:41.970 
division the components that are in here
is<00:03:34.170> two<00:03:35.640> chests<00:03:36.640> two<00:03:36.940> large<00:03:37.240> chests<00:03:40.740> and<00:03:41.740> then

is two chests two large chests and then
a<00:03:42.010> series<00:03:42.610> of<00:03:42.820> offset<00:03:43.510> chests<00:03:43.990> there's<00:03:44.200> one

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
a series of offset chests there's one

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.070 
a series of offset chests there's one
offset<00:03:45.040> just<00:03:45.310> hear<00:03:45.700> another<00:03:46.480> one<00:03:46.690> in<00:03:46.810> the<00:03:46.870> back

offset just hear another one in the back

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.410 
offset just hear another one in the back
to<00:03:48.930> another<00:03:49.930> one<00:03:50.200> with<00:03:50.350> these<00:03:50.560> pipes<00:03:51.030> is<00:03:52.030> three

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
to another one with these pipes is three

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.740 
to another one with these pipes is three
offset<00:03:52.870> chests<00:03:53.610> there<00:03:54.610> is<00:03:56.250> two<00:03:57.250> bellows

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
offset chests there is two bellows

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:09.840 
offset chests there is two bellows
bellows<00:03:58.750> here<00:04:06.540> and<00:04:07.540> a<00:04:08.440> blower<00:04:08.710> motor<00:04:09.130> if<00:04:09.670> I

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.580 
course but if we open this lid we can
see<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:21.310> blower<00:04:21.580> motor<00:04:22.050> it's<00:04:23.050> a<00:04:23.230> mightier

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
see the blower motor it's a mightier

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.920 
see the blower motor it's a mightier
blower<00:04:24.460> motor<00:04:24.820> and<00:04:25.500> since<00:04:26.500> this<00:04:26.770> is<00:04:26.830> on

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
blower motor and since this is on

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.000 
blower motor and since this is on
individual<00:04:30.210> locations<00:04:31.410> there<00:04:32.410> is<00:04:32.620> a<00:04:32.650> blower

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
individual locations there is a blower

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.730 
individual locations there is a blower
motor<00:04:33.340> in<00:04:34.180> the<00:04:34.360> swell<00:04:34.630> division<00:04:35.110> and<00:04:35.350> in<00:04:35.620> the

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
motor in the swell division and in the

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.909 
motor in the swell division and in the
grid<00:04:35.950> when<00:04:36.280> we<00:04:36.370> look<00:04:36.580> on<00:04:36.700> these<00:04:36.910> wind<00:04:37.210> chest<00:04:37.919> we

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
grid when we look on these wind chest we

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.620 
grid when we look on these wind chest we
will<00:04:39.040> see<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.430> following<00:04:39.460> sets<00:04:40.270> of<00:04:40.450> pipes
