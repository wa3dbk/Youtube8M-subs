this<00:01:03.629> our<00:01:04.019> press<00:01:04.739> machine<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.250> little<00:01:05.450> dated

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
this our press machine is a little dated

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.929 
this our press machine is a little dated
so<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.860> didn't<00:01:08.040> work<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.189> we<00:01:08.400> sent<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.700> soft

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
so it didn't work so we sent the soft

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.300 
so it didn't work so we sent the soft

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
different ways to try in restorations

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.279 
different ways to try in restorations

these<00:01:59.580> are<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.880> classic<00:02:00.569> things<00:02:00.780> but<00:02:01.470> also

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
these are the classic things but also

how does the soft tissue affect the

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020

tissue and the Pontic of your

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:09.820 
tissue and the Pontic of your
restoration<00:02:08.880> now<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.209> can<00:02:09.330> see<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.660> this

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
restoration now you can see that this

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.340 
restoration now you can see that this
Pontic<00:02:11.330> we're<00:02:12.330> going<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.690> have<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:13.019> adjust

Pontic we're going to have to adjust
this<00:02:13.640> more<00:02:14.640> possibly<00:02:15.090> interwar<00:02:15.420> Lee<00:02:15.569> maybe

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
this more possibly interwar Lee maybe

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.330 
this more possibly interwar Lee maybe
make<00:02:15.959> it<00:02:15.989> more<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.350> little<00:02:16.709> more<00:02:16.830> round<00:02:17.100> and

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
make it more a little more round and

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.910 
make it more a little more round and
I'll<00:02:17.519> to<00:02:17.670> check<00:02:17.910> this<00:02:18.030> little<00:02:18.239> sharp<00:02:18.540> edge

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
I'll to check this little sharp edge

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.729 
I'll to check this little sharp edge

however<00:02:23.459> what<00:02:23.730> dr.<00:02:24.060> K<00:02:24.239> does<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.480> mean

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
however what dr. K does I mean

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.330 
however what dr. K does I mean
essentially<00:02:25.049> just<00:02:25.650> like<00:02:25.799> any<00:02:25.950> other<00:02:26.099> his

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
essentially just like any other his

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.170 
essentially just like any other his
techniques<00:02:26.819> just<00:02:27.030> takes<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.739> wets<00:02:28.820> the<00:02:29.820> ackee

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
techniques just takes the wets the ackee

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.410 
techniques just takes the wets the ackee
film<00:02:30.390> initially<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:31.350> then<00:02:31.500> places<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:32.090> on<00:02:33.090> the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
film initially and then places it on the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.500 
film initially and then places it on the
FTP<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.650> suits<00:02:35.609> it

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.440 

and<00:02:39.050> what<00:02:39.260> this<00:02:39.409> does<00:02:39.650> is<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:40.700> obviously<00:02:41.360> this

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
and what this does is and obviously this

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.649 
and what this does is and obviously this
is<00:02:41.599> gonna<00:02:41.750> fit<00:02:42.019> on<00:02:42.230> my<00:02:42.440> solid<00:02:43.420> but<00:02:44.420> intro

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:44.659 
is gonna fit on my solid but intro

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:46.509 
is gonna fit on my solid but intro
orally<00:02:45.019> the<00:02:45.049> self<00:02:45.470> tissue<00:02:45.650> may<00:02:45.830> actually<00:02:46.010> be

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
orally the self tissue may actually be

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.339 
orally the self tissue may actually be
binding<00:02:46.909> so<00:02:47.510> this<00:02:47.659> will<00:02:47.810> give<00:02:47.930> you<00:02:48.049> not<00:02:48.200> only

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
binding so this will give you not only

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.580 
binding so this will give you not only
the<00:02:48.670> places<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.930> little<00:02:50.930> spots<00:02:51.260> really

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590

surfaces of the Pontic sand that way you

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.009 
surfaces of the Pontic sand that way you
can<00:03:00.620> adjust<00:03:00.970> appropriately<00:03:01.970> and<00:03:02.810> it's<00:03:02.930> a

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
can adjust appropriately and it's a

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.920 
can adjust appropriately and it's a
clean<00:03:03.410> fairly<00:03:03.950> easy<00:03:04.730> non<00:03:05.060> messy<00:03:05.480> technique

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
clean fairly easy non messy technique

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.110 
clean fairly easy non messy technique
that<00:03:06.739> it<00:03:06.829> will<00:03:06.920> also<00:03:07.069> additionally<00:03:07.760> give<00:03:07.940> you

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
that it will also additionally give you

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.280 
that it will also additionally give you
some<00:03:08.840> of<00:03:08.989> the<00:03:09.430> interproximal<00:03:10.430> regions<00:03:10.970> now

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
some of the interproximal regions now

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.289 
some of the interproximal regions now
this<00:03:12.290> is<00:03:12.489> marking<00:03:13.489> fairly<00:03:13.790> well<00:03:13.940> but<00:03:14.150> when

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
this is marking fairly well but when

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:15.880 
this is marking fairly well but when
this<00:03:14.420> gets<00:03:14.629> wet<00:03:14.930> it's<00:03:15.170> difficult<00:03:15.560> to<00:03:15.650> see<00:03:15.860> so

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
this gets wet it's difficult to see so

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.589 
this gets wet it's difficult to see so
another<00:03:16.579> trick<00:03:16.879> that<00:03:16.910> I<00:03:17.060> was<00:03:17.209> taught<00:03:17.390> a<00:03:17.420> long

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
another trick that I was taught a long

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.780 
another trick that I was taught a long
time<00:03:17.810> ago<00:03:17.989> was<00:03:18.079> using<00:03:18.349> Vaseline<00:03:18.890> on<00:03:19.129> these

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
time ago was using Vaseline on these

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.319 
time ago was using Vaseline on these
fresh<00:03:20.329> ceramic<00:03:20.780> surfaces<00:03:21.260> just<00:03:21.290> to<00:03:22.030> help<00:03:23.030> mark

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
fresh ceramic surfaces just to help mark

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.979 
fresh ceramic surfaces just to help mark
it's<00:03:23.540> amazing<00:03:23.870> how<00:03:24.019> using<00:03:24.650> vaseline<00:03:25.129> or<00:03:25.340> even

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
it's amazing how using vaseline or even

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.990 
it's amazing how using vaseline or even
resin<00:03:26.989> try<00:03:27.410> and<00:03:27.620> paste<00:03:27.859> just<00:03:28.609> something<00:03:28.970> that

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
resin try and paste just something that

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.140 
resin try and paste just something that
will<00:03:29.209> give<00:03:29.569> it<00:03:29.599> a<00:03:29.690> little<00:03:29.780> bit<00:03:29.959> of<00:03:30.049> friction<00:03:31.150> to

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
will give it a little bit of friction to

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.599 
will give it a little bit of friction to
allow<00:03:32.269> the<00:03:32.329> articulating<00:03:32.959> paper<00:03:33.140> to<00:03:33.489> mark<00:03:34.489> the

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
allow the articulating paper to mark the

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.550 
allow the articulating paper to mark the
restorations

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.209 

I<00:03:38.620> hope<00:03:39.250> that<00:03:39.430> helps<00:03:39.670> Cheers
