00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.530
 we have 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.150
 Advance 3 biological weapons truly destroy everything. required name that 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.679
 they could destroy one on this planet but also the sun 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.710
 in the solar system 20,000 euros tweets because we have these things 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.710
 what are they for? 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.409
 &amp; gt that fucking weapons of mass destruction 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:32.349
 away there is only one final goal in life there are two paths that can 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.730
 afford to reach it on the finish line and do perfection 

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:36.730
 satisfaction 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.989
 we cannot reach this goal and it is modest if slowly 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.770
 through the path of suffering or more quickly and pleasantly 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.510
 through producing transformation the suffering guided path is not 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.210
 its true path is all the episodes of life in the system of the 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.610
 excuses that happen to us because we are not consciously involved in ours 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:56.389
 development 

00:00:56.389 --> 00:01:00.629
 slow painful strenuous development we call history that starts somewhere 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.109
 part I can't say where 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:04.750
 and that he is bringing us only god knows where 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.470
 path. light of transformation and the path through which 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.660
 we discover our nature and openness of the strength that guides us we perceive of 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.890
 what is it all about and where are we going yes we start feeling like a 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.550
 taken from this path and finally we start chasing down the path 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.040
 of suffering we are pushed from behind through physical events of the 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.720
 companies that push us to have enough of this suffering and therefore 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.320
 we unconsciously decide to make those small inner changes that we do 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.770
 make fashion forward 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.410
 since we are not like the force of development Lazio we are resisting that 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.670
 we thus experience suffering 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.270
 ok the path of suffering in essence devolution of humor 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.800
 through the millennia if he told me that we continued to devise always 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.820
 We have new systems to enjoy nature that looked like sachets 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.780
 made high hopes and the future in the next generation will blend there will be 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.149
 greater well-being we will all live as if we could cross the sea 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.150
 we'll find out what thigh we could go into space to see right now 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.960
 what's out there we will reach personal political freedoms we can 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.670
 build machines that will do our job taxing all the time 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.809
 it seems that the opposite has occurred 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:17.590
 we are not having fun we have reached a point of complete nation and 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:18.969
 from each other 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:23.180
 so weapons of mass destruction are only a material indication of sa 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.189
 that occurs on the path of suffering because the echo 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:30.439
 asur 4 up weight conclusive form how we can progress in this way we are 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:35.139
 in a stagnant position in all areas of human development because I live 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:37.079
 in one it cannot keep us going 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.889
 we begin to need something completely different 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:44.980
 it is the first appearance of the spiritual need of humanity none 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:47.979
 together kaspersky 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:51.969
 tame humanity in its completeness of volver hours 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:55.849
 awards using in a way that people deeper the principle of 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.849
 nature 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.849
 to me word along light path called the route of the stage 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.669
 we can go on using us as if we were driven by a wave to choose 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:11.140
 to live within us every subsequent phase 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.059
 because there is no need for some painful physical drive 

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:16.299
 beautician 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:17.620
 let's put this back where it came from
