okay<00:00:07.140> this<00:00:07.470> is<00:00:07.680> Pam<00:00:07.980> Goodrich<00:00:08.580> and<00:00:08.880> she<00:00:09.210> is

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
okay this is Pam Goodrich and she is

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.350 
okay this is Pam Goodrich and she is
gonna<00:00:09.480> show<00:00:09.809> us<00:00:10.019> how<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.380> fit<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.340> double<00:00:11.700> bridle

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
gonna show us how to fit a double bridle

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.049 
gonna show us how to fit a double bridle
on<00:00:12.540> Victorious<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:14.340> important<00:00:14.759> things<00:00:14.940> about

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
on Victorious the important things about

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.540 
on Victorious the important things about
I<00:00:15.240> guess<00:00:15.509> it's<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.750> double<00:00:16.020> bridle<00:00:16.410> when<00:00:16.830> the

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
I guess it's a double bridle when the

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.779 
I guess it's a double bridle when the
snaffle<00:00:18.150> should<00:00:18.720> be<00:00:19.130> on<00:00:20.130> top<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.580> curve

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
snaffle should be on top of the curve

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.630 
snaffle should be on top of the curve
and<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.240> bits<00:00:21.510> should<00:00:21.960> be<00:00:22.199> separate<00:00:22.680> in<00:00:22.890> the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
and the bits should be separate in the

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.150 
and the bits should be separate in the
horse's<00:00:24.000> mouth<00:00:26.300> the<00:00:27.300> front<00:00:27.650> there<00:00:28.650> should<00:00:28.949> be

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
horse's mouth the front there should be

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.330 
horse's mouth the front there should be
a<00:00:29.189> space<00:00:30.170> there<00:00:31.170> are<00:00:31.199> horses<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:31.890> have<00:00:32.040> very

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
a space there are horses that have very

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.700 
a space there are horses that have very
short<00:00:32.759> mouths<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.840> then<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.320> bits<00:00:34.530> have<00:00:34.680> to

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
short mouths and then the bits have to

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.620 
short mouths and then the bits have to
be<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.950> little<00:00:35.130> bit<00:00:35.370> closer<00:00:35.610> together<00:00:35.940> just<00:00:36.480> in

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
be a little bit closer together just in

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.910 
be a little bit closer together just in
order<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.140> make<00:00:37.290> sure<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.710> curve

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
order to make sure that the curve

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.660 
order to make sure that the curve
doesn't<00:00:38.370> lay<00:00:38.940> on<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.480> touch<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:40.640> curb<00:00:41.640> chain

doesn't lay on the touch the curb chain

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.200 
doesn't lay on the touch the curb chain
should<00:00:42.210> lie<00:00:42.390> flat<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:44.070> angle<00:00:44.579> when<00:00:45.090> it

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
should lie flat and the angle when it

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.600 
should lie flat and the angle when it
comes<00:00:45.420> into<00:00:45.629> contact<00:00:45.870> should<00:00:46.350> be<00:00:46.410> 45<00:00:46.890> degrees

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610

comes into contact should be 45 degrees
here<00:00:49.160> that<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.280> adjustable<00:00:50.820> if<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.000> have<00:00:51.149> a

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
here that is adjustable if you have a

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.510 
here that is adjustable if you have a
horse<00:00:51.480> that's<00:00:51.660> really<00:00:52.320> sensitive<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:53.280> might

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
horse that's really sensitive you might

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.920 
horse that's really sensitive you might
add<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> little<00:00:53.969> more<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.510> there's<00:00:54.809> not

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
add a little more so that there's not

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.689 
add a little more so that there's not
too<00:00:55.140> much<00:00:55.260> curve<00:00:55.530> affect<00:00:55.860> if<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.520> have<00:00:56.670> a

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
too much curve affect if you have a

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.760 
too much curve affect if you have a
horse<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.210> needs<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.199> little<00:00:58.350> more<00:00:58.530> curve

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
horse that needs a little more curve

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.700 
horse that needs a little more curve
affect<00:00:59.160> slightly<00:00:59.640> tighter<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.210> okay<00:01:00.570> but<00:01:01.469> this

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
affect slightly tighter is okay but this

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.500 
affect slightly tighter is okay but this
is<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.600> generic<00:01:04.400> adjustment<00:01:05.510> noseband

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
is the generic adjustment noseband

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.750 
is the generic adjustment noseband
should<00:01:07.200> be<00:01:07.320> under<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.740> cheek<00:01:08.010> but<00:01:08.580> should

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
should be under the cheek but should

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.270 
should be under the cheek but should
have<00:01:09.570> plenty<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:09.960> space<00:01:10.320> here<00:01:10.830> some<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.100> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
have plenty of space here some of the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.010 
have plenty of space here some of the
bits<00:01:11.549> don't<00:01:11.880> interfere<00:01:12.240> with<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.659> noseband

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
bits don't interfere with the noseband

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.679 
bits don't interfere with the noseband
he's<00:01:13.710> quite<00:01:14.010> long<00:01:14.340> here<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.030> fairly<00:01:15.420> short

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
he's quite long here and fairly short

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.620 
he's quite long here and fairly short
here<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.890> nose<00:01:17.280> bent<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.330> little

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
here so the nose bent and is a little

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.300 
here so the nose bent and is a little
bit<00:01:18.750> high<00:01:18.960> but<00:01:19.290> that's<00:01:19.560> where<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.830> belongs

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
bit high but that's where it belongs

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.830 
bit high but that's where it belongs
on<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.640> particular<00:01:20.820> horse<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.750> it

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
on this particular horse so that it

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.990 
on this particular horse so that it
doesn't<00:01:22.170> interfere<00:01:22.290> with<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.740> bits<00:01:23.009> if<00:01:23.700> you

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
doesn't interfere with the bits if you

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.170 
doesn't interfere with the bits if you
have<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.240> horse<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.630> has<00:01:24.810> tonguing<00:01:25.590> issues

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
have a horse that has tonguing issues

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.760 
have a horse that has tonguing issues
meaning<00:01:27.180> likes<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.630> get<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.900> tongue<00:01:28.110> up<00:01:28.439> or

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
meaning likes to get the tongue up or

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.969 
meaning likes to get the tongue up or
over<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.369> bit<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:30.390> can<00:01:30.689> raise<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.439> Snapple<00:01:31.890> a

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
over the bit you can raise the Snapple a

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.520 
over the bit you can raise the Snapple a
little<00:01:32.250> bit<00:01:32.369> higher<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.360> then<00:01:34.009> snap<00:01:35.009> up

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
little bit higher so that then snap up

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.359 
little bit higher so that then snap up
is<00:01:37.310> even<00:01:37.880> further<00:01:38.270> up<00:01:38.720> and<00:01:39.080> away<00:01:39.890> from<00:01:40.220> the

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
is even further up and away from the

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.010 
is even further up and away from the
curb<00:01:40.640> it's<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:41.090> that<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:41.360> horse<00:01:41.570> can't<00:01:41.869> get

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
curb it's so that the horse can't get

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.920 
curb it's so that the horse can't get
his<00:01:42.140> tongue<00:01:42.290> over<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:42.590> bit<00:01:43.450> this<00:01:44.450> you<00:01:44.869> know

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
his tongue over the bit this you know

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.410 
his tongue over the bit this you know
this<00:01:45.530> is<00:01:45.710> a<00:01:45.740> normal<00:01:46.220> adjustment<00:01:46.759> but<00:01:47.090> there<00:01:47.270> is

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
this is a normal adjustment but there is

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.570 
this is a normal adjustment but there is
room<00:01:47.659> for<00:01:47.690> wiggle<00:01:48.170> room<00:01:48.350> if<00:01:48.830> you<00:01:49.040> have<00:01:49.250> a<00:01:49.280> horse

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
room for wiggle room if you have a horse

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.180 
room for wiggle room if you have a horse
that<00:01:49.820> is<00:01:49.940> really<00:01:50.659> difficult<00:01:51.170> in<00:01:51.799> the<00:01:51.979> house

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
that is really difficult in the house

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.700 
that is really difficult in the house
this<00:01:53.180> could<00:01:53.420> go<00:01:53.600> down<00:01:53.630> on<00:01:54.050> this<00:01:54.320> particular

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
this could go down on this particular

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.770 
this could go down on this particular
horse<00:01:55.130> can<00:01:55.550> go<00:01:55.670> down<00:01:55.880> a<00:01:55.909> little<00:01:56.210> bit<00:01:56.360> for<00:01:56.600> his

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
horse can go down a little bit for his

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.010 
horse can go down a little bit for his
upper<00:01:57.290> tush<00:01:57.580> is<00:01:58.580> actually<00:01:59.090> fairly<00:01:59.360> high<00:01:59.720> if

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
upper tush is actually fairly high if

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.859 
upper tush is actually fairly high if
you<00:02:00.140> can<00:02:00.320> see<00:02:00.530> that<00:02:00.740> and<00:02:01.220> it<00:02:01.549> should<00:02:01.880> also<00:02:02.240> not

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
you can see that and it should also not

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.430 
you can see that and it should also not
touch<00:02:03.500> to<00:02:03.830> the<00:02:03.979> curb<00:02:04.190> it<00:02:04.399> in<00:02:04.640> anyway<00:02:05.180> you<00:02:06.080> have

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
touch to the curb it in anyway you have
