00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.139
 I bring a new video of the series the 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.150
 galaxy 

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:13.389
 by god today what we are going to do is going to 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:16.299
 be install super user or root have 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:19.870
 administrator root access in our 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.930
 rom usually the hoarse city does not have 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:25.210
 but this video is special for the 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.120
 roma this with the originals of samsung 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.100
 that by default these layers are in that 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.960
 in that way you have access 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.120
 administrator like some applications 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.670
 are to use for example one that is 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.100
 pretty cool that is the sixaxis that 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.290
 serves to control let's go to have 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.850
 access to the command of the play and be able to play 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.160
 with the command to play on the samsung 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.710
 galaxy without cars that is pretty cool 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.000
 or for that we need root access between 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.670
 many other millions of 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.429
 applications that need root access 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:58.059
 they are usually pretty cool for that 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:01:01.030
 we need only this 10 super its 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:04.269
 special for nodes that is installed like this 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.909
 the link is what I'll put in the description 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.100
 as always and we do not need anything else 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.670
 we do not need anything else except this 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.770
 important file the file has to 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.570
 be in zip start occurs to 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.580
 either install it or uncompress 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.590
 because it is a hub endorsement to this has to 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.780
 to be like that or if you will give him 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.909
 double click and it comes out this is it is so 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.170
 perfect is valid or is it already inside 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.539
 this 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.450
 this file something else very well 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:34.860
 very smart 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.840
 it comes out unzipping but when you 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.509
 double click on the file you have to 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.219
 get out this way it's worth in the download that 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.259
 I 'm going to put 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:45.030
 it will come out that way because it is just as I 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.740
 download it so well what 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.310
 we need now is to connect our 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.899
 phone to the computer in normal mode does not 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.539
 either in pendrive mode it's worth it because this 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:58.079
 file we do not need to put in our 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:02:01.860
 or internal memory or micro sd yo os 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:05.099
 I recommend to put it in the micro sd 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.810
 for that of more security gives 

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:08.519
 exactly the same at this time 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.860
 exactly as I have it 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:18.390
 good and very good very well very well 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.709
 update we take it and put it in 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.900
 the root 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.790
 valeria is only once in the sun 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.120
 now what do we do now we go to 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.120
 mobile 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.610
 we already have here the mobile has already 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.610
 stepped out 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.800
 we released the usb 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.990
 we turn it off again 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.209
 and now we have to put it in him 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.340
 recovery in the cloud work mode how it 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.250
 come in he will have to remember him from 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:54.990
 previous video volume button up 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.790
 the middle button and light when no 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.240
 come out the letters we remove the from the 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.510
 here 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.680
 to turn on and off and we would already be in 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.720
 the recovery is worth 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.790
 being in the recovery 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.580
 but we have to make it easy and it is 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.100
 zinc suscite from sdk the external forum 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.470
 the card sd card is the internal memory 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.620
 of the local external telephone as the micro 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.600
 sd does not have much loss we what 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.960
 as we have put it in the 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:29.150
 my mother in the micro sd well what 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:32.770
 you'll have here is super user 1.65 we give 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.770
 to 10 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:41.110
 and now it's 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:43.570
 and such phrase of rubble in your terminal 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.530
 rebot system now here we say no 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:50.440
 to all the things that he asks us in the 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:53.230
 when leaving the recovery and now we 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.710
 should leave the galaxy nodes and in 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.990
 theory would now come out as updating 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.460
 applications or something like that I do not know if to me 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.490
 now it will come out to me because as I already had 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:07.140
 installed on the super user like not me 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:09.340
 something like that comes out who knows 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.040
 we leave you updating 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:15.160
 here some little something and it is not 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.140
 does not have much more to me no longer because 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.359
 I had it already had it put together let's see 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.950
 I had it installed to you I will put you 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.150
 how updating application will put us 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.900
 an application and it will not take anything 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:30.010
 so now we're going here 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.780
 apparently you have to install it is worth to me 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.970
 it sounds to me that it was installed 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.070
 automatically only when we did the 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.470
 the east but if it was not was not happening 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.390
 nothing one as we already have the archives 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.860
 tucked into the in the phone's memory 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.470
 all we have to do is go 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.800
 to google play and say super install 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.800
 usero 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:54.060
 will be downloaded 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.060
 we open it and it's done 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.890
 allow 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.940
 it would be out there what happens that has not 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:04.680
 found as is an update 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.030
 is outdated will tell us that the 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.240
 Supervision binaries need 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:12.990
 update we give you to continue here 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:16.520
 we say normal, do not listen to him 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.520
 we say normal and it would end 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:25.550
 installation completed well well since 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:29.120
 you know super root users of your 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:32.000
 phone with a stock here for example 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.889
 already gives you had a series of records of 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.840
 applications that already 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:37.540
 that they had already broken for example we can 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.810
 see what is 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:43.750
 that we have real root access 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.460
 for example in sixaxis control is the 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:49.060
 obligation that is what I said we give 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.950
 start and you see it without salt if you have 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.240
 received without superuser or permissions 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.310
 be that we can see that everything is 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.440
 perfect so I do not expect anything that I have 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.210
 liked this super user installation 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.450
 simple easy and with more power like 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:03.100
 you could see without any problem and 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.390
 you are already root user to be able to install 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.220
 all kinds of applications that you want 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:09.360
 so nothing see you in the next 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.360
 video and goodbye
