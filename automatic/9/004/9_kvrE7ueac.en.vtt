so 25 30 years down the road don't plan

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.970 
so 25 30 years down the road don't plan
on<00:00:47.910> having<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.270> lawn<00:00:48.450> underneath<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:48.989> okay<00:00:49.350> but

you yeah I mean these trees rarely need
to<00:01:43.229> be<00:01:43.350> pruned<00:01:43.590> okay<00:01:44.189> they<00:01:44.460> take<00:01:44.640> on<00:01:44.790> their

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
to be pruned okay they take on their

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.249 
to be pruned okay they take on their
shape<00:01:45.210> naturally<00:01:45.720> there<00:01:45.840> are<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:45.960> few<00:01:46.110> I'll

because this one this is neat this is

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.599 
because this one this is neat this is
really<00:01:51.869> interesting<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.679> deciduous

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:53.609 
really interesting this is a deciduous

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:55.700 
really interesting this is a deciduous
tree<00:01:53.820> meaning<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.390> loses<00:01:54.719> its<00:01:54.869> needles<00:01:55.439> in

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
tree meaning it loses its needles in

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.590 
tree meaning it loses its needles in
this<00:01:55.859> case<00:01:56.069> it's<00:01:56.880> called<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.119> dawn<00:01:57.329> redwood

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
this case it's called the dawn redwood

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.340 
this case it's called the dawn redwood
related<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.590> giant<00:01:58.890> sequoia<00:01:59.960> yeah<00:02:00.960> yeah

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
related to the giant sequoia yeah yeah

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.380 
related to the giant sequoia yeah yeah
yeah<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:01.950> think<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.250> gets<00:02:02.369> small<00:02:02.670> cones<00:02:02.939> but<00:02:03.270> it

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
yeah I think it gets small cones but it

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.380 
yeah I think it gets small cones but it
gets<00:02:03.539> you<00:02:03.780> know<00:02:03.869> 60<00:02:04.259> 70<00:02:04.560> feet<00:02:04.590> tall<00:02:05.039> it<00:02:06.030> forms

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
gets you know 60 70 feet tall it forms

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.999 
gets you know 60 70 feet tall it forms
kind<00:02:06.539> of<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.719> buttress<00:02:06.990> shaped<00:02:07.469> trunk<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.979> a

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
kind of a buttress shaped trunk to a

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.300 
kind of a buttress shaped trunk to a
very<00:02:08.369> very<00:02:08.989> tapered<00:02:09.989> down<00:02:10.140> trunk<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.890> lot<00:02:11.190> of

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
very very tapered down trunk a lot of

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.890 
very very tapered down trunk a lot of
privacy<00:02:11.610> though<00:02:11.849> even<00:02:12.150> even<00:02:12.599> at<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.810> bottom

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
privacy though even even at the bottom

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.860 
privacy though even even at the bottom
yeah<00:02:13.260> it's<00:02:13.440> just<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.709> majestic<00:02:14.250> tree<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:15.660> bark

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
yeah it's just a majestic tree the bark

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.660 
yeah it's just a majestic tree the bark
is<00:02:16.019> interesting<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:16.650> returns<00:02:16.950> reddish<00:02:17.370> over

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
is interesting it returns reddish over

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.130 
is interesting it returns reddish over
time<00:02:17.849> so<00:02:18.000> that's<00:02:18.180> another<00:02:18.390> unusual<00:02:18.870> choice

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
time so that's another unusual choice

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.339 
time so that's another unusual choice
called<00:02:19.470> dawn<00:02:19.769> redwood<00:02:20.329> down<00:02:21.329> the<00:02:21.660> way<00:02:21.780> here<00:02:22.140> is

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
called dawn redwood down the way here is

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:23.720 
called dawn redwood down the way here is
something<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:23.069> is<00:02:23.220> making<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.579> resurgence

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
something that is making a resurgence

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.030 
something that is making a resurgence
it's<00:02:24.329> the<00:02:24.420> elm<00:02:24.599> tree<00:02:24.989> if<00:02:25.140> you<00:02:25.260> remember<00:02:25.650> New

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
it's the elm tree if you remember New

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.850 
it's the elm tree if you remember New
England<00:02:26.400> Main<00:02:26.940> Street<00:02:27.180> was<00:02:27.329> like<00:02:27.860> trees

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
England Main Street was like trees

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.530 
England Main Street was like trees
though<00:02:29.099> because<00:02:29.459> we've<00:02:29.610> had<00:02:29.849> such<00:02:30.269> bad<00:02:30.510> luck

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
though because we've had such bad luck

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.569 
though because we've had such bad luck
with<00:02:31.079> elm<00:02:31.290> trees<00:02:31.590> locally<00:02:32.040> lately<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.459> we've

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
with elm trees locally lately and we've

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.280 
with elm trees locally lately and we've
had<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.879> cut<00:02:33.060> down<00:02:33.090> some<00:02:33.239> elm<00:02:33.690> trees<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:34.079> these

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
had to cut down some elm trees so these

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.289 
had to cut down some elm trees so these
actually<00:02:34.709> a<00:02:34.739> better<00:02:34.980> species<00:02:35.549> right<00:02:35.879> across

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
actually a better species right across

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.059 
actually a better species right across
between<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.900> American<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:37.349> another<00:02:37.620> species

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
between the American and another species

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.589 
between the American and another species
which<00:02:38.280> is<00:02:38.310> disease<00:02:38.790> resistant<00:02:39.269> doesn't<00:02:39.510> get

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
which is disease resistant doesn't get

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.479 
which is disease resistant doesn't get
that<00:02:39.720> Dutch<00:02:40.170> elm<00:02:40.470> disease<00:02:40.560> okay<00:02:41.160> it's<00:02:41.370> called

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
that Dutch elm disease okay it's called

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.520 
that Dutch elm disease okay it's called
the<00:02:41.670> Princeton<00:02:42.120> elm<00:02:42.329> but<00:02:43.170> just<00:02:43.349> like<00:02:43.500> the

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
the Princeton elm but just like the

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.229 
the Princeton elm but just like the
American<00:02:43.950> only<00:02:44.160> grow<00:02:44.370> vigorously<00:02:44.610> they<00:02:45.120> have

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
American only grow vigorously they have

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.089 
American only grow vigorously they have
arching<00:02:45.750> branches<00:02:46.019> so<00:02:46.440> they're<00:02:46.590> an<00:02:46.739> arching

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
arching branches so they're an arching

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.559 
arching branches so they're an arching
shape<00:02:47.340> that<00:02:47.519> they<00:02:47.640> will<00:02:47.790> lean<00:02:48.030> over<00:02:48.239> Main

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
shape that they will lean over Main

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.119 
shape that they will lean over Main
Street<00:02:48.900> again<00:02:49.110> some<00:02:49.349> day<00:02:49.379> around<00:02:49.709> here<00:02:49.829> so

landscape how many years old is a tree
this<00:02:53.370> size<00:02:53.430> this<00:02:54.209> is<00:02:54.329> probably<00:02:54.600> 10<00:02:54.780> or<00:02:54.870> 11

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
this size this is probably 10 or 11

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.470 
this size this is probably 10 or 11
years<00:02:55.139> old<00:02:55.380> okay<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.220> now<00:02:56.579> the<00:02:56.609> size<00:02:57.150> of<00:02:57.359> the
