definitely<00:02:04.939> we're<00:02:05.240> looking<00:02:05.450> at<00:02:05.570> quite<00:02:05.780> a

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
definitely we're looking at quite a

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.680 
definitely we're looking at quite a
unique<00:02:06.049> shape<00:02:06.500> within<00:02:07.430> the<00:02:07.490> knife<00:02:07.670> and<00:02:08.390> also

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
unique shape within the knife and also

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.089 
unique shape within the knife and also
within<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:08.929> handle<00:02:09.319> we've<00:02:09.649> obviously<00:02:09.830> got

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
within the handle we've obviously got

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.040 
within the handle we've obviously got
their<00:02:10.220> regular<00:02:10.610> grip<00:02:10.819> but<00:02:11.450> then<00:02:11.630> you'll<00:02:11.780> see

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
their regular grip but then you'll see

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.120 
their regular grip but then you'll see
this<00:02:12.860> is<00:02:13.400> some<00:02:13.670> additional<00:02:14.300> section<00:02:14.720> cutting

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
this is some additional section cutting

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.350 
this is some additional section cutting
which<00:02:16.130> basically<00:02:16.430> comes<00:02:16.730> from<00:02:16.940> a<00:02:16.970> fencing

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
which basically comes from a fencing

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.390 
which basically comes from a fencing
foil<00:02:17.569> style<00:02:17.930> can<00:02:18.709> for<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:18.890> additional<00:02:19.220> grip

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
foil style can for the additional grip

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.400 
foil style can for the additional grip
so<00:02:19.580> this<00:02:19.730> gives<00:02:19.970> us<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.330> way<00:02:20.810> to<00:02:20.870> advance<00:02:21.230> on

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
so this gives us the way to advance on

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.960 
so this gives us the way to advance on
the<00:02:21.500> knife<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:21.860> have<00:02:22.010> greater<00:02:22.519> pressure<00:02:22.849> on

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
the knife and have greater pressure on

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.949 
the knife and have greater pressure on
the<00:02:23.090> back<00:02:23.269> and<00:02:23.810> also<00:02:24.140> control<00:02:25.870> well<00:02:26.870> obviously

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
the back and also control well obviously

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.710 
the back and also control well obviously
we<00:02:27.290> apply<00:02:28.250> more<00:02:28.489> leverage<00:02:28.819> towards<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.540> rear

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
we apply more leverage towards the rear

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.320 
we apply more leverage towards the rear
rear<00:02:30.170> of<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.380> knife<00:02:30.530> here<00:02:30.970> just<00:02:31.970> some<00:02:32.120> key

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
rear of the knife here just some key

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.500 
rear of the knife here just some key

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
game preparation with this as well so

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.750 
game preparation with this as well so
that's<00:03:00.799> towards<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.190> rear<00:03:01.370> and<00:03:01.489> knife<00:03:01.579> or<00:03:01.700> the

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
handle obviously you see we've got this

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.130 
handle obviously you see we've got this
deep<00:03:03.410> curvature<00:03:03.859> in<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.070> blade<00:03:04.280> and<00:03:04.600> so<00:03:05.600> this

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
deep curvature in the blade and so this

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.569 
deep curvature in the blade and so this
sort<00:03:06.350> of<00:03:06.440> back<00:03:06.769> third<00:03:07.100> we're<00:03:07.310> going<00:03:07.340> to<00:03:07.489> be

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
sort of back third we're going to be

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:09.520 
sort of back third we're going to be
looking<00:03:07.700> at<00:03:07.940> doing<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.209> finer<00:03:08.480> work<00:03:08.720> with<00:03:08.989> the

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
looking at doing the finer work with the

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.990 
looking at doing the finer work with the
belly<00:03:09.769> of<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.130> blade<00:03:10.310> here<00:03:10.549> the<00:03:10.700> heavier

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
belly of the blade here the heavier

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.430 
belly of the blade here the heavier
chopping<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:11.720> then<00:03:11.989> we're<00:03:12.140> going<00:03:12.260> to<00:03:12.320> this

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
chopping and then we're going to this

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.050 
chopping and then we're going to this
finer<00:03:12.739> point<00:03:13.070> here<00:03:13.250> for<00:03:13.400> any<00:03:13.549> boring<00:03:13.880> that<00:03:13.970> we

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
finer point here for any boring that we

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.910 
finer point here for any boring that we
need<00:03:14.209> to<00:03:14.329> do<00:03:14.480> and<00:03:15.290> hopefully<00:03:15.440> I'll<00:03:15.709> get<00:03:15.799> the

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
need to do and hopefully I'll get the

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.890 
need to do and hopefully I'll get the
chance<00:03:16.160> to<00:03:16.310> show<00:03:16.489> you<00:03:16.519> all<00:03:17.420> of<00:03:17.570> these<00:03:17.840> things

today the first thing I in the D you

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.479 
today the first thing I in the D you
start<00:03:21.560> off<00:03:21.650> by<00:03:21.799> putting<00:03:21.980> this<00:03:22.100> knife<00:03:22.310> through

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
start off by putting this knife through

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.640 
start off by putting this knife through
its<00:03:22.579> paces<00:03:22.760> just<00:03:23.630> actually<00:03:23.930> yeah<00:03:24.140> using<00:03:24.590> a

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
its paces just actually yeah using a

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.830 
its paces just actually yeah using a
technique<00:03:24.950> called<00:03:25.010> batoning<00:03:25.700> so<00:03:26.569> what<00:03:26.720> I'm

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
technique called batoning so what I'm

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.199 
technique called batoning so what I'm
gonna<00:03:26.930> do<00:03:27.109> is<00:03:27.230> take<00:03:27.440> some<00:03:27.760> some<00:03:28.760> previously

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
gonna do is take some some previously

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.030 
gonna do is take some some previously
split<00:03:29.600> wood<00:03:29.780> and<00:03:30.380> actually<00:03:30.680> want<00:03:30.829> to<00:03:30.890> take

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
split wood and actually want to take

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.430 
split wood and actually want to take
this<00:03:31.160> down<00:03:31.370> into<00:03:31.549> smaller<00:03:31.970> sections<00:03:32.540> for

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
this down into smaller sections for

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.360 
this down into smaller sections for
burning<00:03:33.769> so<00:03:34.640> I'm<00:03:34.730> just<00:03:34.910> gonna<00:03:35.030> run<00:03:36.069> use<00:03:37.069> a<00:03:37.100> base

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
burning so I'm just gonna run use a base

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.430 
burning so I'm just gonna run use a base
board<00:03:37.670> on<00:03:37.790> the<00:03:37.880> ground<00:03:38.090> here<00:03:38.299> and<00:03:39.019> take<00:03:39.290> this

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
board on the ground here and take this

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.000 
board on the ground here and take this
wood<00:03:39.709> and<00:03:40.420> then<00:03:41.420> impact<00:03:42.380> on<00:03:42.530> the<00:03:42.620> top<00:03:42.799> of<00:03:42.950> the

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
wood and then impact on the top of the
