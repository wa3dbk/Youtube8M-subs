I'm able to do real time analysis of
what's<00:00:30.169> going<00:00:30.380> on<00:00:31.300> look<00:00:32.300> at<00:00:32.419> key<00:00:33.050> things<00:00:33.440> about

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
what's going on look at key things about

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.840 
what's going on look at key things about
the<00:00:34.489> engine<00:00:34.969> as<00:00:35.630> I'm<00:00:36.500> using<00:00:36.770> it<00:00:37.040> I<00:00:37.190> can<00:00:37.340> also<00:00:37.460> go

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
the engine as I'm using it I can also go

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.430 
the engine as I'm using it I can also go
out<00:00:38.060> on<00:00:39.050> a<00:00:39.110> track<00:00:39.590> and<00:00:40.150> do<00:00:41.150> specific<00:00:41.930> scans

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
out on a track and do specific scans

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.900 
out on a track and do specific scans
what<00:00:42.770> we<00:00:42.890> call<00:00:43.100> logs<00:00:44.770> store<00:00:45.770> a<00:00:45.800> lot<00:00:46.190> of<00:00:46.400> data<00:00:46.580> go

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
what we call logs store a lot of data go

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.060 
what we call logs store a lot of data go
back<00:00:47.180> analyze<00:00:47.990> it<00:00:48.320> and<00:00:48.500> figure<00:00:48.829> out<00:00:48.890> what

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
back analyze it and figure out what

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.640 
back analyze it and figure out what
changes<00:00:49.490> we<00:00:49.670> need<00:00:49.700> to<00:00:49.850> make<00:00:50.000> to<00:00:50.480> the<00:00:51.290> engine

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
changes we need to make to the engine

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.710 
changes we need to make to the engine
control<00:00:51.800> unit<00:00:53.050> so<00:00:54.050> with<00:00:54.290> this<00:00:54.700> it's<00:00:55.700> a<00:00:55.910> real

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
control unit so with this it's a real

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.470 
control unit so with this it's a real
important<00:00:57.320> tool<00:00:57.590> for<00:00:57.620> reprogramming<00:00:58.430> the<00:00:58.880> ECU

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
important tool for reprogramming the ECU

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.830 
important tool for reprogramming the ECU
so<00:01:00.079> we<00:01:00.230> get<00:01:00.550> more<00:01:01.550> power<00:01:01.760> more<00:01:02.239> reliability

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
so we get more power more reliability

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.130 
so we get more power more reliability
and<00:01:03.440> we<00:01:04.280> can<00:01:04.460> even<00:01:04.549> get<00:01:04.850> better<00:01:05.329> economy<00:01:05.990> out

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
and we can even get better economy out

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.200 
and we can even get better economy out
of<00:01:06.170> it

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
of it

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:13.200 
of it
