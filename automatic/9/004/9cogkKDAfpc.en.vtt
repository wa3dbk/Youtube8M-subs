entrapments on them so instead of

enchantment on a weapon you can find

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.740

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
these in chests and they'll have

enchantments<00:00:46.379> on<00:00:46.530> them<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:46.950> can<00:00:47.100> put

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
enchantments on them that you can put

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.639 
enchantments on them that you can put
onto<00:00:47.789> your<00:00:48.210> weapon<00:00:48.660> with<00:00:48.899> an<00:00:49.079> anvil<00:00:49.289> and

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
onto your weapon with an anvil and

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.770 
onto your weapon with an anvil and
they're<00:00:50.399> really<00:00:50.610> interesting<00:00:51.120> because<00:00:51.239> these

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
they're really interesting because these

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.220 
they're really interesting because these
linked<00:00:52.199> up<00:00:52.350> with<00:00:52.500> anvils<00:00:53.010> really<00:00:53.699> well<00:00:53.910> and

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
linked up with anvils really well and

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.479 
linked up with anvils really well and
you<00:00:55.230> know<00:00:55.350> it's<00:00:55.530> quite<00:00:55.770> surprising<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.370> we

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
you know it's quite surprising that we

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.860 
you know it's quite surprising that we
haven't<00:00:56.730> seen<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.879> screenshot<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.390> these<00:00:57.600> yet

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
haven't seen a screenshot of these yet

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.590 
haven't seen a screenshot of these yet
so<00:00:58.460> that<00:00:59.460> would<00:00:59.579> lead<00:00:59.760> me<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.000> believe<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.390> we

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
so that would lead me to believe that we

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.330 
so that would lead me to believe that we
weren't<00:01:00.809> getting<00:01:01.079> them<00:01:01.379> but<00:01:01.770> just<00:01:02.190> because

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
weren't getting them but just because

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.729 
weren't getting them but just because
we're<00:01:02.609> getting<00:01:02.879> anvils<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:04.350> things<00:01:04.589> like

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
we're getting anvils and I things like

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.230 
we're getting anvils and I things like
that<00:01:04.830> i<00:01:05.040> would<00:01:05.369> say<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.880> we're<00:01:06.000> probably

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
that i would say that we're probably

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.359 
that i would say that we're probably
going<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.659> be<00:01:06.810> getting<00:01:06.930> them<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.950> i<00:01:08.040> really

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
going to be getting them and i really

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.950 
going to be getting them and i really
hope<00:01:08.490> we<00:01:08.520> do<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:09.030> like<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.479> one<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.810> big

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
hope we do this like a one of the big

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
features and yeah i really hope we do

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.700

get them as i said there's no screenshot
of<00:01:16.740> them<00:01:17.009> at<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.250> moment<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:17.790> there<00:01:18.360> isn't

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
of them at the moment so there isn't

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.359 
of them at the moment so there isn't
actually<00:01:18.720> any<00:01:19.049> proof<00:01:19.409> or<00:01:19.710> evidence<00:01:19.920> that

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
actually any proof or evidence that

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.730 
actually any proof or evidence that
there<00:01:20.580> are<00:01:20.729> some<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.600> they<00:01:21.990> are<00:01:22.140> coming<00:01:22.470> but

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
there are some that they are coming but

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.190 
there are some that they are coming but
you<00:01:23.700> would<00:01:24.030> imagine<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.420> they<00:01:24.659> are<00:01:24.810> because

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
you would imagine that they are because

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.710 
you would imagine that they are because
of<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:26.040> fact<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.310> we<00:01:26.460> have<00:01:26.610> an<00:01:26.850> bills<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.540> yes

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
of the fact that we have an bills so yes

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.060 
of the fact that we have an bills so yes

coming but again we have no proof yet so
at<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.990> moment<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.500> know<00:01:43.680> unfortunately

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430

so next question panda polio ass is
there<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:46.920> possibility<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.670> us<00:01:47.880> getting

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
there a possibility of us getting

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.149 
there a possibility of us getting
witches<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.259> straight<00:01:49.590> up<00:01:49.680> I'm<00:01:49.799> gonna<00:01:49.920> have<00:01:50.070> to

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
witches so straight up I'm gonna have to

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.249 
witches so straight up I'm gonna have to
say<00:01:50.310> no<00:01:50.340> on<00:01:50.820> witches<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.810> reason<00:01:52.110> why<00:01:52.229> I

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
say no on witches and the reason why I

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.719 
say no on witches and the reason why I
think<00:01:52.470> which<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:52.860> won't<00:01:53.189> be<00:01:53.310> coming<00:01:53.610> is

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
think which is won't be coming is

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:54.770 
think which is won't be coming is
because<00:01:53.880> they<00:01:54.180> still<00:01:54.390> need<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.630> add<00:01:54.750> the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
because they still need to add the

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.270 
because they still need to add the
wither<00:01:55.140> they<00:01:55.409> still<00:01:55.619> need<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.829> add<00:01:55.860> wither

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
wither they still need to add wither

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.340 
wither they still need to add wither
skeletons<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:57.180> think<00:01:57.479> maybe<00:01:57.630> another<00:01:57.930> mob<00:01:58.200> as

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.679 
skeletons I think maybe another mob as
well<00:01:58.530> I'm<00:01:58.710> not<00:01:58.860> really<00:01:58.979> sure<00:01:59.070> but<00:01:59.520> still<00:02:00.509> this

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689

comes<00:02:56.700> from<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:57.060> beasts<00:02:57.239> mods<00:02:57.540> one<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.019> he

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
comes from the beasts mods one and he

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.410 
comes from the beasts mods one and he
asks<00:02:58.500> well<00:02:58.769> what<00:02:58.950> about<00:02:59.069> beaconed<00:02:59.640> and<00:02:59.849> this

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
asks well what about beaconed and this

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.570 
asks well what about beaconed and this
is<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:00.569> really<00:03:00.870> interesting<00:03:01.349> one<00:03:01.650> because<00:03:01.680> if

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
is a really interesting one because if

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.059 
is a really interesting one because if
you<00:03:02.700> didn't<00:03:02.910> know<00:03:03.000> beacons<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.920> emeralds<00:03:04.920> go

you didn't know beacons and emeralds go

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.759 
you didn't know beacons and emeralds go
together<00:03:05.280> so<00:03:05.790> you<00:03:06.090> actually<00:03:06.239> have<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:06.630> use

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
together so you actually have to use

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.979 
together so you actually have to use
emerald<00:03:07.769> blocks<00:03:08.099> to<00:03:08.400> be<00:03:09.090> able<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.330> use<00:03:09.510> beacons

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
emerald blocks to be able to use beacons

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.440 
emerald blocks to be able to use beacons
and<00:03:10.200> also<00:03:11.099> to<00:03:11.160> create<00:03:11.640> a<00:03:11.670> beacon<00:03:12.150> you<00:03:12.299> need

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
and also to create a beacon you need

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.140 
and also to create a beacon you need
another<00:03:13.049> star<00:03:13.440> and<00:03:13.709> you<00:03:14.549> only<00:03:14.700> get<00:03:14.910> another

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
another star and you only get another

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.120 
another star and you only get another
star<00:03:15.450> from<00:03:15.720> defeating<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.500> wither<00:03:16.739> or<00:03:17.099> I

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
star from defeating the wither or I

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.009 
star from defeating the wither or I
think<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.180> might<00:03:18.329> be<00:03:18.359> able<00:03:18.510> to<00:03:18.660> get<00:03:18.750> them<00:03:18.870> from

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
think you might be able to get them from

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.979 
think you might be able to get them from
wither<00:03:19.260> skeletons<00:03:19.799> as<00:03:19.980> well<00:03:20.160> so<00:03:20.690> again<00:03:21.690> if<00:03:21.930> we

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
wither skeletons as well so again if we

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.990 
wither skeletons as well so again if we
get<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.500> wither<00:03:22.739> and<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.100> Willis<00:03:23.370> get<00:03:23.549> with<00:03:23.970> a

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
get the wither and the Willis get with a

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.150 
get the wither and the Willis get with a
skeleton<00:03:24.359> you<00:03:25.079> know<00:03:25.200> that's<00:03:25.380> here<00:03:25.560> that's<00:03:25.859> the

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
skeleton you know that's here that's the

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.610 
skeleton you know that's here that's the
only<00:03:26.310> way<00:03:26.430> we<00:03:26.579> could<00:03:26.700> get<00:03:26.880> beacons<00:03:27.359> but<00:03:27.660> you

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
only way we could get beacons but you

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.740 
only way we could get beacons but you
know<00:03:28.739> obviously<00:03:28.940> with<00:03:29.940> a<00:03:29.970> boss<00:03:30.239> and<00:03:30.510> the

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
know obviously with a boss and the

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.650 
know obviously with a boss and the
wither<00:03:30.930> scousers<00:03:31.410> aren't<00:03:31.680> confirmed<00:03:32.100> so

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
wither scousers aren't confirmed so

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.449 
wither scousers aren't confirmed so
again<00:03:33.660> I'd<00:03:33.959> have<00:03:34.290> to<00:03:34.440> say<00:03:34.560> no<00:03:34.829> on<00:03:35.040> beacons

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
again I'd have to say no on beacons

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.849 
again I'd have to say no on beacons
because<00:03:35.790> I<00:03:36.000> can't<00:03:36.329> imagine<00:03:36.450> them<00:03:36.959> bring<00:03:37.709> in

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
because I can't imagine them bring in

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.559 
because I can't imagine them bring in
all<00:03:38.069> the<00:03:38.190> features<00:03:38.370> that<00:03:38.549> they<00:03:38.790> already<00:03:38.970> plus

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
all the features that they already plus

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.479 
all the features that they already plus
the<00:03:39.780> wither<00:03:39.989> plus<00:03:40.319> it<00:03:40.500> with<00:03:40.620> a<00:03:40.650> skeleton<00:03:41.010> and

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
the wither plus it with a skeleton and

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.530 
the wither plus it with a skeleton and
plus<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.540> beacon<00:03:42.959> so<00:03:43.859> um<00:03:44.130> you<00:03:44.700> know<00:03:44.819> even<00:03:45.359> if

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
plus the beacon so um you know even if

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.090 
plus the beacon so um you know even if
they<00:03:45.690> did<00:03:45.930> manage<00:03:46.260> to<00:03:46.410> bring<00:03:46.560> in<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:46.889> wither

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
they did manage to bring in the wither

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.160 
they did manage to bring in the wither
and<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.639> wither<00:03:48.000> skeleton<00:03:48.510> I<00:03:48.600> just<00:03:48.930> can't

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
and the wither skeleton I just can't

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.050 
and the wither skeleton I just can't
imagine<00:03:49.470> them<00:03:49.859> bringing<00:03:50.190> in<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.489> beacons<00:03:50.910> as

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
imagine them bringing in the beacons as

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.520 
imagine them bringing in the beacons as
well<00:03:51.269> so<00:03:51.600> yeah<00:03:51.810> guys<00:03:51.959> that's<00:03:52.019> pretty<00:03:52.380> much<00:03:52.470> it
