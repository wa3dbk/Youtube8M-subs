go so up first aaron has an all mango
and<00:00:58.940> this<00:00:59.940> one<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.590> it's<00:01:01.590> 12<00:01:01.890> fret<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.309> body

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
and this one is it's 12 fret to the body

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.340 
and this one is it's 12 fret to the body
yep<00:01:02.969> on<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:04.129> so<00:01:05.420> what's<00:01:06.420> not<00:01:06.630> different<00:01:06.960> about

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
yep on it so what's not different about

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.130 
yep on it so what's not different about
these<00:01:07.560> two<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:08.250> when<00:01:08.970> we<00:01:09.090> say<00:01:09.330> it's<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.600> concert

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
these two is when we say it's a concert

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.719 
these two is when we say it's a concert
that<00:01:10.460> really<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:12.290> the<00:01:13.290> scale<00:01:13.830> length<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.460> it's

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
that really is the scale length so it's

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.810 
that really is the scale length so it's
from<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.299> nut<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.740> settle<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.729> the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
from the nut to the settle and in the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.330 
from the nut to the settle and in the
case<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.240> my<00:01:18.360> Amoy<00:01:18.600> it's<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.259> body<00:01:19.500> size<00:01:19.860> as

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
case of my Amoy it's the body size as

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.140 
case of my Amoy it's the body size as
well<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.630> these<00:01:22.560> both<00:01:22.950> have<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.549> exact<00:01:24.000> same

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
well so these both have the exact same

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.770 
well so these both have the exact same
scale<00:01:24.930> length<00:01:25.259> which<00:01:26.159> means<00:01:26.240> that<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.540> fret

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
scale length which means that the fret

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.069 
scale length which means that the fret
spacing<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.590> exactly<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.640> same<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.930> this

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
spacing is exactly the same and in this

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.340 
spacing is exactly the same and in this
case<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:32.189> joins<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.909> body<00:01:33.060> at<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.810> 12th<00:01:34.170> fret

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
case it joins the body at the 12th fret

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.310 
case it joins the body at the 12th fret
right<00:01:34.920> there<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.460> let's<00:01:36.270> look<00:01:36.390> at<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.630> 14<00:01:37.079> and

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
right there and let's look at the 14 and

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.300 
right there and let's look at the 14 and
then<00:01:37.439> we'll<00:01:37.590> point<00:01:37.829> out<00:01:37.950> some<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.250> the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
then we'll point out some of the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.749 
then we'll point out some of the
differences<00:01:41.030> this<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.270> an<00:01:42.450> all<00:01:42.689> koa<00:01:43.759> concert

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
differences this is an all koa concert

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.620 
differences this is an all koa concert
and<00:01:44.939> it's<00:01:45.450> 14<00:01:45.990> frets<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.619> body<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.970> can

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
and it's 14 frets to the body so you can

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.620 
and it's 14 frets to the body so you can
see<00:01:48.840> right<00:01:49.049> here<00:01:49.110> it's<00:01:49.890> joined<00:01:50.460> at<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.000> 14th

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
see right here it's joined at the 14th

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.340 
see right here it's joined at the 14th
fret<00:01:51.930> instead<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.619> 12th<00:01:53.009> so<00:01:54.049> the<00:01:55.049> biggest

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
fret instead of the 12th so the biggest

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.730 
fret instead of the 12th so the biggest
impact<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.430> has<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.530> moves

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
impact that that has is that it moves

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.160 
impact that that has is that it moves
the<00:01:59.070> bridge<00:01:59.390> because<00:02:00.390> if<00:02:00.540> we're<00:02:00.719> gonna<00:02:00.810> join

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
the bridge because if we're gonna join

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.980 
the bridge because if we're gonna join
here<00:02:01.530> at<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.770> 14th<00:02:02.219> fret<00:02:02.600> everything<00:02:03.600> on<00:02:03.750> this

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
here at the 14th fret everything on this

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.859 
here at the 14th fret everything on this
instrument<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.680> koa<00:02:04.950> instrument<00:02:05.549> has<00:02:06.060> slid

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
instrument this koa instrument has slid

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.809 
instrument this koa instrument has slid
up<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:08.369> way<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:09.119> neck<00:02:09.420> is<00:02:09.629> longer<00:02:10.580> by<00:02:11.580> those

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
up that way the neck is longer by those

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.470 
up that way the neck is longer by those
two

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
two

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.899 
two
and<00:02:12.750> as<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.319> result<00:02:13.800> you<00:02:13.980> can<00:02:14.159> see<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.640> bridge

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
and as a result you can see the bridge

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.530 
and as a result you can see the bridge
has<00:02:15.780> had<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.409> move<00:02:16.590> be<00:02:17.250> moved<00:02:17.519> a<00:02:17.819> little<00:02:18.390> bit

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
has had to move be moved a little bit

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.050 
has had to move be moved a little bit
closer<00:02:19.049> two<00:02:19.620> frets<00:02:19.920> closer<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.849> sound

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
closer two frets closer to the sound

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.270 
closer two frets closer to the sound
hole<00:02:21.269> so<00:02:22.019> that<00:02:22.049> the<00:02:22.379> scale<00:02:22.680> length<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.190> the

hole so that the scale length and the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.410 
hole so that the scale length and the
intonation<00:02:23.760> are<00:02:24.420> are<00:02:25.019> correct<00:02:25.530> so<00:02:26.420> don't

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
intonation are are correct so don't

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.539 
intonation are are correct so don't
forget<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:27.659> the<00:02:27.870> bracing<00:02:28.290> on<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.739> top<00:02:28.950> it's

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
forget that the bracing on the top it's

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.580 
forget that the bracing on the top it's
different<00:02:29.910> in<00:02:30.239> order<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.720> put<00:02:31.349> the<00:02:31.410> bridge

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
different in order to put the bridge

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.920 
different in order to put the bridge
patch<00:02:31.830> right<00:02:32.069> under<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.310> bridge<00:02:32.489> so<00:02:33.060> because

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
patch right under the bridge so because

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.960 
patch right under the bridge so because
we<00:02:34.049> always<00:02:34.200> do<00:02:34.500> put<00:02:34.769> a<00:02:34.799> bridge<00:02:35.040> patch<00:02:35.280> right

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
we always do put a bridge patch right

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.820 
we always do put a bridge patch right
under<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.330> bridge<00:02:36.569> and<00:02:36.900> then<00:02:37.110> we<00:02:37.290> have<00:02:37.470> fan

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
under the bridge and then we have fan

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.740 
under the bridge and then we have fan
bracing<00:02:38.340> in<00:02:38.459> there<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:38.879> so<00:02:39.060> that<00:02:39.090> bracing

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
bracing in there and so that bracing

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.190 
bracing in there and so that bracing
pattern<00:02:40.730> changes<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.909> little<00:02:42.180> bit<00:02:42.329> or<00:02:43.049> the

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
pattern changes a little bit or the

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.809 
pattern changes a little bit or the
position<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.980> exact<00:02:44.280> position<00:02:44.489> of<00:02:44.760> the

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
position the exact position of the

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.300 
position the exact position of the
braces<00:02:45.299> so<00:02:45.989> one<00:02:46.349> of<00:02:46.379> the<00:02:46.530> differences<00:02:46.890> that

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
braces so one of the differences that

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.069 
braces so one of the differences that
you<00:02:47.670> see<00:02:48.030> is<00:02:49.190> aesthetic<00:02:50.690> you<00:02:51.690> know<00:02:51.780> you<00:02:51.870> can

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
you see is aesthetic you know you can

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.930 
you see is aesthetic you know you can
see<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.470> proportions<00:02:53.459> here<00:02:53.700> are<00:02:53.790> different

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
see the proportions here are different

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.940 
see the proportions here are different
the<00:02:54.629> neck<00:02:54.900> is<00:02:55.079> a<00:02:55.109> little<00:02:55.349> bit<00:02:55.470> longer<00:02:55.680> I'll

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
the neck is a little bit longer I'll

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.190 
the neck is a little bit longer I'll
zoom<00:02:56.160> back<00:02:56.370> out<00:02:56.579> just<00:02:57.299> a<00:02:57.390> bit<00:02:57.599> so<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:57.810> can<00:02:57.930> just

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
zoom back out just a bit so you can just

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.910 
zoom back out just a bit so you can just
kind<00:02:58.470> of<00:02:58.500> see<00:02:58.709> that<00:02:59.540> but<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:01.109> proportions<00:03:01.709> of

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
kind of see that but the proportions of

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.670 
kind of see that but the proportions of
the<00:03:02.280> neck<00:03:02.489> length<00:03:02.849> to<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.329> body<00:03:03.540> size<00:03:03.870> are

the neck length to the body size are

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.740 
the neck length to the body size are
different<00:03:05.099> in<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.280> two<00:03:05.310> again<00:03:05.970> exact<00:03:06.540> same

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
different and I won't say doesn't matter

what we think looks better or or we
don't<00:03:18.180> like<00:03:18.450> as<00:03:18.660> much<00:03:18.870> or<00:03:19.169> like<00:03:19.349> better<00:03:19.650> is

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919 
don't like as much or like better is

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.599 
don't like as much or like better is
really<00:03:19.950> that<00:03:20.549> aesthetic<00:03:21.030> is<00:03:21.209> is<00:03:21.510> up<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:22.049> you

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
really that aesthetic is is up to you

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.960 
really that aesthetic is is up to you
the<00:03:24.560> it<00:03:25.560> does<00:03:25.799> as<00:03:26.040> I<00:03:26.160> said<00:03:26.370> it<00:03:26.459> does<00:03:26.639> change

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
the it does as I said it does change

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.390 
the it does as I said it does change
that<00:03:27.209> bridge<00:03:27.450> position<00:03:27.799> this<00:03:28.799> is<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.069> more

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
that bridge position this is a more

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
little bit less traditional so some

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.360 
little bit less traditional so some
people<00:03:35.910> would<00:03:36.060> like<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:36.389> look<00:03:36.540> of<00:03:36.630> that<00:03:37.370> yet

everything affects the acoustics and

a<00:04:07.560> one<00:04:07.889> a<00:04:07.919> very<00:04:08.040> warm<00:04:08.489> wood<00:04:08.750> mango<00:04:09.750> is<00:04:10.019> a<00:04:10.370> if<00:04:11.370> we

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
a one a very warm wood mango is a if we

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.189 
a one a very warm wood mango is a if we
put<00:04:11.699> it<00:04:11.790> as<00:04:11.879> a<00:04:11.910> three<00:04:12.239> but<00:04:12.419> a<00:04:12.449> two<00:04:12.660> or<00:04:12.840> a<00:04:12.870> three<00:04:12.900> a

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:13.199 
put it as a three but a two or a three a

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:15.409 
put it as a three but a two or a three a
little<00:04:13.500> bit<00:04:13.650> brighter<00:04:13.859> so<00:04:14.190> you<00:04:15.060> want<00:04:15.209> to<00:04:15.269> play

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
little bit brighter so you want to play

00:04:15.419 --> 00:05:33.920 
little bit brighter so you want to play
them<00:04:15.569> and<00:04:15.889> see<00:04:16.889> what<00:04:16.979> we<00:04:17.070> hear<00:04:17.280> here<00:04:17.630> here

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.260 

what<00:05:34.930> do<00:05:34.990> you<00:05:35.050> think<00:05:35.260> I<00:05:35.730> think<00:05:36.730> that<00:05:36.790> probably

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
what do you think I think that probably

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.750 
what do you think I think that probably
the<00:05:37.680> the<00:05:38.680> tone<00:05:38.920> would<00:05:39.130> has<00:05:39.310> more<00:05:39.520> of<00:05:39.580> an<00:05:39.670> effect

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
the the tone would has more of an effect

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.560 
the the tone would has more of an effect
on<00:05:40.150> the<00:05:40.270> instrument<00:05:40.960> then<00:05:41.970> when<00:05:42.970> then<00:05:43.390> which

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
on the instrument then when then which

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.150 
on the instrument then when then which
which<00:05:43.900> whether<00:05:44.290> it's<00:05:44.470> twelve<00:05:44.650> or<00:05:44.770> fourteen

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
which whether it's twelve or fourteen

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.740 
which whether it's twelve or fourteen
but<00:05:45.400> it's<00:05:45.640> kind<00:05:45.850> of<00:05:45.880> too<00:05:46.000> close<00:05:46.180> to<00:05:46.330> call

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
but it's kind of too close to call

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.630 
but it's kind of too close to call
I<00:05:46.780> mean<00:05:47.590> they<00:05:47.650> both<00:05:47.800> sound<00:05:47.980> like<00:05:48.100> my<00:05:48.310> annoying

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.640 
I mean they both sound like my annoying

it's hard for you guys cuz you're out
over<00:05:53.770> YouTube<00:05:54.640> and<00:05:54.880> compressed<00:05:55.300> audio<00:05:55.510> button

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020

here<00:05:56.620> live<00:05:57.900> I'm<00:05:58.900> really<00:05:59.260> hard-pressed<00:05:59.710> to

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
here live I'm really hard-pressed to

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.730 
here live I'm really hard-pressed to
hear<00:06:00.550> much<00:06:01.150> of<00:06:01.390> a<00:06:01.450> difference<00:06:01.870> at<00:06:02.080> all<00:06:02.230> yeah

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
hear much of a difference at all yeah

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.370 
hear much of a difference at all yeah
and<00:06:02.950> I<00:06:03.400> think<00:06:04.000> you're<00:06:04.180> right<00:06:04.330> that<00:06:04.630> the<00:06:05.110> would

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
and I think you're right that the would

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.140 
and I think you're right that the would
it's<00:06:05.800> kind<00:06:06.070> of<00:06:06.130> a<00:06:06.190> difference<00:06:06.520> that<00:06:06.670> we<00:06:06.820> hear

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
it's kind of a difference that we hear

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.880 
it's kind of a difference that we hear
if<00:06:07.360> anything<00:06:07.870> is<00:06:08.290> the<00:06:08.440> way<00:06:08.560> we<00:06:08.800> would

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:08.890 
if anything is the way we would

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.530 
if anything is the way we would
attribute<00:06:09.130> to<00:06:09.340> the<00:06:09.520> would<00:06:09.700> the<00:06:09.940> only<00:06:10.330> way<00:06:10.480> to

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:10.540 
attribute to the would the only way to

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:11.820 
attribute to the would the only way to
scientifically<00:06:10.990> do<00:06:11.320> it<00:06:11.470> or<00:06:11.680> more

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
scientifically do it or more

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.310 
scientifically do it or more
scientifically<00:06:12.340> is<00:06:12.550> if<00:06:12.730> we<00:06:12.880> could<00:06:13.090> take<00:06:13.450> you

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
scientifically is if we could take you

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.720 
scientifically is if we could take you
know<00:06:14.350> four<00:06:14.620> slices<00:06:14.890> of<00:06:15.160> wood<00:06:15.310> from<00:06:15.430> the<00:06:15.520> same

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:15.730 
know four slices of wood from the same

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.630 
know four slices of wood from the same
board<00:06:15.940> make<00:06:16.600> two<00:06:16.840> matching<00:06:17.260> MOOCs<00:06:17.470> one<00:06:18.310> is<00:06:18.460> a

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:18.640 
board make two matching MOOCs one is a

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.250 
board make two matching MOOCs one is a
12th<00:06:18.910> fret<00:06:19.060> once<00:06:19.300> a<00:06:19.390> 14th<00:06:19.780> fret<00:06:19.930> and<00:06:20.140> then

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:20.260 
12th fret once a 14th fret and then

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.470 
12th fret once a 14th fret and then
compare<00:06:20.680> yeah<00:06:21.340> because<00:06:21.640> having<00:06:21.850> :<00:06:22.210> mango

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:22.480 
compare yeah because having : mango

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.480 
compare yeah because having : mango
makes<00:06:22.660> it<00:06:22.780> more<00:06:22.840> difficult<00:06:22.990> but<00:06:23.590> also<00:06:23.980> it<00:06:24.370> may

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490 
makes it more difficult but also it may

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.070 
makes it more difficult but also it may
be<00:06:24.550> that<00:06:24.820> this<00:06:25.030> issue<00:06:25.270> of<00:06:25.480> moving<00:06:25.750> the<00:06:25.810> bridge

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.640 

it<00:06:29.080> could<00:06:29.290> be<00:06:29.440> that<00:06:29.650> that<00:06:29.680> is<00:06:30.870> amplified<00:06:31.870> by<00:06:32.320> a

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:32.650 
it could be that that is amplified by a

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.320 
it could be that that is amplified by a
factor<00:06:33.100> when<00:06:33.250> you<00:06:33.400> make<00:06:33.550> a<00:06:33.580> guitar<00:06:33.790> that<00:06:34.000> way

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.330 
factor when you make a guitar that way

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.990 
factor when you make a guitar that way
because<00:06:35.170> like<00:06:35.200> the<00:06:35.470> this<00:06:36.190> idea<00:06:36.520> that<00:06:36.700> oh<00:06:36.820> this

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.000 
because like the this idea that oh this

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.850 
because like the this idea that oh this
changes<00:06:37.180> that<00:06:37.540> sound<00:06:37.810> is<00:06:38.050> really<00:06:38.470> a<00:06:38.500> guitar

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860 
changes that sound is really a guitar

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.920 
changes that sound is really a guitar
idea<00:06:39.190> because<00:06:39.490> a<00:06:39.520> twelfth<00:06:40.150> fret<00:06:40.240> or<00:06:40.360> 14th<00:06:40.810> fret

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
idea because a twelfth fret or 14th fret

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.420 
idea because a twelfth fret or 14th fret
guitar<00:06:41.260> does<00:06:41.500> sound<00:06:41.710> quite<00:06:41.890> a<00:06:41.980> bit<00:06:42.130> different

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:42.430 
guitar does sound quite a bit different

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:43.620 
guitar does sound quite a bit different
depending<00:06:42.550> where<00:06:42.850> the<00:06:42.970> bridge<00:06:43.120> goes<00:06:43.360> yeah

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:43.630 
depending where the bridge goes yeah

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.750 
depending where the bridge goes yeah
maybe<00:06:43.900> as<00:06:44.110> you<00:06:44.470> shrink<00:06:44.650> down<00:06:44.950> in<00:06:45.100> ukulele<00:06:45.580> land

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:45.760 
maybe as you shrink down in ukulele land

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.720 
maybe as you shrink down in ukulele land
it<00:06:46.120> has<00:06:46.510> less<00:06:46.810> of<00:06:46.840> an<00:06:47.020> impact<00:06:47.110> and<00:06:47.980> that's<00:06:48.220> I

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:48.730 
it has less of an impact and that's I

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.090 
it has less of an impact and that's I
mean<00:06:49.030> originally<00:06:49.420> guitars<00:06:50.170> were<00:06:50.440> twelve<00:06:50.800> fret

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:51.100 
mean originally guitars were twelve fret

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.070 
mean originally guitars were twelve fret
to<00:06:51.220> the<00:06:51.310> body<00:06:51.490> right<00:06:52.120> and<00:06:52.450> you<00:06:52.750> were<00:06:52.840> telling

squared<00:07:08.500> off<00:07:08.620> the<00:07:08.800> top<00:07:08.980> that<00:07:09.220> this<00:07:09.370> part<00:07:09.610> of

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:09.640 
squared off the top that this part of

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.580 
squared off the top that this part of
the<00:07:09.760> instrument<00:07:10.150> so<00:07:10.810> that<00:07:10.990> it<00:07:11.050> they<00:07:11.380> could

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:11.590 
the instrument so that it they could

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:13.410 
the instrument so that it they could
join<00:07:11.770> at<00:07:11.950> the<00:07:11.980> 14th<00:07:12.400> fret<00:07:12.610> and<00:07:12.910> that<00:07:13.270> was

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:13.420 
join at the 14th fret and that was

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.450 
join at the 14th fret and that was
because<00:07:13.570> on<00:07:14.140> a<00:07:14.530> banjo<00:07:15.130> issed

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:15.460 
because on a banjo issed

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.340 
because on a banjo issed
was<00:07:15.760> getting<00:07:16.450> an<00:07:16.540> instrument<00:07:16.930> made<00:07:17.050> for<00:07:17.230> him

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:17.350 
was getting an instrument made for him

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.560 
was getting an instrument made for him
and<00:07:17.530> because<00:07:18.070> banjo<00:07:18.550> has<00:07:18.940> all<00:07:19.180> the<00:07:19.330> frets

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:19.570 
and because banjo has all the frets

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.300 
and because banjo has all the frets
clear<00:07:19.900> of<00:07:19.990> the<00:07:20.080> body<00:07:20.230> he<00:07:20.710> was<00:07:20.800> used<00:07:21.010> to<00:07:21.100> playing

clear of the body he was used to playing

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.790 
clear of the body he was used to playing
passages<00:07:21.880> that<00:07:22.090> shifted<00:07:23.050> up<00:07:23.230> past<00:07:23.650> the

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:23.800 
passages that shifted up past the

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.590 
passages that shifted up past the
twelfth<00:07:24.070> fret<00:07:24.190> and<00:07:24.490> he<00:07:24.820> didn't<00:07:25.060> like<00:07:25.150> on<00:07:25.330> 12th

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:25.600

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:28.780 
couldn't reach so the first orchestra

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.330 
couldn't reach so the first orchestra
model<00:07:29.050> was<00:07:29.140> made<00:07:29.290> for<00:07:29.410> this<00:07:29.470> banjo<00:07:29.710> player<00:07:30.070> in

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:30.340 
model was made for this banjo player in

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.650 
model was made for this banjo player in
order<00:07:30.550> to<00:07:30.670> give<00:07:30.850> him<00:07:31.030> a<00:07:31.060> little<00:07:31.240> more<00:07:31.360> access

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:31.660 
order to give him a little more access

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.940 
order to give him a little more access
and<00:07:32.440> you<00:07:33.190> know<00:07:33.280> so<00:07:33.490> that's<00:07:33.670> really<00:07:33.970> the<00:07:34.950> the

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:35.950 
and you know so that's really the the

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.400 
and you know so that's really the the
one<00:07:36.190> benefit<00:07:36.790> I<00:07:36.820> would<00:07:37.150> say<00:07:37.390> of<00:07:37.540> the<00:07:37.690> 14th<00:07:38.140> fret

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:38.410 
one benefit I would say of the 14th fret

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:41.160 
one benefit I would say of the 14th fret
body<00:07:38.770> is<00:07:39.100> that<00:07:39.610> you<00:07:39.760> have<00:07:40.030> two<00:07:40.360> more<00:07:40.540> frets<00:07:40.900> of

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:41.170 
body is that you have two more frets of

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:46.380 
body is that you have two more frets of
access<00:07:43.080> on<00:07:44.080> the<00:07:44.320> other<00:07:44.470> hand<00:07:44.830> I<00:07:45.220> think<00:07:46.000> that

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:46.390 
access on the other hand I think that

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.830 
access on the other hand I think that
the<00:07:47.080> ukulele<00:07:47.680> is<00:07:47.950> small<00:07:48.400> enough<00:07:48.670> that

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:48.840 
the ukulele is small enough that

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.510 
the ukulele is small enough that
accessing<00:07:49.840> those<00:07:50.080> upper<00:07:50.500> frets<00:07:50.800> even<00:07:51.280> on<00:07:51.400> the

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:51.520 
accessing those upper frets even on the

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.080 
accessing those upper frets even on the
12<00:07:51.790> is<00:07:52.620> you<00:07:53.620> know<00:07:53.710> pretty<00:07:54.100> easy<00:07:54.430> to<00:07:54.670> do<00:07:54.850> with

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:55.090 
12 is you know pretty easy to do with

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:57.600 
12 is you know pretty easy to do with
your<00:07:55.270> hand<00:07:55.540> you<00:07:55.690> do<00:07:55.840> get<00:07:56.110> two<00:07:56.740> more<00:07:56.920> frets<00:07:57.310> this
