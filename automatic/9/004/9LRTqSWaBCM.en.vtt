00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
an electronic trigger this drum head

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.580 
an electronic trigger this drum head
uses<00:00:47.190> what's<00:00:47.430> called<00:00:47.520> f<00:00:47.969> sr<00:00:48.420> technology<00:00:49.350> which

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
uses what's called f sr technology which

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.369 
uses what's called f sr technology which
stands<00:00:49.890> for<00:00:50.039> force<00:00:50.460> sensing<00:00:51.000> resistor<00:00:51.379> which

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
stands for force sensing resistor which

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.459 
stands for force sensing resistor which
basically<00:00:52.829> means<00:00:53.809> this<00:00:54.809> trigger<00:00:55.170> works

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
basically means this trigger works

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.939 
basically means this trigger works
strictly<00:00:56.100> off<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.520> touch<00:00:56.940> or<00:00:57.329> pressure<00:00:57.949> not

another drum off triggering this has
none<00:01:21.890> of<00:01:21.920> those<00:01:22.159> issues<00:01:24.159> so<00:01:25.159> as<00:01:25.250> you<00:01:25.340> can<00:01:25.520> see

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
none of those issues so as you can see

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.779 
none of those issues so as you can see
in<00:01:26.119> its<00:01:26.869> acoustic<00:01:27.170> setting<00:01:27.679> it<00:01:27.979> sounds<00:01:28.459> great

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
in its acoustic setting it sounds great

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:31.569 
in its acoustic setting it sounds great
as<00:01:29.259> an<00:01:30.259> acoustic<00:01:30.829> head<00:01:31.039> and<00:01:31.250> that<00:01:31.340> was<00:01:31.490> an

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
as an acoustic head and that was an

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:33.789 
as an acoustic head and that was an
important<00:01:32.030> part<00:01:32.240> of<00:01:32.299> this<00:01:32.390> project<00:01:32.689> and<00:01:33.140> had

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
important part of this project and had

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.639

this technology
and<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:18.270> patch<00:02:18.569> like<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.500> drunk<00:02:19.950> kick<00:02:20.250> pad<00:02:20.490> that

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
and a patch like a drunk kick pad that

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.070 
and a patch like a drunk kick pad that
you<00:02:20.850> will<00:02:21.000> adhere<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.569> head<00:02:21.750> where<00:02:21.990> the

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
beater hits so let's take a listen to

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.220 
beater hits so let's take a listen to
this<00:02:25.890> also<00:02:26.550> in<00:02:26.760> its<00:02:26.940> electronic<00:02:27.630> format<00:02:28.050> so

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
this also in its electronic format so

00:02:28.230 --> 00:03:14.479 
this also in its electronic format so
that<00:02:28.260> you<00:02:28.440> can<00:02:28.590> hear<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:28.950> two<00:02:29.100> differences

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.369 

awesome<00:03:15.689> again<00:03:16.689> one<00:03:16.900> of<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.049> unique<00:03:17.319> features

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 
awesome again one of the unique features

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.849 
awesome again one of the unique features
of<00:03:17.799> the<00:03:18.129> in<00:03:18.280> head<00:03:18.579> as<00:03:19.260> that<00:03:20.260> because<00:03:20.650> it

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
of the in head as that because it

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:22.800 
of the in head as that because it
doesn't<00:03:21.189> it<00:03:21.519> only<00:03:21.639> works<00:03:21.909> off<00:03:22.150> of<00:03:22.180> pressure

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
doesn't it only works off of pressure

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.709 
doesn't it only works off of pressure
and<00:03:23.049> touch<00:03:23.290> it<00:03:23.650> will<00:03:24.340> eliminate<00:03:24.670> all<00:03:25.180> of<00:03:25.689> the

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:25.719 
and touch it will eliminate all of the

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:28.379 
and touch it will eliminate all of the
crosstalk<00:03:26.500> and<00:03:26.799> double<00:03:27.189> trigger<00:03:27.430> issues<00:03:28.209> that

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
crosstalk and double trigger issues that

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.659 
crosstalk and double trigger issues that
you<00:03:28.480> might<00:03:28.629> have<00:03:28.950> so<00:03:29.950> you<00:03:30.010> can<00:03:30.250> if<00:03:30.340> you<00:03:30.459> watch

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:30.669 
you might have so you can if you watch

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.670 
you might have so you can if you watch
the<00:03:30.970> level<00:03:31.299> meter<00:03:31.480> on<00:03:31.689> the<00:03:31.810> role<00:03:32.019> in<00:03:32.200> module

the level meter on the role in module

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.800 
the level meter on the role in module
you<00:03:33.519> can<00:03:33.669> see<00:03:33.909> here<00:03:34.329> that<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:36.010> is<00:03:36.159> triggering

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
you can see here that it is triggering

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.929 
you can see here that it is triggering
now<00:03:37.810> if<00:03:37.959> I<00:03:38.079> hit<00:03:38.260> the<00:03:38.439> rim<00:03:38.739> or<00:03:39.159> the<00:03:39.400> side<00:03:39.669> of<00:03:39.849> the

now if I hit the rim or the side of the

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:43.159 
now if I hit the rim or the side of the
shell<00:03:40.379> you'll<00:03:41.379> notice<00:03:41.650> that<00:03:41.829> there<00:03:42.430> is<00:03:42.609> no

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
shell you'll notice that there is no

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:45.750 
shell you'll notice that there is no
triggering<00:03:44.169> going<00:03:44.469> on<00:03:44.650> with<00:03:44.829> the<00:03:45.010> rolling

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
triggering going on with the rolling

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:53.640 
triggering going on with the rolling
unit<00:03:51.209> you<00:03:52.209> can<00:03:52.389> see<00:03:52.599> that<00:03:52.629> the<00:03:52.900> level<00:03:53.230> meter<00:03:53.439> is

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
unit you can see that the level meter is

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.860

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
great feature of this is that you are

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.240 
great feature of this is that you are
playing<00:05:05.909> a<00:05:06.090> real<00:05:06.300> drum<00:05:06.569> head<00:05:06.870> you<00:05:07.620> use<00:05:07.860> this<00:05:08.039> on

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
playing a real drum head you use this on

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.600 
playing a real drum head you use this on
your<00:05:08.490> drums<00:05:08.879> and<00:05:09.300> it's<00:05:10.050> drummers<00:05:10.590> we<00:05:11.129> all<00:05:11.370> want

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
your drums and it's drummers we all want

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.350 
your drums and it's drummers we all want
to<00:05:11.669> feel<00:05:11.879> the<00:05:12.120> physicality<00:05:12.689> of<00:05:13.020> playing<00:05:13.379> drums

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
to feel the physicality of playing drums

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.730 
to feel the physicality of playing drums
sometimes<00:05:15.360> if<00:05:15.509> you're<00:05:15.629> playing<00:05:15.810> electronics

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
sometimes if you're playing electronics

sometimes if you're playing electronics
you<00:05:16.979> lose<00:05:17.189> a<00:05:17.219> little<00:05:17.550> bit<00:05:17.669> of<00:05:17.819> that<00:05:17.939> you're<00:05:18.870> not
