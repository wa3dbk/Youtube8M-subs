00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.529
 what happens gamers welcome to the first 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.149
 channel video let's start with a 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.470
 little bit of guild wars and we're going to 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:10.170
 teach the way to get two 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.760
 chests in fields should give run vale 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.440
 say that in these chests there will not be 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.930
 achievement achievements will come later 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.820
 we will do much more videos possibly 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.220
 let's make videos of all the achievements worth 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.740
 but this time it's just chests we've 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.480
 come to the genda run fields area 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.630
 and you have to come to this waypoint 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.279
 is hung 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.230
 and now nothing simply follow the 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.370
 path that we are going to follow us and 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.359
 is 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.990
 let's see 

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:38.590
 good 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:41.150
 surely we will add a second part of 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.220
 this because there is a chest that yes 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.350
 has the ogre in the same place where 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.200
 let's get these two chests like this 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.890
 is but for now we're going to go up 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.960
 this only 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.030
 and we will try to go a little bit on the rise 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.399
 of the difficulty level starting a 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.390
 little bit with the easy ones and little to 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.230
 little go to the most difficult 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.769
 these are 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.360
 medium not to be very difficult it 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.450
 here the trick is to wait for 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.970
 turn as soon as it has rotated 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.350
 I have started looking at earth seems is 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.119
 that's important is where you are 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.119
 looking is where you're going to go shooting 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.980
 our world 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.380
 If I get it over 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.409
 you have to be us 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.380
 true 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:42.409
 the trick is to not move before 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:46.159
 that pulls up simao of that in 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.569
 how much the platform goes up if you 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.390
 move while you are going up 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:51.799
 You probably see that it is the same 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.140
 that if you move when it's spinning 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.470
 this you have to put right with the 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.070
 wonder to do it 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.440
 perfect now through this wall 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.020
 Here we hope to come out this fire 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.409
 and steam because they put us in this way 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.409
 combat 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.350
 here you jump to you 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.620
 and now it jumps directly to the 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.980
 wall without any fear you go to 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.980
 cross 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.010
 beware of the left fire 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.120
 and now 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.129
 here to see depends on the level you are 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:46.250
 I recommend you not face the 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:49.010
 these fillers put enough things 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.080
 he holds up are pretty strong with 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.879
 the level if you are 80 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.680
 obviously mess with them because that 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:58.900
 at level 30 but beware for example here 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.519
 the jump start here say it 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.019
 then use to the right 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.180
 you will call 4 there is one of them or 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.120
 veterans and I do not recommend it 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.950
 to see first let's go for the easy 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.980
 so yes 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.460
 throw yourself around here beware of this 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.690
 are the ones that are going to be playing 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:21.180
 what the balls that is being 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.700
 when we come to him who has the 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.560
 achievement because if you see these sticks 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.390
 what's up here up here if 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.760
 will have to go up one by one 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.190
 imagine having to go up one by 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.300
 one and those two shooting from afar and 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:38.050
 putting combat mode 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:40.240
 It's a bit long but it 's good 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.150
 as you see here you have in the chest that is 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:46.020
 very easy to say a mentality without 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.390
 jump and you're done 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.700
 actually this chest would not be coming 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:54.350
 over here it would be doing one of those 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.760
 jumps with diving goggles there is 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:00.270
 too complicated I would say but if 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.070
 some day we can climb it we will climb it 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.370
 on Tuesday left door for the 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.370
 left 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.269
 jumping here 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.860
 I'm left scratched because this spikes 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.860
 and I say to see 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.740
 and now to go out where we are 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.400
 let's throw 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.400
 here 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.100
 now you have to adjust the jump here and 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.930
 until it's worth what's coming now 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.260
 We recommend that you put the camera like this 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.290
 as vertical as you can 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.180
 because so to see is recommended but 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.009
 you can do the children simply to 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.869
 calculate the jump 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:52.360
 this will take a while to do with the 

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:55.840
 jump that you have to do but 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.050
 to the link and I know 20 times will come out 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.509
 Quick 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.040
 or even less if this gets used 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:04.240
 rap is missing 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.240
 maybe less is not 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.620
 yes but look look from the right both 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.350
 the time falling 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.949
 it seems that it does not but you start to 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.949
 fall and fall 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:20.430
 if there was not a lot of data for 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.259
 and this because we are going for both 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.199
 chests but if we go for the gold that 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:26.810
 when I did it I went for the achievement 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:29.900
 need two hours 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.920
 I do not imagine after a while the bay 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.640
 until the coconuts 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.640
 mirandÃ©s 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.120
 for her it was theoretically down there is a 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:42.969
 veteran then and they have loaded it 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:46.479
 I hope not so you see the teques 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:50.339
 this yes yes you have something to block me 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:54.099
 I am a chart and I have this here that are 

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:55.749
 two of the soldiers of the legion if they 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:57.009
 you have better anything for 

00:05:55.749 --> 00:06:01.050
 to block 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:01.050
 because this aunt gets on 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.569
 if they see and only receive and more than one 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:10.379
 we would go to the beast the battle is 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:10.379
 as if nothing open 

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:16.330
 and we 're going to upload the video 

00:06:14.739 --> 00:06:18.069
 in the third one only doing the 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:21.579
 third so we make the videos more 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:23.049
 short and much more better for you and 

00:06:21.579 --> 00:06:24.429
 even that is all 

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:26.829
 we hope you liked the video 

00:06:24.429 --> 00:06:28.380
 if you liked to like it 

00:06:26.829 --> 00:06:31.230
 it cost nothing 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:33.840
 and nothing to subscribe if you want more let's go 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:36.900
 to upload guides tutorials reviews of 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:40.520
 new games of han bel bel band which is 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:44.490
 a page of cheap games that they put 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.960
 Usually game packs and gameplays 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.060
 of what you want or if you want 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.900
 that we spend a whole video game what 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.900
 let it be us 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:58.790
 and for me until when they are 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.340
 tactically so nothing like we have 

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:03.940
 said see you in the next video 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.940
 approximate then
