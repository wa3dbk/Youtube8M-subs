00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:10.019
 I would say it is a type of project where 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.769
 architecture can generate an experience 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.769
 sensory 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.350
 initially was a project that was 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.650
 summarizes the equation of the internal 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.019
 factory that were used in the public had 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.570
 contact with production has transformed this 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.820
 project in a visual frame in the landscape 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.730
 gradually we realized that 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.010
 had enormous potential that is that good 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.480
 is the manufacturer of nestle and 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.750
 They called us just for you to have a 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.670
 idea to make an intervention well 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.039
 inside the factory only to 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.559
 solve this question there is a 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.989
 of a million to spend 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.850
 We did the intervention, it was over. 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.190
 being much smaller in the factory than 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.039
 far out of the factory with these 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.480
 walkways towers and the budget 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.480
 went from 8 million 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.280
 The trick of the project would have been I think 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.100
 make two vertical towers and two 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.260
 walkways that connect these accesses 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.340
 that we created for the public are 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.550
 segregated 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.030
 the interior is monumental and almost salary 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.250
 precisely because it has a dimension 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:31.030
 compatible with other external demand 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.790
 all metal and closed plate which does not 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.150
 had she has insulation 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.880
 thermal insulation to reduce 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.410
 incidence of radiation despite using 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.620
 a lot of glass that interested 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:49.210
 reflections and by the tomtom of the light that the magnet 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:51.100
 which could not produce much leaked 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.950
 the structure has many dwellings that 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.010
 have an exaggerated permanent ventilation 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.920
 or make all perforated two sides of the 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.170
 production of perforated sheet as 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.970
 venetian here are semi transparent but 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.410
 also a total ventilation of 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.869
 enough attention not to generate more 1 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.880
 that there is a greenhouse or 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.320
 quality of the material that interested 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.930
 it was a virus 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:20.620
 When we covered with the glass he 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.590
 idea that these reflexes are all 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.680
 would have of the dutra of that 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.690
 landscapes that were cropped reflections 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.780
 the glass itself filters the light and 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.670
 internal environment very different feeling 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.100
 in this experience for those who 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.540
 visit a kind of introduction to 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:42.540
 who is going to enter that route more 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.540
 scenographic 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.070
 the whole factory proposal was like this is the 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.450
 Fantastic chocolate factory the people 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:56.280
 proposed to make some windows and was well 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.020
 the proposal that we are not going to 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.480
 close everyone opens windows 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.670
 specific pieces 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.950
 Where are we even talking about this? 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.230
 enters a forest forest with 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.740
 photos of the cocoa and the leaves after 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:14.040
 win between seeing the windows with the 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:17.130
 cows and in those tubes that show 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.260
 that the production at the end of the route 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.690
 you see how it is produced that 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.050
 chocolate specifically also understand 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.280
 a little is the chuchu the history of 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.650
 I think chocolate was the first 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.580
 project that we actually noticed 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:35.220
 which often our role beyond 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:39.840
 only draw and design is really 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.790
 understanding the problem as a whole is 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.220
 What is the customer's desire? 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.820
 but it was interesting so it's about to see 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.890
 that you are for having this notion that 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.959
 you are unique the architect is 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.300
 often the only person capable of 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.550
 understand the process as a whole then 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.010
 in the end, we people 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.260
 has returned this demand from a 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.739
 another shape with another size with a 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:07.470
 another dimension of how far I know fan 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.150
 very worth it but for them the 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.959
 end result was very satisfactory 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.959
 for everybody
