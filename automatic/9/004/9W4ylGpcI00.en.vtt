in<00:00:12.990> this<00:00:13.110> topper<00:00:13.440> pack<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:13.969> pretty<00:00:14.969> much<00:00:15.000> i

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
in this topper pack and pretty much i

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.970 
in this topper pack and pretty much i
think<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:16.049> worst<00:00:16.289> ones<00:00:16.560> that<00:00:16.710> get<00:00:16.800> would<00:00:16.949> be

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
think the worst ones that get would be

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.040 
think the worst ones that get would be
like<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.550> quarterback<00:00:18.000> that's<00:00:18.420> that's<00:00:18.990> not

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
like a quarterback that's that's not

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.410 
like a quarterback that's that's not

live<00:05:24.570> let's<00:05:24.930> open<00:05:25.230> it<00:05:25.320> see<00:05:25.530> what<00:05:25.650> we<00:05:25.740> get<00:05:25.890> I

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
live let's open it see what we get I

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.430 
live let's open it see what we get I
don't<00:05:27.240> know<00:05:27.300> if<00:05:27.360> it's<00:05:27.480> just<00:05:27.630> one<00:05:27.840> card<00:05:28.110> or<00:05:28.260> what

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
don't know if it's just one card or what

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.830 
don't know if it's just one card or what
and<00:05:28.710> it's<00:05:29.130> one<00:05:29.310> card<00:05:29.610> and<00:05:29.880> it's<00:05:30.090> an<00:05:30.240> auto<00:05:30.390> gram

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
and it's one card and it's an auto gram

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.560 
and it's one card and it's an auto gram
so<00:05:31.470> I<00:05:31.500> I<00:05:32.100> figured<00:05:32.520> it<00:05:32.640> would<00:05:32.760> be<00:05:32.790> a<00:05:33.150> quarterback

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
so I I figured it would be a quarterback

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.800 
so I I figured it would be a quarterback
I<00:05:34.230> was<00:05:35.040> hoping<00:05:35.190> not<00:05:35.550> George<00:05:36.090> Blanda<00:05:36.419> or

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
I was hoping not George Blanda or

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.880 
I was hoping not George Blanda or
anything<00:05:37.169> like<00:05:37.200> that<00:05:37.400> but<00:05:38.400> uh<00:05:39.650> Holograms<00:05:40.650> not

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
anything like that but uh Holograms not

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.260 
anything like that but uh Holograms not
too<00:05:41.100> bad<00:05:41.280> he's<00:05:41.460> not<00:05:41.490> the<00:05:41.730> worst<00:05:41.850> quarterback

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
too bad he's not the worst quarterback

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.940 
too bad he's not the worst quarterback
to<00:05:42.540> get<00:05:42.720> I<00:05:42.900> can<00:05:43.110> at<00:05:43.200> least<00:05:43.320> selling<00:05:43.680> for<00:05:43.860> like
