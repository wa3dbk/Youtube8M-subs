00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.590
 for many you are the benchmark 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.119
 successful person on the track then their 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.070
 opinions they think you are successful 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.289
 the media will recognize you 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.810
 you are an idol to many people 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:36.899
 what is success for you and 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:40.460
 and consider yourself a successful person but I 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:44.960
 I consider myself of course a successful person 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:51.090
 although success may be different for everyone 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:56.560
 its success yes but I think what success is 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:01:01.350
 for me, success is when 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:05.370
 you have to seize the family 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:10.180
 beloved people that surround you when 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:13.000
 you have children baby i have 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.750
 alexander is 14 years old 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.110
 love much 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.210
 although he himself is already in another city but I 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:24.540
 I often see them here 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:30.190
 my favorite job I train people 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:32.140
 helping to understand myself 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.530
 how to do bodybuilding and 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:39.010
 so on and perform and competitions in 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:43.840
 Basically, I do what I love here 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.770
 trying to make money in their field 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.170
 your business 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.200
 Here and I have favorite people who 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:54.250
 I am surrounded but I consider it a success 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.590
 but natural in place we do not stand 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.430
 because you want 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:04.119
 and in the material base in the realm of self 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:07.649
 a little higher understand yes, but I think 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:11.050
 that the most important thing was spiritual 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.480
 balance that's when you have it 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.390
 inside when you know that you have everything 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.900
 good at home when you are fine 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:24.030
 work then I think it's successful 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:27.010
 people like that 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.890
 the next question on this happens 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.569
 substitution of the concept of masculinity and 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.760
 not even the media are to blame 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.670
 although also involved in it themselves 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.380
 parents yes I mean mom 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.160

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.380

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.990
 but at the same time everyone forgot the Soviet 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.100

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.620
 The person from physical education is not engaged 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.320
 accordingly and spiritually it will be but now 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.620
 in fact, here we have our miracle 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.870
 things happen in the state that 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.930

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.890
