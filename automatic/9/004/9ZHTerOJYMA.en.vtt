00:00:01.659 --> 00:00:07.019
Most of us wouldn't give earthworms a second glance, but not emma Sherlock

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:14.639
Earthworms are her passion you see Emma is curator of worms at the natural history Museum in London

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.948
not only that she's president of the earthworm society of britain as

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:26.669
[Emma] is about to reveal. There's far more to the humble earthworm than first meets the eye

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:35.249
Most people think we've only got one species of earthworm [in] the uk, but that's really not true

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.279
We actually have about 27 different species

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.369
We've got stumpy green ones

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.879
And they're bright green stripy ones these ones when they stretch out you'll really see the stripes on them

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.520
We call them tiger worms because of the strikes we've got pink ones. We've got grey ones

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.239
We've got ones with black heads

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.959
We've got some deep red ones some a really large sort of 30 centimeters in length

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.969
Right down to some adults being just a few centimetres so massive diversity

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.779
Surprisingly scientists like Emma know very little about the distribution of these different earthworm species

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.860
Sampling the worms in your garden can help fill in these gaps

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.989
The best way to sample earthworms really. It's just to dig a hole in [the] ground so I don't really dig around the plot

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.240
Pull out the square

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.170
I've dug and then just go through it and try and see how many earthworms are in here and in a plot this size

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.299
Potentially it could be 50 100. Maybe even if it was a really really rich batch

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.489
Maybe even up to 200 earthworms

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:48.269
So in an area the [size] of a football field [you] [could] get maybe as many as 2 million earthworms

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.770
All gardeners may that earthworms are really really good for the soil

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:03.150
But the reason that is is because they are borrowing down into the soil. They're letting air in letting carbon dioxide out

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.600
Earthworms are the recyclers of the planet?

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:14.699
They are breaking down all the organic rubbish and releasing all those nutrients back into the soil to be used again [by] the plants

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.990
Without earthworms in our soils life will pretty quickly dry up

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:28.410
Earthworms aren't just good for the soil. They're juicy muscular bodies are perfect food for lots of other wildlife

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.149
Birds just can't resist them

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.420
[Badgers] gorge on them

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.049
60% of their diet is made up of worms and

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.580
Moles well they can eat 50 grams of worms a day

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.780
It does seem they get rather picked on by other animals

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.540
one neat Little trick

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.909
I'm gonna Share with you is something to actually get the deep bearing worth worms to the surface

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:07.049
Without the heavy digging, and that's this what I've done here is mix mustard powder with water

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.220
Maybe around 2 tablespoons per liter in a half bottle and then pour it on the ground

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.929
What this technique does is it just irritates the worm slightly so they come up to the surface?

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:29.820
Earthworm Behavior is also fascinating not least the way they reproduce I'll let Emma explain

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.829
Earthworms are hermaphrodites that means they have male and female parts

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.410
But they still sexually reproduce so they find another earthworm kind of glue themselves

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.790
Together pass each other sperm and then when they've broken off

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.779
They then each produce a cocoon which then sits in the soil until the conditions are right and then the babies Emerge

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.060
I

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.780
love earthworms because they're so

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.500
Amazingly important for our soils. There's such fascinating animals and when you actually start to look at them

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.370
It's amazing the diversity

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:13.340
And variety of them the sizes the colors the different jobs that they all do and yet no one's out there looking at them

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.879
And they're working so hard under our feet [I]

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.540
Hope you see them in a different light now

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.630
you
