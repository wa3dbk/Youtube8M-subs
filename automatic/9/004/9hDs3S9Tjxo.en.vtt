let us begin The Edge of Darkness based
upon<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.520> trailer<00:02:15.090> I<00:02:15.270> really<00:02:15.780> thought<00:02:15.930> was

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
upon the trailer I really thought was

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.050 
upon the trailer I really thought was
gonna<00:02:16.200> be<00:02:16.260> old<00:02:16.500> Mel<00:02:16.739> going<00:02:17.489> out<00:02:17.610> with<00:02:17.760> people

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
gonna be old Mel going out with people

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.150 
gonna be old Mel going out with people
killing<00:02:18.750> them<00:02:18.870> shooting<00:02:19.200> him<00:02:19.380> knocking<00:02:20.040> him

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
killing them shooting him knocking him

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.580 
killing them shooting him knocking him
dead<00:02:20.430> but<00:02:20.940> it<00:02:21.000> really<00:02:21.180> wasn't<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:21.510> at<00:02:21.690> all<00:02:21.810> it

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
dead but it really wasn't that at all it

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.920 
dead but it really wasn't that at all it
was<00:02:22.709> kind<00:02:22.950> of<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.160> slower<00:02:23.760> story<00:02:24.209> but<00:02:24.630> it<00:02:24.840> was

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
was kind of a slower story but it was

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.979 
was kind of a slower story but it was
still<00:02:25.140> good<00:02:25.290> movie<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:26.070> was<00:02:26.190> surprisingly

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
still good movie it was surprisingly

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.630 
still good movie it was surprisingly
good<00:02:27.989> I<00:02:28.260> think<00:02:28.440> that<00:02:28.709> it<00:02:28.770> was<00:02:28.860> very<00:02:28.920> nice<00:02:29.340> they

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
good I think that it was very nice they

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.430 
good I think that it was very nice they
were<00:02:29.700> trying<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.090> show<00:02:30.360> of<00:02:30.690> his<00:02:30.870> relationship

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
were trying to show of his relationship

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.530 
were trying to show of his relationship
with<00:02:31.470> his<00:02:31.709> daughter<00:02:31.890> however<00:02:32.430> not<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.390> be

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
with his daughter however not to be

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.060 
with his daughter however not to be
totally<00:02:33.930> callous<00:02:34.350> but<00:02:34.530> I<00:02:34.560> think<00:02:34.830> from<00:02:34.980> a

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
totally callous but I think from a

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.100 
totally callous but I think from a
filmmaking<00:02:35.489> of<00:02:35.700> perspective<00:02:36.270> it<00:02:36.660> just<00:02:36.750> slowed

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
filmmaking of perspective it just slowed

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.720 
filmmaking of perspective it just slowed
the<00:02:37.260> movie<00:02:37.500> down<00:02:37.620> too<00:02:37.860> much<00:02:38.040> it<00:02:38.370> was<00:02:38.489> shot

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
the movie down too much it was shot

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.850 
the movie down too much it was shot
beautifully<00:02:39.450> which<00:02:39.630> I'm<00:02:39.959> really<00:02:40.290> usually
