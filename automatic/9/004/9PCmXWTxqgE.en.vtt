 months already that the very first robot 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.580
 Congolese routis took office 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.920

 kinshasa to journalists from the fp this 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.250
 robot two meters fifty high 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.690
 is now part of the daily life of

 pedestrians 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.719
 at the origin of this machine or even 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.520
 technology an association founded for 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.890
 help Congolese women engineers

 Theresa ima is at the head of a team 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.030
 of 7 people and finance thanks to its

 own company the first android 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.600
 she hopes to be able to create jobs 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.870
 but also flooded the market

 international tea took 0 handsome world 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.769
 several robots putting domec is a 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.659
 robot that is doing the 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.010
 road safety is a robot that is 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.890
 in the process of regulating the road 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.979
 serum to congo medina then we too 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.530
 we must also take our 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.210
 intelligence to make sell meaning and 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.830
 in other countries of central africa 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.990
 as also elsewhere why not to 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.509
 united states why not in europe and 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.640
 asia the cost of making a 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.799
 copy is around 15 thousand dollars 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.509
 equipped with solar panels to ensure 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.670
 its autonomy is designed in aluminum 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.530
 to resist the equatorial climate 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.170
 the robot is equipped with electronics 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.590
 push when the streets to the cards 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.720
 image using a transmission ip it 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.280
 sends his recent and trial in the 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.430
 centers and that we are tempted - district 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.830
 is free and these data will allow 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.380
 but only to pursue people who 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.060
 are going to make term infractions these 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.860
 data will be sent to the police a 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.600
 good way to reduce accidents 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.990
 but also to generate revenue for 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.000
 the state 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.649
 madam insa intends to sell his product

 to communities through these two 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.820
 arguments in this megalopolis of 10 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.530
 million people the circulation is 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.569
 chaotic the code of the road not 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.910
 always respected and the police very 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:16.440
 strongly contested but this robot does 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.450
 for the moment unanimity and well 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.920
 when it closes the traffic you 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.019
 notice that everyone stops and 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.090
 pedestrians cross without problem that 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.799
 god bless those who invented them the 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.900
 policemen bother us too much there 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:33.090
 only the robots work a 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.709
 robot appreciated and listened to a circulation 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.930
 easier in the streets of kinshasa 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.440
 is not yet enough to lead the 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.440
 eyes closed
