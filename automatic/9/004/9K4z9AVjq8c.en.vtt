00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
taking a joint support formula so just

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
favorite to energy products I really

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.360 
favorite to energy products I really
like<00:02:18.960> that<00:02:18.990> and<00:02:19.380> then<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.950> focus

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
like that and then the focus

phenylalanine<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.330> methyl<00:02:22.320> tyramine<00:02:22.710> I<00:02:22.950> like

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
phenylalanine and methyl tyramine I like

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.060 
phenylalanine and methyl tyramine I like
those<00:02:23.430> boat<00:02:23.670> nmt<00:02:24.000> so<00:02:24.810> that's<00:02:24.990> good<00:02:25.200> nmt<00:02:25.920> I

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
those boat nmt so that's good nmt I

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.530 
those boat nmt so that's good nmt I
never<00:02:26.370> really<00:02:26.520> got<00:02:26.610> that<00:02:26.670> much<00:02:27.030> out<00:02:27.210> of<00:02:27.270> but<00:02:27.480> I

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
never really got that much out of but I

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.080 
never really got that much out of but I
like<00:02:27.810> peña<00:02:28.560> so<00:02:29.280> I'm<00:02:29.340> gonna<00:02:29.460> say<00:02:29.610> that<00:02:29.790> that's<00:02:29.970> a

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
like peña so I'm gonna say that that's a

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.670 
like peña so I'm gonna say that that's a
good<00:02:30.240> blood<00:02:30.450> overall<00:02:31.110> I<00:02:31.140> think<00:02:31.260> this<00:02:31.500> is<00:02:31.650> a

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
good blood overall I think this is a

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.140 
good blood overall I think this is a
very<00:02:31.770> well<00:02:32.190> put<00:02:32.340> together<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:32.640> pre-workout<00:02:33.090> I

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
very well put together a pre-workout I

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.910 
very well put together a pre-workout I
think<00:02:33.390> it's<00:02:33.480> definitely<00:02:33.690> worth<00:02:34.020> a<00:02:34.140> try<00:02:34.380> the

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
think it's definitely worth a try the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.100 
think it's definitely worth a try the
watermelon<00:02:35.490> is<00:02:35.580> very<00:02:35.790> good<00:02:36.000> tasting<00:02:36.510> so

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
watermelon is very good tasting so

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.990 
watermelon is very good tasting so
overall<00:02:37.920> I'd<00:02:38.040> say<00:02:38.070> this<00:02:38.400> is<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:38.610> complete

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
overall I'd say this is a complete

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.670 
overall I'd say this is a complete
formula<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.720> even<00:02:40.320> though<00:02:40.380> it's<00:02:40.530> in<00:02:40.620> a

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
formula and even though it's in a

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.400 
formula and even though it's in a
proprietary<00:02:41.520> blend<00:02:41.670> I<00:02:42.240> think<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.260> it<00:02:43.380> is

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
proprietary blend I think that it is

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.230 
proprietary blend I think that it is
adequately<00:02:43.890> dose<00:02:44.160> based<00:02:44.370> on<00:02:44.610> my<00:02:44.760> educated

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
adequately dose based on my educated

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.449 
adequately dose based on my educated
guess<00:02:45.390> there's<00:02:46.050> no<00:02:46.230> huge<00:02:46.770> blends<00:02:47.130> I<00:02:47.280> have<00:02:47.370> this

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
guess there's no huge blends I have this

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.520 
guess there's no huge blends I have this
one<00:02:47.670> product<00:02:47.940> I<00:02:48.150> got<00:02:48.270> the<00:02:48.390> other<00:02:48.480> day<00:02:48.600> that<00:02:48.989> was

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
one product I got the other day that was

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.430 
one product I got the other day that was
literally<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:50.150> blend<00:02:51.150> included<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.810> freakin

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
literally the blend included the freakin

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.320 
literally the blend included the freakin
other<00:02:52.650> ingredients<00:02:53.370> too<00:02:53.580> I'm<00:02:53.790> not<00:02:54.090> hip<00:02:54.300> to

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
other ingredients too I'm not hip to

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.420 
other ingredients too I'm not hip to
that<00:02:54.480> but<00:02:55.320> this<00:02:55.500> actually<00:02:55.680> has<00:02:55.950> a<00:02:55.980> really<00:02:56.220> good

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
that but this actually has a really good

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.100 
that but this actually has a really good
blend<00:02:56.700> you<00:02:57.150> could<00:02:57.270> tell<00:02:57.450> pretty<00:02:57.720> much<00:02:57.930> how

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
blend you could tell pretty much how

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.870 
blend you could tell pretty much how
