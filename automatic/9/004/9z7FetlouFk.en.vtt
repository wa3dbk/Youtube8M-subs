 sts method of therapeutic bodybuilding the 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.830
 term sts originates from the expression in 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.210
 English to designate 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.850
 strength training 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.680
 The purpose of this method is to maintain and 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.779
 development of the functional 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.480
 physiotherapist talita map of the 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.730
 precursors in the use of the sts method 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.739
 in southern jaraguá account of the importance 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.380
 to carry out daily activities of

 without damaging the body or the 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.129
 The objective of this method is to 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.860
 maintenance and development of 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.200
 functional ie you have to have strength 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.719
 day to day to support diverse 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.340
 activities sometimes so you have 55 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.949
 You have to run to get some 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.469
 thing has to climb a flight of stairs 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.210
 very fast you have to get a weight 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.730
 And you have to have strength in your 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.489
 muscles to support this. 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.260
 without causation on the benefits of 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.909
 Talita method counts that besides 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.729
 respect the conditioning of each 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.290

 that after 14 months of practice is more 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.909
 than satisfied with the results after 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.579
 I had surgery with two 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.290
 and has been indicated by the 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.190
 doctors in making

 professional to do that and I am 14 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.740
 months making this the bodybuilding 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.690
 results were surprising. 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.950
 besides you have surgery it is also 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.820

 bodybuilding and it is well 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.300
 determinant because of the glucose that 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.570
 low when I do weight training is a 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.209
 excellent benefit for lowering blood glucose

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:55.739
 body preparation for resistance 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:58.890
 physics is is to have more today the choir I 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:02.510
 I walk and more than five kilometers do 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.709
 it three times a week and more 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.630
 bodybuilding therapy 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.000
 a dermatologist alessandra quinta who 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.580
 already practiced exercises before sought 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.350
 in the method sts a better suitability of 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.680
 times in your routine and how I always 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.239
 I took a class with a personal is the demand of the 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.549
 talita came from a need for 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.049
 adaptation of time and also because I 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.510
 I heard comments about the work 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.070
 it is her responsibility and this 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.750
 the most recent work of the 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.209
 metabolic advice makes about five 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.860
 months we started she launched the 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.450
 challenge because it is a different proposal 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.400
 it also depends on me of my 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.590
 discipline not only that I go there and she 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.049
 seek the exercise while I'm there and 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.030
 I decided to accept the proposal and I did not 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.950
 sorry alexandre is still comments like 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.870
 was the adaptation of this new 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.299
 exercises and food 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.250
 based on this that extent it does is 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.500
 the level of physical activity and 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.390
 that we have made a 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.880
 new proposal then my activity 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.170
 physics is no longer twice a 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.930
 week 30 minutes for once 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.760
 per week an hour with her and furthermore 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.390
 I have two more tasks during the 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.069
 week 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.260
 one of them I ended up choosing to do 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.819
 Pilates class I really like 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.300
 pilates because of the posture of the 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:15.880
 stretching and the other task is 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.700
 free I end up doing it alone with 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.109
 relation to food is the first 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.850
 week was a bit strange some 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.230
 new things that I was accustomed to 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.900
 eat but from the moment you 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.270
 realize that you're better off being 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.100
 feels lighter not only in the sense of 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.530
 weight but lighter as a whole more 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.300
 more agile we end up at 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.030
 sometimes even eating more than you eat before 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.440
 more healthier foods and when 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.540
 begins to realize that the result is 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.880
 being good is more a reason for us 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.440
 continue persevering to have discipline 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.240
 so this is it folks if you want 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.280
 health and physical well-being 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.200
 look for a qualified professional 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.200
