00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.529
 hello everyone hello everyone and welcome 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:13.280
 well you remember the tree that we can 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.280
 truth we have here in the garden quoted the 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.560
 house entrance 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.700
 and we have been trying for a few years 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.190
 I have to say 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.650
 taking care of him a little 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.810
 to have shade we did a test 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.680
 structural that was necessary because 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.790
 you see the thickest branch, not the main one 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.420
 Well, I was taking one included 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:37.550
 of an already exaggerated inclination almost 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.910
 he touched a branch on the ground and 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.400
 tears and other faults well then if 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.130
 he was lying down so we made him a 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.230
 it was a bit drastic to leave the 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.360
 the main branches up 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.260
 straight lines so that he retakes his 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.260
 its original form 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.470
 and let's go a little bit to keep 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.130
 shapes 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.130
 good 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.250
 Now that he keeps a little bit of 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.340
 Balance 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.870
 we logically removed some branches a 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.870
 little bit thick you see there 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.310
 and they have left you can appreciate all 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.950
 the pacifiers that have come out all 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.230
 These pretty things you have here and then 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.570
 all those twigs 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.940
 now that we take them off we will take advantage of 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.390
 leave 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:31.830
 Some that interest us in the future 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.450
 for depends on the thickness that of the branches 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.700
 that we want to leave the tree or in the 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.470
 address that we want that the exit 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.050
 new branch we can take advantage of and leave them 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.740
 and those that do not remove them do not leave them all 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.150
 because the only thing he does is that is why 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.030
 pacifiers the only thing they do is take 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.330
 force the tree and branch without any 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.330
 they are not 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.200
 eleva we are going to remove it 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.549
 and we will leave the main le 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.720
 we leave earlier and we see some that we 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.340
 interest then 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.650
 we are leaving it to go 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.360
 taking the new form 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:09.440
 come on, let's go with them 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:12.440
 we see how it is truly branched 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.350
 everything sprouted out there because that's what 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.200
 let's remove and we're going to leave this 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.569
 is that there is here at the tip 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.370
 at that end of the fat branch that 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.379
 we cut course of the 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.550
 up and that means new ones that are 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:27.069
 going out and that 's outside we do not 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.760
 they are interested in new shoots that are 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.760
 too low 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.319
 we have already removed all those who 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:41.989
 I had that we did not like 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.989
 we have left him in that new point 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.909
 last year two years ago we have 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.890
 left there the buds have come out 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:53.400
 new of course that branch we want 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.400
 keep it 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.450
 the new ones that are coming out 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.640
 in which we have conserved 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.620
 is the old one is sprouting also 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.989
 although it has the seed is still and what 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.420
 good that the tour pulling a little 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.360
 it is already 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.550
 there in the middle we have also left to 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.160
 plug that gap 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.750
 that there has been so much space without 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.960
 no bud we have left you there are two or 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.960
 three 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.310
 and then of course from each branch to 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.000
 as they aging because 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.710
 new shoots will come out and it will close 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.700
 that calm I had and so great the in 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.170
 the branch 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.959
 down here we have removed them 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.060
 everyone down here does not interest us they look 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.280
 two little white dots where the teams 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.840
 we are not interested in any of that because 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.420
 The only thing it does is to detract from 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.310
 long and if we have removed the branches 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.840
 low is not to let it go now 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.260
 plus 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:54.290
 well there we have the shots in the 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.700
 soil that we have removed that are the 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.790
 buds had to be removed already 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.280
 a week ago at least but I did not 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.450
 he gave time so his thing is to take it 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.910
 one more they start to come out they are 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.099
 Semitic little more than two or three four 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.830
 gigas and with the nail pinching a 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:11.330
 little bit is very easy to start if 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.590
 leave as I have since I left 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.290
 I am that you use a knife and a 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.680
 knife or tweezers that cut very 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:22.760
 well while letting you have them 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:25.070
 clear what kind of bonsai or things 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.470
 of those but they have to cut very well 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.000
 Just do not make no tears 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.450
 cause injuries that then come out 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.770
 diseases and bugs and pests 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:37.300
 Well, he has already removed them 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.860
 so we pick it up 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.909
 and the history golitos 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.909
 now yes yes 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:50.900
 ready and prepared 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.520
 At least I calculate 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.530
 it's good that maybe I do not turn to 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.900
 touch and we'll see I do not know what happened for 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:01.190
 there some accident I think that I already 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:03.910
 I let him pull by his in a natural way 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.910
 good 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.200
 Well, nothing else, you've seen it, I hope 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.690
 that serves somebody and that has 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.690
 liked come on then
