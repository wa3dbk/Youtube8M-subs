seven modes with you we already know
what<00:00:19.310> the<00:00:19.400> Ionian<00:00:19.910> and<00:00:20.119> Aeolian<00:00:20.720> are<00:00:20.869> but<00:00:21.439> I'm

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
what the Ionian and Aeolian are but I'm

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.409 
what the Ionian and Aeolian are but I'm
gonna<00:00:21.710> show<00:00:21.919> you<00:00:21.980> how<00:00:22.160> all<00:00:22.400> seven<00:00:23.090> of<00:00:23.210> these

gonna show you how all seven of these

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:26.620 
gonna show you how all seven of these
modes<00:00:23.779> live<00:00:24.500> within<00:00:25.009> a<00:00:25.279> C<00:00:25.610> major<00:00:25.880> scale<00:00:26.180> now

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
modes live within a C major scale now

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.950 
modes live within a C major scale now
the<00:00:27.470> C<00:00:27.680> major<00:00:27.890> scale<00:00:28.210> the<00:00:29.210> two<00:00:29.419> octave<00:00:29.840> one

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
the C major scale the two octave one

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.450 
the C major scale the two octave one
that<00:00:30.079> we<00:00:30.140> learn<00:00:30.349> goes<00:00:30.710> like<00:00:30.860> this<00:00:31.040> let<00:00:31.219> me<00:00:31.250> show

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
now I'm gonna play all seven modes

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.080 
now I'm gonna play all seven modes
within<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.140> C<00:00:49.380> major<00:00:49.560> scale<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.580> first<00:00:50.850> one

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
within that C major scale the first one

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.320 
within that C major scale the first one
is<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.360> Ionian<00:00:51.870> what<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.140> know<00:00:52.320> already

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.330 
is the Ionian what you know already

00:00:53.330 --> 00:01:05.410 
is the Ionian what you know already
you'll<00:00:54.330> see<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.780> sea

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.210 

now<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.479> mode<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.680> based<00:01:07.890> off<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
now the mode that is based off the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.039 
now the mode that is based off the
second<00:01:08.729> degree<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.240> major<00:01:09.420> scale<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:10.020> the

second degree of the major scale is the
Dorian<00:01:10.680> mode<00:01:11.299> that<00:01:12.299> would<00:01:12.420> start<00:01:12.630> on<00:01:12.750> D<00:01:12.960> in

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
Dorian mode that would start on D in

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:22.490 
Dorian mode that would start on D in
this<00:01:13.200> case<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.799> go<00:01:14.100> up<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.460> D

we've<00:02:26.920> learned<00:02:27.130> already<00:02:27.280> that's<00:02:28.000> going<00:02:28.180> to

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
we've learned already that's going to

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:39.920 
we've learned already that's going to
throw<00:02:28.330> it<00:02:28.420> on<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.810> and<00:02:29.170> go<00:02:29.260> back<00:02:29.470> to<00:02:29.620> a

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
Locrian mode let's go start with B up to

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:58.559 
Locrian mode let's go start with B up to
being<00:02:47.080> back<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:58.090> then<00:02:58.270> it<00:02:58.360> just<00:02:58.450> repeats

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
being back and then it just repeats

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.559 
being back and then it just repeats
itself<00:02:59.020> back<00:02:59.290> up<00:02:59.319> to<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.680> root<00:02:59.800> again<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.190> C

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
let me play through all seven modes

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.370 
let me play through all seven modes
within<00:03:06.910> that<00:03:07.000> C<00:03:07.269> major<00:03:07.510> scale<00:03:07.750> again<00:03:07.900> here

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
within that C major scale again here

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:18.330 
within that C major scale again here
they<00:03:08.500> go

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
now we're gonna start learning how to

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.270 
now we're gonna start learning how to
play<00:03:55.390> these<00:03:55.569> patterns<00:03:55.989> around<00:03:56.140> the<00:03:56.440> neck<00:03:56.709> in

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
play these patterns around the neck in

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.979 
play these patterns around the neck in
different<00:03:57.640> places<00:03:57.849> but<00:03:58.090> for<00:03:58.150> now<00:03:58.540> I<00:03:58.569> want<00:03:58.900> you
