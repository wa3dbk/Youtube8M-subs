00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
horrible it's actually located in a good

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.580 
horrible it's actually located in a good
area<00:03:42.519> it's<00:03:42.670> located<00:03:43.239> right<00:03:43.329> by<00:03:43.810> where<00:03:44.410> your

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
area it's located right by where your

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.770 
area it's located right by where your
training<00:03:45.130> but<00:03:45.310> if<00:03:45.790> you<00:03:46.000> happen<00:03:46.209> to<00:03:46.420> not<00:03:46.720> have

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
training but if you happen to not have

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.210 
training but if you happen to not have
monkeys<00:03:47.470> and<00:03:47.680> you<00:03:47.799> go

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
monkeys and you go

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.390 
monkeys and you go
mid-round<00:03:49.080> getting<00:03:50.080> this<00:03:50.170> perfect<00:03:50.800> is<00:03:51.010> tough

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
mid-round getting this perfect is tough

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.730 
mid-round getting this perfect is tough
because<00:03:51.780> once<00:03:52.780> you<00:03:52.930> go<00:03:53.080> into<00:03:53.470> that<00:03:53.590> little

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
because once you go into that little

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.740 
because once you go into that little
corner<00:03:54.190> it's<00:03:54.430> you<00:03:54.910> know<00:03:55.030> that's<00:03:55.330> the<00:03:55.480> same

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
corner it's you know that's the same

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.870 
corner it's you know that's the same
pathway<00:03:56.260> going<00:03:56.530> in<00:03:56.710> and<00:03:56.860> out<00:03:56.980> and<00:03:57.550> if<00:03:57.670> you<00:03:57.760> go

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
pathway going in and out and if you go

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.520 
pathway going in and out and if you go
in<00:03:58.030> there<00:03:58.240> and<00:03:58.510> there<00:03:58.930> are<00:03:58.960> zombies<00:03:59.350> behind

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
in there and there are zombies behind

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.210 
in there and there are zombies behind
you

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
you

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.950 
you
you're<00:04:00.640> trapped<00:04:01.060> in<00:04:01.330> there<00:04:01.510> and<00:04:01.720> it's<00:04:01.900> really

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
you're trapped in there and it's really

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.620 
you're trapped in there and it's really
hard<00:04:02.590> to<00:04:02.860> hold<00:04:03.130> off<00:04:03.490> the<00:04:03.850> zombies<00:04:04.300> in<00:04:04.450> that

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
hard to hold off the zombies in that

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.260 
hard to hold off the zombies in that
little<00:04:05.140> corner<00:04:05.590> because<00:04:06.430> it's<00:04:06.700> really<00:04:07.030> not<00:04:07.210> a

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
little corner because it's really not a

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.510 
little corner because it's really not a
big<00:04:07.510> corner<00:04:07.930> the<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:08.650> room<00:04:08.920> that<00:04:09.130> juggernauts

big corner the the room that juggernauts
in<00:04:09.730> there<00:04:09.910> it's<00:04:10.060> not<00:04:10.240> very<00:04:10.510> deep<00:04:10.780> so<00:04:11.250> it's<00:04:12.250> just

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
in there it's not very deep so it's just

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.950 
in there it's not very deep so it's just
a<00:04:12.550> constant<00:04:12.880> wave<00:04:13.360> of<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:13.570> zombies<00:04:13.870> just

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:13.960 
a constant wave of the zombies just

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.530 
a constant wave of the zombies just

get this perk and that's the only reason

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.920 
get this perk and that's the only reason
why<00:04:24.730> I<00:04:24.760> wanted<00:04:25.150> to<00:04:25.270> put<00:04:25.420> on<00:04:25.450> this<00:04:25.600> list<00:04:25.840> because

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930

trying to get it so what I think the
worst<00:04:30.670> perk<00:04:31.180> location<00:04:31.990> is<00:04:32.200> in<00:04:32.680> call<00:04:33.580> duty

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
worst perk location is in call duty

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.420 
worst perk location is in call duty
zombies<00:04:34.300> definitely<00:04:34.990> has<00:04:35.200> to<00:04:35.230> be<00:04:35.560> moon<00:04:36.100> and
