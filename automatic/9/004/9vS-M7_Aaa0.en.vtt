 beginning of this in the new generation 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.360
 of consoles a start that undoubtedly 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.210
 some contrasts quite with the 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.490
 disappointment that supposed dragon age 2 for 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.290
 many fans and it's now when beyond 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.900
 of love at first sight that in the e3 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.920
 2013 conquered the hearts of the public 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.810
 and criticism 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.910
 the bioware guys have been able to do 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.550
 well the homework and the demonstration is 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.590
 dragon age 5 and 6 john standing as 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.450
 sequel to his two dragon ancestors 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.070
 age inquisition presents a plot 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.170
 in which you give yourself has been suddenly 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.630
 invaded by diets interconnected with 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.340
 the veil becoming you are doors 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.770
 of entry for all kinds of demons 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.390
 on the other hand the nations of ordes and 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.220
 ferelden are immersed in a 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.560
 war to control the chapel with the 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.810
 order to rise as children of andrÃ¡s t in 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.789
 this maelstrom of conflicts appears this 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.710
 the chosen one able to direct the 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:47.170
 inquisition and redeem you give your 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.720
 catastrophic institution the duration of 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.000
 the main plot is estimated at 50 60 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.500
 and 70 hours even and if we did 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.780
 all missions and secondary tasks 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.820
 that includes the game we would go to the 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.740
 200 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.960
 these missions will take us for a total 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.330
 of 10 regions divided in turn into 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.860
 small provinces the curiosity is that 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.210
 only one of these regions is already more 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.910
 great than dragon age maps 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.560
 origins and dragon age 2 together but not you 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.150
 worry because as you progress in your 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.650
 adventure you can make your trips more 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.650
 dynamic thanks to the frames 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.879
 depending on the decisions we make 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.319
 both in the dialogues and in the 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.420
 missions we do as we do 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.069
 certain missions will give us access to 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.620
 do one or more other missions 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.019
 we will end up in one of the 40 possible 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.879
 variants that has the end of the game and 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.810
 your first decision comes just before 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.810
 start your adventure 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.670
 human elf dwarf or kunar and these will be 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.620
 the four racial options at the time 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.390
 to create your character and with respect to 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.549
 the classes we can choose between three 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.049
 rogue warrior and magician 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.190
 each of these classes will count to your 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.019
 After four trees 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.819
 specialization combinable with each other 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.010
 to make our staff much more 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.629
 way to play in the playable section 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.430
 highlighted the dynamism of this new 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.620
 delivery that is undoubtedly a point 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.359
 very positive besides the return of the 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.310
 tactical camera with which we can 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.180
 Freeze time and order each 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.739
 character 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.049
 the action you must do 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.299
 from resurrecting a partner to attack 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.010
 with x skill to the character z and up 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.870
 flee if the situation paints 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.609
 really complicated 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.680
 the multiplayer component of dragon age 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.629
 raid is given by a mode 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.760
 cooperative online for four players 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.739
 totally independent of the mode of a 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.180
 player since they will not be shared or 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.099
 skills or objects 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.530
 in this mode we will have to introduce ourselves 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:34.590
 in a series of dungeon stays at 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.569
 more pure rpg style and go overcoming the 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.909
 different parts of these defeating 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:41.099
 their bosses although the main course is in 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:42.659
 the single player campaign there is no doubt 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.579
 which is a good option to play and 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:47.219
 Enjoy a good time in the company of 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:49.530
 your friends regarding the sound section 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:51.389
 the epicity is served and your ears the 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.889
 they will enjoy with the very varied band 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.689
 soundtrack that is run by trevor 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:56.870
 morris and will be strengthened with the 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:59.340
 dubbing and the different sound effects 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.099
 the dubbing is in English with subtitles 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.000
 to Castilian and personally I think 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.590
 very good 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.359
 besides the laborious work that has 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.129
 had behind is something that go wear 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:09.959
 he wanted to teach and so he did in one of 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:12.480
 the trailers of dragon age inquisition 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:15.689
 undoubtedly a titanic work and a 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.130
 amazing result finally for the 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:19.289
 what more resolutions and 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.690
 frames per second the fire moves 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:24.360
 a pretty stable 30 fps is with a 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.240
 1080p resolution playstation 4 and 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.949
 900 p in the case of xbox one the 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.960
 difference between both consoles is almost 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:32.580
 imperceptible and unless you have a 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.710
 comparative front that's still 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.229
 quite complicated you will not perceive 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.270
 no difference as the only downside that 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:41.280
 I can put this excellent dragon 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.770
 knight inquisition is the subject of some 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.840
 bugs and errors are not very significant 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.520
 given the colossal size of the game and what 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.590
 more sure is that since I wear the 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.940
 go solving with patches but 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.830
 It is true that sometimes they can reach 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.830
 slightly stain the degree of 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.449
 excellence that reaches this great game as 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.490
 final conclusion there is no doubt that 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:01.620
 dragon age inquisition is positioned as 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.289
 the best dragon age to date as 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.970
 the best game of 2014 and as a game 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:08.580
 that has nothing to envy others 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.259
 as skyrim or dark souls narratively 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.570
 speaking, this is a story 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:14.370
 deep with many possibilities both 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.320
 inside the main plot as it was 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.620
 of her and in which every good lover of 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.330
 rpg can not resist the territories 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.610
 to explore are immense 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.650
 and they are full of activities to do 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.810
 and if you get bored you can always play 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:31.199
 some games in its multiplayer mode that 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:33.150
 It is nothing but nothing bad without a doubt 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.680
 some for lower has done the homework and 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.599

 duration I have more than enough for 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.289
