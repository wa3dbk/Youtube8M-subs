this planning season when it was so wet
here<00:00:09.710> in<00:00:09.800> Ohio<00:00:10.120> guys<00:00:11.120> were<00:00:11.480> calling<00:00:11.960> having

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
here in Ohio guys were calling having

here in Ohio guys were calling having
trouble<00:00:12.710> closing<00:00:12.950> a<00:00:13.309> slot<00:00:13.610> here<00:00:13.910> in<00:00:14.000> the<00:00:14.059> back

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:14.270 
trouble closing a slot here in the back

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.900 
trouble closing a slot here in the back
with<00:00:14.660> two<00:00:15.170> rubber<00:00:15.410> wheels<00:00:15.740> or<00:00:16.100> two<00:00:16.460> cast

with two rubber wheels or two cast

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.560 
with two rubber wheels or two cast
wheels<00:00:17.650> we<00:00:18.650> put<00:00:18.860> the<00:00:18.980> spike<00:00:19.280> on<00:00:19.490> one<00:00:19.760> side<00:00:20.060> and

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
wheels we put the spike on one side and

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.170 
wheels we put the spike on one side and
it<00:00:21.050> made<00:00:21.230> a<00:00:21.260> huge<00:00:22.100> difference<00:00:22.369> in<00:00:22.790> closing

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180

especially<00:01:01.579> when<00:01:02.059> you<00:01:02.179> put<00:01:02.359> on<00:01:02.449> two<00:01:02.780> spikes

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430

especially when you put on two spikes
Yetta<00:01:04.430> recommends<00:01:05.180> that<00:01:05.239> you<00:01:05.360> go<00:01:05.540> with<00:01:05.720> this

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
Yetta recommends that you go with this

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.090 
Yetta recommends that you go with this
drag<00:01:06.229> chain<00:01:06.620> to<00:01:07.550> sort<00:01:07.820> of<00:01:07.909> smooth<00:01:08.270> out<00:01:09.100> the

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
drag chain to sort of smooth out the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.910 
drag chain to sort of smooth out the
area<00:01:10.670> where<00:01:11.000> the<00:01:11.270> seed<00:01:11.540> is<00:01:11.780> if<00:01:12.409> you<00:01:12.590> go<00:01:12.770> with

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
area where the seed is if you go with

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.789 
area where the seed is if you go with
just<00:01:13.159> with<00:01:13.340> one<00:01:13.579> spike<00:01:14.049> you<00:01:15.049> really<00:01:15.439> I<00:01:15.469> would

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
just with one spike you really I would

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.179 
just with one spike you really I would
not<00:01:15.950> rarely<00:01:16.369> recommend<00:01:16.969> a<00:01:17.060> drag<00:01:17.299> chain<00:01:17.630> but<00:01:18.500> if

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
not rarely recommend a drag chain but if

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:20.920 
not rarely recommend a drag chain but if
you<00:01:19.310> go<00:01:19.430> with<00:01:19.579> two<00:01:19.729> spikes<00:01:20.090> I<00:01:20.360> would<00:01:20.479> recommend

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
you go with two spikes I would recommend

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.600 
you go with two spikes I would recommend
a<00:01:20.990> drag<00:01:21.229> chain<00:01:21.259> this<00:01:21.710> will<00:01:21.890> level<00:01:22.189> out<00:01:22.310> that

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
a drag chain this will level out that

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.709 
a drag chain this will level out that

this is a carbide tip they're really

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.149 
this is a carbide tip they're really
sharp<00:01:49.909> so<00:01:50.119> it<00:01:50.329> slices<00:01:51.079> up<00:01:51.259> the<00:01:51.409> residue<00:01:51.859> and

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
sharp so it slices up the residue and

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.179 
sharp so it slices up the residue and
moves<00:01:52.460> it<00:01:52.609> out<00:01:52.700> of<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:52.909> way<00:01:53.030> at<00:01:53.149> the<00:01:53.240> same<00:01:53.450> time

far

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.139 
far
you<00:02:03.710> just<00:02:03.890> want<00:02:04.100> these<00:02:04.219> residue<00:02:04.700> managers

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
you just want these residue managers

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:06.910 
you just want these residue managers
skimming<00:02:05.689> across<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.229> top<00:02:06.409> of<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:06.619> ground

skimming across the top of the ground

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.059 
skimming across the top of the ground
to<00:02:07.610> move<00:02:07.820> the<00:02:07.970> residue<00:02:08.450> out<00:02:08.479> of<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:08.840> way<00:02:09.069> so

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069

the<00:02:31.730> how<00:02:31.880> you<00:02:31.940> have<00:02:32.510> these<00:02:32.840> residue<00:02:33.319> managers

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
the how you have these residue managers

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.910 
the how you have these residue managers
set<00:02:34.100> is<00:02:34.819> you<00:02:35.060> put<00:02:35.269> your<00:02:35.420> planner<00:02:35.720> down<00:02:36.050> and<00:02:36.800> you

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
set is you put your planner down and you

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.650 
set is you put your planner down and you
go<00:02:37.099> through<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.670> you<00:02:37.700> set<00:02:37.940> these<00:02:38.090> residue

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
go through and you set these residue

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.110 
go through and you set these residue
managers<00:02:39.110> so<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.739> residue<00:02:40.280> manager<00:02:40.790> is<00:02:40.970> this

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
managers so the residue manager is this

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.210 
managers so the residue manager is this
skimming<00:02:41.600> across<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.590> top<00:02:42.800> of<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.010> ground

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
skimming across the top of the ground

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.970 
skimming across the top of the ground
that's<00:02:43.580> all<00:02:43.819> that<00:02:44.090> you<00:02:44.269> want<00:02:44.510> just<00:02:44.840> to<00:02:45.830> get

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
that's all that you want just to get

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.190 
that's all that you want just to get
your<00:02:46.100> residue<00:02:46.549> out<00:02:46.790> of<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:46.970> way<00:02:47.120> if<00:02:47.840> you<00:02:48.019> come

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
your residue out of the way if you come

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.930 
your residue out of the way if you come
to<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.500> front<00:02:48.799> of<00:02:48.860> this<00:02:48.980> residue<00:02:49.459> manager

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.850 
to the front of this residue manager
here<00:02:50.390> you'll<00:02:50.930> see<00:02:51.110> how<00:02:51.230> these<00:02:51.350> residue

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
here you'll see how these residue

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.400 
here you'll see how these residue

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
Tavi they are overlapping so there will

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.990 
Tavi they are overlapping so there will

one<00:04:12.720> here<00:04:12.930> has<00:04:13.200> to<00:04:13.319> go<00:04:13.470> out<00:04:13.709> around<00:04:13.950> the

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
one here has to go out around the

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.090 
one here has to go out around the
no-till<00:04:14.819> colder<00:04:15.299> but<00:04:16.200> the<00:04:16.290> residue<00:04:16.650> managers

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
no-till colder but the residue managers

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.509 
no-till colder but the residue managers
are<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.639> same<00:04:17.910> on<00:04:18.780> both<00:04:18.840> units<00:04:19.519> this

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
are the same on both units this

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.000 
are the same on both units this
particular<00:04:21.269> unit<00:04:21.630> here<00:04:21.840> it<00:04:22.169> can<00:04:22.290> also<00:04:22.410> float

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
particular unit here it can also float

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.940 
particular unit here it can also float
up<00:04:23.310> and<00:04:23.490> down<00:04:23.639> and<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.840> downward<00:04:25.110> motion<00:04:25.560> is

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
up and down and the downward motion is

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.730 
up and down and the downward motion is
stopped<00:04:26.280> by<00:04:26.669> the<00:04:26.700> adjustment<00:04:27.419> pin<00:04:27.600> or<00:04:28.169> you<00:04:28.590> can

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
stopped by the adjustment pin or you can

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.100 
stopped by the adjustment pin or you can
have<00:04:28.889> this<00:04:29.040> one<00:04:29.280> here<00:04:29.550> in<00:04:29.790> a<00:04:29.940> rigid<00:04:30.330> position

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
have this one here in a rigid position

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.500 
have this one here in a rigid position
also<00:04:31.460> the<00:04:32.460> only<00:04:32.790> thing<00:04:32.970> we're<00:04:33.150> showing<00:04:33.360> you

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
also the only thing we're showing you

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.740 
also the only thing we're showing you
here<00:04:33.720> is<00:04:33.960> a<00:04:33.990> difference<00:04:34.470> between<00:04:34.650> a<00:04:35.750> no-till

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
here is a difference between a no-till

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.020 
here is a difference between a no-till
Coulter<00:04:37.229> up<00:04:37.440> front<00:04:37.830> versus<00:04:38.400> without<00:04:39.000> a
