00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.400
 Hello, Welcome to Modest Tastes Cuisine 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.080
 this section is quite easy to make ... 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.080
 and prepared in many regions of Anatolia ... 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.440
 we have a simple dessert recipe 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.280
 "Fig Sleeping" 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.280
 But as always before the materials 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.120
 18 pieces of dried figs (about 200 grams) 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.080
 1 liter milk 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.760
 and 1 tea cup of powdered sugar 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.960
 to suspend; hammered nuts 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.960
 Let's start making our fig sleep after our short material list 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.560
 first of all we leave hot water on our dried figs 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.520
 it will wait for about 10 minutes to soften 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.120
 then we will chop 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.440
 milk is transferred to the pot 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.920
 and now we will set it on fire 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.520
 milk into the middle fire 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.520
 we will not heat much, just like yogurt 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.640
 just warm 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.520
 let's chop our dried figs 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.120
 before stalks 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.800
 let's not be too small 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.440
 let's take our last fig 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.960
 our milk did not boil but warmed up 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.280
 adding sugar 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.240
 because figs contain plenty of sugar 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.240
 we also use a small amount of sugar 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.240
 The sugar will completely melt 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.160
 now we can add figs 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.120
 shortly to be cooked with figs 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.240
 figs begin to soften 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.880
 we are closing the fire, we do not want to boil as we say 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.880
 we are now blending 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.160
 figs completely disintegrated 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.800
 Now we can share it slowly in bowls 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.240
 We have shared it in 6 bowls 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.960
 now we're closing 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.760
 So we put him to sleep, we rest for at least 2 hours 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.760
 2 hours later 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.480
 Our sleep was rested, we want to wake up now 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.120
 we waited for 2 hours, but it would be better if you had to wait one night 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.160
 now we can decorate the service now 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.400

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.760

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.320
 "Fig Sleeping" 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.600
