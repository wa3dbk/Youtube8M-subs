00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.030
 Voters 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.640
 I have prepared you my smallest great 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.620
 How to listen to the Zerg with percent more where stuck and goes with the 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.039
 Larvae injection 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:12.749
 and we down below CEBS and also on the Main 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:14.599
 Kuno was up to date 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.749
 I have percent under admixture plays to prepare this 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.769
 pretty much all of that knew spots 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:25.699
 occupied 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.699
 and have you ever used where stuck everywhere 

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:30.989
 and 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.649
 exactly what we want to show now what the consequences for now, for example, Andy 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.660
 has been busy attacking an opponent or something else 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.450
 do 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.200
 and you want to index euros per city with larvae every 40 seconds 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.680
 so that you can build more units 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.490
 then there is the following method it is only one of many but I use it 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.260
 gladly 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.050
 because she walks fast and she just goes 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.130
 we copy all 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.260
 Hochstetten 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.080
 And with us and what I am all that but also buildings 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.450
 in small group behind for group 1 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.590
 with shift and 1 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.049
 can add that they are group 1 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.390
 Mitchell did not do that as an afterthought as I do now 

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:16.530
 always immediately if emergency builds cowsheds somewhere 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.530
 added the grouping 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.780
 so 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.640
 radiant district 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.720
 Bohmann that fertilizing is quicker to let the dialogue go 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.280
 could go in a test series animal group 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.290
 I'll take 2 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.710
 all queens 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.940
 Shi 2 is on strike 3 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.609
 Of course, it is an afterthought 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:44.509
 very time consuming very awkward but if he were in the game after 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.400
 the game flow 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.400
 then it works wonderfully 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.840
 it was as accepted 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.540
 we are at 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.960
 no idea asked 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.900
 came free and so opponents 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.860
 spread her further beat 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.700
 By the way, the CDU, too, if I too 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.520
 of course done here, of course, it would not always work out like that 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.159
 game 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.079
 because there are often more important things to worry about 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:09.450
 but one 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.620
 in Best Case there should be 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.729
 look like that 

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:16.399
 So the units really move quickly from one base to another percentage point 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:17.929
 would be nine 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:22.569
 for now every one of the Kutcher has sounded or sounded 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.009
 always for units 

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:27.069
 and love collecting point then have to find the titanic layman 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:32.709
 SORBENTS back know demanded before the op base of our opponent that not 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.029
 more exists 

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:37.239
 because I needed time in peace - to build 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.779
 and you want now 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:41.479
 so fertilize 

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:42.939
 then just take it now 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:46.439
 to the 4 2 or which group are also grouping that too 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.439
 you have had your whole queen 

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:51.029
 the Hockey League 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:54.029
 how quickly Olav Brunner happened 

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:56.260
 so Las phone rang 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.239
 the one more type does not matter anymore 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.319
 around the hotkey for the larvae are in mind 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:05.729
 that means the world and groupings 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:07.969
 and now v 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:10.969
 Undeterred on the minimap with the crosshair here as it goes 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.109
 your 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:15.689
 Hochstetten 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:17.739
 and always the next 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.009
 next queen at the breakpoint and how she then 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:22.869
 14 

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:25.869
 indexes the larvae 

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:28.729
 that made the husband's retrospective value in use and then 

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:29.899
 indeed 

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:30.819
 all over 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.819
 larvae are produced 

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:38.909
 So such a quick method you just have to go on the mini zigzag Zack 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:39.969
 Zack Zack Zack 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:42.149
 inject his whole quo cities 

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:43.599
 and then wait 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.189
 and the next time the group 1 gentlemen to the hotbed and see now 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:50.089
 here that everyone pushes Elbe 

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:52.649
 7 are running 

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:54.530
 and now see how this added value 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:55.729
 after this 

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:58.759
 the 40 seconds around are at each per digit 

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:00.879
 and we have thus total 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:04.219
 85 were available 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:07.639
 select the most with hardwood 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:09.299
 and around 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.009
 like stepping back starts again to big cities 

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:15.209
 and if you make a legal gentleman then you will see from all 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.430
 directions 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.419
 come here 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.919
 the collection point of each per place that is the last store from Melle 

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:24.469
 Round 

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:25.990
 again 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.990
 Arh Volz sound good 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.360
 then we use all larvae almost at once 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.460
 put the danger 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.750
 Percent have emitted 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.750
 what else do we have to wait 

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:47.439
 and then watch it on the minimap as follows everywhere 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.389
 the CR Clingen come up 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.669
 and that's exactly what makes Zerg Player so powerful when he's enough 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:05.129
 resources 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:06.530
 and enough 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.669
 so did Marx and enough supply 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.539
 He can do it all at once 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:13.589
 Conan 

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:16.589
 of units produce 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.270
 we have here 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.270
 106 90 to recognize 

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:31.469
 she can not exaggerate this alliance 

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:41.330
 but that's how it's done 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.370
 just before achieved a bit helped 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.430
 and if so, then I always look forward to Bern 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:52.289
 Thumbs up or Bern to wear so do not want to and will 

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:55.740
 or if he just comment in Dallas 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.979
 I am now ground and I get out and there too
