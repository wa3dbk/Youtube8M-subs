00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
we have a system one that's file I guess

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.100 
we have a system one that's file I guess
that's<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.820> primary<00:02:06.090> backbone<00:02:06.719> for<00:02:06.750> the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
that's the primary backbone for the

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.419 
that's the primary backbone for the
iPlayer

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
iPlayer

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.339

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
but in with those files work and here is

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.129 
but in with those files work and here is
the<00:02:23.609> iPlayer<00:02:24.000> system<00:02:24.540> one<00:02:24.719> that<00:02:26.930> so<00:02:27.930> here's

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:28.139 
the iPlayer system one that so here's

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:32.059 
the iPlayer system one that so here's
what<00:02:28.469> we<00:02:28.709> are<00:02:28.950> going<00:02:29.129> to<00:02:29.250> do<00:02:30.829> we<00:02:31.829> could

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
what we are going to do we could

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.890 
what we are going to do we could
probably<00:02:32.219> get<00:02:32.609> rid<00:02:32.849> of<00:02:32.879> this<00:02:33.120> since<00:02:33.540> it's

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
probably get rid of this since it's

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.670 
probably get rid of this since it's
pointless<00:02:34.469> now<00:02:35.450> take<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.840> new<00:02:37.349> one<00:02:39.409> drag<00:02:40.409> it

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
pointless now take the new one drag it

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.780 
pointless now take the new one drag it
and<00:02:40.889> drop<00:02:41.819> it<00:02:43.760> weights<00:02:44.760> that's<00:02:45.030> what<00:02:45.359> I<00:02:45.389> think

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
and drop it weights that's what I think

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.399 
and drop it weights that's what I think
I'm<00:02:47.790> telling<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.299> Edna<00:02:48.569> we're<00:02:48.689> doing<00:02:49.019> this<00:02:49.169> or

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
I'm telling and Edna we're doing this or

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
else they're going to find a way to get

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.440 
else they're going to find a way to get
one<00:02:52.260> point<00:02:52.470> for<00:02:52.590> point<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.310> Alton<00:02:53.790> disable<00:02:54.389> all

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
one point for point to Alton disable all
