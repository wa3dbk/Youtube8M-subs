appears to be more random events in star

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.940 
drive to it did happen in star drive one
and<00:01:13.180> I<00:01:13.450> like<00:01:13.480> them<00:01:13.960> they<00:01:14.200> just<00:01:14.409> didn't<00:01:14.740> happen

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
and I like them they just didn't happen

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.210 
and I like them they just didn't happen
enough<00:01:15.520> in<00:01:15.820> my<00:01:16.660> opinion<00:01:16.780> ship<00:01:17.440> customization

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
enough in my opinion ship customization

enough in my opinion ship customization
has<00:01:18.490> been<00:01:18.730> something<00:01:19.060> star<00:01:19.540> drive<00:01:19.840> has<00:01:20.050> always

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
has been something star drive has always

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.500 
has been something star drive has always
done<00:01:20.680> well<00:01:21.160> so<00:01:21.490> I'm<00:01:21.550> really<00:01:21.670> happy<00:01:21.940> to<00:01:22.180> see<00:01:22.210> the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
done well so I'm really happy to see the

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.200 
done well so I'm really happy to see the
system<00:01:22.870> returning<00:01:23.650> in<00:01:23.770> star<00:01:24.070> drive<00:01:24.370> to<00:01:24.670> and<00:01:24.940> I

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
system returning in star drive to and I

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.790 
system returning in star drive to and I
can't<00:01:25.510> wait<00:01:25.660> to<00:01:25.810> see<00:01:25.990> what<00:01:26.230> editions<00:01:26.710> have

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
can't wait to see what editions have

can't wait to see what editions have

always<00:01:30.310> seems<00:01:30.760> to<00:01:30.880> be<00:01:31.180> somewhat<00:01:31.960> of<00:01:32.050> a<00:01:32.170> hit<00:01:32.530> or

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
always seems to be somewhat of a hit or

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.830 
always seems to be somewhat of a hit or
miss<00:01:32.770> kind<00:01:33.520> of<00:01:33.610> thing<00:01:33.820> so<00:01:34.300> their<00:01:34.450> games<00:01:34.660> that

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
miss kind of thing so their games that

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.960 
miss kind of thing so their games that
do<00:01:34.990> some<00:01:35.290> elements<00:01:35.740> really<00:01:35.950> well<00:01:36.310> and<00:01:36.550> others

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
do some elements really well and others

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.600 
do some elements really well and others
very<00:01:37.420> poorly<00:01:37.810> in<00:01:38.200> this<00:01:38.710> example<00:01:39.100> I'm<00:01:39.340> looking

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
very poorly in this example I'm looking

very poorly in this example I'm looking

into<00:01:43.390> a<00:01:43.570> 4x<00:01:44.140> game<00:01:44.440> in<00:01:44.740> a4x<00:01:45.670> game<00:01:46.120> where<00:01:46.330> you're

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
into a 4x game in a4x game where you're

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.080 
into a 4x game in a4x game where you're
investing<00:01:46.990> a<00:01:47.110> lot<00:01:47.380> of<00:01:47.530> time<00:01:47.800> to<00:01:48.160> get<00:01:48.850> to<00:01:49.060> the

investing a lot of time to get to the

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.090 
investing a lot of time to get to the
end<00:01:49.390> I<00:01:49.600> think<00:01:49.630> it's<00:01:49.960> important<00:01:50.470> to<00:01:50.530> get<00:01:50.740> all<00:01:50.920> of

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
end I think it's important to get all of

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.010 
end I think it's important to get all of
these<00:01:51.250> elements<00:01:51.460> right<00:01:52.000> there<00:01:52.510> are<00:01:52.630> games<00:01:52.810> I

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
these elements right there are games I

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.990 
these elements right there are games I
can<00:01:53.200> think<00:01:53.380> of<00:01:53.530> like<00:01:53.800> sort<00:01:54.340> of<00:01:54.370> the<00:01:54.460> stars<00:01:54.700> to

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
can think of like sort of the stars to

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.090 
can think of like sort of the stars to
that<00:01:55.210> has<00:01:55.360> a<00:01:55.390> great<00:01:55.780> combat<00:01:56.230> system<00:01:56.650> but<00:01:57.070> I

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
that has a great combat system but I

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.890 
that has a great combat system but I
really<00:01:57.460> didn't<00:01:57.760> like<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:58.060> empire<00:01:58.450> building

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
really didn't like the empire building

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.310 
really didn't like the empire building
in<00:01:59.110> my<00:02:00.070> opinion<00:02:00.460> classics<00:02:01.270> like<00:02:01.360> Master<00:02:02.110> of

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
in my opinion classics like Master of

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.740 
in my opinion classics like Master of
Orion<00:02:02.410> to<00:02:03.070> that<00:02:03.430> did<00:02:03.670> nearly<00:02:04.000> everything

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
Orion to that did nearly everything

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.930 
Orion to that did nearly everything
perfectly<00:02:05.350> should<00:02:06.130> be<00:02:06.220> looked<00:02:06.460> at<00:02:06.670> as<00:02:06.910> a

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
perfectly should be looked at as a

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.119 
perfectly should be looked at as a
standard<00:02:07.690> when<00:02:07.990> developing<00:02:08.530> these<00:02:08.679> kinds<00:02:09.069> of

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 
standard when developing these kinds of

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.820 
standard when developing these kinds of
games<00:02:09.660> it's<00:02:10.660> interesting<00:02:10.899> how<00:02:11.470> a<00:02:11.500> game

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
games it's interesting how a game

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.030 
games it's interesting how a game
released<00:02:12.190> in<00:02:12.540> 1996<00:02:13.540> still<00:02:14.140> holds<00:02:14.530> up<00:02:14.650> with<00:02:14.920> the

best of them even today ground combat in

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.090 
best of them even today ground combat in
for<00:02:18.910> X<00:02:19.090> Games<00:02:19.330> always<00:02:19.930> seems<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.319> be<00:02:20.530> that<00:02:20.680> area

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
for X Games always seems to be that area

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.160 
for X Games always seems to be that area
that<00:02:21.160> gets<00:02:21.400> neglected<00:02:21.730> and<00:02:22.360> it<00:02:22.510> always<00:02:22.750> seems

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
that gets neglected and it always seems

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.809 
that gets neglected and it always seems
like<00:02:23.290> an<00:02:23.530> afterthought

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
like an afterthought

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.360 
like an afterthought
whilst<00:02:25.269> our<00:02:25.420> drive<00:02:25.749> to<00:02:25.780> be<00:02:26.349> that<00:02:26.590> first<00:02:27.010> game

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
whilst our drive to be that first game

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.339 
whilst our drive to be that first game
that<00:02:27.670> really<00:02:27.999> gets<00:02:28.390> all<00:02:28.719> these<00:02:28.930> elements

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
that really gets all these elements

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.250 
that really gets all these elements
right<00:02:29.650> I<00:02:29.920> guess<00:02:30.700> we'll<00:02:30.909> see<00:02:31.180> I've<00:02:32.019> always

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
right I guess we'll see I've always

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.319 
right I guess we'll see I've always
liked<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.769> combat<00:02:33.159> system<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:33.760> star<00:02:33.999> drive

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
liked the combat system and star drive

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:36.149 
liked the combat system and star drive
and<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.599> seems<00:02:34.840> like<00:02:34.930> in<00:02:35.290> Star<00:02:35.530> Drive<00:02:35.859> to<00:02:36.129> the

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
and it seems like in Star Drive to the

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.459 
and it seems like in Star Drive to the
developer<00:02:36.790> really<00:02:37.120> stepped<00:02:37.510> up<00:02:37.689> his<00:02:37.870> game<00:02:37.989> and

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:38.469 
developer really stepped up his game and

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:40.830 
developer really stepped up his game and
everything<00:02:38.889> is<00:02:39.189> looking<00:02:39.400> really<00:02:39.840> fantastic

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
everything is looking really fantastic

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.050 
everything is looking really fantastic
hopefully<00:02:41.739> the<00:02:41.980> performance<00:02:42.489> issues<00:02:42.819> will<00:02:43.030> be

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
hopefully the performance issues will be

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.879 
hopefully the performance issues will be
addressed<00:02:43.180> with<00:02:43.719> this<00:02:43.989> new<00:02:44.230> instancing

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:44.889 
addressed with this new instancing

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:46.589 
addressed with this new instancing
system<00:02:45.310> and<00:02:45.519> it<00:02:45.819> seems<00:02:46.030> like<00:02:46.209> they've<00:02:46.359> also

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
system and it seems like they've also

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.449 
system and it seems like they've also
implemented<00:02:47.260> some<00:02:47.500> sort<00:02:47.709> of<00:02:47.769> command<00:02:48.189> point

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
implemented some sort of command point

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.429 
implemented some sort of command point
system<00:02:48.909> and<00:02:49.120> that'll<00:02:49.750> probably<00:02:49.930> help<00:02:50.170> keep

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:50.439 
system and that'll probably help keep

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:53.490 
system and that'll probably help keep
everything<00:02:50.590> nice<00:02:51.129> and<00:02:51.189> smooth<00:02:52.139> here<00:02:53.139> is<00:02:53.319> an

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
everything nice and smooth here is an

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.979 
everything nice and smooth here is an
area<00:02:53.829> where<00:02:54.069> star<00:02:54.400> drive<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:55.030> really<00:02:55.569> starts

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
area where star drive to really starts

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.629 
area where star drive to really starts
to<00:02:56.049> get<00:02:56.260> interesting<00:02:56.319> and<00:02:57.099> now<00:02:57.489> we<00:02:57.549> have

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
to get interesting and now we have

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.039 
to get interesting and now we have
another<00:02:58.150> layer<00:02:58.569> of<00:02:58.810> tactical<00:02:59.799> goodness

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
another layer of tactical goodness

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.050 
another layer of tactical goodness
finally<00:03:02.049> a<00:03:02.230> 4x<00:03:02.769> game<00:03:03.069> where<00:03:03.340> ground<00:03:03.730> combat

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
finally a 4x game where ground combat

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.449 
finally a 4x game where ground combat
isn't<00:03:04.480> just<00:03:05.049> this<00:03:05.260> afterthought<00:03:05.949> or<00:03:05.980> tacked

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
isn't just this afterthought or tacked

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.789 
isn't just this afterthought or tacked
on<00:03:06.730> with<00:03:07.000> little<00:03:07.269> screen<00:03:07.599> with<00:03:07.870> statistics

them<00:03:12.609> so<00:03:12.819> I<00:03:12.849> just<00:03:13.120> win<00:03:13.359> anyways<00:03:13.810> here<00:03:14.469> we<00:03:14.650> could

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
them so I just win anyways here we could

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.369 
them so I just win anyways here we could
see<00:03:15.040> smaller<00:03:15.609> armies<00:03:16.480> winning<00:03:16.959> with<00:03:17.139> better

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 
see smaller armies winning with better

development<00:03:23.349> log<00:03:23.530> we<00:03:24.010> see<00:03:24.189> this<00:03:24.370> system

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
development log we see this system

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.240 
development log we see this system
developed<00:03:25.269> quite<00:03:25.540> nicely<00:03:25.980> there's<00:03:26.980> more

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
developed quite nicely there's more

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.949 
developed quite nicely there's more
going<00:03:27.459> on<00:03:27.669> here<00:03:27.730> than<00:03:28.060> what<00:03:28.449> the<00:03:28.629> footage

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
going on here than what the footage

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.979 
going on here than what the footage
shows<00:03:29.069> so<00:03:30.069> normally<00:03:30.609> in<00:03:30.759> a4x<00:03:31.180> game<00:03:31.629> you<00:03:31.840> just

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
shows so normally in a4x game you just

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.689 
shows so normally in a4x game you just
kind<00:03:32.229> of<00:03:32.259> build<00:03:32.530> your<00:03:32.739> best<00:03:32.979> soldier<00:03:33.400> and<00:03:33.639> they

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:33.699 
kind of build your best soldier and they

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:35.369 
kind of build your best soldier and they
get<00:03:33.879> whatever<00:03:34.209> tech<00:03:34.659> bonuses<00:03:35.169> you've

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379 
get whatever tech bonuses you've

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:37.020 
get whatever tech bonuses you've
researched<00:03:35.769> and<00:03:36.099> then<00:03:36.519> you<00:03:36.609> just<00:03:36.790> kind<00:03:36.909> of

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
researched and then you just kind of

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.179 
researched and then you just kind of
throw<00:03:37.209> 25<00:03:37.689> of<00:03:37.870> them<00:03:37.959> at<00:03:38.319> whatever<00:03:38.769> the<00:03:38.949> enemy

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:39.189 
throw 25 of them at whatever the enemy

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:40.830 
throw 25 of them at whatever the enemy
has<00:03:39.370> and<00:03:39.729> then<00:03:39.819> you<00:03:40.209> know<00:03:40.299> that<00:03:40.329> usually

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
has and then you know that usually

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.420 
has and then you know that usually
determines<00:03:41.290> who<00:03:41.439> wins<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:42.009> planet<00:03:42.340> or

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
determines who wins the planet or

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.420 
determines who wins the planet or
territory<00:03:42.939> in<00:03:43.150> this<00:03:43.870> we<00:03:44.290> have<00:03:44.530> a<00:03:44.709> much<00:03:45.040> deeper

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
territory in this we have a much deeper

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.099 
territory in this we have a much deeper
system<00:03:46.000> going<00:03:46.269> on<00:03:46.389> where<00:03:46.599> we<00:03:46.720> can<00:03:46.870> fit

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
system going on where we can fit

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:48.960 
system going on where we can fit
different<00:03:47.530> weapon<00:03:47.829> systems<00:03:48.220> and<00:03:48.430> armors<00:03:48.759> and

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
different weapon systems and armors and

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.149 
different weapon systems and armors and
different<00:03:49.780> consumables<00:03:50.470> and<00:03:50.709> that<00:03:50.859> sort<00:03:51.099> of

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 
different consumables and that sort of

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:53.759 
different consumables and that sort of
thing<00:03:51.220> so<00:03:51.939> I'm<00:03:52.299> really<00:03:52.870> really<00:03:53.169> interested<00:03:53.739> to

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
thing so I'm really really interested to

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.920 
thing so I'm really really interested to
see<00:03:54.009> how<00:03:54.220> all<00:03:54.549> this<00:03:54.759> is<00:03:54.819> going<00:03:55.150> to<00:03:55.299> work<00:03:55.569> in<00:03:55.810> the

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
see how all this is going to work in the

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.309 
see how all this is going to work in the
final<00:03:56.319> build<00:03:56.909> so<00:03:57.909> cool<00:03:58.209> DX<00:03:58.599> all<00:03:58.840> this<00:03:58.989> stuff<00:03:59.169> is

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
final build so cool DX all this stuff is

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:00.860 
final build so cool DX all this stuff is
looking<00:03:59.620> great<00:03:59.859> but<00:04:00.129> will<00:04:00.400> there<00:04:00.669> be

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
looking great but will there be

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.599 
looking great but will there be
multiplayer<00:04:01.870> a<00:04:02.199> quick<00:04:02.919> look<00:04:03.220> on<00:04:03.370> the

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:54.229 
of Master of Orion to where you have to

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:56.620 
of Master of Orion to where you have to
pick<00:05:54.560> a<00:05:54.740> specific<00:05:55.220> research<00:05:55.850> in<00:05:56.060> the<00:05:56.120> category

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
pick a specific research in the category

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.960 
pick a specific research in the category
and<00:05:56.900> miss<00:05:57.440> out<00:05:57.650> on<00:05:57.800> the<00:05:57.919> other<00:05:58.100> I<00:05:58.370> don't<00:05:58.789> know

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
and miss out on the other I don't know

00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:59.950 
and miss out on the other I don't know
if<00:05:59.030> they're<00:05:59.150> going<00:05:59.240> to<00:05:59.330> do<00:05:59.390> something<00:05:59.600> similar

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
if they're going to do something similar

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.810 
if they're going to do something similar
like<00:06:00.289> in<00:06:00.530> master<00:06:00.890> Orion<00:06:01.220> where<00:06:01.400> you<00:06:01.460> can<00:06:01.610> pick

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820 
like in master Orion where you can pick

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.820 
like in master Orion where you can pick
the<00:06:02.090> creative<00:06:02.630> trait<00:06:02.900> and<00:06:03.080> get<00:06:03.289> all<00:06:03.470> of<00:06:03.650> them

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
the creative trait and get all of them

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.980 
the creative trait and get all of them
this<00:06:04.610> is<00:06:04.789> a<00:06:04.820> really<00:06:05.210> good<00:06:05.419> thing<00:06:05.720> in<00:06:05.960> my

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
this is a really good thing in my

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.620 
this is a really good thing in my
opinion<00:06:06.220> also<00:06:07.220> there's<00:06:07.490> an<00:06:07.669> experimental

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:08.630 
opinion also there's an experimental

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.540 
opinion also there's an experimental
tech<00:06:09.200> tree<00:06:09.500> in<00:06:09.650> there<00:06:09.919> which<00:06:10.280> I'm<00:06:10.460> really

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
tech tree in there which I'm really

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.420 
tech tree in there which I'm really
curious<00:06:10.820> to<00:06:11.030> see<00:06:11.300> how<00:06:11.479> it<00:06:11.660> works<00:06:12.160> finally<00:06:13.160> we

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
curious to see how it works finally we

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.430 
curious to see how it works finally we
have<00:06:13.669> some<00:06:14.030> strategic<00:06:14.720> resources<00:06:15.200> we<00:06:15.410> can

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
have some strategic resources we can

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.950 
have some strategic resources we can
find<00:06:15.860> around<00:06:16.070> the<00:06:16.400> galaxy<00:06:16.700> another<00:06:17.570> element

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
find around the galaxy another element

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.540 
find around the galaxy another element
that<00:06:18.050> will<00:06:18.200> add<00:06:18.380> a<00:06:18.410> little<00:06:18.650> flavor<00:06:18.950> to<00:06:19.160> each

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
that will add a little flavor to each

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.870 
that will add a little flavor to each
and<00:06:19.760> every<00:06:20.060> game<00:06:20.860> so<00:06:21.860> am<00:06:22.039> i<00:06:22.190> excited<00:06:22.520> about

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 
and every game so am i excited about

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.080 
and every game so am i excited about
stardrive<00:06:23.570> to<00:06:23.870> be<00:06:24.410> a<00:06:24.440> damn<00:06:24.740> skippy<00:06:25.520> anyways
