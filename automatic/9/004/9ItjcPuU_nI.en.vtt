conferences one thing that we talked

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.809 
conferences one thing that we talked
about<00:00:41.019> in<00:00:41.199> the<00:00:41.260> replication<00:00:41.710> 101<00:00:42.309> class<00:00:42.519> is

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:42.819 
about in the replication 101 class is

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:45.149 
about in the replication 101 class is
that<00:00:43.389> rice<00:00:43.870> bags<00:00:44.170> give<00:00:44.620> off<00:00:44.800> what<00:00:45.069> is

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:45.159 
that rice bags give off what is

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:48.119 
that rice bags give off what is
considered<00:00:45.760> a<00:00:45.940> wet<00:00:46.539> heat<00:00:47.229> when<00:00:47.679> you<00:00:47.769> warm<00:00:48.010> up

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
considered a wet heat when you warm up

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:50.489 
considered a wet heat when you warm up
the<00:00:48.309> rice<00:00:48.519> it<00:00:48.909> actually<00:00:49.329> releases<00:00:49.600> moisture

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:50.499 
the rice it actually releases moisture

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:53.729 
the rice it actually releases moisture
and<00:00:51.479> think<00:00:52.479> about<00:00:52.719> what<00:00:52.960> we<00:00:53.109> tell<00:00:53.409> our

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
and think about what we tell our

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.520 
and think about what we tell our
customers<00:00:54.370> how<00:00:55.120> to<00:00:55.149> apply<00:00:55.569> their<00:00:55.870> nail<00:00:56.079> wraps

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
customers how to apply their nail wraps

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.529 
customers how to apply their nail wraps
the<00:00:56.739> best<00:00:57.010> way<00:00:57.249> we<00:00:57.489> say<00:00:57.639> it<00:00:57.729> needs<00:00:57.879> to<00:00:57.969> be<00:00:58.089> clean

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539 
the best way we say it needs to be clean

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:03.029 
the best way we say it needs to be clean
dry<00:00:59.260> and<00:00:59.739> oil<00:01:00.069> free<00:01:00.579> dry<00:01:01.539> clean<00:01:02.170> dry<00:01:02.559> and<00:01:02.589> oil

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
dry and oil free dry clean dry and oil

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:06.690 
dry and oil free dry clean dry and oil
free<00:01:03.309> dry<00:01:03.670> so<00:01:04.449> if<00:01:04.690> we<00:01:04.839> have<00:01:04.989> dry<00:01:05.290> nails<00:01:06.100> and<00:01:06.520> we

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
free dry so if we have dry nails and we

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.040 
free dry so if we have dry nails and we
put<00:01:06.970> a<00:01:07.210> wet<00:01:07.870> heat<00:01:08.590> on<00:01:08.800> a<00:01:08.860> dry<00:01:09.340> nail<00:01:09.970> now<00:01:10.600> our

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
put a wet heat on a dry nail now our

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.510 
put a wet heat on a dry nail now our
nail<00:01:11.530> is<00:01:11.860> potentially<00:01:13.470> capturing<00:01:14.520> moisture

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
nail is potentially capturing moisture

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.690 
nail is potentially capturing moisture
so<00:01:16.180> what<00:01:16.750> can<00:01:16.900> happen<00:01:17.200> is<00:01:17.710> between<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.490> nail

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
so what can happen is between the nail

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.510 
so what can happen is between the nail
wrap<00:01:18.910> and<00:01:19.210> the<00:01:19.330> actual<00:01:19.750> nail<00:01:20.050> it's<00:01:20.680> possible

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
wrap and the actual nail it's possible

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.550 
wrap and the actual nail it's possible
for<00:01:22.060> you<00:01:22.180> to<00:01:22.210> get<00:01:22.480> moisture<00:01:22.720> trapped<00:01:23.350> between

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
for you to get moisture trapped between

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.370 
for you to get moisture trapped between
those<00:01:23.980> two<00:01:24.310> now<00:01:24.970> what<00:01:25.270> can<00:01:25.420> that<00:01:25.600> lead<00:01:25.840> to<00:01:25.870> well

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
those two now what can that lead to well

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.750 
those two now what can that lead to well
first<00:01:26.710> of<00:01:26.920> all<00:01:27.010> you're<00:01:27.190> not<00:01:27.340> going<00:01:27.490> to<00:01:27.580> get<00:01:27.640> the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
first of all you're not going to get the

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.420 
first of all you're not going to get the
best<00:01:27.910> application<00:01:28.800> you're<00:01:29.800> going<00:01:30.160> to<00:01:30.280> have

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
best application you're going to have

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.890 
best application you're going to have
some<00:01:30.700> lifting<00:01:31.090> around<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.480> edges

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
some lifting around the edges

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.730 
some lifting around the edges
potentially<00:01:32.710> you<00:01:33.670> can<00:01:33.880> potentially<00:01:34.290> get<00:01:35.290> some

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
potentially you can potentially get some

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.190 
potentially you can potentially get some
wetness<00:01:36.700> trapped<00:01:37.120> under<00:01:37.420> there<00:01:37.510> and<00:01:37.810> that's

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
wetness trapped under there and that's

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.290 
wetness trapped under there and that's
where<00:01:38.440> the<00:01:38.740> nasty<00:01:39.130> that<00:01:39.250> icky<00:01:39.580> is<00:01:39.640> can<00:01:39.940> form

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
where the nasty that icky is can form

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.420 
where the nasty that icky is can form
you<00:01:40.600> know<00:01:40.690> bacteria<00:01:41.260> can<00:01:41.440> get<00:01:41.560> in<00:01:41.650> there<00:01:41.830> so

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
you know bacteria can get in there so

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.450 
you know bacteria can get in there so
that<00:01:42.880> is<00:01:43.120> why<00:01:43.300> jamberry<00:01:44.230> does<00:01:44.560> not<00:01:44.890> endorse

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
that is why jamberry does not endorse

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.720 
that is why jamberry does not endorse
