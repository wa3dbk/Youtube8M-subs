00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.330
 to observe all the people is xenon 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.880
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.970
 new video and this is the last 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.290
 no I laugh little improvement of 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.880
 people who grew up so I said that 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.840
 on twitter and all were a little 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.460
 for trolling actually 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.810
 history of making stormy fun 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.939
 a few days before they go 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.079
 account that in fact banon I 'm not going 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.279
 stop making videos but 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:30.689
 only here so I want to do this 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.160
 little idea today to tell you 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.989
 two three things what happens in this 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.460
 moment a little since you will have 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.950
 noticed that I posted less video 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.840
 lately a freelance not to 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.700
 to post a lot more there for the 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.810
 weeks to come 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.370
 so I'll explain to you why at 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.480
 level of gameplay that I will put you 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.160
 frankly it's really not 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.050
 important I do not know what I would put 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.330
 it will probably not be ghost I 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.560
 will come back later but if that's 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.880
 beefy that really means that 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.050
 I have nothing else to put you so what 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.760
 would be a bit problematic but good 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.930
 I hope I will find something else 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.260
 because I really do not want to 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.570
 you post this game there and then so here 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.339
 firstly if I ask more these too 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.340
 time it's obviously because I 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.750
 I'm less motivated to do 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.270
 videos otherwise I would have continued as 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.219
 before once a day and that's it for 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.689
 that's okay I played a little bit 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:18.450
 tired of playing all the time same game 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.100
 it's pretty repetitive 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.810
 or ghost kid I totally 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.729
 stopped I do not know if I will return 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.109
 honestly I still have two more 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.179
 three gameplay I believe on this game there 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:28.560
 but that's all and frankly I 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:30.569
 no idea when will I 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.700
 will return for now it's two 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:34.139
 weeks that I have not played I'm wearing 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.549
 well it lacks absolutely not me 

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:38.130
 while the other call of duty by the 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.840
 I would have missed it honestly 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.950
 from 2 to 3 weeks without playing I got 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.079
 said hey I'll make myself maybe 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.060
 little part there for ghost not at all 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.130
 I absolutely do not want to go back 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.389
 and limits the game disgusts me so here is 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.819
 I'm going to run and I still 

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:52.619
 two three gameplay i will post you by 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.749
 here and there but that's it for ghost it's a 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.829
 little bit finished for now I'm 

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:59.159
 sorry for those interested 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.869
 really dropped gold finally here I hope 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.310
 that you do not look at machine that for 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.349
 of Visigothic collar this because that would be 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.930
 still a little sad 

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:08.060
 wait how much this game and 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.410
 and here you go or good I will not say anything 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.050
 but frankly it's clear that 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.760
 it's because he says he's more 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.870
 then 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.660
 about other young people 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.090
 black ops 2 battlefield 4 fps in general 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.680
 I still like it even if it's a little bit 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.209
 little there is because in fact it's there 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.300
 just two weeks it's two 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.620
 weeks that I left on world of 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.900
 warcraft and for those who know 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.780
 it's not a memory and tg so nothing 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.010
 to do with the fps even though me at the 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.470
 base anyway a player of the memory 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.750
 and I started the species very, very late 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.220
 has the buttocks online call of duty 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.970
 company I had to start when 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.560
 I was 14 almost 15 years old there I 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.550
 expect him to have a 19 do not know if 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.320
 for a long time that I really want 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.510
 seriously in quotation marks or fps and 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.310
 that I play fps just before 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.410
 I was a memory player pg of the coup 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.840
 I went back on the games a little 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.850
 who I like at last who I liked 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.160
 always been the mmorpg 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.630
 of auxerrois of warcraft hold game that 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.959
 I appreciate a lot and I played 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.130
 enormously about two years ago there I 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.640
 put myself back and play really a lot 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.030
 a lot 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.170
 so suddenly I play at the console 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.820
 it's been about two weeks since 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.650
 that I stopped kid I also stop 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.480
 to play fps in general no I have not 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.370
 read but neither my ps3 nymex box one since 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.410
 time has indeed would I 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.170
 reread to play a little bit but good 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.670
 so that's it so I'm playing too much at the 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.380
 console do not worry it wants 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.299
 not to say that I will stop far from there 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.610
 in fact I was just a little bit 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.110
 tired of games I did not play 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.250
 a lot still in easy game of 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.440
 three hours a day so that's when 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.790
 not even bad whether call of duty or 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.989
 battlefield so here I'm going to do a 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.940
 little bit a little break I when 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.290
 even a lot of gameplay you post I 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.900
 have to see if this gameplay on 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.920
 blackhawks 2 good it's not huge by 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.540
 report at the time but hey we'll say 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.950
 globally on the species must have a 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.170
 little fortnight of gameplay so that's 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.400
 rather correct knowing that suddenly I 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.840
 will make a new schedule videos 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.970
 so I'm going to stop posting a video 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.380
 every day for now it's not going 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.959
 last a very long time I think that risk 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.610
 to last maybe three weeks go 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.750
 one month maximum by the end of the head 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.970
 a crazy after I'll take you 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.590
 really seriously but there for the 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.930
 blow I think I'll post you three 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.690
 videos per week during 3 to 4 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.430
 weeks so one on wednesday like 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.019
 today another one and get dressed 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.419
 on Sunday I think there was better 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.970
 know in the times when they will be 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.229
 the most I think because it's clear 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.150
 I also do not release videos to 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:25.460
 monday at 2 am finally this kind 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:29.090
 bullshit needs to stay a little bit 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.220
 logic still sent a day 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.479
 stop saying anything so 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.070
 as I said yeah three videos by 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.050
 week from now on during 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.850
 a little while because I was tired 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.110
 fps 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.729
 by the way if you join the strong kraft 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.050
 1 for those interested even if I 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.020
 do not think I have a lot of subscribers 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.250
 on this game I play with raiden so 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.479
 for now there is hayden heart that 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.880
 plays in the rail terminals and I think that 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.110
 it will be forever and ever because 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.090
 the onl and others do not look like 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.400
 want to go but if you play 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.500
 on izon whose and horde side I would put 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.690
 maybe the nickname of our characters in 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.070
 the description it may depend 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.449
 we are going to make a small deal with 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.560
 subscribers or blow something like that if 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.530
 never there are people who play too 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.500
 on this server do not hesitate to me mp or 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.729
 mp raiden if you play on is it looks like 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.080
 that you are next to them because 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:13.520
 suddenly here we can talk a little 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.009
 little one will feel less alone given 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.409
 we are really all this is played 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.240
 in the team and then 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:22.159
 otherwise what did I have to say 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.320
 popopo friends to go back to ghost so 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:25.250
 you know a fish since the beginning I 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.750
 say it's not the club that's 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.130
 please the most is that I will stop 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.330
 to repeat it so every time I 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.599
 think that because of that you risk 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.740
 to get drunk but there good so far 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:35.810
 in fact what I did was that I 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.430
 actually continues in poster since I 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.050
 play a little bit I do not get drunk 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.610
 but there when I realize in fact 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.159
 I take no pleasure in playing 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.990
 compare a world of warcraft or it's 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:46.460
 the total wonder of the connection to 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.380
 the disconnect I tell myself that here is 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.330
 why his end why am I 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.680
 will continue to play a game that makes me 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.320
 more necessarily play fun while 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.030
 simply by redeeming ghost this will be 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.770
 maybe definitive it can be two 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.020
 days I already did it I had bought 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.610
 of black ops once for two days and 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.710
 I came back quickly but now I think 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.389
 that on ghost and will be different so if 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.699
 I'm doing that from low ghost I'm sorry 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:09.229
 for those that would interest me I will do 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:11.539
 surely bo 's instead for 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:12.830
 replace while waiting for tightening 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:14.150
 crazy because a head out a 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.210
 crazy in a good actually really with 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:19.520
 the moment I'm going to recover 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.810
 in youtube activity etc posted a 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.090
 video a day normally 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.500
 and then that's it so I hope it's you 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.199
 will not blow too much that I'm less 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.520
 active during that time but hey I 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:31.099
 think everything is said anyway the 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.449
 fps in general gets drunk a little bit i'm going 

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:33.560
 continue to post you videos and 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:34.759
 gameplay that I 'll get to catch 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.259
 but hey I think I will not play it 

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:38.360
 more than one or two hours a week that 

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:39.620
 risk of being really cotton for you 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.569
 get out of the gameplay for now 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.030

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:45.139

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.340
