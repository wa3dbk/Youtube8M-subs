00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.150
 Hello everyone and today I found a video 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:09.780
 famous american blogger where is he 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:13.670
 compares ipad 2 and ipad mini with tests 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:18.000
 performance meaning it runs 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:21.630
 speedtest.net and geekbench and see 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.359
 how will that tablet behave in 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.930
 the Internet and also where faster 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.550
 the application opens and go first 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.009
 will fall from geekbench 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.870
 in these devices the same is 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:40.170
 operating system 601 and the same 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.079
 amount of RAM 503 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.399
 megabytes and also they have installed 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.430
 same type 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:52.140
 again and here and completed both devices and 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:56.870
 on ipad mini this number reached 750 2 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.699
 bagels on ipad 2 this number will set 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.489
 758 bagels so he 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.729
 ipad 2 wins for now and now 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.659
 let's check who catches the net better 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:12.810
 Wi-Fi and run the speedtest.net test 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.869
 And as you can see, the iPad mini is already ahead 2 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.350
 ipad and it has enough download 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:23.130
 the big is exactly as much as six megabits 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.430
 more than ipad 2 and this download 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.070
 is 16 megabits and it confirms 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.650
 that ipad mini stand up wi-fi 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.920
 fashion he loop these check so 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.159
 cool ipad mini module and test a 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.280
 ipad mini 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.390
 now two you are safari and load and 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.899
 main page 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.600
 apple and ipad mini uploaded very well 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:49.179
 slightly faster than ipad 2 and let's 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.020
 now open the macbook pro page 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:53.770
 retina 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.890
 and let's open the store now and here 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.469
 ipad mini showed itself better he 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.109
 loaded the store faster than ipad here 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:05.229
 open the page where are sold mac 

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:09.340
 mini and ipad 2 again uploaded a little 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:12.430
 a little faster than a ipad mini and the 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.200
 I have a little disappointed test so but 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.140
 new device should always be 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.780
 faster and here how it all wrong here 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.290
 upload to both devices on ipad 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.920
 mini 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.209
 everything worked out fast enough than 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.250
 iPad 2 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.190
 well now let's open the standard 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.459
 the application from where we load the amount 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.989
 your applications on ours and pads of this 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:40.200
 appstore and on ipad mini she is surprised 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.549
 would start meeting night 2 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.220
 now let's open the outsiders 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:48.519
 applications but still from this 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:52.299
 and it will be and he looks and she started 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:54.280
 also faster on the alps and nothing on yours 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:58.180
 there is already 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:01.000
 the difference in a second can even v2 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.040
 but still it's on the changed 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.290
 these seconds will be used later 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.130
 turn into minutes and then maybe even 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:12.220
 in hours and so ipad mini for now 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.020
 show very well as well 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.000
 ipad mini I think I did it here and 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:20.140
 faster because it was sick on 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.970
 the second ipad was already loaded so 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.270
 what's the author of us a little 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.550
 in the test and now the camera application and 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.350
 opened to him in surprise at the second from 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.760
 ipad 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.680
 interest is true because he has a camera 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.860
 worse but now probably one of the most 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.410
 the main tests who faster including 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.790
 Okayama I propose to listen to our beloved 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.790
 all dub step 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:59.370
 and now it's 20 seconds and 2 is on 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.250
 this while we wait 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.000
 ipad mini and think that he should soon 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:09.690
 turn on and yes here it is turned on 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.270
 just how many 24 seconds think this 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.750
 very very very normal rate 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:19.049
 for a small tablet would have it all 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.000
 look at the account choose which one you are 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.890
 want to 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.290
 tablet but i would advise you the best 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.660
 from me since it is newer and can 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:31.980
 support more and more 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.720
 us all sorts of operating in from apple and 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:37.140
 there will appear more and more 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.360
 closer than it but that was all put 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.919
 big thumbs up subscribe to 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.919
