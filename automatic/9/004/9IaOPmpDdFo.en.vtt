can choose whether you know if you have
a<00:01:16.030> lot<00:01:16.420> more<00:01:16.450> yarn<00:01:17.020> then<00:01:17.710> let's<00:01:18.220> say<00:01:18.430> we're

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
a lot more yarn then let's say we're

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.060 
a lot more yarn then let's say we're
going<00:01:18.820> to<00:01:19.030> make<00:01:19.180> a<00:01:19.210> scarf<00:01:19.750> out<00:01:19.990> of<00:01:20.290> these

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
going to make a scarf out of these

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.290 
going to make a scarf out of these
colors<00:01:21.490> okay<00:01:22.260> let's<00:01:23.260> say<00:01:23.410> I<00:01:23.500> have<00:01:23.950> five<00:01:24.730> more

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
colors okay let's say I have five more

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.250 
colors okay let's say I have five more
skeins<00:01:25.720> of<00:01:25.990> this<00:01:26.230> but<00:01:26.710> I<00:01:26.740> only<00:01:26.950> have<00:01:27.370> oh<00:01:28.260> let's

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
skeins of this but I only have oh let's

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.820 
skeins of this but I only have oh let's
say<00:01:29.470> three<00:01:30.010> of<00:01:30.310> this<00:01:30.550> yarn<00:01:30.880> okay<00:01:31.540> what<00:01:32.500> I<00:01:32.530> would

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
say three of this yarn okay what I would

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.420 
say three of this yarn okay what I would
probably<00:01:33.040> do<00:01:33.550> is<00:01:33.850> use<00:01:34.420> this<00:01:34.780> yarn<00:01:35.170> as<00:01:35.410> my<00:01:36.040> warp

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
probably do is use this yarn as my warp

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.740 
probably do is use this yarn as my warp
because<00:01:37.060> I<00:01:37.090> have<00:01:37.330> more<00:01:37.630> of<00:01:37.750> it<00:01:37.950> because<00:01:38.950> I<00:01:39.750> can

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
because I have more of it because I can

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.130 
because I have more of it because I can
then<00:01:40.780> use<00:01:41.650> just<00:01:42.040> these<00:01:42.280> two<00:01:42.580> balls<00:01:42.850> go<00:01:43.540> back<00:01:43.810> to

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
then use just these two balls go back to

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.320 
then use just these two balls go back to
my<00:01:44.320> stash<00:01:44.650> find<00:01:45.430> some<00:01:45.640> other<00:01:45.820> yarns<00:01:46.270> that

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.580 
get woven in with other yarns everything
kind<00:02:21.280> of<00:02:21.490> mellows<00:02:22.210> out<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:23.140> you<00:02:23.290> end<00:02:23.440> up<00:02:23.530> with

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
kind of mellows out and you end up with

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.260 
kind of mellows out and you end up with
a<00:02:23.740> fabric<00:02:24.340> that<00:02:24.490> you<00:02:24.610> can<00:02:24.760> even<00:02:25.000> make<00:02:25.120> a

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
a fabric that you can even make a

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.720 
a fabric that you can even make a
garment<00:02:25.630> out<00:02:25.960> of<00:02:26.170> you'd<00:02:26.350> be<00:02:26.500> shocked<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.220> it

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
garment out of you'd be shocked and it

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.240 
garment out of you'd be shocked and it
works<00:02:27.970> so<00:02:28.150> that<00:02:28.540> means<00:02:29.530> that<00:02:29.740> I<00:02:29.800> could<00:02:30.100> have<00:02:30.190> a

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
works so that means that I could have a

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.300 
works so that means that I could have a
bright<00:02:30.580> color<00:02:30.820> like<00:02:30.910> this<00:02:31.330> and<00:02:31.710> of<00:02:32.710> course<00:02:32.920> I

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
bright color like this and of course I

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.460 
bright color like this and of course I
might<00:02:33.640> put<00:02:33.850> it<00:02:33.940> with<00:02:34.060> lime<00:02:34.270> green<00:02:34.630> and<00:02:34.900> I'd

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
might put it with lime green and I'd

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.230 
might put it with lime green and I'd
still<00:02:35.740> wear<00:02:35.950> this<00:02:36.160> I<00:02:36.340> could<00:02:36.550> make<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.700> vest<00:02:37.000> out

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
still wear this I could make a vest out

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.540 
still wear this I could make a vest out
of<00:02:37.420> it<00:02:37.510> or<00:02:37.630> a<00:02:37.690> scarf<00:02:38.110> or<00:02:38.410> something<00:02:38.740> fun<00:02:38.980> with

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
and then just to kind of double check

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.930

double<00:04:34.550> check<00:04:35.140> right<00:04:36.140> here<00:04:36.170> in<00:04:36.620> this<00:04:36.890> split

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
double check right here in this split

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.910 
double check right here in this split
complementary<00:04:37.750> got<00:04:38.750> yellow<00:04:39.080> lands<00:04:39.470> right<00:04:39.740> in
