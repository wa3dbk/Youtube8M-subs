but when if you buy a new one you will
be<00:00:42.629> much<00:00:43.670> you<00:00:44.670> know<00:00:44.789> tougher<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.600> harder

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
be much you know tougher and harder

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.060 
be much you know tougher and harder
texture<00:00:47.190> but<00:00:47.570> so<00:00:48.570> i<00:00:48.930> have<00:00:49.230> not<00:00:49.410> used<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:49.829> for

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
texture but so i have not used this for

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.430 
texture but so i have not used this for
a<00:00:50.100> while<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:51.480> know<00:00:51.600> when<00:00:51.960> after<00:00:52.350> you

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
a while and you know when after you

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.709 
a while and you know when after you
start<00:00:52.680> using<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:53.160> it's<00:00:53.969> really<00:00:54.360> hard<00:00:54.570> to

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
start using this it's really hard to

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.990 
start using this it's really hard to
clean<00:00:54.989> clean<00:00:55.530> clean<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.980> but<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.640> know<00:00:56.760> I

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000

is water and I just spray it make it wet
at<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.890> top<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.430> then<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.509> will<00:01:16.020> use<00:01:16.259> my

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
at the top and then I will use my

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.920 
at the top and then I will use my
foundation<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.430> couple<00:01:18.030> ways<00:01:18.210> for<00:01:18.630> where

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
foundation a couple ways for where

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.990 
foundation a couple ways for where
confrontations<00:01:19.799> one<00:01:20.759> way<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:22.880> you<00:01:23.880> know

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
confrontations one way is to you know

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.380 
confrontations one way is to you know
just<00:01:24.240> use<00:01:24.479> BB<00:01:24.840> cream<00:01:25.170> or<00:01:25.640> any<00:01:26.640> foundations<00:01:27.210> you

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.340 
just use BB cream or any foundations you
have<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:28.140> if<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.400> want<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.790> have<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.000> dewy

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
have and if you want to have a dewy

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.859 
have and if you want to have a dewy
finish<00:01:31.369> if<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.430> think<00:01:32.850> your<00:01:33.030> foundation<00:01:33.630> does

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
finish if you think your foundation does

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.539 
finish if you think your foundation does
not<00:01:34.110> have<00:01:34.409> enough<00:01:35.630> do<00:01:36.630> we<00:01:36.920> looking<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.369> can

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
not have enough do we looking you can

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.420 
not have enough do we looking you can
always<00:01:38.759> put<00:01:39.509> out<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:40.490> luminizing<00:01:42.740> product<00:01:43.740> for

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
always put out a luminizing product for

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.789 
always put out a luminizing product for
example<00:01:44.820> i<00:01:44.970> have<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.570> mac<00:01:47.030> strobe<00:01:48.030> cream<00:01:48.799> so

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
example i have this mac strobe cream so

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.639 
example i have this mac strobe cream so
this<00:01:50.100> one<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:51.420> good<00:01:51.780> for<00:01:53.630> hydration<00:01:54.649> also

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
this one is is good for hydration also

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.149 
this one is is good for hydration also
just<00:01:56.310> creates<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:57.030> dewy<00:01:57.210> looking<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:58.159> so

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
just creates a dewy looking and so

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.999 
just creates a dewy looking and so
usually<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.700> do<00:01:59.850> I<00:02:00.360> also<00:02:00.719> have<00:02:01.200> this<00:02:01.469> product

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
usually I do I also have this product

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.899 
usually I do I also have this product
for<00:02:02.280> tars<00:02:02.579> is<00:02:03.320> illuminating<00:02:04.369> theorem<00:02:05.369> so

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
for tars is illuminating theorem so

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.059 
for tars is illuminating theorem so
usually<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.600> just<00:02:06.810> put<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.619> foundation<00:02:10.069> here

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
usually I just put the foundation here

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.559 
usually I just put the foundation here
just<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.550> little<00:02:11.849> bit

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
just a little bit

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:19.220 
just a little bit
and<00:02:12.859> i<00:02:13.859> also<00:02:14.670> put<00:02:17.090> like<00:02:18.090> two<00:02:18.269> example<00:02:18.659> mac<00:02:18.870> i

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
and i also put like two example mac i

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.500 
and i also put like two example mac i
just<00:02:19.530> put<00:02:19.739> some<00:02:19.950> also<00:02:23.389> in<00:02:24.389> back<00:02:24.659> of<00:02:24.689> my<00:02:24.989> hand

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
just put some also in back of my hand

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.300 
just put some also in back of my hand
because<00:02:27.510> sometimes<00:02:27.989> you<00:02:28.260> can<00:02:28.409> wear<00:02:28.620> two<00:02:28.980> steps

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
because sometimes you can wear two steps

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.149 
because sometimes you can wear two steps
but<00:02:29.639> i'm<00:02:29.760> just<00:02:29.969> trying<00:02:30.269> to<00:02:30.359> we're<00:02:30.689> one<00:02:31.049> step<00:02:31.349> so

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
but i'm just trying to we're one step so

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.490 
but i'm just trying to we're one step so
you<00:02:32.250> can<00:02:32.430> see<00:02:32.700> i<00:02:32.909> have<00:02:32.939> two<00:02:33.420> things<00:02:33.719> and<00:02:33.989> then

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
you can see i have two things and then

you<00:06:26.350> can<00:06:26.380> do<00:06:26.830> take<00:06:27.520> care<00:06:27.639> of<00:06:27.759> two<00:06:27.940> things

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
you can do take care of two things

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.140 
you can do take care of two things
concealer<00:06:28.900> and<00:06:29.139> foundation<00:06:29.800> so<00:06:30.759> I<00:06:30.789> really

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150 
concealer and foundation so I really

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:36.000 
concealer and foundation so I really
really<00:06:31.330> like<00:06:31.539> that<00:06:34.080> and<00:06:35.080> it's<00:06:35.289> really<00:06:35.620> really

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.010 
really like that and it's really really

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:39.350 
really like that and it's really really
easy<00:06:36.780> to<00:06:37.780> use<00:06:37.810> the<00:06:38.320> Beauty<00:06:38.650> Blender<00:06:38.830> and

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 
easy to use the Beauty Blender and

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.529 
easy to use the Beauty Blender and
because<00:06:40.360> it's<00:06:40.660> wet<00:06:41.199> you<00:06:42.070> will<00:06:42.310> not<00:06:42.520> absorb<00:06:42.970> all

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:43.539 
because it's wet you will not absorb all

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:46.409 
because it's wet you will not absorb all
the<00:06:43.960> other<00:06:44.740> foundation<00:06:45.370> to<00:06:45.639> the<00:06:46.000> blender

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:46.419 
the other foundation to the blender

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:48.210 
the other foundation to the blender
actually<00:06:46.930> you<00:06:47.080> will<00:06:47.289> just<00:06:47.620> leave<00:06:47.860> it<00:06:48.010> on<00:06:48.100> the

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.220 
actually you will just leave it on the

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.760 
actually you will just leave it on the
surface<00:06:48.639> so<00:06:49.270> when<00:06:49.449> you<00:06:49.539> apply<00:06:49.870> your<00:06:50.169> face<00:06:50.440> it

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:50.770 
surface so when you apply your face it

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:54.770 
surface so when you apply your face it
really<00:06:51.130> just<00:06:51.720> apply<00:06:52.720> on<00:06:53.080> your<00:06:53.139> face<00:06:53.500> and<00:06:53.860> stuff
