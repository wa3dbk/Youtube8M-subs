00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
really quick what I did to the hair

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.880 
really quick what I did to the hair
because<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.480> did<00:00:33.690> change<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.199> up<00:00:34.350> within<00:00:34.769> the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
because I did change it up within the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.920 
because I did change it up within the
month<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.339> I've<00:00:35.430> worn<00:00:35.699> it<00:00:35.850> um<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.690> first

month that I've worn it um the first
obvious<00:00:37.530> change<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.610> hair<00:00:38.790> is

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
obvious change to it is that the hair is

and that I put a Scully on top to let it

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.670 
and that I put a Scully on top to let it
process<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:54.000> little<00:00:54.150> bit<00:00:54.360> faster<00:00:54.750> watched

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
now and I rinsed it out and actually got

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.469 
now and I rinsed it out and actually got
this<00:01:01.140> color<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.979> color<00:01:02.189> did<00:01:02.430> not<00:01:02.640> cause<00:01:03.180> the

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
this color the color did not cause the

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:06.109 
this color the color did not cause the
waves<00:01:03.689> to<00:01:04.019> drop<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.680> color<00:01:04.920> actually<00:01:05.610> kept

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
waves to drop the color actually kept

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.630 
waves to drop the color actually kept
the<00:01:06.299> curl<00:01:06.509> that<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.810> have<00:01:07.049> right<00:01:07.259> now<00:01:07.460> the<00:01:08.460> hair

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
the curl that I have right now the hair

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.249 
the curl that I have right now the hair
looks<00:01:08.850> really<00:01:08.939> really<00:01:09.450> big<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.990> that's<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
looks really really big and that's the

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.260 
looks really really big and that's the
reason<00:01:10.500> why<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.310> reason<00:01:11.340> why<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.210> looks

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
reason why and the reason why it looks

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.999 
reason why and the reason why it looks
really<00:01:12.689> big<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.110> because<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.710> was<00:01:13.830> playing

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
really big is because I was playing

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.940 
really big is because I was playing
around<00:01:14.070> with<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.490> that's<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.360> um<00:01:15.509> but<00:01:16.290> it's

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
around with it that's it um but it's

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.090 
around with it that's it um but it's
very<00:01:17.310> very<00:01:17.610> big<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:17.970> let<00:01:18.119> me<00:01:18.180> just<00:01:18.299> turn<00:01:18.720> around

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
very very big so let me just turn around

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:28.989 
very very big so let me just turn around
so<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.130> guys<00:01:20.400> can<00:01:20.640> see<00:01:21.050> this<00:01:22.050> here

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:28.999 

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:31.969 

so<00:01:29.999> it's<00:01:30.179> big<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.960> it's<00:01:31.079> fabulous<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.799> it's

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
so it's big and it's fabulous and it's

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.630 
so it's big and it's fabulous and it's
EMA<00:01:32.549> um<00:01:33.420> no<00:01:33.899> all<00:01:34.200> right<00:01:34.319> so<00:01:34.590> that's<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.250> first

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
EMA um no all right so that's the first

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.940 
EMA um no all right so that's the first
obvious<00:01:36.329> thing<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.630> I've<00:01:37.380> done<00:01:37.649> with<00:01:37.829> the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
obvious thing that I've done with the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.889 
obvious thing that I've done with the
hair<00:01:38.219> the<00:01:38.909> second<00:01:39.270> thing<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.479> I've<00:01:39.719> done

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
hair the second thing that I've done

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:41.719 
hair the second thing that I've done
with<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.229> hair<00:01:40.469> is<00:01:40.590> actually<00:01:40.770> took<00:01:41.219> off<00:01:41.429> the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
with the hair is actually took off the

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.449 
with the hair is actually took off the
closure<00:01:42.140> and<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.319> was<00:01:43.530> probably<00:01:43.859> three

00:01:44.449 --> 00:01:44.459 
closure and this was probably three

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:46.249 
closure and this was probably three
weeks<00:01:44.490> no<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:45.569> was<00:01:45.719> probably<00:01:45.929> two<00:01:46.229> weeks

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
weeks no this was probably two weeks

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.800 
weeks no this was probably two weeks
into<00:01:46.709> wearing<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.130> install<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.789> just<00:01:48.450> couldn't

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
into wearing the install I just couldn't

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.080 
into wearing the install I just couldn't
get<00:01:48.959> the<00:01:49.349> waves<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.219> closure<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.789> blend

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
get the waves of the closure to blend

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.819 
get the waves of the closure to blend
with<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.450> curled<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.109> hair<00:01:52.319> now<00:01:52.770> the

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
with the curled of the hair now the

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.910 
with the curled of the hair now the
closer<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.399> got<00:01:53.579> had<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:54.270> wave<00:01:54.920> didn't

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
closer that I got had a wave didn't

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.499 
closer that I got had a wave didn't
really<00:01:56.069> curl<00:01:56.340> up<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.609> way<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.759> wanted<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.299> curl

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
really curl up the way I wanted to curl

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.149 
really curl up the way I wanted to curl
up<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.869> can<00:01:58.049> reflect<00:01:58.289> the<00:01:58.530> way<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.740> hair<00:01:58.950> was

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
up so I can reflect the way the hair was

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.010 
up so I can reflect the way the hair was
and<00:01:59.429> I<00:01:59.459> tried<00:01:59.700> so<00:01:59.939> hard<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.299> try<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.479> blend<00:02:00.840> it

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
and I tried so hard to try to blend it

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.109 
and I tried so hard to try to blend it
and<00:02:01.920> detection<00:02:02.369> was<00:02:02.459> a<00:02:02.579> little<00:02:02.909> bit<00:02:03.000> too

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
and detection was a little bit too

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.850 
and detection was a little bit too
straight<00:02:03.450> for<00:02:03.719> me<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:04.020> get<00:02:04.170> in<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.289> room<00:02:04.439> area

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
straight for me I get in the room area

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.289 
straight for me I get in the room area
which<00:02:05.129> didn't<00:02:05.520> make<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.729> look<00:02:05.879> real<00:02:06.119> I

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
which didn't make it look real I

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.600 
which didn't make it look real I
couldn't<00:02:06.719> blend<00:02:06.929> it<00:02:07.020> cuz<00:02:07.289> I<00:02:07.590> get<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.190> relaxing

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
couldn't blend it cuz I get a relaxing

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.819 
couldn't blend it cuz I get a relaxing
really<00:02:08.759> bad<00:02:08.910> so<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.660> decided<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.470> just<00:02:10.619> use<00:02:10.709> my

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:10.829 
really bad so I decided to just use my

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:13.220 
really bad so I decided to just use my
own<00:02:11.039> natural<00:02:11.459> hair<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:12.000> try<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.239> blend<00:02:12.629> with

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
own natural hair to try to blend with

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.319 
own natural hair to try to blend with
the<00:02:14.010> hair<00:02:14.250> instead<00:02:14.549> of<00:02:14.610> using<00:02:14.849> the<00:02:15.030> closure

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
the hair instead of using the closure

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.630 
the hair instead of using the closure
which<00:02:16.049> helps<00:02:16.440> as<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:16.890> saw<00:02:17.069> I<00:02:17.099> might<00:02:17.310> get<00:02:17.459> ready

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
which helps as you saw I might get ready

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.150 
which helps as you saw I might get ready

it's<00:05:06.590> not<00:05:06.740> like<00:05:06.860> it's<00:05:07.010> straight<00:05:07.280> here<00:05:07.580> so<00:05:07.789> the

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:07.909 
it's not like it's straight here so the

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:09.279 
it's not like it's straight here so the
curls<00:05:08.180> aren't<00:05:08.419> going<00:05:08.630> to<00:05:08.720> intertwine<00:05:09.139> with

each other but the tangle is not bad the

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.710 
each other but the tangle is not bad the
tangle<00:05:12.889> the<00:05:13.520> proof<00:05:13.789> that<00:05:14.120> the<00:05:14.240> tangle<00:05:14.510> is<00:05:14.570> not

tangle the proof that the tangle is not

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.629 
tangle the proof that the tangle is not
bad<00:05:14.930> is<00:05:15.199> that<00:05:15.229> when<00:05:15.530> I<00:05:15.590> put<00:05:15.800> conditioner<00:05:16.310> in<00:05:16.490> it

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 
bad is that when I put conditioner in it

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:19.300

once it's wet and I brush it like those
