it's thinking but from here we can
basically<00:01:44.780> make<00:01:45.229> a<00:01:45.260> start<00:01:45.890> point<00:01:46.159> in<00:01:46.340> an

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
basically make a start point in an

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.530 
basically make a start point in an
endpoint<00:01:46.760> so<00:01:48.760> because<00:01:49.760> basically<00:01:49.970> what<00:01:50.240> every

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
endpoint so because basically what every

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.330 
endpoint so because basically what every
