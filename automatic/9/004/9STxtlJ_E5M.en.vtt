00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 diego sanchez barea all march for the 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.529
 left can be squared in all the 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.050
 perimeter zone I prefer to change basket 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.809
 gentlemen technique this is character 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.299
 expression techniques play was played here 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.090
 is going to see perform several like this is 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.010
 changing hands barea already had 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.070
 deposited on the board when it receives 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.580
 those tapas this technique for another jota 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.580
 varieties 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.990
 the rebound is offensive to Canada but 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.860
 he gives it away shit ready 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:40.530
 the legalized 8 the difference in an open 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.130
 and closing of eyes a result was opened 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.210
 that was by a point opened for 8 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.720
 cleaning the area for the turn of three 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.720
 by calixto 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.740
 one minute and 35 seconds what remains the 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.710
 distance a little puerto rico kendall 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.880
 he tried to cheat he did the play very well 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.920
 very good play finally and get 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.410
 roasting two points very well rose team 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.840
 biting the line remember that 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.300
 great player from venezuela el diablo 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.720
 cross l'aire that in that area was 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:16.060
 unstoppable cross and I remember a 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.380
 excelso also triplist as was his 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.720
 brother twist 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.729
 the air exactly here wreaked havoc 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.600
 in this same scenario playing in the 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:28.720
 finals against caracas savers 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.440
 Johnson new bounce second chance 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:36.360
 second chance is missing a hard but 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.430
 of basketball the lack of Sanchez 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.550
 but the jump that has 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.210
 tristan thompson 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:47.540
 there we see the hard lack seemed 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.960
 even an unsportsmanlike foul there is a 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:55.060
 discount you request to canada 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:58.580
 38 to 36 the difference gerardo gómez 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.740
 some novelty over there was not 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.280
 doing what we had talked nano 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:08.239
 the quick game what josé juan showed 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.830
 barea when entering penetration is what 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.420
 who wants to see to top what is sure 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.660
 will ask to remember that galindo 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.970
 santiago and sanchez the tall men of 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.970
 puerto rico are in the painting that's 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.670
 so that ayuso who is a shooter and barea 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.360
 move the web ball is more out of the 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.940
 perimeter 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.900
 and me even though thompson is 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:34.950
 still on court by canada has been seen 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.640
 a little bit not very effective within the 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.270
 painting 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.110
 goes through the defense that has kept you 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.110
 santiago at all times 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:49.140
 the blackboard does not indicate that canada the 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.750
 nicholson's best scorer with 11 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.110
 while the brook is the rich port that 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.540
 offers 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.600
 a ridge away after 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.770
 been submitted by a passage of the game 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.840
 to a tight marker with a boom 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.300
 closed advantage to puerto rico about 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.690
 Canada manages to get rid of a 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.340
 point to get to 6 when there is less of 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.370
 one minute to finish a time of 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.410
 puerto rico game has to follow 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.500
 taking care of the offensive rebounds has 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.120
 awarded 6 rebounds to the selection of 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.540
 Canada and that has allowed the 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.640
 Canadians will always be close to 2 a 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.120
 4 points of the Puerto Rico selection 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.120
 sos 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.830
 will be charged the play sanctioned with 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.160
 free throws in the value for 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.160
 thompson 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.390
 has 7 has not committed faults 7 points 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.960
 for thomson prepares the second shot 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:53.380
 but enter 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:57.150
 look at the bounce they are for your strong 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.150
 bending legs here together 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.950
 the value 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.560
 8 in the account for thompson 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:15.670
 38 to 34 years old helped a lot 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.120
 he fulfilled the role he managed to separate all his 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.810
 team 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.810
 and canada 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.640
 selecting the 2001 is the reduction 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.650
 of the selection of Puerto Rico there is a lack 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:32.810
 about the use they surprise committing 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:35.510
 infringement on joseph davis joseph 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.450
 the number 6 davis I is missing a 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.460
 his second staff with the mobility of 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.919
 Puerto Rico is complicated 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.530
 Canada does not get to do the aids 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:47.750
 defensive and always end up committing 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:51.750
 that lack when puerto rico seeks 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:57.260
 vertical locks and or blocking 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:05:00.230
 to unmark ayuso jj barea 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.960
 over the collective 5 is punishable from 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:09.639
 the free throw zone to 1 go now 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:12.009
 to 11 for use 11 points for use 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.930
 4 feelings for rock in disguise 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:15.430
 to get rid of the release mark or 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.830
 the change of marking on that play 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.139
 roasting appears use can not happen 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.240
 the barrier he left a man has been 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:24.249
 in the curtain they looked for that selection of 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.009
 shot for number 11 from the angle 

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:29.740
 right when they were going to deprive is the got 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:32.979
 with the movement of canada looking for the 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:36.879
 corner for that triple in the pones 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:39.069
 close 37 to 40 loses Canada with 

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:42.340
 puerto rico from that corner when 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:44.800
 there are 10 seconds to finish 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.650
 this second room that good curtain 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.139
 for this shot of 3000 use does not work 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.510
 the play is a second to pass the 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:56.080
 last load in suspension launches no 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:58.090
 can convert 40 to 37 ends the 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.639
 second quarter a game time is going 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:05.580
 with advantage of three port points 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:05.580
 rich on canada 40 to 37
