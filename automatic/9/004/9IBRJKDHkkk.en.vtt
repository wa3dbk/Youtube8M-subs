00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
on which I was largely in favor of

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.190 
on which I was largely in favor of
unfortunately<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.420> wasn't<00:00:33.600> really<00:00:33.870> taken

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
unfortunately it wasn't really taken

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.080 
unfortunately it wasn't really taken
into<00:00:34.380> account<00:00:34.410> just<00:00:34.980> how<00:00:35.309> long<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.760> season

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
into account just how long this season

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.780 
into account just how long this season
what's<00:00:36.239> going<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.780> be<00:00:36.960> or<00:00:37.309> just<00:00:38.309> when<00:00:38.670> the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
what's going to be or just when the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.459 
what's going to be or just when the
finals<00:00:39.120> was<00:00:39.239> going<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.480> be<00:00:39.570> done<00:00:39.780> either<00:00:39.989> so

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
finals was going to be done either so

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
that kind of incorporated the delay I

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.790 
that kind of incorporated the delay I
think<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.930> community<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.320> going<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.559> react

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
think the community is going to react

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.100 
think the community is going to react
mostly<00:00:44.219> positive<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.000> patch<00:00:45.270> now<00:00:45.840> it's

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
even one of the biggest patches that s 2

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.920 
even one of the biggest patches that s 2
has<00:01:13.950> ever<00:01:14.130> had<00:01:14.509> hopefully<00:01:15.509> people<00:01:15.689> will

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
killing sprees rather than only giving

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.420

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
them negatives what it will also do is

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.310
