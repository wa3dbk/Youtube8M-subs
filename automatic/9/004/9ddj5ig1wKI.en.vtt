00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
think that it's not designed very well

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.940 
think that it's not designed very well
and<00:00:11.519> I<00:00:11.610> think<00:00:11.700> that<00:00:12.150> it's<00:00:12.690> physically<00:00:13.500> ugly<00:00:13.650> as

well as just being like poorly
programmed<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:16.260> I<00:00:16.710> think<00:00:16.980> that<00:00:17.250> it's<00:00:17.520> it's

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
programmed and I think that it's it's

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.970 
programmed and I think that it's it's
very<00:00:18.439> unprofessional<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.770> try<00:00:19.949> to

Batman called me last night and he said

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.550 
Batman called me last night and he said
that<00:02:04.120> he<00:02:04.270> thinks<00:02:04.540> that<00:02:04.660> you<00:02:04.780> really<00:02:05.050> lame<00:02:05.260> and

that he thinks that you really lame and

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.940 
that he thinks that you really lame and
I<00:02:05.980> agreed<00:02:06.370> and<00:02:06.550> we<00:02:07.150> high-fived<00:02:07.830> through<00:02:08.830> the

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
I agreed and we high-fived through the

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.850 
I agreed and we high-fived through the
telephone<00:02:09.399> so<00:02:09.880> I<00:02:10.210> guess<00:02:10.840> Batman<00:02:11.320> just<00:02:11.530> thinks

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
telephone so I guess Batman just thinks

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.260 
telephone so I guess Batman just thinks
that<00:02:12.040> you're<00:02:12.280> not<00:02:12.490> a<00:02:12.520> cool<00:02:12.850> guy

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
that you're not a cool guy

Tom and everyone thinks that Batman is
cool<00:02:15.610> so<00:02:15.940> I<00:02:15.970> guess<00:02:16.330> he<00:02:16.600> probably<00:02:17.080> that<00:02:17.290> Batman

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830
