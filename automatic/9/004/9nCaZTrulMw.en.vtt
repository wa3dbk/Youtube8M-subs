center and today we're going to look at
this<00:00:05.330> 2013<00:00:06.500> Kawasaki<00:00:07.500> Ninja<00:00:07.890> 300<00:00:08.840> special

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
this 2013 Kawasaki Ninja 300 special

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.680 
this 2013 Kawasaki Ninja 300 special
edition<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:10.769> this<00:00:11.580> black<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.360> lime-green

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
edition and this black and lime-green

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.959 
edition and this black and lime-green
this<00:00:13.410> is<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.740> first<00:00:14.040> one<00:00:14.280> of<00:00:14.400> these<00:00:14.519> we've<00:00:14.759> got

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
this is the first one of these we've got

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.260 
this is the first one of these we've got
in<00:00:15.120> this<00:00:15.299> color<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:17.369> think<00:00:17.940> that's<00:00:18.150> just

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
in this color and I think that's just

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.590 
in this color and I think that's just
awesome

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:20.600 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.750 

well<00:00:22.070> Kawasaki<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.100> think<00:00:23.369> really<00:00:23.609> hit<00:00:23.730> a

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
well Kawasaki I think really hit a

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.040 
well Kawasaki I think really hit a
homerun<00:00:24.000> with<00:00:24.210> this<00:00:24.510> bike<00:00:26.449> of<00:00:27.449> course<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.869> big

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
homerun with this bike of course the big

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.710 
homerun with this bike of course the big
news<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.529> it's<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.949> 300<00:00:29.580> cc<00:00:29.970> motor<00:00:30.240> instead<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.660> a

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
news is it's a 300 cc motor instead of a

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.049 
news is it's a 300 cc motor instead of a
250<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.769> course<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.250> big<00:00:32.460> thing<00:00:32.759> with<00:00:32.910> the

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
250 of course the big thing with the

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.630 
250 of course the big thing with the
ninjas<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.690> major<00:00:33.870> 250<00:00:34.500> s<00:00:34.559> previous<00:00:34.829> AMD's<00:00:35.430> is

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
ninjas the major 250 s previous AMD's is

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.670 
ninjas the major 250 s previous AMD's is
that<00:00:35.790> there<00:00:35.940> are<00:00:36.000> twin<00:00:36.270> cylinder<00:00:36.570> motor<00:00:36.899> so

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
that there are twin cylinder motor so

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.290 
that there are twin cylinder motor so
you've<00:00:37.800> got<00:00:37.950> two<00:00:38.160> cylinders<00:00:38.610> as<00:00:38.790> opposed<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.210> a

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
you've got two cylinders as opposed to a

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.450 
you've got two cylinders as opposed to a
single<00:00:39.690> cylinder<00:00:40.309> with<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.340> competition<00:00:41.910> and

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
single cylinder with the competition and

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.310 
single cylinder with the competition and
there's<00:00:44.460> really<00:00:44.760> no<00:00:45.270> comparison<00:00:45.450> then<00:00:46.140> to

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
there's really no comparison then to

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.770 
there's really no comparison then to
solar<00:00:46.649> water<00:00:47.059> with<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.149> two<00:00:48.300> power<00:00:48.539> pulses

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
solar water with the two power pulses

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.049 
solar water with the two power pulses
really<00:00:49.260> makes<00:00:49.469> lots<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.100> lots<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.520> power<00:00:51.379> so

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
really makes lots and lots of power so

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.389 
really makes lots and lots of power so
really<00:00:54.059> does<00:00:54.270> well<00:00:54.570> but<00:00:55.020> they<00:00:55.170> changed<00:00:56.129> quite

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
really does well but they changed quite

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.250 
really does well but they changed quite
a<00:00:56.460> bit<00:00:56.579> in<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:57.120> motor<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.539> now<00:00:57.660> has<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.870> spin<00:00:58.230> on

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
a bit in this motor it now has a spin on

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.520 
a bit in this motor it now has a spin on
type<00:00:58.620> wolf<00:00:58.920> filter<00:00:59.370> has<00:01:00.059> beer<00:01:00.329> exhaust<00:01:00.780> pipes

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.800 

then<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.589> course<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.949> more<00:01:05.129> displacement<00:01:05.880> you

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
then of course the more displacement you

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.270 
then of course the more displacement you
can<00:01:06.960> see<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.229> connecting<00:01:07.710> tube<00:01:07.950> there

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
can see that connecting tube there

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.550 
can see that connecting tube there
between<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.450> pipes<00:01:09.689> really<00:01:10.080> helps<00:01:10.350> with<00:01:10.439> the

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
between the pipes really helps with the

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.380 
between the pipes really helps with the
low<00:01:10.710> end<00:01:10.890> power<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.490> what<00:01:11.640> Kawasaki<00:01:12.119> really

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
low end power and what Kawasaki really

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.060 
low end power and what Kawasaki really
tried<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.570> do<00:01:12.780> with<00:01:12.930> these<00:01:13.049> besides<00:01:13.470> just<00:01:13.860> give

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
tried to do with these besides just give

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.520 
tried to do with these besides just give
them<00:01:14.189> more<00:01:14.400> power<00:01:14.430> overall<00:01:15.299> was<00:01:16.170> give<00:01:16.380> them

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
them more power overall was give them

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.280 
them more power overall was give them
more<00:01:16.710> power<00:01:16.740> down<00:01:17.310> low<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:18.270> it's<00:01:19.080> much<00:01:19.259> easier

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
more power down low so it's much easier

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.260 
more power down low so it's much easier
to<00:01:19.650> pull<00:01:19.890> away<00:01:19.979> from<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.400> stop<00:01:20.640> sign<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.240> that

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
to pull away from a stop sign and that

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.810 
to pull away from a stop sign and that
kind<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.600> thing<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.049> then<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.890> also<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.520> new

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
kind of thing and then the also a new

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
kind of thing and then the also a new
clutch<00:01:24.119> in<00:01:24.390> these<00:01:24.570> has<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.049> new<00:01:25.229> FCC<00:01:26.840> clutch

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
clutch in these has the new FCC clutch

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.050 
clutch in these has the new FCC clutch
which<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.320> really<00:01:28.710> light<00:01:28.950> pool<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.820> then<00:01:30.000> it

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
which is really light pool and then it

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.120 
which is really light pool and then it
also<00:01:30.180> has<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.450> slipper<00:01:30.750> clutch<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.409> if<00:01:31.979> you're

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
also has a slipper clutch so if you're

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.819 
also has a slipper clutch so if you're
decelerating<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.420> get<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.380> long<00:01:34.560> gear

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
decelerating and you get to long gear

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.910 
decelerating and you get to long gear
too<00:01:35.040> soon<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.490> will<00:01:35.640> lock<00:01:35.880> up<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.119> back<00:01:36.450> tire

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
too soon you will lock up that back tire

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.350 
too soon you will lock up that back tire

got<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.299> wavy<00:01:42.960> style<00:01:43.380> rotors<00:01:43.890> or<00:01:44.070> pedal<00:01:44.399> style

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
got the wavy style rotors or pedal style

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.190 
got the wavy style rotors or pedal style
rotors<00:01:45.030> Kawasaki<00:01:45.509> calls<00:01:45.810> or<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.079> got

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
rotors Kawasaki calls or so you got

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.289 
rotors Kawasaki calls or so you got
these<00:01:46.320> little<00:01:46.500> cuts<00:01:46.829> in<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.700> rotors<00:01:48.090> there

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
these little cuts in the rotors there

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.090 
these little cuts in the rotors there
and<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:48.990> gives<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.290> more<00:01:49.409> surface<00:01:49.799> area<00:01:49.950> to

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
and that gives it more surface area to

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.850 
and that gives it more surface area to
just<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.369> paint<00:01:50.549> eat

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860
