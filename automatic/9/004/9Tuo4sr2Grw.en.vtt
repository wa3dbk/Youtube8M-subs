00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:09.889 
have the monthly dragon which is a

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.709 
have the monthly dragon which is a
really<00:00:10.889> pretty<00:00:11.130> simple<00:00:11.550> easy<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.269> greet

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
really pretty simple easy to greet

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.020 
really pretty simple easy to greet
dragon<00:00:13.200> well<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.710> guess<00:00:14.130> it's<00:00:14.400> easy<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.700> breathe

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
dragon well I guess it's easy to breathe

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.109 
dragon well I guess it's easy to breathe
because<00:00:15.529> most<00:00:16.529> players<00:00:16.830> can<00:00:17.160> tell<00:00:17.400> what<00:00:17.789> to

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
because most players can tell what to

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.080 
because most players can tell what to
use<00:00:18.359> but<00:00:18.720> just<00:00:19.020> by<00:00:19.170> looking<00:00:19.500> at<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.680> elements

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
use but just by looking at the elements

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.970 
use but just by looking at the elements
now<00:00:21.090> this<00:00:21.330> dragon<00:00:21.900> I'm<00:00:22.080> not<00:00:22.380> really<00:00:22.590> sure<00:00:22.859> if

it's<00:00:23.100> limited<00:00:23.340> edition<00:00:23.580> or<00:00:24.090> not<00:00:24.240> but<00:00:24.630> it

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
it's limited edition or not but it

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.730 
it's limited edition or not but it

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
just really simple to element it has the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.030 
just really simple to element it has the
elements<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:04.080> plant<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.040> fire<00:01:06.320> now<00:01:07.320> that

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
being said the elements are simple but

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.270 
being said the elements are simple but
the<00:01:11.250> rarity<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.479> dragon<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:12.990> think<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.500> is

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
the rarity of the dragon I think is is

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.850 
the rarity of the dragon I think is is
quite<00:01:14.729> rare<00:01:15.180> I'd<00:01:15.689> say<00:01:16.049> it's<00:01:16.350> more<00:01:16.560> rare<00:01:16.830> than

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
quite rare I'd say it's more rare than

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.210 
quite rare I'd say it's more rare than
the<00:01:17.100> poison<00:01:17.400> dragon<00:01:17.700> or<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.390> flower<00:01:18.630> dragon

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.450 
be difficult so if you're wondering if
the<00:01:46.500> combination<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.340> wrong<00:01:47.700> it's<00:01:48.479> not<00:01:49.460> the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
the combination is wrong it's not the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.980
