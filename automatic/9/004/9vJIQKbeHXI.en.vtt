the<00:01:09.770> left<00:01:10.060> this<00:01:11.060> is<00:01:11.119> going<00:01:11.300> to<00:01:11.360> be<00:01:11.450> used<00:01:11.660> for

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
the left this is going to be used for

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.219 
the left this is going to be used for
our<00:01:11.810> rust<00:01:12.080> technique<00:01:13.630> now<00:01:14.630> you<00:01:14.690> don't<00:01:15.020> need

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
our rust technique now you don't need

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:16.870 
our rust technique now you don't need
too<00:01:15.380> much<00:01:15.530> antiquing<00:01:16.070> cream<00:01:16.280> it<00:01:16.460> does<00:01:16.670> go<00:01:16.850> a

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
too much antiquing cream it does go a

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.969 
too much antiquing cream it does go a
long<00:01:17.119> way<00:01:17.360> you<00:01:17.930> can<00:01:18.080> apply<00:01:18.290> to<00:01:18.350> your<00:01:18.470> finger

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
long way you can apply to your finger

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.950 
long way you can apply to your finger
but<00:01:19.160> actually<00:01:19.820> I<00:01:19.880> think<00:01:19.940> I'll<00:01:20.479> get<00:01:20.600> a<00:01:20.660> brush

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
but actually I think I'll get a brush

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.550 
but actually I think I'll get a brush
and<00:01:21.200> I<00:01:21.320> apply<00:01:21.350> with<00:01:21.710> a<00:01:21.740> brush<00:01:25.810> now<00:01:26.810> it's<00:01:27.290> really

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
and I apply with a brush now it's really

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.380 
and I apply with a brush now it's really
important<00:01:28.160> to<00:01:28.250> work<00:01:28.399> this<00:01:28.580> antiquing<00:01:29.119> cream

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
important to work this antiquing cream

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.240 
important to work this antiquing cream
so<00:01:29.630> it<00:01:29.810> gets<00:01:30.229> right<00:01:30.410> into<00:01:30.649> the<00:01:30.740> depths<00:01:31.069> of<00:01:31.130> the

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
so it gets right into the depths of the

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.620 
so it gets right into the depths of the
texture<00:01:31.729> and<00:01:33.610> you<00:01:34.610> see<00:01:34.789> as<00:01:34.880> I<00:01:34.970> mentioned<00:01:35.420> a

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
texture and you see as I mentioned a

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:48.590 
texture and you see as I mentioned a
small<00:01:36.289> amount<00:01:36.740> goes<00:01:36.830> a<00:01:36.950> long<00:01:37.160> long<00:01:37.340> way

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.719 

there<00:01:49.230> we<00:01:49.320> go<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:49.770> there's<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.280> light<00:01:50.490> gray

you a another added dimension to using

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.170 
you a another added dimension to using
the<00:06:01.510> antiquing<00:06:01.990> creams<00:06:02.520> now<00:06:03.520> one<00:06:03.880> thing<00:06:04.060> you

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
the antiquing creams now one thing you

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.150 
the antiquing creams now one thing you
can<00:06:04.390> do<00:06:04.630> is<00:06:04.870> buff<00:06:05.140> these<00:06:05.410> antique<00:06:05.770> and<00:06:05.950> creams

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 
can do is buff these antique and creams

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.220 
can do is buff these antique and creams
once<00:06:06.400> they're<00:06:06.550> dry<00:06:06.700> and<00:06:07.120> just<00:06:07.810> will<00:06:08.110> have<00:06:08.140> a

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:08.230 
once they're dry and just will have a

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.080 
once they're dry and just will have a
soft<00:06:08.470> cloth<00:06:08.680> and<00:06:09.010> hopefully<00:06:09.580> you'll<00:06:09.700> see<00:06:09.880> the

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
soft cloth and hopefully you'll see the

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.060 
soft cloth and hopefully you'll see the
angle<00:06:10.450> that<00:06:10.900> you<00:06:11.020> get<00:06:11.170> a<00:06:11.200> really<00:06:11.410> lovely<00:06:11.710> sheen

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
angle that you get a really lovely sheen

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.590 
angle that you get a really lovely sheen
on<00:06:12.100> the<00:06:12.340> surface<00:06:14.760> now<00:06:15.760> you<00:06:15.820> could<00:06:16.180> seal<00:06:16.420> this

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.600 
on the surface now you could seal this

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.510 
on the surface now you could seal this
again<00:06:16.870> and<00:06:17.140> then<00:06:17.380> start<00:06:17.770> layering<00:06:18.010> with

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
again and then start layering with

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.370 
again and then start layering with
quinacridone<00:06:18.850> gold<00:06:19.180> again<00:06:19.630> just<00:06:19.840> to<00:06:19.960> age<00:06:20.170> it

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
quinacridone gold again just to age it

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.780 
quinacridone gold again just to age it
even<00:06:20.680> more<00:06:20.860> so<00:06:21.130> that<00:06:21.160> there's<00:06:21.610> endless

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:21.790 
even more so that there's endless

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.680 
even more so that there's endless
possibilities<00:06:23.580> okay<00:06:24.580> so<00:06:24.640> the<00:06:24.970> first<00:06:25.090> coat<00:06:25.510> of

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
possibilities okay so the first coat of

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.890 
possibilities okay so the first coat of
quinacridone<00:06:26.170> gold<00:06:26.500> is<00:06:27.070> now<00:06:27.250> dry<00:06:27.550> I'd<00:06:28.450> really

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:28.900 
quinacridone gold is now dry I'd really

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.400 
quinacridone gold is now dry I'd really
like<00:06:29.080> it<00:06:29.230> how<00:06:29.380> is<00:06:29.620> but<00:06:30.460> we<00:06:30.910> can<00:06:31.200> take<00:06:32.200> it<00:06:32.380> a

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:32.410 
like it how is but we can take it a

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:33.840 
like it how is but we can take it a
stage<00:06:32.650> forever<00:06:32.920> again<00:06:33.340> I'm<00:06:33.520> going<00:06:33.610> to<00:06:33.700> put<00:06:33.820> a

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:33.850 
stage forever again I'm going to put a

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.540 
stage forever again I'm going to put a
second<00:06:34.180> coat<00:06:34.210> of<00:06:34.600> the<00:06:35.020> gold<00:06:35.230> on<00:06:35.440> and<00:06:35.680> this<00:06:36.430> is

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550 
second coat of the gold on and this is

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.280 
second coat of the gold on and this is
just<00:06:36.700> going<00:06:36.820> to<00:06:36.880> intensify<00:06:37.330> that<00:06:37.630> that<00:06:38.020> rust

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:38.290 
just going to intensify that that rust

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:42.870 
just going to intensify that that rust
color<00:06:39.510> and<00:06:40.620> again<00:06:41.620> it's<00:06:42.010> really<00:06:42.250> important<00:06:42.760> to

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 
color and again it's really important to

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:52.149 
color and again it's really important to
apply<00:06:43.180> this<00:06:43.240> thinly

00:06:52.149 --> 00:06:52.159 

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:54.459 

so<00:06:52.819> there<00:06:53.119> you<00:06:53.149> go<00:06:53.360> a<00:06:53.389> really<00:06:53.749> easy<00:06:54.050> rust

00:06:54.459 --> 00:06:54.469 
so there you go a really easy rust

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:57.309 
so there you go a really easy rust
technique<00:06:55.449> now<00:06:56.449> you<00:06:56.509> could<00:06:56.809> leave<00:06:56.929> the<00:06:57.139> rust

00:06:57.309 --> 00:06:57.319 
technique now you could leave the rust

00:06:57.319 --> 00:06:58.959 
technique now you could leave the rust
as<00:06:57.469> it<00:06:57.619> is<00:06:57.709> but<00:06:57.889> we're<00:06:58.279> going<00:06:58.369> to<00:06:58.429> antique<00:06:58.789> this

00:06:58.959 --> 00:06:58.969 
as it is but we're going to antique this

00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:00.339 
as it is but we're going to antique this
now<00:06:59.149> with<00:06:59.389> the<00:06:59.479> white<00:06:59.599> anti-aging<00:07:00.139> cream

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:00.349 
now with the white anti-aging cream

00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:03.519 
now with the white anti-aging cream
again<00:07:01.309> as<00:07:01.729> before<00:07:02.059> just<00:07:02.509> apply<00:07:02.959> this<00:07:03.019> all<00:07:03.469> over

00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:03.529 
again as before just apply this all over

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:06.850 
again as before just apply this all over
with<00:07:03.889> a<00:07:04.039> brush<00:07:05.379> it's<00:07:06.379> going<00:07:06.439> to<00:07:06.619> give<00:07:06.739> an

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:06.860 
with a brush it's going to give an

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.649 
with a brush it's going to give an
appearance<00:07:07.219> of<00:07:07.759> this<00:07:07.849> piece<00:07:08.119> so<00:07:08.149> it<00:07:08.479> looks

00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:08.659 
appearance of this piece so it looks

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:10.149 
appearance of this piece so it looks
like<00:07:08.839> it's<00:07:09.019> been<00:07:09.139> painted<00:07:09.379> in<00:07:09.769> the<00:07:09.860> paints

00:07:10.149 --> 00:07:10.159 
like it's been painted in the paints
