00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.990
 hello to all today we get 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.059
 found for a video on how 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.950
 make three stars with strategy 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.490
 Dragons crowd against City Hall 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.530
 level 8 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.960
 I introduced you all through 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.190
 three different replay so first 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.010
 replay we end up with a 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.630
 composition of 10 level 3 dragons 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.640
 so all the dragons were launched 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.640
 in the top of the online base so 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.349
 as I specified in my strategy 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.500
 strategy of attack with full dragon 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.700
 so he did not take out the castle 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.590
 clan so that means he has he 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.750
 preferred all the essays and in his 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.879
 composition he chose three spells of 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.110
 care so it's dragon he uses his 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.170
 care spells when these dragons are at 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.670
 range of anti-aircraft defenses and 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.590
 his way dragons with their attack 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.950
 splash will destroy quite easily 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.239
 the clan castles so the dragons 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.350
 continue their breakthrough we see they 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.180
 shave the base relatively online 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.469
 so they destroy as they go 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.469
 and so they find themselves still aligned 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.640
 so there the dragons are attacking the hotel 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.230
 of town and some buildings 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.030
 would be the town hall will give way enough 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.049
 quickly here and so it remains 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.970
 already more than one defense 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.560
 antiaircraft and so that's where there is 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.939
 a crucial point is that they spot 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.909
 that the beasts practically every 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.920
 target buildings the dragons is so 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.210
 just had it right down he deposited I 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.830
 not sure if you have seen and 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.049
 deposed his king of bass bars to attract 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.369
 the cannon customers to attack it's on 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.869
 oger from colombia under a clan jo and 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.240
 then put it on a pig's jard 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.890
 what are they going to attack directly at the 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.330
 anti-aircraft defense so that's a 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.450
 point that had relatively interesting 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.710
 so that's using these holes a few 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.600
 ground troops with riders 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.250
 pig so that is the king and 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.479
 5 pig will say in his Rider 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.579
 clan castle could open him 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.960
 an anti-air defense but in 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.970
 paying attention of course that those of 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.520
 air defense be relatively 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.960
 easily accessible from the ground which 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.270
 that is to say that there is not too much cannon 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.070
 which targets or while novo graser us 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.380
 that is, our pig shoes and 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.460
 the time to destroy it 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.740
 so for that it is necessary that the castle of 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.259
 opposing clan be totally wiped out by 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.820
 this dragon so the second replay again 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.680
 an online attack so a dragon summer 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.390
 deposited for each building and therefore the 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.009
 blow the dragons see further advancing in 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.810
 line send who is they are all about 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.459
 the same line 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.229
 so he digs slowly based on the 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.910
 Clan castle and starts shooting 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.950
 life like just now when there is the 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.260
 when there is anti-aircraft defense 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.570
 target kimou we put the sheets down 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.920
 care spells so there the horses each 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.480
 pig were dropped when we live 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.680
 on time and look like he did a 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.640
 small a first cleaning 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.440
 so that is to say that it is well seen in 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.700
 his attack before his attack and bah 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.530
 when he drops his men 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.750
 these pig drivers they were 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.670
 attacked directly to the anti defenses 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.560
 aerial and so that if he's scared he could 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.970
 destroy two antiaircraft defenses this 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.050
 which is considerable because the 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.700
 thierry aisne against the defender 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.230
 dragons that's deadly so in this the 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.460
 removing that gave him a lot more 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.910
 chances to make a three- star 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.260
 good there he has a few minutes ago 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.280
 flying skeletons that he attacks but 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.580
 it's true that it's going to do very little 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.580
 damages 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.590
 he had used a stormy evening that 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.870
 was very helpful in destroying the 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.100
 last turn anti-aircraft defense 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.080
 so is there the dragons are going to finish 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.970
 quietly work in the base 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.560
 so when it comes to tackling 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.080
 last buildings so down we see 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.100
 what is the g1 king of the barbarians who 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.570
 crate a few buildings but that's 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.730
 really not on him all the inter going is 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.440
 wear since lille brest 3 dragon and 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.030
 his three dragons who are supposed to finish 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.250
 really work him the king is over 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.080
 there to distract the troops as we have 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.190
 could see him the part of before the king who 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.050
 were there to distract the cannon 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.990
 while pig drivers 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.000
 was going to tackle the remaining defenses 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.010
 so that's nothing interesting 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.230
 so there is more than the non buildings 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.820
 defensive to destroy so that is to say 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.010
 tanks or even extractors 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.810
 and workers' huts is so this 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.120
 will still be a 100% it's a second 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.020
 100% with exactly the same composition 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.520
 that is 10 dragon level 3 and 5 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.959
 dwarf pig driver jadot clan 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.700
 so that's a very good thing and that's 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.670
 an adaptable strategy for hotels 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.290
 of the city level of May 8 in time pass 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.550
 and a third replay so there 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.590
 now it will be with dragons of 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.390
 level 2 but still said dragons this 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.040
 time here so like just now a 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.900
 striker line one drops a dragon 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.340
 about per building and so you go 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.540
 see that it will allow by doing that 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.830
 it will keep them online 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.209
 when they go to buildings 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.860
 following look they destroyed the 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.910
 building and continue online 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.670
 there this time in the castle ducla 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.380
 we had a level 3 dragon instead 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.230
 to help with their long and hot 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.850
 pig here he is our dragons is orienting himself 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.080
 towards a base shot is there there are some 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.280
 Islands will be attracted also by 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.670
 clan castle troops who them 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.620
 out 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.270
 so fate of rage that will allow us 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.650
 to accelerate at the level of the troops of the 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.240
 clan castle to be able to 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.880
 eliminate faster and be less 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.590
 exposed if she is sorcerer or where the 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.230
 troops that are relatively long at 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.610
 destroy so there we continue a defense 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.070
 destroyed antiaircraft 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.930
 we have another target but who is 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.120
 of a very low level so it 's not going 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.310
 to be embarrassing and there we use another 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.350
 fate of rage next to the defense 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.120
 anti-aircraft to be able to destroy it 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.430
 more quickly and finally care so kind 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.740
 hopping care as we could see for 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.260
 so that our dragons can finish the 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.640
 tacc so there a good part of the base 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.010
 is eliminated we do not know yet it's a 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.990
 two or three stars but at least the 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.070
 two stars assured that's already what 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.570
 still remains all the way around 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.880
 the base but we see that there is already more 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.530
 anti- aircraft defense so with a 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.990
 line brest 1-2 we have five left 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.370
 seadragon dragons total if dragon is 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.710
 largely sufficient normally for 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.970
 destroy the rest since it was said that 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.410
 to attack the nothing is more than 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.910
 the wizard's towers that are almost 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.050
 no damage men and towers 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.570
 darche and my darche towers and that's 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.490
 derisory compared to sea dragon 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.740
 so here are the dragons going to finish yet 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.600
 once the buildings remain without too much 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.640
 feels too much trouble 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.120
 finish so after in general when 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.460
 it's like that 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.160
 the only factor that could make us 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.410
 have a miss the 3 stars pardon it's 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.400
 of time so if we take too much 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.860
 time to make his attack 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.150
 we risk playing them but there is no 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.560
 only the attacked was pretty good 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.320
 managed and therefore pay should paillard 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.020
 problem so we remember that tired of 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.640
 planned city hotel attacks 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.050
 level 8 against city halls of 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.490
 level 8 so that's really a 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.230
 recorded since in clan war 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.240
 it's in the interest of showing you 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.340
 that's only in clan station if you 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.590
 make the 3 stars it must give beautiful 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:02.350
 much more luck to your clan's 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.520
 win her and win the war 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.350
 so we've all seen them for this 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.610
 strategy so I hope this video 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.110
 you more is the case do not hesitate to 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.970

 like and if they wanted to see if you 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.910
 want to see a lot of clash videos

 of plant do not hesitate to you either
