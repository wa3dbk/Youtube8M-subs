00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.210
 they are grown and project to fantastic sambar in fact here where we are 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.540
 at that moment it is proposed 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.670
 one or two tables for breakfast to eat and the charges serve 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.880
 before it is very very enjoyable 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.680
 it was the pool has a special shape 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.030
 has a deeper area and a ram that's a string 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.579
 inside this Thursday the newspaper 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:47.310
 an ax to have other children 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.229
 but something that I love is that it has a set in the afternoon 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.510
 bottom of the pond is accusing the water upwards 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.910

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.800

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.800
 fair you can pass for was unknown 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.479
 I eat cereal 

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:16.929
 a room 

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:19.089
 with a contemporary style 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:22.430
 I love the contrast that made this fact 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.409
 make it with the chocolates that we have in 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.649
 in the city he raised Gines 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:29.559
 picture 

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:32.899
 everything makes an integral atmosphere 

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:34.519
 each one of the details 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.310
 there are many to marry to the soffits that we have in the chest the details of 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:40.389
 this fact 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:43.589
 good that we have a fine indeed the upholstery 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:46.199
 that Paris is painted by hand 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.379
 fig tree osuna does it to catch 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:51.489
 I rejoice that its colors in very welcoming tones 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.059
 he would be totally 

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:56.549
 Honduran wooden jack 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.639
 on some planks in order 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:01.639
 of a very strong texture 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:04.219
 and here is 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:08.429
 I would like to move to the Falcon Menor so we can see the beams we have 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.149
 I would like to emphasize 

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:14.029
 the originality of the furniture designs 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:18.419
 they are not mothers with children over 55 and a half on the other hand that is to say 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:20.529
 that we are not going to get it 

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:24.029
 the latest designs denounced more designers 

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:25.389
 those of the world 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:27.980
 in that we are always aware of 87 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.949
 Sometimes it's about bringing different things 

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:34.419
 and that's the reflection of this dining room 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:38.389
 It has a very very particular very original design and yasmani its base explained 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:40.230
 that the resignation added that it is also 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.540
 a trend 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.800
 very avant-garde 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.539
 and we have here also this mirror wall 

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:48.699
 the entire wall of the bathroom and 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:51.699
 montes tempo 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.149
 it's a good transitional style 

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:59.149
 this property had to do the year failures 

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:01.819
 the conservative carvings that be 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:05.389
 they have presented the new vicente of the forest without two new 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:07.880
 I love you so a very fine piece of furniture 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.880
 very elaborated yet completely different 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.049
 past policies of doing it 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.999
 this needs to be mentioned 

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:21.249
 and I would like you to accompany me upstairs 

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:22.909

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.469
 on the second floor 

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:38.329
 in the part of the second floor lobby where you live in the areas of the 

00:04:38.329 --> 00:04:39.050
