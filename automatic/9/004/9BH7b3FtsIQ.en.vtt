way you meant to put it on I don't do
that<00:00:58.469> I'll<00:00:58.859> put<00:00:59.129> them<00:00:59.219> backwards<00:01:00.680> Torres<00:01:01.680> ins

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
that I'll put them backwards Torres ins

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.579 
that I'll put them backwards Torres ins
books<00:01:02.850> more<00:01:03.090> aggressive<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.840> little<00:01:04.500> bit

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
books more aggressive a little bit

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.530 
books more aggressive a little bit
better<00:01:04.710> look<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.489> little<00:01:05.850> bit<00:01:06.030> better<00:01:06.150> looking

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
better look a little bit better looking

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.740 
better look a little bit better looking
and<00:01:07.010> also<00:01:08.010> if<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.970> look<00:01:09.210> at<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.510> back<00:01:09.720> here

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
and also if you look at the back here

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.280 
and also if you look at the back here
with<00:01:10.710> split<00:01:11.159> forward<00:01:11.640> if<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.689> project<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:13.110> line

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
with split forward if you project a line

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.830 
with split forward if you project a line
down<00:01:13.500> from<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.830> bottom<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.220> your<00:01:14.250> tail<00:01:14.840> from

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
down from the bottom of your tail from

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.420 
down from the bottom of your tail from
the<00:01:15.930> bottom<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.320> your<00:01:16.350> main<00:01:16.560> shaft<00:01:16.890> down<00:01:18.170> to

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
the bottom of your main shaft down to

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.730 
the bottom of your main shaft down to
where<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.970> front<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.509> skit<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:22.049> its

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
where the front of that skit is its

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.920 
where the front of that skit is its
buried<00:01:23.159> pipes<00:01:23.549> your<00:01:24.060> center<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.420> gravity<00:01:24.509> is

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
buried pipes your center of gravity is

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.590 
buried pipes your center of gravity is
on<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.439> main<00:01:25.680> shaft<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.250> if<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.240> do<00:01:27.390> have

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
on that main shaft and if you do have

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.600 
on that main shaft and if you do have
them<00:01:27.750> reversed<00:01:28.080> makes<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.100> little<00:01:29.280> bit<00:01:29.490> more

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
them reversed makes a little bit more

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.270 
them reversed makes a little bit more
stable<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.119> learning<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.840> take<00:01:31.140> off<00:01:31.350> as<00:01:31.590> well

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
stable and learning and take off as well

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.300 
stable and learning and take off as well
as<00:01:32.430> looking<00:01:32.700> better<00:01:32.930> so<00:01:33.950> flip<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.130> upside

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
as looking better so flip this upside

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.289 
as looking better so flip this upside
down<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:36.229> usually<00:01:37.229> do<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.860> my<00:01:37.979> lap<00:01:38.189> it's<00:01:39.060> a

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
down I usually do this in my lap it's a

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.130 
down I usually do this in my lap it's a
lot<00:01:39.689> easier<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:40.079> do<00:01:41.150> nitrile<00:01:42.150> helicopters<00:01:42.689> put

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
lot easier to do nitrile helicopters put

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.539 
lot easier to do nitrile helicopters put
in<00:01:43.229> your<00:01:43.380> tail<00:01:43.560> skins<00:01:43.860> on<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.159> one<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
in your tail skins on is one of the

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.499 
in your tail skins on is one of the
first<00:01:44.820> things<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.299> do<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.829> can<00:01:47.509> work

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
first things you do so that you can work

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.660 
first things you do so that you can work
with<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.840> otherwise<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:49.950> gets<00:01:50.130> too<00:01:50.399> big<00:01:50.610> and

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
with it otherwise it gets too big and

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.350 
with it otherwise it gets too big and
too<00:01:51.000> heavy<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:52.610> they're<00:01:53.610> rather<00:01:53.939> difficult

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
too heavy and they're rather difficult

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.340 
too heavy and they're rather difficult
to<00:01:54.630> work<00:01:54.869> on<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.310> just<00:01:57.090> put<00:01:57.149> this<00:01:57.450> screw<00:01:58.020> onto

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
to work on so I just put this screw onto

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.390 
to work on so I just put this screw onto
the<00:01:58.590> driver<00:01:59.570> and<00:02:00.570> just<00:02:00.750> put<00:02:00.899> one<00:02:01.110> screw<00:02:01.409> in

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
the driver and just put one screw in

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:10.830 
the driver and just put one screw in
through<00:02:04.270> that<00:02:04.540> skid<00:02:04.900> and<00:02:09.540> into<00:02:10.540> the<00:02:10.660> black

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
through that skid and into the black

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:18.150 
through that skid and into the black
plastic<00:02:11.170> log<00:02:11.620> of<00:02:11.890> that<00:02:12.160> Vice<00:02:12.760> plight
