00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
 with the a-4, if I'm going to explain today, a very interesting theory 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.740
 I found myself in wikileaks 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.280
 and recommend this page for all your questions with pokémon 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.629
 I hope you serve them and enjoy the exhibition very much xd 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:15.820
 there tied them up pokémon 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.599
 birth of maple 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:21.649
 tells a legend that a new habit in nothing when hatching this was born of 

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:26.380
 the f1 considered the pokémon creator or pokemon hike with his taxes gave 

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:27.069
 formal 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:28.599
 I'm in the universe 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.890
 zarzel gus created mv his own body being meo the first existing pokémon 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.850
 and which is believed to be the ancestor of the other pokémon because in his DNA he has 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.170
 the genetic code of all of them making it capable of using any 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.210
 technique so this one and maple us are the only pokémon who saw all the 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.250
 process of formation of the cosmos 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.490
 they were born later to roads that in turn gave rise to time by doing it 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.390
 move forward from birth 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.740
 it is said that time advances with each one of his beats and that he is also 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.950
 able to control its flow, being able to travel to the past and the future at pleasure 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.090
 and pal that gave rise to space and dimensions giving them stability 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.930
 with your breathing 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.270
 it is not known if we make a vow because I do not believe the world is to say to the planet earth 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.780
 but later it was born final tour which turned out to be very violent so 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.820
 it was banished to the distortion world a world put to ours and whose laws 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.090
 They defy common sense so that it will not cause further damage 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.740
 where you observe the world in silence through any object that causes 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.120
 reflections like metal mirrors and water 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.210
 with the created world but still uninhabitable were born fever debuted in 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.860
 eba and 4 who created the oceans rivers 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.660
 lakes and other water sources the earth continents islands and other masses of 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.220
 solid ground and the sky wind clouds and changes of climates respectively 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.540
 since the world is limited it was soon filled by oceans and land and by not 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.320
 be more author space or want to fight to conquer the 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.270
 planet 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.970
 how these two pokémon were 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.050
 very strong and could go so far as to destroy the planet there are not four the most 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.160
 mighty of the three titles of heaven decided to solve the conflict 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.860
 to himself 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.289
 going down from the ozone layer where nobody knew of its existence and dropping 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.930
 a sharp cry that calmed the fighters these went to 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.720
 rest in a long sleep one inside the mountains and another at 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.810
 ocean bottom both are currently awake but no longer fight 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.199
 for expanding their territories 

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:28.119
 loudon created the continents and regis daughters accommodated them with their tremendous 

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:31.119
 force I want the oceans hirai whatever the sky 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:36.109
 some regis was born and it is almost said that they created the rock loled logs 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:40.069
 and steel made from special ice clay from mountain and magma 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.429
 the gas registers dragged the continents pulling ropes with their great 

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:48.119
 power to then generally rest in temples in such a way 

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:51.579
 that will only awaken when the three jiloca record 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:55.540
 register and register this year against them and invoke them in case of 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.259
 that the world is in danger 

00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:01.469
 the recorders during the rest of their leader take care as faithful guardians 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:05.709
 different parts of the world generally places that have to do with their 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.919
 archaeological ruins elements or very important as the tree of the 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:11.159
 Start 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:15.680
 some volcanoes arose and the control of these was lost because both of gordon 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.659
 and how the records were asleep and the records had been 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:21.799
 created to control them 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.159
 so that a pokémon was born capable of handling the magma of the land of atlanta 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.159
 which could control when they got out of control 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:33.879
 later on the cold seabed nation sea apply to two large 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:37.919
 distances to return to his place of origin the temple of the sea where he takes care of 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:38.859
 the oceans 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:43.219
 since he wants only his creator and his pokémon inhabitants although in that 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:48.349
 there were very few times since there was only omani tempo later caputo kabul 3 and 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.950
 read 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.299

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:54.269
 kirk douglas karla acosta and some magic burlap two giants 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.109
 As it was a very strenuous task, it allowed Manabi to procreate many 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.939
 has to help him in this work currently quiogue and the people of the sea 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:04.039
 they care for manatee and their temple 

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:07.839
 if this pokémon will automatically die, another new one will appear 

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:11.529
 at the bottom of the sea where another manatee will be born to return to fulfill its 

00:04:11.529 --> 00:04:12.639
 cycle 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:17.180
 On the mainland several children were born, they are in charge of purifying the environment 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.109
 environment using a flash that consists in dissolving toxins from the air to 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.349
 transform barren land into flower fields were born other pokémon with 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:28.849
 similar skills viewers with the gift of being able to travel in time 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:32.960
 known as the guardians of the forest they grow trees and plants 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.199
 which allowed several ancient pokémon to leave the oceans and 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:41.229
 colonize the earth giving way to new types and evolutions as agora 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:42.259

 armando krahn and 2 ram brown and the don bastion argenta h oxigene set east 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.900
 last considered to be the ultimate hunter 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.730
 millions of years went by and together with the pokémon evolved the 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.110
 humans who lived together and lived with them 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.740
 later where today is the region photo were born mugía and gold that 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.189
 they are the representation of the life of the sun and the moon on earth 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:10.319
 when humans settled in towns and cities they created two towers 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:12.900
 for them or they lived in the bell tower 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.700
 and lugi in the brass tower of city iris until one day oliver a ray 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:17.030
 by 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.589
 guilt of anger that I felt towards 

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:23.439
 this caused the almost total destruction of the tower which from that 

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:25.680
 fact it was known as the burned tower 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.800
 there three innocent pokémon were caught in the flames and died 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:34.309
 or he did not feel guilty about this and with his powers he managed to revive them 

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:36.430
 giving them new identities 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.380
 from that moment they were known as the three legendary raikou dogs 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.970
 represents the lightning that caused the fire between the flames that its 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.419
 covered in the forest his and cune the water that purified the flames of the fire 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.080
 due to this incident or cut him off all bond of friendship with humans and only 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.729
 will return with the humans the day in which human and pro that coexist in peace and 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:57.539
 harmony 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:01.749
 On the other hand, he decided to stay and live in the swirling islands. 

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:05.349
 were born the three legendary birds article at the same time cold 

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:09.439
 it took him to get away from the storms and mountains the warm air every time he caught 

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:12.509
 an island in the orange archipelago to avoid it 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:16.479
 but soon after the birds who, knowing their great power, had 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:21.220
 envy each other began to fight over control of the three islands creating 

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:23.479
 a sudden change in the global climate 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:25.129
 I was enraged 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:29.259
 decided to calm the birds with their song and left the humans an instrument 

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:33.360
 musical with which they could invoke him to stop the fight of the three birds in 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.900
 If you need it in the future 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.730
 final rest of maple euros the legend continues and tells that once created 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:42.229
 the Pokémon and their worlds 

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:46.380
 maple use moved to its own dimension where it rests to recover 

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:50.090
 the power lost by creation although it can be invoked in a place called 

00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:54.969
 origin room at the top of some ruins of the crown mountain and would only come out 

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:57.539
 when the universe was in grave danger 

00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:01.360
 a danger that I am evolving naturally in many species of 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.649
 pokémon to inhabit the earth in order to take care of the or that the themes 

00:07:04.649 --> 00:07:07.849
 legendary were not able to solve 

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:11.930
 in the movie maple usi the jewel of life he wakes up from his rest to 

00:07:11.929 --> 00:07:15.490
 save the earth from a great meteor that is approaching at great speed to 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.330
 impacting the doing this weakens because it loses many of its tables and 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:23.319
 we give it helps to find them then it goes back to its dimension to 

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:24.619
 rest 

00:07:24.619 --> 00:07:29.659
 arcelús likes to rest in solitude isolated from all life of space 

00:07:29.659 --> 00:07:30.610
 and time 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.449
 it is also said that we do understand all kinds of pokémon language and also 

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:36.960
 the human language by means of telepathy 

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:41.569
 Other legends speak about a mysterious object called a flute. 

00:07:41.569 --> 00:07:45.349
 they have the power to invoke glass stairs into the room 

00:07:45.349 --> 00:07:49.289
 of origin surely made by some ancient civilization that already 

00:07:49.289 --> 00:07:51.210
 he knew the existence of maple euros
