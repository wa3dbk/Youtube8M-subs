off<00:01:52.479> why<00:01:52.720> was<00:01:53.020> it<00:01:53.200> so<00:01:53.380> hard<00:01:53.709> you<00:01:54.250> think<00:01:54.520> in<00:01:54.640> the

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
off why was it so hard you think in the

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.490 
off why was it so hard you think in the
past<00:01:54.970> to<00:01:55.239> kind<00:01:55.420> of<00:01:55.479> achieve<00:01:55.840> those<00:01:56.110> long-term

past to kind of achieve those long-term
weight<00:01:57.039> loss<00:01:57.099> goals<00:01:57.580> because<00:01:58.300> I<00:01:58.420> think<00:01:58.479> that<00:01:58.660> a

00:01:58.949 --> 00:01:58.959 
weight loss goals because I think that a

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:00.800 
weight loss goals because I think that a
lot<00:01:59.200> of<00:01:59.259> the<00:01:59.380> products<00:01:59.770> that<00:01:59.950> are<00:02:00.039> out<00:02:00.190> there

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
lot of the products that are out there

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.870 
lot of the products that are out there
promise<00:02:01.810> you<00:02:02.170> results<00:02:02.860> that<00:02:03.190> they're<00:02:03.610> kind<00:02:03.819> of

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
promise you results that they're kind of

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.660 
promise you results that they're kind of
unrealistic<00:02:04.479> because<00:02:05.470> you<00:02:06.009> have<00:02:06.190> to<00:02:06.340> continue

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
unrealistic because you have to continue

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.449 
unrealistic because you have to continue
to<00:02:06.759> take<00:02:06.940> the<00:02:07.090> product<00:02:07.330> or<00:02:07.830> continue<00:02:08.830> very

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
to take the product or continue very

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.300 
to take the product or continue very
strict<00:02:10.000> calorie<00:02:10.440> regimens<00:02:11.440> to<00:02:11.890> keep<00:02:12.099> the

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
strict calorie regimens to keep the

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.490 
strict calorie regimens to keep the
results<00:02:12.730> off<00:02:12.879> and<00:02:13.120> you<00:02:13.930> don't<00:02:13.959> have<00:02:14.260> to<00:02:14.410> do

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
results off and you don't have to do

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.199 
results off and you don't have to do
that<00:02:14.530> with<00:02:14.800> skinny<00:02:15.069> fiber<00:02:15.280> I<00:02:15.640> like<00:02:16.000> that<00:02:16.030> I

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
that with skinny fiber I like that I

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.610 
that with skinny fiber I like that I
think<00:02:16.660> one<00:02:16.780> of<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.959> things<00:02:16.989> is<00:02:17.290> you<00:02:17.349> know<00:02:17.560> you

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
think one of the things is you know you

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.590 
think one of the things is you know you
can<00:02:17.830> keep<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:18.160> off<00:02:18.310> but<00:02:18.520> we<00:02:18.640> can't<00:02:18.879> eat<00:02:19.090> carrots

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
can keep it off but we can't eat carrots

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.570 
can keep it off but we can't eat carrots
and<00:02:19.840> celery<00:02:20.710> in<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.070> rest<00:02:21.250> of<00:02:21.370> our<00:02:21.430> lives

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
and celery in the rest of our lives

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.550 
and celery in the rest of our lives
you're<00:02:22.180> going<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.540> have<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:22.840> eat<00:02:22.960> kind<00:02:23.230> of<00:02:23.350> real

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
you're going to have to eat kind of real

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.610 
you're going to have to eat kind of real
food<00:02:23.830> at<00:02:24.070> some<00:02:24.280> point

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
food at some point

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.930 
food at some point
and<00:02:24.709> I<00:02:24.799> think<00:02:24.860> that<00:02:25.159> your<00:02:25.310> weight<00:02:25.489> loss<00:02:25.730> is

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
and I think that your weight loss is

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.880 
and I think that your weight loss is
remarkable<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:26.959> so<00:02:27.200> then<00:02:27.349> I<00:02:27.440> wanted<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.769> ask

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
remarkable and so then I wanted to ask

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.490 
remarkable and so then I wanted to ask
you<00:02:28.129> what<00:02:28.519> exactly<00:02:29.390> occurred<00:02:29.569> with<00:02:30.110> Kayla

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
you what exactly occurred with Kayla

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.320 
you what exactly occurred with Kayla
nutritionally<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:31.549> kind<00:02:31.730> of<00:02:31.790> make<00:02:32.090> that

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
nutritionally to kind of make that

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.789 
nutritionally to kind of make that
happen<00:02:32.540> well<00:02:33.140> kayla<00:02:33.319> is<00:02:33.470> an<00:02:33.560> excellent

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
happen well kayla is an excellent

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.770 
happen well kayla is an excellent
example<00:02:33.980> because<00:02:34.730> she's<00:02:34.970> tried<00:02:35.390> multiple

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
example because she's tried multiple

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.720 
example because she's tried multiple
different<00:02:36.260> programs<00:02:36.860> and<00:02:37.099> nothing<00:02:37.489> worked

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
different programs and nothing worked

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.430 
different programs and nothing worked
and<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.420> reason<00:02:38.780> that<00:02:38.810> this<00:02:39.019> product<00:02:39.379> was

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
and the reason that this product was

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.259 
and the reason that this product was
able<00:02:39.709> to<00:02:39.830> work<00:02:40.010> is<00:02:40.190> because<00:02:40.549> the<00:02:40.700> enzymes<00:02:41.090> were

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
able to work is because the enzymes were

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.449 
able to work is because the enzymes were
able<00:02:41.450> to<00:02:41.569> get<00:02:41.720> her<00:02:41.900> body<00:02:42.170> in<00:02:42.620> a<00:02:42.950> condition

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
able to get her body in a condition

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.220 
able to get her body in a condition
where<00:02:43.610> losing<00:02:44.000> weight<00:02:44.150> was<00:02:44.299> possible<00:02:44.780> she

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
where losing weight was possible she

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.050 
where losing weight was possible she
didn't<00:02:45.560> change<00:02:45.739> her<00:02:45.860> diet<00:02:46.159> she<00:02:46.549> didn't<00:02:46.819> start

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
didn't change her diet she didn't start

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.180 
didn't change her diet she didn't start
exercising<00:02:47.870> all<00:02:48.019> she<00:02:48.470> did<00:02:48.590> was<00:02:48.650> take<00:02:48.980> our

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
exercising all she did was take our

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.460 
exercising all she did was take our
Skinny<00:02:49.430> Fiber<00:02:49.519> twice<00:02:50.120> a<00:02:50.150> day<00:02:50.480> and<00:02:50.659> without

you have to combine exercise I don't
exercise<00:02:57.310> aside<00:02:58.310> from<00:02:58.579> the<00:02:58.879> things<00:02:59.090> that<00:02:59.239> I<00:02:59.269> do

daughter playing with our dogs things of

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.259 
daughter playing with our dogs things of
that<00:03:03.739> nature<00:03:03.769> I<00:03:04.280> think<00:03:04.609> a<00:03:04.670> lot<00:03:04.700> of<00:03:04.910> them<00:03:04.970> would

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
that nature I think a lot of them would

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:06.309 
that nature I think a lot of them would
like<00:03:05.390> to<00:03:05.510> hear<00:03:05.629> that<00:03:05.840> because<00:03:05.930> they<00:03:06.170> either

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
like to hear that because they either

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.410 
like to hear that because they either
don't<00:03:06.590> like<00:03:06.829> to<00:03:06.950> exercise<00:03:07.220> or<00:03:07.640> just<00:03:07.819> maybe<00:03:07.970> in
