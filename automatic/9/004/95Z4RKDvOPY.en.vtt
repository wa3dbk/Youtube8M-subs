00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
application in life who designed this I

into<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.160> person<00:00:53.579> who<00:00:53.670> can<00:00:53.820> then<00:00:53.910> hold<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.449> belief

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
into a person who can then hold a belief

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.080 
into a person who can then hold a belief
as<00:00:54.930> well<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.649> me<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:55.949> fascinating<00:00:56.520> and

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
as well that to me is fascinating and

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.819 
as well that to me is fascinating and
way<00:00:57.329> too<00:00:57.390> big<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:57.899> there<00:00:58.020> must<00:00:58.320> be<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.530> designer

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
way too big and there must be a designer

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.410 
way too big and there must be a designer
behind<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.550> in<00:00:59.670> my<00:00:59.820> heart<00:00:59.940> that's<00:01:00.239> what<00:01:00.390> I

the<00:01:10.460> hospital<00:01:10.609> over<00:01:11.210> a<00:01:11.240> year<00:01:11.509> ago<00:01:11.719> today<00:01:11.780> I

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
the hospital over a year ago today I

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.260 
the hospital over a year ago today I
thought<00:01:12.380> God<00:01:12.679> are<00:01:13.130> you<00:01:13.429> kidding<00:01:13.819> me<00:01:14.000> you're

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
thought God are you kidding me you're

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.029 
thought God are you kidding me you're
putting<00:01:14.569> my<00:01:14.689> son<00:01:14.960> in<00:01:14.990> the<00:01:15.140> home<00:01:15.319> why<00:01:15.530> like<00:01:15.890> and

putting my son in the home why like and
then<00:01:16.130> I<00:01:16.159> thought<00:01:16.399> that's<00:01:16.609> evil<00:01:16.850> creeping<00:01:17.329> and

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
then I thought that's evil creeping and

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.120 
then I thought that's evil creeping and
thinking<00:01:17.810> that<00:01:17.899> I<00:01:18.049> believe<00:01:18.469> in<00:01:18.619> God<00:01:18.770> and<00:01:18.799> I<00:01:19.069> do

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
thinking that I believe in God and I do

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.590 
thinking that I believe in God and I do
struggle<00:01:19.579> with<00:01:19.729> it<00:01:19.939> every<00:01:19.999> sentence<00:01:20.479> I'm

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
struggle with it every sentence I'm

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.020 
struggle with it every sentence I'm
struggling<00:01:21.350> with<00:01:21.590> it's<00:01:22.280> okay

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
struggling with it's okay

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.199 
struggling with it's okay
okay<00:01:23.509> good<00:01:23.719> day<00:01:24.170> well<00:01:24.590> I<00:01:24.799> farmed<00:01:25.609> out<00:01:25.880> a<00:01:25.909> lot

00:01:26.199 --> 00:01:26.209 
okay good day well I farmed out a lot

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:27.789 
okay good day well I farmed out a lot
and<00:01:26.479> I<00:01:26.599> believe<00:01:26.959> there's<00:01:27.229> a<00:01:27.289> scientific

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
and I believe there's a scientific

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.490 
and I believe there's a scientific
explanation<00:01:28.039> for<00:01:28.640> every<00:01:29.539> miracle<00:01:29.780> except

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
explanation for every miracle except

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.980 
explanation for every miracle except
maybe<00:01:31.039> that<00:01:31.250> Sarah<00:01:32.030> Palin<00:01:32.270> is<00:01:32.539> considered

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
maybe that Sarah Palin is considered

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:42.930 
maybe that Sarah Palin is considered
presidential

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.910 

the<00:01:43.940> only<00:01:44.240> miracle<00:01:44.510> that's<00:01:45.100> inexplicable<00:01:47.920> at
