radio interesting thing about the Amiga
Forest's<00:00:20.650> line<00:00:20.890> is<00:00:21.730> it<00:00:21.939> does<00:00:22.060> have<00:00:22.269> the<00:00:22.390> 6<00:00:22.599> pin

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
Forest's line is it does have the 6 pin

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.589 
Forest's line is it does have the 6 pin
microphone<00:00:23.380> connector<00:00:23.769> here<00:00:24.189> and<00:00:24.699> if<00:00:25.269> we<00:00:25.449> look

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:25.599 
microphone connector here and if we look

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:27.630 
microphone connector here and if we look
at<00:00:25.660> the<00:00:25.779> other<00:00:25.900> side<00:00:26.199> you'll<00:00:27.039> see<00:00:27.249> that<00:00:27.369> it<00:00:27.490> has

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
at the other side you'll see that it has

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.579 
at the other side you'll see that it has
a<00:00:27.669> four<00:00:28.330> pin<00:00:28.539> connector<00:00:29.019> on<00:00:29.140> the<00:00:29.169> other<00:00:29.349> side

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:29.589 
a four pin connector on the other side

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:32.100 
a four pin connector on the other side
so<00:00:29.830> you<00:00:30.099> can<00:00:30.609> run<00:00:30.789> the<00:00:31.089> microphone<00:00:31.749> that<00:00:31.990> comes

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
so you can run the microphone that comes

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.050 
so you can run the microphone that comes
with<00:00:32.380> the<00:00:32.529> radio<00:00:32.829> that<00:00:33.010> has<00:00:33.100> up-down<00:00:33.579> controls

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.060 
with the radio that has up-down controls

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.300 
with the radio that has up-down controls
or<00:00:34.540> if<00:00:35.140> you<00:00:35.260> have<00:00:35.410> another<00:00:35.620> microphone<00:00:36.040> you

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.310 
or if you have another microphone you

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.860 
or if you have another microphone you
prefer<00:00:36.640> you<00:00:36.940> can<00:00:37.059> just<00:00:37.210> plug<00:00:37.360> it<00:00:37.510> in<00:00:37.600> the<00:00:37.719> other

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
prefer you can just plug it in the other

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.119 
prefer you can just plug it in the other
side<00:00:38.110> you<00:00:38.289> can<00:00:38.440> actually<00:00:38.559> have<00:00:38.860> both

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
side you can actually have both

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:40.889 
side you can actually have both
microphones<00:00:39.579> plugged<00:00:40.059> in<00:00:40.210> at<00:00:40.329> the<00:00:40.420> same<00:00:40.600> time

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899 
microphones plugged in at the same time

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:42.869 
microphones plugged in at the same time
obviously<00:00:41.320> you<00:00:41.770> can't<00:00:42.010> key<00:00:42.280> them<00:00:42.460> at<00:00:42.609> the<00:00:42.699> same

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
obviously you can't key them at the same

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.000 
obviously you can't key them at the same
time<00:00:43.149> but<00:00:43.359> you<00:00:43.420> can<00:00:43.660> use<00:00:43.809> either<00:00:43.989> one<00:00:44.230> at<00:00:44.680> any

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
time but you can use either one at any

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.400 
time but you can use either one at any
time<00:00:45.250> so<00:00:45.550> very<00:00:45.850> neat<00:00:46.390> that<00:00:46.600> they<00:00:46.809> include<00:00:47.170> the

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
time so very neat that they include the

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.810 
time so very neat that they include the
the<00:00:47.649> dual<00:00:47.800> option<00:00:48.250> for<00:00:48.430> that<00:00:48.550> on<00:00:48.730> the

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
the dual option for that on the

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.520

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
radios I had sitting here I was pretty

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.390 
radios I had sitting here I was pretty
surprised<00:01:35.080> that<00:01:35.260> it<00:01:35.500> was<00:01:35.980> actually<00:01:36.160> a<00:01:36.310> little

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
surprised that it was actually a little

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.030 
surprised that it was actually a little
bit<00:01:36.520> smaller<00:01:36.790> top<00:01:37.330> to<00:01:37.510> bottom<00:01:37.740> just<00:01:38.740> a<00:01:38.830> little

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
bit smaller top to bottom just a little

here and it won't be heating up the
inside<00:02:04.300> board<00:02:04.720> so<00:02:05.080> I'm<00:02:05.860> kind<00:02:06.100> of<00:02:06.160> neat<00:02:06.310> the<00:02:06.430> way

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
inside board so I'm kind of neat the way

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.940 
inside board so I'm kind of neat the way
it's<00:02:06.700> laid<00:02:06.880> out<00:02:06.940> and<00:02:07.360> like<00:02:08.349> we<00:02:08.470> said<00:02:08.619> you<00:02:08.739> can

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
it's laid out and like we said you can

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.490 
it's laid out and like we said you can
get<00:02:09.220> about<00:02:09.310> 80<00:02:09.970> to<00:02:10.179> 100<00:02:10.509> watts<00:02:10.660> output<00:02:10.899> so<00:02:11.410> it

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
get about 80 to 100 watts output so it

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.069 
get about 80 to 100 watts output so it
is<00:02:11.620> a<00:02:11.650> high<00:02:11.920> output<00:02:12.840> transistor<00:02:13.840> that's

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:14.079 
is a high output transistor that's

here so those are your locations for

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.180 
here so those are your locations for
making<00:04:18.669> those<00:04:18.760> adjustments<00:04:20.160> basically<00:04:21.160> I

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
making those adjustments basically I

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.860 
making those adjustments basically I
will<00:04:21.400> tell<00:04:21.579> you<00:04:21.700> that<00:04:21.910> this<00:04:22.240> radio<00:04:22.600> from<00:04:22.810> the

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
will tell you that this radio from the

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.890 
will tell you that this radio from the
factory<00:04:23.410> is<00:04:23.740> really<00:04:24.250> set<00:04:24.490> up<00:04:24.610> to<00:04:24.640> rock<00:04:24.940> in

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
lot is really going to you know fuzzy up

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:46.980 
lot is really going to you know fuzzy up
something<00:04:45.970> that<00:04:46.120> really<00:04:46.270> is<00:04:46.450> good<00:04:46.630> to<00:04:46.660> start

the<00:04:57.070> radio<00:04:57.340> is<00:04:57.400> pretty<00:04:57.639> much<00:04:57.790> ready<00:04:58.270> to<00:04:58.360> go

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
the radio is pretty much ready to go

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.590 
the radio is pretty much ready to go
very<00:04:59.740> good<00:05:00.070> quality<00:05:00.669> in<00:05:01.030> terms<00:05:01.060> of<00:05:01.450> way

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
very good quality in terms of way

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.810 
very good quality in terms of way
everything's<00:05:02.020> designed<00:05:02.340> these<00:05:03.340> radios<00:05:03.700> are

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
everything's designed these radios are

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.690 
everything's designed these radios are
very<00:05:03.970> rugged<00:05:04.240> they<00:05:04.480> use<00:05:04.660> much<00:05:05.410> thicker<00:05:05.740> board

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
very rugged they use much thicker board

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.760 
very rugged they use much thicker board
material<00:05:07.330> and<00:05:07.690> the<00:05:07.900> board<00:05:08.110> material<00:05:08.530> in<00:05:08.620> them

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
material and the board material in them

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.500 
material and the board material in them
is<00:05:08.919> designed<00:05:09.250> not<00:05:09.370> to<00:05:09.490> absorb<00:05:09.940> water<00:05:10.240> like<00:05:10.480> a

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
is designed not to absorb water like a

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.659 
is designed not to absorb water like a
lot<00:05:10.690> of<00:05:10.810> exports<00:05:11.320> use<00:05:11.890> boards<00:05:12.250> that<00:05:12.430> can

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
lot of exports use boards that can

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:15.210 
lot of exports use boards that can
absorb<00:05:12.880> water<00:05:13.240> and<00:05:13.419> it<00:05:13.690> ruins<00:05:14.560> the<00:05:14.680> traces<00:05:15.100> and

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
absorb water and it ruins the traces and

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.770 
absorb water and it ruins the traces and
everything<00:05:15.550> on<00:05:15.700> them<00:05:15.850> these<00:05:16.180> radios<00:05:16.570> use<00:05:16.750> a

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
everything on them these radios use a

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.050 
everything on them these radios use a
heavier<00:05:17.140> copper<00:05:17.680> and<00:05:17.860> a<00:05:18.160> stronger<00:05:18.669> board<00:05:18.910> in

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
heavier copper and a stronger board in

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.680 
heavier copper and a stronger board in
them<00:05:19.180> so<00:05:19.390> makes<00:05:20.050> them<00:05:20.200> very<00:05:20.350> durable
