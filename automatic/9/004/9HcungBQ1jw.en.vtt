00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
lotta space however we use the sweet

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.190 
lotta space however we use the sweet
potato<00:01:16.560> whom<00:01:16.939> so<00:01:17.939> it's<00:01:18.119> natural<00:01:18.330> because

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
potato whom so it's natural because

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.499 
potato whom so it's natural because
there's<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:20.100> little<00:01:20.280> bit<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.490> sugar<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.119> edit

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
there's a little bit of sugar and edit

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.170 
there's a little bit of sugar and edit
to<00:01:21.659> do<00:01:21.840> enhance<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.439> but<00:01:23.189> very<00:01:23.460> minimal<00:01:23.880> but<00:01:24.060> I

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
to do enhance it but very minimal but I

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.310 
to do enhance it but very minimal but I
think<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.479> can<00:01:24.509> definitely<00:01:24.840> taste<00:01:25.200> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
think I can definitely taste the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.990 
think I can definitely taste the
difference<00:01:25.680> between<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.130> delight<00:01:26.460> teeth<00:01:26.729> at

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
difference between the delight teeth at

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.530 
difference between the delight teeth at
the<00:01:27.119> mid<00:01:27.299> mid<00:01:27.810> tea<00:01:28.220> and<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.909> think<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.270> this

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
the mid mid tea and I think that this

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.660 
the mid mid tea and I think that this
one<00:01:30.750> leaves<00:01:30.990> more<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.530> good<00:01:32.369> taste

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
one leaves more of a good taste

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.240 
one leaves more of a good taste

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
afterwards yes yeah yeah yeah yeah so

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.420 
afterwards yes yeah yeah yeah yeah so
I'm<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.180> then<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.689> doesn't<00:01:36.900> just<00:01:37.619> go
