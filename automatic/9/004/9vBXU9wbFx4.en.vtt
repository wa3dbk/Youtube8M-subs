00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.230
 welcome all poker fans with you 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.929
 alexander bat and today we have a review 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.500
 small but quite interesting distribution 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.330
 and with euro poker tour and how we see the player 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.320
 from colombia may rock got pocket 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.630
 eights and he raises the button and 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.760
 German will play against him and only 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.590
 Names that says King 6 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.189
 suited is quite a good card to 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.630
 make a count from the big blind 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.309
 I just want to say that the tournament is already in 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.290
 its rather late stage less than a hundred 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.460
 the person left was registered 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.950
 about 650 people that is now coming 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.100
 instead of fighting for getting into good 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:51.420
 prize money and what we see is a dream for cancer 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.070
 he caught the senior set sitting in the position and 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.079
 of course should put here 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.469
 continued bet shamin checks rock 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.050
 set a continued order rate 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:03.719
 the size of a half can we see ourselves too 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.780
 hit hit middle pair hardly here 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.090
 will throw something clear with the king 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.630
 6 suited still want more 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.790
 just get in in flash but six in 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.520
 in this case too 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.590
 the hit is quite good and here we see it 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.259
 already 30 sixth chignon and he immediately 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.689
 makes an advance bid immediately make 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.990
 on the transfer rate in the half bank that is 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.790
 he makes it clear to the lesson that the guy I have 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.700
 I have a six or eight 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.710
 something like that and your ace is king and ace 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.950
 the lady here is not very well worth it 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.920
 rock looked at him something to himself 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.480
 thought and just did a cold ray here 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.800
 he didn't either 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.380
 Well, I just did not know rock there 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.180
 really i'm six and seven 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.760
 seven on the river is not the most pleasant 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.440
 card for chignon he understands that street 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.980
 there is also possible despite the fact that 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.580
 rock 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.970
 cards like 4 5 9 10 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.960
 it would hardly have been 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.140
 button but nevertheless to shame he 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.850
 cautious commentators do check us here 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.640
 they said that check-raising here would be bad 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.410
 the decision that this is the maximum check-call and here 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.300
 see rock and bet i bet 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.480
 half a sweat for value 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.640
 Ishime he immediately calls and 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.430
 sees what he sees he sees a full house 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.620
 Eight and joyful and joyful 10 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.400
 head knowing that I could lose 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.520
 much more money and I think this guys 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.680
 distribution is very instructive because 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:35.460
 she clearly shows us how to 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.410
 This seems like a good Panas. 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.870
 cards like thrips in this hand 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.740
 lose the least chips wish you 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.020
 more often 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.570
 less likely to get into such situations if 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.590
 you get to play there the smallest 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.590
 good bye see you
