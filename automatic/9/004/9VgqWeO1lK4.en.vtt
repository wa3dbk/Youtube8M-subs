there's<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.580> boost<00:00:23.910> function<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:25.500> little

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
there's a boost function this little

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.609 
there's a boost function this little
switch<00:00:26.099> allows<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.300> adjust<00:00:27.720> presence<00:00:28.470> or

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
switch allows you to adjust presence or

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.160 
switch allows you to adjust presence or
feedback<00:00:29.090> this<00:00:30.090> little<00:00:30.390> switch<00:00:30.660> gives<00:00:31.050> you

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
feedback this little switch gives you

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.220 
feedback this little switch gives you
two<00:00:31.380> different<00:00:31.529> channels<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.669> gain<00:00:33.059> one<00:00:34.020> high

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
all and even with each channel you have

00:01:48.710 --> 00:02:03.240 
all and even with each channel you have
a<00:01:48.740> boost

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:10.410 

hey

and
it's<00:02:12.890> pretty<00:02:13.129> significant<00:02:13.700> boost<00:02:13.819> their

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:32.240 

I<00:02:29.599> like<00:02:30.599> the<00:02:30.780> boost<00:02:30.989> feature<00:02:31.290> be<00:02:31.739> really<00:02:32.069> good

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
I like the boost feature be really good

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.369 
I like the boost feature be really good
for<00:02:32.400> solos<00:02:32.879> you<00:02:33.239> can<00:02:33.390> dial<00:02:33.660> up<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.930> nice<00:02:34.140> rhythm

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
for solos you can dial up a nice rhythm

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:46.640 
for solos you can dial up a nice rhythm
guitar<00:02:34.800> sound<00:02:35.129> like<00:02:35.340> this<00:02:36.319> and<00:02:37.319> then<00:02:37.650> kick<00:02:37.950> it

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.250 

very<00:02:47.650> nice<00:02:48.120> now<00:02:49.120> let's<00:02:49.660> go<00:02:49.870> to<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:50.110> other

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
very nice now let's go to the other

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.400 
very nice now let's go to the other
channel<00:02:50.830> as<00:02:51.520> you<00:02:51.760> can<00:02:51.940> see<00:02:52.209> when<00:02:53.080> you<00:02:53.200> kick

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
channel as you can see when you kick

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.890 
channel as you can see when you kick
this<00:02:53.680> this<00:02:54.190> LED<00:02:54.790> turns<00:02:55.060> red<00:02:55.390> telling<00:02:55.810> you

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
this this LED turns red telling you

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:03.050 
this this LED turns red telling you
you're<00:02:56.170> on<00:02:56.319> the<00:02:56.440> hot<00:02:56.620> Channel

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.320 

Oh

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:20.630 

and<00:03:08.020> you<00:03:08.290> got<00:03:08.470> boost<00:03:08.740> with<00:03:08.950> this<00:03:09.100> challenge

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.630 

I

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:37.880 

mmm<00:03:27.120> very<00:03:27.290> nice

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.110 

you've<00:03:38.890> also<00:03:39.070> got<00:03:39.340> some<00:03:39.490> total<00:03:39.790> variation

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
you've also got some total variation

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:50.330 
you've also got some total variation
with<00:03:40.540> this<00:03:40.750> switch<00:03:41.290> right<00:03:41.530> here

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.059 

like<00:03:51.090> a<00:03:51.120> presence<00:03:51.750> when<00:03:51.989> it's<00:03:52.140> switched<00:03:52.680> over

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
like a presence when it's switched over

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.809 
like a presence when it's switched over
this<00:03:53.190> way<00:03:53.370> it's<00:03:53.580> a<00:03:53.670> presence<00:03:54.120> not

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:25.330 

switch<00:03:57.819> back<00:03:58.030> to<00:03:58.060> the<00:03:58.239> left<00:03:58.540> it's<00:03:58.810> a<00:03:58.900> feedback

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.960 

definitely<00:04:26.340> gets<00:04:26.460> a<00:04:26.550> little<00:04:26.670> bit<00:04:26.820> more

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
definitely gets a little bit more

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:37.200 
definitely gets a little bit more
mid-range<00:04:27.330> e<00:04:27.750> when<00:04:28.080> it's<00:04:28.230> set<00:04:28.440> to<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:28.680> right

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.950

this one a lot and unfortunately I have
to<00:05:33.040> send<00:05:33.430> this<00:05:33.580> one<00:05:33.790> to<00:05:33.990> Hank<00:05:34.990> it<00:05:35.170> affects<00:05:35.500> bay

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
to send this one to Hank it affects bay

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.770 
to send this one to Hank it affects bay
but<00:05:36.700> if<00:05:36.790> you're<00:05:36.910> looking<00:05:36.940> for<00:05:37.210> a<00:05:37.330> high<00:05:37.540> gain

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
but if you're looking for a high gain

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.950 
but if you're looking for a high gain
distortion<00:05:38.410> pedal<00:05:39.270> to<00:05:40.270> do<00:05:40.390> a<00:05:40.420> heck<00:05:40.630> of<00:05:40.660> a<00:05:40.840> lot

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
distortion pedal to do a heck of a lot

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.290 
distortion pedal to do a heck of a lot
worse<00:05:41.020> than<00:05:41.590> this<00:05:41.710> one<00:05:41.950> this<00:05:42.850> one<00:05:43.090> has

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
worse than this one this one has

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.620 
worse than this one this one has
probably<00:05:43.960> the<00:05:44.170> most<00:05:44.380> variability<00:05:45.370> I've<00:05:45.940> ever

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
probably the most variability I've ever

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.600 
probably the most variability I've ever
experienced<00:05:47.500> from<00:05:47.650> a<00:05:47.680> high<00:05:47.830> gain<00:05:48.070> distortion

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610

experienced from a high gain distortion
pedal<00:05:48.970> we've<00:05:49.870> got<00:05:50.050> two<00:05:50.230> channels<00:05:50.680> of

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
pedal we've got two channels of

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.530 
pedal we've got two channels of
distortion<00:05:51.430> each<00:05:51.640> of<00:05:51.820> them<00:05:51.940> have<00:05:52.120> a<00:05:52.150> boost

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:52.540 
distortion each of them have a boost

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.640 
distortion each of them have a boost
we've<00:05:53.410> got<00:05:53.560> a<00:05:53.590> full<00:05:53.860> EQ<00:05:54.370> section<00:05:54.670> and<00:05:55.650> it

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
we've got a full EQ section and it

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:57.930 
we've got a full EQ section and it
sounds<00:05:56.920> like<00:05:56.980> going<00:05:57.130> to<00:05:57.220> be<00:05:57.280> really<00:05:57.580> tweakable

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
sounds like going to be really tweakable

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.480 
sounds like going to be really tweakable
for<00:05:58.240> a<00:05:58.270> lot<00:05:58.390> of<00:05:58.420> different<00:05:58.570> amplifiers<00:05:59.340> to<00:06:00.340> my

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
first pedal review for 2010 and it's
