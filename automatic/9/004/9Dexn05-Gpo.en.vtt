00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.150
 light land ok 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.030
 I say this hooks because we already have it 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.810
 out here we're going to lift and up 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.240
 here 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.200
 is to grab the string boat 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:46.090
 to the little ones you put and face down 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.090
 mind beats around here 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:54.870
 it stays that way and now you're going to grab this 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.870
 part and you're going to fit 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:04.340
 come in and put 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:06.860
 is ready it looks huge but with this 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.410
 now the blow is not going to be that strong 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.690
 and in fact this is no longer going to break the 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.840
 thread is not going to break either as 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.840
 come 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.069
 or they stay like this 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.249
 I do not know 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.260
 how to say damper dampens the 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:30.319
 knock 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.319
 but now it's placed here 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.080
 then the next 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:45.350
 sven you hold it like that 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:48.710
 but it does not come back to see the weight 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:51.100
 so that's how kids stay, I hope that 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:54.560
