00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.430
 the virus loading 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:35.400
 i this initiative started a year ago and 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.530
 half ago when the mix came to us with 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.660
 this challenge of hitting another record of the 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.770
 largest panel in the world is on the 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.870
 our company 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.460
 we will be bold and pioneering when 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.710
 we received this proposal we stayed 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.830
 enthusiastic to participate in this 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.570
 project was only possible with the 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.510
 the participation of partners as 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.120
 bradesco cielo this got too much balance 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.329
 was very important because it was a 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.680
 remember and no one broke during 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.690
 seven years 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.729
 our expectation is to gather here 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.130
 daily something around 120 thousand 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.770
 people per day during this Christmas period 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.930
 I believe this is a dream that I 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.360
 I managed to transfer it to everyone and today 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.080
 we live in this dream of form 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.380
 joint 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.380
 I've flown the four corners in this world and 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.200
 get all roads led me to 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.020
 I realized that this is the best 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.960
 partnership with his daughter was already a 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.240
 our dream some years the level of 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.130
 caprice that she uses in her 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.649
 decoration looks I started to work 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.990
 with christmas decoration by passion 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.970
 I always put on a lot and it always 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.659
 I had the notion that it was something that 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.390
 people could create a lot 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.060
 within these themes and I think it will 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.670
 be a success'm already feeling the 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:56.520
 the general reaction of the people who 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.520
 of the comments but it will be very good 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.709
 we created this decoration with the 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.769
 proposal to build a house to have a 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:12.400
 idea to reunite the family pro sunrise 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:14.769

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:20.310
