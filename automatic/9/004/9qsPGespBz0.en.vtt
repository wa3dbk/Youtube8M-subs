was actually a suggestion from weirdo
the<00:02:25.720> mad<00:02:25.870> genius<00:02:25.900> of<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.860> defense<00:02:27.190> you<00:02:27.310> see

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.970 
the mad genius of the defense you see
all<00:02:27.910> over<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.270> place<00:02:28.450> now<00:02:28.630> it<00:02:28.780> seems<00:02:28.960> and<00:02:29.170> I'll

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
all over the place now it seems and I'll

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.680 
all over the place now it seems and I'll
have<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.220> make<00:02:30.370> a<00:02:30.400> video<00:02:30.610> about<00:02:30.940> that<00:02:31.510> because

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
have to make a video about that because

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.540 
have to make a video about that because
i<00:02:31.960> think<00:02:32.350> i<00:02:32.440> am<00:02:32.470> going<00:02:32.680> to<00:02:32.770> switch<00:02:32.890> my<00:02:33.160> defence

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
i think i am going to switch my defence

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.280 
i think i am going to switch my defence
soon<00:02:33.760> but<00:02:34.060> he<00:02:34.210> definitely<00:02:34.420> needs<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.870> like<00:02:35.260> a

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
soon but he definitely needs a like a

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.780 
soon but he definitely needs a like a
whole<00:02:35.500> video<00:02:35.710> shout<00:02:36.130> out<00:02:36.280> for<00:02:36.430> that<00:02:36.580> because

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
whole video shout out for that because

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.280 
whole video shout out for that because
i'm<00:02:37.240> just<00:02:37.330> going<00:02:37.540> to<00:02:37.630> scroll<00:02:37.840> through<00:02:37.900> and

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
i'm just going to scroll through and

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.230 
i'm just going to scroll through and
basically<00:02:39.100> just<00:02:39.370> show<00:02:39.520> his<00:02:39.670> defense<00:02:40.060> that's

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
basically just show his defense that's

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.300 
basically just show his defense that's
been<00:02:40.630> spread<00:02:40.960> all<00:02:41.140> over<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.500> place<00:02:41.740> I<00:02:42.010> think

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
been spread all over the place I think

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.880 
been spread all over the place I think
it's<00:02:42.430> kind<00:02:42.490> of<00:02:42.580> funny<00:02:42.990> but<00:02:43.990> yeah<00:02:44.380> I'm<00:02:44.620> gonna<00:02:44.740> do

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
it's kind of funny but yeah I'm gonna do

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.580 
it's kind of funny but yeah I'm gonna do
that<00:02:45.070> also<00:02:45.370> definitely<00:02:46.030> 144<00:02:46.960> shard<00:02:47.170> farming

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
that also definitely 144 shard farming

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.110 
that also definitely 144 shard farming
because<00:02:47.800> it's<00:02:47.980> become<00:02:48.250> such<00:02:48.550> a<00:02:48.580> big<00:02:48.820> part<00:02:49.030> of

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
because it's become such a big part of

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.120
