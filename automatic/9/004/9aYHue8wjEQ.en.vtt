throughout<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.399> deck<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:03.180> there<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.629> lot

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
throughout the deck that there is a lot

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.100

of blacks and grays on the entire deck I

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.719 
of blacks and grays on the entire deck I
think<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.500> really<00:01:07.530> varies<00:01:07.920> for<00:01:08.400> your<00:01:08.580> own

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
think it really varies for your own

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.160 
think it really varies for your own
personal<00:01:09.090> preference<00:01:09.600> kind<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.900> like<00:01:10.020> with

unique<00:02:15.740> and<00:02:16.100> I<00:02:17.090> understand<00:02:17.750> why<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:17.900> lot<00:02:18.200> of

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
unique and I understand why a lot of

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.640 
unique and I understand why a lot of
