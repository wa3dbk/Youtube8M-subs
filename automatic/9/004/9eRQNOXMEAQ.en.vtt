00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.800
 b 4 waves 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.270
 Ha ha ha 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.480
 The 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.740
 I will 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.240
 Donic's off Charov 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:01.820
 Original Senzou carbon extruded 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:05.030
 Off street with a very strong racket with the name of Charov 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.930
 Well although those of carbon daughter it contains two 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:13.190
 Jump even to the preeminent 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:15.870
 Is because master more than a also a little quite a long Intermediate in the bracket of the 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:20.640
 But I think the kana difficult 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:24.790
 It's a tax racket from day to day, so it's like an official that's buzzing 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.460
 I think it is one that can be recommended for players who are pushing in the drive 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.830
 How is it 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.140
 I agree 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:34.620
 Certainly when the ball was shot 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:39.660
 And there was a sense that is you been growing Te jerk 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:46.650
 After all, I'm playing a bit 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:48.550
 The furniture ponta is done with this racket when attacking by the drive and the counter block etc 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.810
 It was severe 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:57.100
 Just So Kosoma power hitter 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:03:01.300
 It is also good for people who go buzzing, but a little 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:05.390
 I used various rackets but it's not speed 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.560
 People without power seek the speed of the racket 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:14.560
 I think it is good to use 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:18.020
 Well that's not as hard as the so-called carbon of the so-called 'whack' 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:25.250
 Well, I wonder if it's an easy-to-use class 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:31.180
 The force of it falling to come door control by that is what is there is a case that does not work 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:36.370
 And the person who put it together and the person who already uses the ball of the other party etc 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:40.560
 I think people who use both drive and meat are very good 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:43.760
 If I use this to imitate Offcharov's play 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.760
 I think it is dangerous 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.550
 that 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:54.000
 Also I'd have been white from this time in the plastic ball 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:57.730
 After all, it's a bit heavy with plastic folder and it won't fly Yu- kun 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.990
 Now the mean Tsu racket say this is 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.819
 It is likely that demand will increase 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.850
 Overall it is 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:08.130
 Ma's Rapporteur 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:11.940
 People think I Na speed becomes a little slower might say 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:15.100
 For those who want a little bit of rotation 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:20.080
 Because it's a bit dangerous 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:21.820
 Those who think that plastic balls are sold out and can not go out try a bit 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.980
 I think there is also 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:28.760
 By kama racket news plywood 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:34.760
 Without seeing the head 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:36.639
 Shot feeling but I was the first time also had tried to hit it is like that without feeling uncomfortable 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.419
 Hey 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:43.800
 The feel at impact by making it so in the center 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:48.150
 Certainly because there is also a feeling that is hard 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.370
 If you put carbon before 7 it becomes harder 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:55.760
 A little 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:59.990
 The people who really use it are limited to only six with a limited amount of carbon 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:07.350
 It has become a soft atmosphere what 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:10.680
 It is not a racket that is limited so certainly from the people who use it 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.160
 I don't feel that it feels like a hitting ball 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.300
 But it is hard 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.980
 Now? 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:20.449
 It is harder than ordinary two -ply plywood 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:26.749
 6 pieces class 3- 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:30.580
 But I compaction it is difficult if not you, I love firm 

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:30.580
 After that is already table software 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:38.230
 People who want to be able to revise even after playing in a little taste city 4-1 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.660
 1 lower 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:45.660
 A person without power in front 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:51.409
 I think I'm going for a well off charov 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:54.129
 If you like and want to play off Charov with this 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:06:00.039
 I did an idea 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:06:01.930
 Well, because it's speed-oriented Japan, it's a plastic ball and the speed drops too. 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:04.639
 In addition such a place 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:07.539
 I think there are players who want to 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:07.539
 By all means to 9 players
