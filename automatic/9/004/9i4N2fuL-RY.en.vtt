00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.910
 I will teach you to establish 7 shields and what have 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.630
 we will do the first thing first thing 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.130
 open the torrent file that we download 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.519
 by the way the link to it will be in the description and 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.090
 due to download sims downloaded now 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:36.450
 let's install it here very much 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.170
 a lot of game and here from sims 4 to the south you sit 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.110
 on l 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.829
 this is it and then I began to us 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.940
 need to learn 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.550
 then we don’t have it very much later 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:53.129
 we run a stop . 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:55.070
 we start it so then we choose where it is 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:00.120
 will be in principle not only 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:02.699
 No, well, in general, additional 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.020
 software we can we 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:10.140
 we can remove and now it means install click 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:14.549
 well , I have it already installed so yes 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.520
 so we fell asleep him and go mean by 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.840
 I have an appointment in his computer while 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:25.200
 indices m-files x86 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.180
 now now now now over here 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.450
 simpson 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.840
 our and now we mean download 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.690
 By the way, I recommend before downloading the service . 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.390
 this disable antivirus is me 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.670
 sure it is mine blow and unplug 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.820
 firewall and venus and then everything will be 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:52.170
 okay, and I guarantee you a kayak to her 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:55.080
 ben and it causes me and garbage okay 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.320
 at night you will have a hit here in the afternoon. 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:02.970
 yin-yang here itself here they slaughter 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:06.710
 why forgotten the game benn and transfer all 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.710
 it's still you there 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:13.200
 if you don’t have it then 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:19.560
 Please for the most illustrative example here 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:23.730
 and the interface form to emerge a threat in 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.130
 In general, he finds viruses and antiviruses 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.489
 I will not specifically say not to pay 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.810
 attention and u in general and I will not 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.780
 knife protect me 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.900
 me there that your not a threat 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:40.470
 the Japanese without it will not start sims but 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.110
 why do we transfer this here and did everything 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.390
 this is here because s request change 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:50.920
 that we are for me 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:56.650
 and so we already kind of do everything but 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:59.670
 And our game on my claim will be so that she 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.350
 was not in english and forgot right here and 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.530
 tolerated here so here I already 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:13.300
 here it is ported and run it 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:16.300
 and we will come out and we have in general 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:20.230
 will be ready now you can run all 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.220
 bitterness count everything is ready we can 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.090
 quietly stock 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:28.360
 currently sims ii and that game beer we go in and 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.430
 we run 7 and it means that we have no sims 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.780
 started up 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:40.230
 it's nothing because we have to go 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:45.000
 here you are cues we sit down for them with Yiddish instep 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.959
 oh not go there pc pc 1000 times ck radio operator and 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.700
 install these two things 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:53.240
 they have me already set so much so that 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.700
 there we have further 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.250
 next we sort of stop everything and 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.040
 but for some reason he doesn't 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:05.540
 Antivirus runs we turn off 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:09.370
 she has now I'll turn it off until 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:12.700
 restart let me be 15 minutes and 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.700
 click ok 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.470
 next and what we have to do we 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.860
 run 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.010
 wadji personally i have wedge he hasn't yet 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.190
 launched the most illustrative example 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:30.290
 look after 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:33.710
 looking for a finger where sam is and you yourself 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:38.770
 have long been fame and that means you have to 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:41.270
 somewhere to find about and here u and jim engine 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.570
 so should we run 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.610
 favor and where we actually wait when 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:50.860
 start i said name is 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:56.170
 so now we have for engine hashes return a 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:57.800
 right we go in and jen and choose 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.520
 get out of the city 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:04.580
 so we enter there but me jim kids 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.070
 autonomous lived and back to the worker 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.560
 the table and so the game is already calm 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:13.660
 you can run all that yourself 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:16.930
 check but there is such a problem and 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:20.150
 called she 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:22.820
 also it is called here you say 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.940
 have we run the game all that and suddenly 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:29.000
 our son wanted to go to the toilet well shoo go to 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:31.640
 toilet there since there is always censorship and 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.680
 again it is very unprofessional I 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:38.630
 the thing is what your sim enters melts there like 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.840
 as always everyone in the squares 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.610
 and and it comes out and stands but the squares are not 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.160
 disappear yet we have to do 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.430
 we must first copy the name 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.590
 here it is, but here is the file and then 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:54.040
 here come into this file eyelashes yourself 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:57.860
 just shifting it like this 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:06:00.620
 now we also have this whole problem and so 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:03.110
 here we are already in the game here we have some 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.780
 picture video and here's the game 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:08.390
 principle works well we them of course 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:11.210
 let's start playing and we have stocked 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:14.180
 save and if you are not a game and you 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:18.260
 most likely he does not play you by the hand and 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:21.500
 saving but in japan cops but 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:23.180
 why new times on tests and 8 will be 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.860
 creating a family everything is now I 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.530
 upload your family and we are now 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.510
 let's look worked destinies with censorship and 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.790
 not 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:35.540
 or we throw the sword immediately after the plant and 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:39.430
 so now we have the moon and here alone 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:42.890
 my simus ir sen playing some game 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.490
 so I will not disturb him and that's 17 without 

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.410
 business is worth 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:48.680
 Let him your toilet to him as if time 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:56.420
 need so already wanted these planets 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:07:00.040
 let him go and wait wait wait wait well and 

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:03.109
 Here we see that she is not the same higher 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.109
 [music] 

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:19.010
 the nose that he is from this game is more poor 

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:21.560
 everything works fine the game goes without 

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:29.630
 lags but as without me only because 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:32.840
 record and that's all not lag all 

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:34.000
 ok and so i think this one helped you 

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.100
 tile 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.850
