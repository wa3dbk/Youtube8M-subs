00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
reduced back into the pot the reason for

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.680 
reduced back into the pot the reason for
this<00:02:06.959> is<00:02:07.200> cross<00:02:07.440> contamination<00:02:08.160> can<00:02:08.520> occur

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
this is cross contamination can occur

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.350 
this is cross contamination can occur
there's<00:02:09.690> often<00:02:10.110> blood<00:02:10.380> dead<00:02:11.280> skin<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:11.940> sebum

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
there's often blood dead skin and sebum

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.860 
there's often blood dead skin and sebum
so<00:02:13.230> we<00:02:13.380> don't<00:02:13.590> want<00:02:14.000> that<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.270> go<00:02:15.450> into<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.230> pot

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
so we don't want that to go into the pot

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.340 
so we don't want that to go into the pot
