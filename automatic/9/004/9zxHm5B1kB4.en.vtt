00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.100
 r fell and 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.830
 the insignia 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:07.819
 also much worse 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:10.889
 according to the white according to the nerÃ©e 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.219
 according to the ministry and artistic director 3 finds the crisis 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.910
 the finishing touches during the last rehearsal 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.259
 it will be one that is going to be without the evening 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:23.359
 in short the boys' choir has been around for 25 years 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:26.830
 it is unlike the guests from Haarlem 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.380
 it did not come from a denomination 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.430
 are not affiliated with the churches of Protestant knowledge 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.290
 you could say we are actually more a concert cordon 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.540
 the boys briefly it used to be in the catholic church controversial law 30 young 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.340
 men and boys furthermore that the choir 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.610
 young people with it alone don't have a passion for singing 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.130
 I see that when the soloists asked for money revealed very early 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.680
 I started singing 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.450
 to come and talk 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:59.770
 it was pretty crazy 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.120
 6 I think that is really crazy a lot of people think following 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.390
 the ships just can't 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.390
 bye 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.080
 wanted it made last year during the big concert in the twice 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.480
 do mouscron 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.970
 a special one busy with that singing 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.740
 and even if you have enough other interests 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.549
 now they are always classmates seen as a maverick the evening 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.000
 from stem cell therapy year we are completely upset to watch our videos 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.130
 it's a bit of a go yes how much time all of it 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.490
 I especially find it very welcome 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.820
 we wanted 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.490
 to 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.620
 but all those wonderful singing talents will be in one with their peers tomorrow 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.600
 packed with a month earlier 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.960
 for one that without concept anyway 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.070
