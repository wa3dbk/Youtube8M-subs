again and we kind of hung around and a
lot<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.049> room<00:01:16.229> here<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.920> do<00:01:17.070> stuff<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.520> we

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
lot of room here to to do stuff so we

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.499 
lot of room here to to do stuff so we

found stuff to keep us busy yeah part of

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.999 
found stuff to keep us busy yeah part of
was<00:01:21.630> too<00:01:21.720> cold<00:01:21.869> outside<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.619> think<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.860> lot<00:01:22.890> of

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
was too cold outside so I think a lot of

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.910 
was too cold outside so I think a lot of
guys<00:01:23.189> retreated<00:01:23.580> inside<00:01:23.729> after<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.180> bit

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
guys retreated inside after a bit

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.870 
guys retreated inside after a bit
considering<00:01:25.920> how<00:01:26.009> it's<00:01:26.400> being<00:01:26.520> played<00:01:26.670> in<00:01:26.820> the

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
considering how it's being played in the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.160 
considering how it's being played in the
second<00:01:27.180> period<00:01:27.270> versus<00:01:27.689> how<00:01:27.780> they<00:01:27.869> played<00:01:28.049> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
second period versus how they played the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.590 
second period versus how they played the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
pride and everything but was sort of a

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.090 
pride and everything but was sort of a
pretty<00:01:51.720> slow<00:01:51.899> period<00:01:52.200> in<00:01:52.259> terms<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.560> action<00:01:52.950> in
