00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
the way back off to the side of course

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.279 
the way back off to the side of course
and<00:02:06.550> then<00:02:07.030> I<00:02:07.060> just<00:02:07.150> took<00:02:07.510> the<00:02:07.750> two<00:02:07.960> sections

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
and then I just took the two sections

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.020 
and then I just took the two sections
and<00:02:08.770> pin<00:02:09.729> them<00:02:09.970> with<00:02:10.179> straight<00:02:10.539> pins<00:02:11.100> so<00:02:12.100> take

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
and pin them with straight pins so take

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.630 
and pin them with straight pins so take
a<00:02:13.060> look<00:02:13.270> at<00:02:13.450> how<00:02:13.600> I'm<00:02:13.990> doing<00:02:14.440> this<00:02:14.590> right<00:02:14.860> I'm

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
a look at how I'm doing this right I'm

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.780 
a look at how I'm doing this right I'm
starting<00:02:16.150> with<00:02:16.240> a<00:02:16.270> straight<00:02:17.050> pin<00:02:17.520> forward<00:02:18.520> and

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
starting with a straight pin forward and

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.090 
starting with a straight pin forward and
then<00:02:18.970> flipping<00:02:19.360> it<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:19.750> back<00:02:19.990> I<00:02:20.380> just<00:02:20.860> find

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
then flipping it to the back I just find

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.940 
then flipping it to the back I just find
that<00:02:21.280> this<00:02:21.490> holds<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.209> hair<00:02:22.450> a<00:02:22.690> lot<00:02:23.050> better

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
that this holds the hair a lot better

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.690 
that this holds the hair a lot better
and<00:02:24.990> yeah<00:02:26.610> it's<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.760> bomb<00:02:29.040> so<00:02:30.040> option<00:02:30.250> two<00:02:30.459> is

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
and yeah it's the bomb so option two is

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.610 
and yeah it's the bomb so option two is
you<00:02:31.090> can<00:02:31.270> still<00:02:31.540> pin<00:02:31.720> it<00:02:31.840> back<00:02:31.990> and<00:02:32.350> have<00:02:32.590> it

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
you can still pin it back and have it

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.860 
you can still pin it back and have it
like<00:02:32.860> leaning<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.400> side<00:02:33.489> like<00:02:33.700> that<00:02:34.150> so

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
like leaning to the side like that so

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.020 
like leaning to the side like that so
right<00:02:35.320> here<00:02:35.620> I'm<00:02:35.890> basically<00:02:36.430> just<00:02:36.550> combing
