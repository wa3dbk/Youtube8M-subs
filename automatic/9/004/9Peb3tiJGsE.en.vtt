00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.640

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.579

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.560
 think again rum 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:16.020
 in february there is a scavenger hunt 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.510

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:20.040
 with mystery and everything he could also 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.049
 join in but it still takes a while 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.150
 little bit because we are still ahead 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.010
 christmas and the people spam and me 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:31.620

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:34.470
 hours down the canal where are we 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:38.150
 Actually we would be very much with the people 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.150

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.400
 path
