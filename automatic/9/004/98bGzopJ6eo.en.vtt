00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
which response to this I think two

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.069 
which response to this I think two
things<00:01:44.909> number<00:01:45.030> one<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.270> don't<00:01:45.509> think<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:45.899> I

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
things number one I don't think so I

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.780 
things number one I don't think so I
don't<00:01:46.320> think<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:46.799> I'm<00:01:46.920> not<00:01:47.040> covering<00:01:47.189> myself<00:01:47.460> I

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
don't think so I'm not covering myself I

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.420 
don't think so I'm not covering myself I
don't<00:01:47.939> think<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:48.420> but<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.500> think<00:01:49.560> by<00:01:49.920> asking<00:01:50.100> the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
don't think so but I think by asking the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.530 
don't think so but I think by asking the
question<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.850> would<00:01:50.939> not<00:01:51.030> suggested<00:01:51.479> I<00:01:51.509> think

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
question it would not suggested I think

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.240 
question it would not suggested I think
so<00:01:51.930> but<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.170> one<00:01:52.290> thing<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.470> would<00:01:52.530> say<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
so but the one thing I would say the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.050 
so but the one thing I would say the
league<00:01:53.490> does<00:01:53.880> own<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.390> team<00:01:54.600> does<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:55.049> not<00:01:56.030> yes

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
league does own the team does it not yes

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.120 
league does own the team does it not yes
is<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.719> not<00:01:57.869> make<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.259> question<00:01:58.619> fair<00:01:58.860> I

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
is that not make the question fair I

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.800 
is that not make the question fair I
don't<00:02:00.119> think<00:02:00.360> so

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
don't think so

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.929 
don't think so
number<00:02:01.200> one<00:02:01.409> we<00:02:01.740> sold<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.310> we're<00:02:02.490> gonna<00:02:02.579> close

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
number one we sold it we're gonna close

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.270 
number one we sold it we're gonna close
this<00:02:03.210> week<00:02:03.509> we<00:02:04.200> already<00:02:04.619> have<00:02:04.920> established

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
this week we already have established

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.229 
this week we already have established
our<00:02:05.670> price<00:02:05.969> I<00:02:06.409> think<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:07.590> if<00:02:07.770> we<00:02:07.979> had<00:02:08.280> if<00:02:08.910> it

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
our price I think that if we had if it

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.400 
our price I think that if we had if it
had<00:02:09.360> gone<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:10.190> Michael<00:02:11.190> Jordan<00:02:11.430> and

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
had gone to Michael Jordan and

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.520 
had gone to Michael Jordan and
which<00:02:13.100> was<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.370> next<00:02:13.580> team<00:02:13.910> up<00:02:14.750> with<00:02:15.110> in<00:02:15.290> terms

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
which was the next team up with in terms

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.650 
which was the next team up with in terms
of<00:02:15.830> a<00:02:15.980> high<00:02:16.160> percentage<00:02:16.880> there<00:02:17.270> was<00:02:17.390> a<00:02:17.420> know

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
of a high percentage there was a know

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.360 
of a high percentage there was a know

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
going into Barclays Center it would have

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.690 
going into Barclays Center it would have
been<00:02:23.930> fair<00:02:24.200> to<00:02:24.230> speculate<00:02:25.010> I<00:02:25.040> suppose<00:02:25.460> that

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
been fair to speculate I suppose that

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.270 
been fair to speculate I suppose that
you<00:02:26.570> know<00:02:26.630> we<00:02:26.750> want<00:02:26.930> to<00:02:27.050> take<00:02:27.470> Brooklyn<00:02:27.950> off<00:02:28.100> of

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
you know we want to take Brooklyn off of

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.060 
you know we want to take Brooklyn off of

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
the mat so there was no winning

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.030 
the mat so there was no winning
and<00:02:31.430> people<00:02:31.820> write<00:02:32.060> about<00:02:32.120> it<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:33.260> it's<00:02:33.740> okay

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
and people write about it and it's okay

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.320 
and people write about it and it's okay
to<00:02:34.100> write<00:02:34.370> about<00:02:34.550> it<00:02:34.820> and<00:02:34.910> we<00:02:35.120> sort<00:02:35.300> of

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
to write about it and we sort of

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.320 
to write about it and we sort of
expected<00:02:36.110> but<00:02:36.710> you<00:02:37.190> know<00:02:37.370> that's<00:02:38.030> not<00:02:38.300> a
