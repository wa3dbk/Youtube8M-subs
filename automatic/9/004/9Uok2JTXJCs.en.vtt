to<00:02:17.140> have<00:02:17.319> a<00:02:17.530> pair<00:02:17.920> of<00:02:17.950> these<00:02:18.190> available<00:02:18.670> for

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
to have a pair of these available for

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.670 
to have a pair of these available for
testing<00:02:19.690> for<00:02:20.260> when<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:20.910> use<00:02:22.080> vehicles<00:02:23.080> that<00:02:23.530> can

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
testing for when I use vehicles that can

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.110 
testing for when I use vehicles that can
take<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:24.190> pair<00:02:24.940> of<00:02:24.970> 3s<00:02:26.459> battery<00:02:27.459> packs<00:02:27.760> I<00:02:27.910> didn't

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
take a pair of 3s battery packs I didn't

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.300 
take a pair of 3s battery packs I didn't
have<00:02:28.239> any<00:02:28.450> before<00:02:28.780> that<00:02:29.650> were<00:02:29.800> matched<00:02:30.069> to

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
have any before that were matched to

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.229 
have any before that were matched to
have<00:02:30.430> one<00:02:30.959> racers<00:02:31.959> edge<00:02:32.200> 3s<00:02:33.130> back<00:02:33.790> that's

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
have one racers edge 3s back that's

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:35.970 
have one racers edge 3s back that's
actually<00:02:34.720> a<00:02:34.750> hard<00:02:34.989> case<00:02:35.200> backwards<00:02:35.769> I<00:02:35.830> think

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
actually a hard case backwards I think

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.000 
actually a hard case backwards I think
it's<00:02:36.099> at<00:02:36.989> 3420<00:02:37.989> Sears<00:02:38.319> and<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.530> night<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:38.830> so

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
it's at 3420 Sears and the night that so

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.710 
it's at 3420 Sears and the night that so
these<00:02:39.130> are<00:02:40.590> 3825<00:02:41.590> CS<00:02:42.010> they<00:02:42.700> are<00:02:42.910> a<00:02:43.150> little<00:02:43.450> bit

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
these are 3825 CS they are a little bit

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.720 
these are 3825 CS they are a little bit
I<00:02:43.930> believe<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.319> little<00:02:44.530> bit<00:02:44.620> too<00:02:44.799> hairy<00:02:45.100> compare

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
I believe a little bit too hairy compare

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.340 
I believe a little bit too hairy compare
them<00:02:45.819> side-by-side<00:02:46.090> you're<00:02:46.750> just<00:02:47.019> a<00:02:47.110> little

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
them side-by-side you're just a little

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.890 
them side-by-side you're just a little
bit<00:02:47.470> shorter<00:02:47.739> and<00:02:48.340> also<00:02:48.760> not<00:02:49.000> quite<00:02:49.269> as<00:02:49.540> wide

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
bit shorter and also not quite as wide

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.430 
bit shorter and also not quite as wide
as<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:51.160> hard<00:02:51.340> case<00:02:51.610> to<00:02:51.940> sell<00:02:52.480> but<00:02:53.200> they're

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
as the hard case to sell but they're

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.460 
as the hard case to sell but they're
just<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.799> tiny<00:02:54.040> bit<00:02:54.220> taller<00:02:55.049> like<00:02:56.049> a<00:02:56.200> couple

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
just a tiny bit taller like a couple

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.530 
just a tiny bit taller like a couple
millimeters<00:02:56.920> I'm<00:02:57.310> hoping<00:02:57.580> that<00:02:57.640> this<00:02:58.360> will

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
millimeters I'm hoping that this will

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.000 
millimeters I'm hoping that this will
still<00:02:58.840> work<00:02:58.989> out<00:02:59.260> but<00:02:59.500> they<00:02:59.860> were<00:02:59.920> pretty

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
still work out but they were pretty

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.180 
still work out but they were pretty
cheap<00:03:00.459> so<00:03:00.700> I<00:03:00.940> picked<00:03:01.390> up<00:03:01.510> a<00:03:01.630> couple<00:03:01.750> of<00:03:01.959> those

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
cheap so I picked up a couple of those

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.500 
cheap so I picked up a couple of those
just<00:03:03.190> to<00:03:03.310> finally<00:03:03.640> have<00:03:03.790> a<00:03:03.819> pair<00:03:04.120> and<00:03:04.330> then<00:03:04.420> the

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
just to finally have a pair and then the

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.349 
just to finally have a pair and then the
last<00:03:04.690> one<00:03:05.640> this<00:03:06.640> came<00:03:07.209> from<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:09.030> airsoft<00:03:10.030> line

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
last one this came from the airsoft line

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.440 
last one this came from the airsoft line
and<00:03:10.690> they<00:03:11.380> call<00:03:11.560> it<00:03:11.790> airsoft<00:03:12.790> pack<00:03:13.030> only

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
and they call it airsoft pack only

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.150 
and they call it airsoft pack only
