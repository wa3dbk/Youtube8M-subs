black<00:01:28.149> ops<00:01:28.420> comes<00:01:28.659> out<00:01:28.929> or<00:01:29.170> what<00:01:29.820> hmm<00:01:30.820> I'm

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
black ops comes out or what hmm I'm

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:33.389

gonna<00:01:31.149> play<00:01:31.450> it<00:01:31.600> up<00:01:31.780> until<00:01:32.560> black<00:01:32.829> ops<00:01:33.100> but

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.419 
I'm probably gonna trade it in I think
like<00:01:37.719> ebgames<00:01:38.140> gamestop<00:01:38.890> will<00:01:39.009> probably<00:01:39.310> give

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
like ebgames gamestop will probably give

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:41.249 
like ebgames gamestop will probably give
me<00:01:39.460> like<00:01:39.700> maybe<00:01:39.969> like<00:01:40.149> twenty<00:01:40.600> dollars<00:01:40.899> for<00:01:41.170> it

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
me like maybe like twenty dollars for it

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.639 
me like maybe like twenty dollars for it
which<00:01:41.920> is<00:01:42.069> pretty<00:01:42.249> bad<00:01:42.579> but<00:01:43.229> when<00:01:44.229> black<00:01:44.469> ops

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
which is pretty bad but when black ops

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:46.319 
which is pretty bad but when black ops
comes<00:01:44.859> out<00:01:45.100> you're<00:01:45.490> not<00:01:45.640> going<00:01:45.819> to<00:01:45.880> be<00:01:45.969> seen<00:01:46.210> me

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
like the distance there's no drop-off on

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.630 
like the distance there's no drop-off on
the<00:03:39.730> shot<00:03:39.970> and<00:03:40.300> the<00:03:41.200> snipers<00:03:41.770> just<00:03:42.100> seem<00:03:42.310> I

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
the shot and the snipers just seem I

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.250 
the shot and the snipers just seem I
don't<00:03:42.850> know<00:03:43.090> they<00:03:43.270> just<00:03:43.450> seemed<00:03:43.750> like<00:03:43.930> it's

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
don't know they just seemed like it's

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.970 
don't know they just seemed like it's
one<00:03:44.470> shot<00:03:44.709> kill<00:03:44.950> with<00:03:45.130> the<00:03:45.220> m24<00:03:45.940> no<00:03:46.330> problem<00:03:46.980> I

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
one shot kill with the m24 no problem I

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.280 
one shot kill with the m24 no problem I
don't<00:03:48.940> I<00:03:49.030> don't<00:03:49.209> know<00:03:49.450> if<00:03:49.600> they<00:03:49.750> can<00:03:49.810> adjust

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
don't I don't know if they can adjust

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.500 
don't I don't know if they can adjust
them<00:03:50.440> or<00:03:50.590> not<00:03:50.739> but<00:03:51.489> what<00:03:51.700> I<00:03:51.730> did<00:03:52.030> notice<00:03:52.209> is

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
them or not but what I did notice is

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.130 
them or not but what I did notice is
this<00:03:52.750> lag<00:03:53.170> and<00:03:53.830> on<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.430> ps3<00:03:54.790> it<00:03:55.390> seems<00:03:55.930> like

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
this lag and on the ps3 it seems like

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.190 
this lag and on the ps3 it seems like
every<00:03:56.530> time<00:03:56.640> you'd<00:03:57.640> sign<00:03:58.030> in<00:03:58.360> and<00:03:58.510> out<00:03:58.660> it

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
every time you'd sign in and out it

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.530 
every time you'd sign in and out it
would<00:03:59.769> lag<00:03:59.980> and<00:04:00.400> I<00:04:00.459> think<00:04:01.060> you<00:04:01.120> have<00:04:01.269> a<00:04:01.300> pretty

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
would lag and I think you have a pretty

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.770 
would lag and I think you have a pretty
funny<00:04:01.870> story<00:04:01.959> about<00:04:02.350> that<00:04:02.590> don't<00:04:02.920> you<00:04:03.090> yeah<00:04:04.090> um

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
funny story about that don't you yeah um

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.140

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
that video probably will be posted on

right when you bremen it comes back
you're<00:05:21.430> dead<00:05:21.700> already<00:05:22.000> so<00:05:22.270> that's<00:05:22.810> a<00:05:22.960> problem

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
you're dead already so that's a problem

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:25.129 
you're dead already so that's a problem
they<00:05:23.500> need<00:05:23.650> to<00:05:23.740> fix<00:05:23.979> i'm<00:05:24.310> not<00:05:24.490> sure<00:05:24.760> if<00:05:24.850> they

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
they need to fix i'm not sure if they

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:27.510 
they need to fix i'm not sure if they
will<00:05:26.139> because<00:05:26.800> i've<00:05:26.919> been<00:05:26.950> looking<00:05:27.250> on<00:05:27.490> the

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
will because i've been looking on the

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.860 
will because i've been looking on the
forms<00:05:27.910> and<00:05:28.030> they<00:05:28.120> didn't<00:05:28.360> say<00:05:28.450> anything<00:05:28.479> on

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
forms and they didn't say anything on

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.550 
forms and they didn't say anything on
the<00:05:28.990> forms<00:05:29.350> um<00:05:30.330> that's<00:05:31.330> just<00:05:31.479> a<00:05:31.660> problem<00:05:32.410> that

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
the forms um that's just a problem that

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.170 
the forms um that's just a problem that
i<00:05:32.590> think<00:05:32.650> they<00:05:32.860> really<00:05:33.130> need<00:05:33.250> to<00:05:33.460> look<00:05:33.820> into

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
i think they really need to look into

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.370 
i think they really need to look into
and<00:05:34.419> some<00:05:34.600> other<00:05:34.750> stuff<00:05:34.810> like<00:05:35.169> you<00:05:35.290> were

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
saying the pistol the sniper look at

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.909 
saying the pistol the sniper look at
that<00:05:37.389> pistol<00:05:37.840> how<00:05:37.960> far<00:05:38.229> he<00:05:38.350> shot<00:05:38.650> and<00:05:38.889> killed

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
that pistol how far he shot and killed

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:40.800 
that pistol how far he shot and killed
that<00:05:39.250> guy<00:05:39.460> that<00:05:40.090> was<00:05:40.240> just<00:05:40.450> that<00:05:40.750> was

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
that guy that was just that was

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.409 
that guy that was just that was
sickening<00:05:41.350> right<00:05:41.560> there<00:05:41.770> that's<00:05:42.280> just<00:05:42.460> I<00:05:42.820> I

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
sickening right there that's just I I

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.110 
sickening right there that's just I I
don't<00:05:43.930> know<00:05:44.050> man<00:05:44.160> they<00:05:45.160> needa<00:05:45.460> just<00:05:45.789> a<00:05:45.910> little

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
don't know man they needa just a little

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.520 
don't know man they needa just a little
bit<00:05:46.270> would<00:05:46.450> be<00:05:46.539> nice<00:05:46.720> if<00:05:46.960> they<00:05:47.050> had<00:05:47.080> a<00:05:47.200> silencer

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
bit would be nice if they had a silencer

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.590 
bit would be nice if they had a silencer
for<00:05:48.039> the<00:05:48.160> pistol<00:05:48.550> too<00:05:48.760> if<00:05:48.970> you<00:05:49.120> could<00:05:49.270> do

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 
for the pistol too if you could do

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.260 
for the pistol too if you could do
something<00:05:49.930> with<00:05:50.110> the<00:05:50.410> the<00:05:50.770> pistols<00:05:51.220> but<00:05:51.550> it

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
something with the the pistols but it

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.730 
something with the the pistols but it
looks<00:05:52.479> like<00:05:52.660> you<00:05:52.840> can't<00:05:53.080> and<00:05:53.380> I<00:05:53.440> think<00:05:53.470> there's

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
looks like you can't and I think there's

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.230
