that's<00:03:24.060> a<00:03:24.120> little<00:03:24.240> bit<00:03:24.360> easier<00:03:24.840> to<00:03:25.170> fight<00:03:25.770> and

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
that's a little bit easier to fight and

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.750 
that's a little bit easier to fight and
because<00:03:27.140> fire<00:03:28.140> I<00:03:28.470> mean<00:03:28.680> he's<00:03:28.920> level<00:03:29.220> 50<00:03:29.490> fire

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
because fire I mean he's level 50 fire

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.580 
because fire I mean he's level 50 fire
has<00:03:30.000> now<00:03:30.150> become<00:03:30.300> available<00:03:30.690> so<00:03:31.230> let's<00:03:31.440> do<00:03:31.560> a

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
has now become available so let's do a

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.520 
has now become available so let's do a
nuclear<00:03:32.070> hit<00:03:32.280> on<00:03:32.460> the<00:03:32.610> sky<00:03:32.880> these<00:03:33.840> guys<00:03:34.110> seems

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
nuclear hit on the sky these guys seems

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.190 
nuclear hit on the sky these guys seems
to<00:03:34.620> negate<00:03:34.710> each<00:03:34.920> other<00:03:35.220> water<00:03:35.820> and<00:03:36.150> fire<00:03:36.240> so

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
to negate each other water and fire so

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:46.360 
to negate each other water and fire so
watch<00:03:37.590> it<00:03:37.620> burn<00:03:37.980> baby<00:03:38.360> or<00:03:39.360> in<00:03:39.420> your<00:03:39.480> case<00:03:39.570> melt

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370
