pushes water back into tanks from the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.770 
pushes water back into tanks from the
pump<00:01:46.100> okay<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.820> two<00:01:48.329> small<00:01:50.210> round<00:01:51.210> black

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
Rubbermaid salt because you can do so

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
this ball valve is cut back is because

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.690 
this ball valve is cut back is because
we<00:03:28.790> need<00:03:29.000> equal<00:03:29.239> flow<00:03:29.989> between<00:03:30.410> both<00:03:31.070> sides<00:03:31.100> of
