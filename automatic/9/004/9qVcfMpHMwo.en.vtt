00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.860 
the game and you got China rising for
free<00:02:12.090> then

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
dollars but is still worth it but the

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.220 
dollars but is still worth it but the
trick<00:02:17.730> is<00:02:17.760> here<00:02:18.180> now<00:02:18.420> is<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.900> since
