00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello girls how are you how can you give yourself 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.400
 account already we changed a little bit of the fund 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.770
 because I was being told that he looked very father 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.330
 this from the idea of ​​the photos but 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.370
 at the same time I thought I was like very 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.259
 gray and like I needed some color 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.089
 so I decided to change the color of the 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.379
 wall by this color blue landmark and the 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.789
 really like that I think it's 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.320
 nice but I do not know what you say 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.029
 in the comments that you think and 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.010
 going on to the main theme of this video 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.570
 in this tutorial I want to show you how 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.010
 recreate this hairstyle the truth that to me 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.050
 I think you are super nice 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.300
 Super cute touches remain and very 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.830
 feminine but at the same time it allows you 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.480
 be comfortable because you're not going to bring the 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.579
 hair on his face let's see the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.960
 video for this hairstyle I'm going to 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.610
 use some hair extensions 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.309
 but of course this step is 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.230
 optional I'll start by placing the 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.420
 first of the curtains in this section 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.219
 like a little of my ears and I'm going to 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.850
 use a first curtain of these from 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.920
 3 clips 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.510
 try that when you place them you have what 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.510
 more pegadito to your scalp 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.260
 the second of the curtains I'm going to 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.359
 place more or less at the height of 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.469
 ears and again I will place one of 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.469
 this one of three clips 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.840
 I'm going to go up about two centimeters to 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.740
 place my third curtain that is of 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.740
 four clips 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.970
 my last curtain of 4 clicks I'm going to 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.729
 place more or less at the height of 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.830
 eyebrows by the way that my hair had already 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.090
 created a loose wave texture by 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.920
 here in the description of the video too 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.520
 I'll leave the link in case you want 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.520
 watch this video 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.619
 and finally I'm going to place four of 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.229
 these small one- click to this 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.039
 height to give me as more volume 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.039
 in the opposite 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.920
 Once all the curtains are in place 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.540
 I really like the effect it gives you 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.950
 the hair because it has a lot 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.450
 volume and besides that these 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.730
 extensions that I chose have as 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.770
 a kind of three degraded in the 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.640
 tips so it makes me give you a 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.560
 interesting effect in terms of color 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.180
 to start fully with the hairstyle 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.310
 I'm going to select the opposite 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.320
 in this way and I'm going to start spinning 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.390
 back to form a small 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.830
 rollito which I will hold with the 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.100
 help from one of these tweezers for a 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.100
 little 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.070
 on the other side I'm going to take a more lock 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.540
 or less of the same thickness and just like 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.820
 the previous one I'm going to tangle back 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.320
 to get to form a roll and what 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.060
 I'm going to join with the previous one to 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.060
 join them with a league of little girls 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.600
 I recommend that in this step equal 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.700
 if you can use two lists do it 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.130
 to ensure that they are not going to break 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.780
 throughout your day try that when joining 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.580
 these two rolls are more or less 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.230
 focused because I was in doing the base 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.670
 of our braid and we do not want us 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.500
 will be like this with much success towards a 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.270
 side truth once you like the 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.620
 position of your first ponytail 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.050
 let's take the hair that is 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.700
 We find around here are going to 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.500
 make generous when choosing the 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.300
 hair because we want our 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.550
 braid is left with a lot of volume and looks 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.200
 so super pretty and super flashy the 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.850
 rest of the hair I decided to spend it 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.710
 in front so that I do not get in the way 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.480
 while doing the braid in this section 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.370
 in the middle for our braid what 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.450
 we must do is divide the hair into 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.100
 two sections 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.840
 after the section on the right we're going 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.490
 to take a super-tiny lock of 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.230
 preference of the back and what 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.360
 let's change to the section of the 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.340
 left then in our section of the 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.200
 left alike let's take a lock 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.420
 very tiny and preferably of the 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.160
 back and now we are going to cross 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.350
 in front of the section of the 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.170
 right and this is basically all the 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.790
 procedure that we should continue to take 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.100
 a small strand of the part of the 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.780
 right and we send it to the left 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.020
 then from the left we take a lock 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.400
 tiny one and we passed it to the right 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.840
 following these steps over and over again 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.820
 until you reach the tips you're going to 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.890
 get a tail effect braid 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.150
 of fish I think they call him and seriously 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.070
 which looks very pretty but of course 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.600
 that if you have problems with this guy 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.740
 of braids you can make a braid of 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.740
 those of three segments 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.260
 once you have already advanced something in your 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.670
 braid the truth is that if it gets complicated 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.560
 a little bit of being knitting with the 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.000
 arms back then I 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.520
 I recommend that you pass your braid towards 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.830
 forward and from there continue weaving 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.510
 in the end we will hold with a league 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.080
 of the little ones and me personally 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.090
 I like to leave about 8 or 9 free 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.380
 centimeters without knitting and then since 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.420
 also subject to our braid we 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.160
 left is pulling the sides so that 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.170
 it gets more volume and looks 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.090
 even more chubby as if she had 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.680
 a lot of hair and this would be 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.360
 practically everything already if you want 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.180
 you can add a little preacher 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.650
 or a little oil for your tips and 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.360
 ready 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.710
