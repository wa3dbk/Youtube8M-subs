supply<00:00:33.309> to<00:00:33.370> that<00:00:33.579> mixer<00:00:34.180> now<00:00:34.870> you<00:00:34.930> can<00:00:35.230> also

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
supply to that mixer now you can also

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.940 
supply to that mixer now you can also
see<00:00:36.040> that<00:00:36.850> not<00:00:37.090> only<00:00:37.239> is<00:00:37.690> that<00:00:38.110> pipe<00:00:38.410> labeled

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 
see that not only is that pipe labeled

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.150

cold<00:00:39.460> supply<00:00:39.910> to<00:00:39.969> tap<00:00:40.450> there's<00:00:41.260> also<00:00:41.590> what's

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
cold supply to tap there's also what's

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.819 
cold supply to tap there's also what's
called<00:00:42.370> an<00:00:42.579> isolation<00:00:43.300> valve<00:00:43.570> on<00:00:43.840> that<00:00:44.560> pipe

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
called an isolation valve on that pipe

can see from our gas supply video one

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.440 
can see from our gas supply video one
when<00:01:34.390> the<00:01:34.600> slot<00:01:34.990> in<00:01:35.350> the<00:01:35.799> in<00:01:36.430> the<00:01:36.700> valve<00:01:36.909> itself

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
when the slot in the in the valve itself

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.399 
when the slot in the in the valve itself
is<00:01:38.159> at<00:01:39.159> 90<00:01:39.820> degrees<00:01:40.210> to<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.600> pipe<00:01:40.810> I<00:01:41.049> is

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
is at 90 degrees to the pipe I is

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.980 
is at 90 degrees to the pipe I is
running<00:01:41.799> across<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.610> pipe<00:01:42.820> that's<00:01:43.450> when<00:01:43.810> it's

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
running across the pipe that's when it's

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.730 
running across the pipe that's when it's
off<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:45.369> visually<00:01:45.790> you<00:01:45.970> could<00:01:46.180> see<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:47.680> that

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
off so visually you could see that that

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.280 
off so visually you could see that that
slot<00:01:48.280> is<00:01:48.520> in<00:01:48.700> fact<00:01:48.970> a<00:01:49.210> blade<00:01:49.930> or<00:01:50.260> something

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
slot is in fact a blade or something

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.170 
slot is in fact a blade or something
which<00:01:50.740> cutting<00:01:51.189> across<00:01:51.580> the<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.210> pipe<00:01:52.530> and

which cutting across the the pipe and

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.870 
which cutting across the the pipe and
and<00:01:55.180> shuts<00:01:55.479> it<00:01:55.659> off<00:01:55.780> similarly<00:01:56.650> when<00:01:57.220> the<00:01:57.580> slot

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
and shuts it off similarly when the slot

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.179 
and shuts it off similarly when the slot
on<00:01:57.909> the<00:01:58.119> screw<00:01:58.540> head<00:01:58.810> is<00:01:59.020> in<00:01:59.470> line<00:01:59.799> with<00:01:59.830> the

on the screw head is in line with the

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:01.620 
on the screw head is in line with the
pipe<00:02:00.400> it<00:02:00.610> allows<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:01.030> water<00:02:01.210> to<00:02:01.450> run<00:02:01.570> through

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
pipe it allows the water to run through

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.260 
pipe it allows the water to run through
it<00:02:01.990> you<00:02:02.350> just<00:02:02.560> need<00:02:02.740> a<00:02:02.799> simple<00:02:03.070> screwdriver<00:02:03.430> to

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
it you just need a simple screwdriver to

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.580 
it you just need a simple screwdriver to
turn<00:02:04.479> that<00:02:04.740> isolation<00:02:05.740> valve<00:02:05.950> on<00:02:06.100> and<00:02:06.250> off<00:02:07.590> so

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
turn that isolation valve on and off so

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.289 
turn that isolation valve on and off so
that's<00:02:08.709> how<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:08.979> cold<00:02:09.250> supply<00:02:09.640> works<00:02:09.939> it<00:02:10.149> goes

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.299 
that's how the cold supply works it goes

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:13.140 
that's how the cold supply works it goes
in<00:02:10.539> it<00:02:11.290> goes<00:02:11.319> straight<00:02:11.680> to<00:02:11.739> the<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.610> cold<00:02:12.849> tap

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
in it goes straight to the the cold tap

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.380 
in it goes straight to the the cold tap
in<00:02:13.390> this<00:02:14.170> particular<00:02:14.590> instance<00:02:15.099> there<00:02:15.909> are<00:02:16.150> um

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
in this particular instance there are um

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.910 
in this particular instance there are um
T<00:02:17.170> junctions<00:02:18.480> from<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.810> cold<00:02:20.110> supply<00:02:20.590> and

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
T junctions from the cold supply and

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.220 
T junctions from the cold supply and
they<00:02:21.280> feed<00:02:21.730> on<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.120> right<00:02:22.870> hand

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
they feed on the right hand

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.800 
they feed on the right hand
side<00:02:23.409> of<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.680> unit<00:02:24.069> they<00:02:24.670> feed<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.360> washing

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
side of the unit they feed the washing

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.699 
side of the unit they feed the washing
machine<00:02:26.200> and<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:27.640> dishwasher<00:02:28.239> so<00:02:29.170> they<00:02:29.590> are

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
machine and the dishwasher so they are

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.369 
machine and the dishwasher so they are
fed<00:02:29.980> all<00:02:30.340> off<00:02:30.760> of<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.060> rising<00:02:31.450> main<00:02:31.629> all<00:02:31.930> up

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
fed all off of the rising main all up

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.920 
fed all off of the rising main all up
mains<00:02:32.799> pressure<00:02:33.269> washing<00:02:34.269> machines<00:02:34.750> and

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
mains pressure washing machines and

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.170 
mains pressure washing machines and
dishwashers<00:02:35.080> don't<00:02:36.069> work<00:02:36.340> on<00:02:36.580> anything<00:02:36.849> less

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
dishwashers don't work on anything less

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.900 
dishwashers don't work on anything less
than<00:02:37.390> mains<00:02:37.629> pressure<00:02:38.280> so<00:02:39.280> it's<00:02:39.430> important

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
than mains pressure so it's important

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.369 
than mains pressure so it's important
that<00:02:40.060> they<00:02:40.180> are<00:02:40.209> fed<00:02:40.540> directly<00:02:41.080> from<00:02:41.200> the

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
that they are fed directly from the

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.670 
that they are fed directly from the
rising<00:02:41.769> main<00:02:42.120> this<00:02:43.120> this<00:02:43.599> particular<00:02:44.019> kitchen

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
rising main this this particular kitchen

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.949 
rising main this this particular kitchen
is<00:02:44.799> a<00:02:44.890> little<00:02:44.920> more<00:02:45.310> unusual<00:02:45.489> than<00:02:46.060> most<00:02:46.330> in

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
is a little more unusual than most in

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.960 
is a little more unusual than most in
that<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.860> cold<00:02:48.160> supply<00:02:48.640> also<00:02:49.360> feeds<00:02:50.970> through

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
that the cold supply also feeds through

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.930 
that the cold supply also feeds through
the<00:02:52.209> smaller<00:02:52.569> pipes<00:02:52.959> here<00:02:53.440> a<00:02:54.060> hot<00:02:55.060> water<00:02:55.739> tap

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
the smaller pipes here a hot water tap

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.160 
the smaller pipes here a hot water tap
so<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.060> cold<00:02:58.390> supply<00:02:59.700> this<00:03:00.700> isn't<00:03:01.000> just<00:03:01.269> a<00:03:01.480> hot

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
so the cold supply this isn't just a hot

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.479 
so the cold supply this isn't just a hot
water<00:03:02.379> tap<00:03:02.769> this<00:03:03.310> is<00:03:03.489> also<00:03:03.700> a<00:03:04.269> filter<00:03:04.959> tap

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
water tap this is also a filter tap

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.589 
water tap this is also a filter tap
we'll<00:03:06.489> have<00:03:06.640> a<00:03:06.670> look<00:03:06.819> at<00:03:06.970> that<00:03:07.090> when<00:03:07.299> we<00:03:07.420> go

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
we'll have a look at that when we go

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.690 
we'll have a look at that when we go
above<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.109> the<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.890> sink<00:03:09.160> unit<00:03:09.459> to<00:03:09.609> the

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
above the the the sink unit to the

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.880 
above the the the sink unit to the
surface<00:03:10.180> so<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:10.959> cold<00:03:11.319> supply<00:03:12.030> is<00:03:13.030> fed<00:03:13.510> into<00:03:14.260> a

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
surface so the cold supply is fed into a

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.750 
surface so the cold supply is fed into a
water<00:03:15.459> filter<00:03:16.560> from<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.620> water<00:03:17.920> filter<00:03:18.489> it

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
water filter from the water filter it

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.199 
water filter from the water filter it
goes<00:03:18.970> straight<00:03:19.299> to<00:03:19.359> the<00:03:19.540> cold<00:03:20.760> part<00:03:21.760> of<00:03:22.030> the

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
goes straight to the cold part of the

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.819 
goes straight to the cold part of the
boiling<00:03:22.989> water<00:03:23.319> tap<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:25.319> another<00:03:26.319> branch<00:03:26.620> of

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
boiling water tap and another branch of

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.309 
boiling water tap and another branch of
the<00:03:26.890> cold<00:03:27.190> water<00:03:27.459> is<00:03:27.639> fed<00:03:28.090> directly<00:03:28.299> into<00:03:28.780> the

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
the cold water is fed directly into the

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.339 
the cold water is fed directly into the
water<00:03:29.560> heater<00:03:29.980> itself<00:03:30.489> this<00:03:31.269> water<00:03:31.540> heats<00:03:31.989> the

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
water heater itself this water heats the

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.210 
water heater itself this water heats the
water<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:33.250> 98<00:03:34.030> degrees<00:03:34.650> about<00:03:35.650> as<00:03:35.859> close<00:03:36.160> to

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
water to 98 degrees about as close to

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.120 
water to 98 degrees about as close to
boiling<00:03:36.579> actually<00:03:37.299> you<00:03:37.419> can<00:03:37.569> just<00:03:37.599> hear<00:03:37.989> it

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.610 

that's<00:03:42.130> a<00:03:42.430> wonderful<00:03:43.060> coincidence<00:03:43.440> so<00:03:44.440> that

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
that's a wonderful coincidence so that

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.860 
that's a wonderful coincidence so that
the<00:03:44.889> the<00:03:45.370> heater<00:03:45.849> is<00:03:46.090> on<00:03:46.239> all<00:03:46.389> of<00:03:46.419> the<00:03:46.690> time

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
the the heater is on all of the time

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.990 
the the heater is on all of the time
thermostatically-controlled<00:03:47.829> the<00:03:48.760> cold

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
thermostatically-controlled the cold

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.759 
thermostatically-controlled the cold
water<00:03:49.239> goes<00:03:49.510> into<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.930> heated<00:03:50.290> the<00:03:50.410> element

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
water goes into the heated the element

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.430 
water goes into the heated the element
heats<00:03:51.069> the<00:03:51.340> water<00:03:51.519> to<00:03:51.819> 98<00:03:52.269> degrees<00:03:52.299> and<00:03:52.870> then

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
heats the water to 98 degrees and then

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.409 
heats the water to 98 degrees and then
is<00:03:53.590> fed<00:03:53.829> up<00:03:53.859> up<00:03:54.190> to<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:54.790> the<00:03:55.060> boiling<00:03:55.389> hot

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.419 
is fed up up to the the boiling hot

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:59.009 
is fed up up to the the boiling hot
water<00:03:55.750> tap<00:03:56.109> above<00:03:56.470> to<00:03:57.220> the<00:03:57.459> the<00:03:57.819> hot<00:03:58.030> boiling

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
water tap above to the the hot boiling

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.809 
water tap above to the the hot boiling
hot<00:03:59.169> tap<00:03:59.470> and<00:03:59.769> the<00:04:00.040> filter<00:04:00.400> tap<00:04:00.579> that<00:04:00.700> we

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
hot tap and the filter tap that we

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.849 
hot tap and the filter tap that we
talked<00:04:01.030> about<00:04:01.319> the<00:04:02.319> one<00:04:02.470> on<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:02.680> left

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
talked about the one on the left

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:05.039 
talked about the one on the left
obviously<00:04:03.040> is<00:04:03.370> red<00:04:03.579> is<00:04:03.790> boiling<00:04:04.150> water<00:04:04.419> and<00:04:04.750> it

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
obviously is red is boiling water and it

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:07.530 
obviously is red is boiling water and it
just<00:04:05.230> works<00:04:05.650> on<00:04:05.799> a<00:04:05.859> lever<00:04:06.099> action<00:04:06.480> there's<00:04:07.480> a

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
just works on a lever action there's a

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.869 
just works on a lever action there's a
slight<00:04:07.900> delay<00:04:08.079> and<00:04:08.500> you<00:04:09.220> can<00:04:09.400> see<00:04:09.579> the<00:04:09.700> water

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 
slight delay and you can see the water

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:12.930 
slight delay and you can see the water
coming<00:04:10.299> out<00:04:10.359> of<00:04:10.419> there<00:04:10.599> is<00:04:10.840> indeed<00:04:11.139> boiling<00:04:11.940> so

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
coming out of there is indeed boiling so

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.879 
coming out of there is indeed boiling so
we<00:04:13.359> don't<00:04:13.540> need<00:04:13.660> a<00:04:13.720> kettle<00:04:14.139> in<00:04:14.260> this<00:04:14.410> property

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
we don't need a kettle in this property

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:17.400 
we don't need a kettle in this property
you<00:04:15.879> simply<00:04:16.299> put<00:04:16.510> your<00:04:16.539> coffee<00:04:16.840> in<00:04:17.049> your<00:04:17.200> cup

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
you simply put your coffee in your cup

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.770 
you simply put your coffee in your cup
run<00:04:18.070> it<00:04:18.190> under<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.430> boiling<00:04:18.849> tap<00:04:19.120> and<00:04:19.329> that's

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
run it under the boiling tap and that's

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.629 
run it under the boiling tap and that's
done<00:04:19.989> similarly<00:04:20.530> if<00:04:21.010> you<00:04:21.130> want<00:04:21.310> to<00:04:21.370> drink<00:04:21.549> the

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
done similarly if you want to drink the

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.000 
done similarly if you want to drink the
water<00:04:21.789> and<00:04:22.060> you<00:04:22.240> prefer<00:04:22.389> filtered<00:04:22.960> water<00:04:23.110> just

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
water and you prefer filtered water just

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.820 
water and you prefer filtered water just
use<00:04:24.130> the<00:04:24.340> cold<00:04:24.580> and<00:04:25.090> that<00:04:25.660> water<00:04:25.900> has<00:04:26.289> been<00:04:26.560> run

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
use the cold and that water has been run

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.620 
use the cold and that water has been run
through<00:04:27.099> the<00:04:27.220> filter<00:04:27.400> that<00:04:27.699> you<00:04:27.820> saw<00:04:28.030> down

through the filter that you saw down
below<00:04:29.160> the<00:04:30.160> mixer<00:04:30.490> tap<00:04:30.699> that<00:04:30.880> we<00:04:31.000> talked<00:04:31.240> about

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
below the mixer tap that we talked about

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.630 
below the mixer tap that we talked about
while<00:04:31.750> we<00:04:31.900> were<00:04:32.020> down<00:04:32.229> there<00:04:32.260> is<00:04:32.620> this<00:04:33.340> little

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
while we were down there is this little

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.839 
while we were down there is this little
beauty<00:04:33.969> here

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:34.849 
beauty here

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:38.800 
beauty here
it's<00:04:35.180> forward<00:04:35.509> for<00:04:35.659> hot<00:04:35.840> in<00:04:36.139> this<00:04:36.289> case<00:04:37.780> on<00:04:38.780> a

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
it's forward for hot in this case on a

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.490 
it's forward for hot in this case on a
pivot<00:04:39.169> handle<00:04:39.560> and<00:04:39.740> then<00:04:40.460> back<00:04:40.669> for<00:04:40.909> cold<00:04:41.120> and

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
pivot handle and then back for cold and

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.879 
pivot handle and then back for cold and
pull<00:04:42.500> that<00:04:42.680> and<00:04:42.889> you<00:04:43.699> can<00:04:43.909> see<00:04:44.180> straight<00:04:44.360> away

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
pull that and you can see straight away

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.809 
pull that and you can see straight away
that<00:04:45.889> the<00:04:46.189> coal<00:04:46.460> is<00:04:47.150> under<00:04:47.719> mains<00:04:47.930> pressure

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:48.819 
that the coal is under mains pressure

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:53.379 
that the coal is under mains pressure
whereas<00:04:49.819> the<00:04:49.939> hot<00:04:51.219> is<00:04:52.219> under<00:04:52.879> tank<00:04:53.120> pressure

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
whereas the hot is under tank pressure

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:55.709 
whereas the hot is under tank pressure
that's<00:04:53.930> the<00:04:54.139> difference<00:04:54.469> between<00:04:54.560> the<00:04:54.979> two

00:04:55.709 --> 00:04:55.719 
that's the difference between the two

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:58.779 
that's the difference between the two
quite<00:04:56.719> easy<00:04:56.930> to<00:04:57.169> spot<00:04:57.469> so<00:04:58.069> mains<00:04:58.430> pressure

00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:58.789 
quite easy to spot so mains pressure

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:00.700 
quite easy to spot so mains pressure
because<00:04:59.569> it's<00:04:59.719> come<00:04:59.900> directly<00:05:00.379> from<00:05:00.560> the

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
because it's come directly from the

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:07.779 
because it's come directly from the
riving<00:05:01.099> line<00:05:03.099> against<00:05:04.099> tank<00:05:04.310> pressure<00:05:06.789> quite

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:07.789 
riving line against tank pressure quite

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:11.649 
riving line against tank pressure quite
a<00:05:07.819> bit<00:05:07.969> of<00:05:08.060> difference<00:05:10.090> so<00:05:11.090> that's<00:05:11.210> the<00:05:11.419> first

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:11.659 
a bit of difference so that's the first

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:13.390 
a bit of difference so that's the first
port<00:05:11.960> of<00:05:12.020> call<00:05:12.080> for<00:05:12.529> the<00:05:12.590> water<00:05:12.770> as<00:05:13.069> it<00:05:13.189> comes

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
port of call for the water as it comes

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.129 
port of call for the water as it comes
into<00:05:13.580> the<00:05:13.699> property<00:05:14.180> now<00:05:14.810> we're<00:05:14.990> going<00:05:15.080> to

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.139 
into the property now we're going to

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:16.779 
into the property now we're going to
move<00:05:15.259> on<00:05:15.469> to<00:05:15.620> the<00:05:15.740> downstairs<00:05:16.129> system<00:05:16.610> where

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:16.789 
move on to the downstairs system where

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:19.659 
move on to the downstairs system where
we<00:05:16.909> can<00:05:17.090> see<00:05:17.270> how<00:05:17.300> that's<00:05:17.689> fed<00:05:18.370> and<00:05:19.370> how<00:05:19.550> it

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
we can see how that's fed and how it

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.029 
we can see how that's fed and how it
operates
