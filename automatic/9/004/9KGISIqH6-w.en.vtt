 will become attraction in today's program 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.650
 Let's take a trip to the south of 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.679
 Brazil 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.680
 because it is and then we will go German in the 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.260
 typical steps of the Portuguese dance then 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.969
 it's time to pick up the chimarrão and learn 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.050
 a little more about the culture of the river 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.600
 great southern 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.000
 We are here with a student of the 2nd 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.940
 the period of law divided between 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.780
 the codes and the dance this as was the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.610
 first contact with yours with the dance 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.520
 influence was directly linked to 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.109
 parents where I once spent five years in Rio Grande 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.059
 from the south you have a center of traditions 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.280

 You had such difficulties in the 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.229
 first steps is difficulty getting out 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.150
 I felt because as a child I had not yet 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.850
 had very active motor coordination 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.869
 so it's complicated you coordinate on foot 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.960
 hand and arm with respect to the fittings 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.750
 Each garment has a meaning as 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.420
 is it that accessory thing that he 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.430

 one of them is chile pac is what i am 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.500
 feeling that he is one he brings you to 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.540
 idea of ​​primitive the clothing that 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.540
