get a better hold on the phone or if

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.590 
get a better hold on the phone or if
it's<00:01:19.140> just<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.530> design<00:01:20.490> feature<00:01:20.729> but<00:01:21.119> anyway

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
it's just a design feature but anyway

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.450 
it's just a design feature but anyway
it's<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.380> great-looking<00:01:22.650> phone<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.280> if<00:01:23.369> you

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
it's a great-looking phone and if you

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.270 
it's a great-looking phone and if you
notice<00:01:23.640> from<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.000> side<00:01:24.240> it's<00:01:24.840> also<00:01:25.140> very<00:01:25.650> thin

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
notice from the side it's also very thin

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.600 
notice from the side it's also very thin
extremely<00:01:27.060> thin<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:28.439> think<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:29.100> for<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
extremely thin so I think that for the

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.520 
extremely thin so I think that for the
people<00:01:29.759> who<00:01:29.970> want<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.360> galaxy<00:01:30.810> s3<00:01:31.200> but<00:01:31.350> don't

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
people who want the galaxy s3 but don't

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.929 
people who want the galaxy s3 but don't
want<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.770> put<00:01:31.920> out<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.159> five<00:01:32.340> hundred<00:01:32.670> dollars

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
want to put out the five hundred dollars

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.880 
want to put out the five hundred dollars
for<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:33.689> is<00:01:33.869> probably<00:01:34.140> going<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.560> be<00:01:34.619> your

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
for it this is probably going to be your

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.789 
for it this is probably going to be your

actually<00:03:25.709> look<00:03:26.190> at<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.519> memory<00:03:26.850> inside<00:03:27.180> of

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
actually look at the memory inside of

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.690 
actually look at the memory inside of
the<00:03:27.480> phone<00:03:27.720> it<00:03:28.440> uses<00:03:28.769> up<00:03:29.100> so<00:03:29.310> much<00:03:29.459> of<00:03:29.519> the

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
memory on bloatware that that four

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.930 
memory on bloatware that that four
gigabytes<00:03:31.739> turns<00:03:32.010> into<00:03:32.190> like<00:03:32.370> one<00:03:32.640> point

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
gigabytes turns into like one point

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.509 
gigabytes turns into like one point
seven<00:03:33.269> gigabytes<00:03:33.600> but<00:03:34.170> in<00:03:34.350> this<00:03:34.590> phone<00:03:34.860> you

more responsive than my samsung galaxy

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.310 
more responsive than my samsung galaxy
s3<00:04:09.470> when<00:04:10.470> it<00:04:10.590> first<00:04:10.799> came<00:04:11.010> out<00:04:11.190> of<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.430> box<00:04:11.670> so

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
s3 when it first came out of the box so

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.479 
s3 when it first came out of the box so
so<00:04:13.320> i<00:04:13.350> think<00:04:13.739> that<00:04:13.859> this<00:04:13.950> is<00:04:14.130> going<00:04:14.250> to<00:04:14.340> be<00:04:14.459> a

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
so i think that this is going to be a

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.279 
so i think that this is going to be a
big<00:04:14.760> seller<00:04:15.030> from<00:04:15.239> metro<00:04:15.630> and<00:04:15.840> i<00:04:15.900> think<00:04:16.140> that

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
big seller from metro and i think that

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.890 
big seller from metro and i think that

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
especially since the LG motion did so

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.730 
especially since the LG motion did so
