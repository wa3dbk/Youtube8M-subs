00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello friends we will be talking about a scam that is held every year and still 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.130
 they continue celebrating the 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.910
 there is no date or record that jesus was born on December 25 but from where 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.449
 they take out this hoax 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.879
 and the big lie of Santa Claus an old man who can not with his life and 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:20.419
 supposedly gifted toy ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:21.919
 laugh 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:24.919
 says in the bible that the birth of Jesus Christ is celebrated 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.749
 that is, there is no record or date of the birth of Jesus 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:34.839
 even in the bible it says clearly that there were in shepherds pastoring their 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:35.890
 sheep 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.690
 here comes the other of the lies in Bethlehem for this time falls snow 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.100
 so if there is snow there is no grass 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.180
 as the sheep were going to eat grass if what there is is snow 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.470
 unless the sheep were not open 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.650
 jajaj and ji jo jo jo ja ja is clearly seen these holidays are paid 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.450
 as well as the chubby dressed in red that in truth what it seems is a chanta 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.290
 drunk here the one who fill his pockets with these festivities of 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.630
 fantasies and lies are the businesses on these dates it shoots a 28 and a 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.820
 wing gigantic economy 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.620
 they sell you in the trees until the light bulbs and decorations cost in 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.190
 gifts that sometimes throw it aside 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.360
 credit cards make their August good is a round business in a few 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.420
 words on December 25 is the day of the trade 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.180
 Ponce also forgot that it is the day of the big lie 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.530
 how is it possible that in the scriptures it says clearly who is the father of the 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.890
 lie and no Chinese hawthorn is called satan 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.390
 if satan is from the father of lies then why do people who 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.549
 they celebrate this holiday they cheat they lie to the innocence of children 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.040
 also on a birthday gift they gave him the head of John the Baptist 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.850
 before the daughter of the real you believe how Jesus got to know that Juan was killed 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.850
 to please the daughter of the royal 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.710
 if we continue we do not stop 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.770
 another little thing that you forgot to say wilfrid 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.530
 is that in those celebrations only what you see are revealed after 100 less than 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.180
 what they think is in Jesus 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.340
 there are more murders and robberies since the poor have to steal to give away the 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.539
 most needy are those who pay for the broken dishes 

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:16.869
 that's the reality and I do not think Jesus Christ would agree with 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:18.119
 these holidays 

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.819
 I do not think so
