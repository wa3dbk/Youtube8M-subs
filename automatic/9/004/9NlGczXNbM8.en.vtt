 at volvo the name x and designates 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.879
 the fighters the xc60 and the little suv 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.160
 of the mark located in the range under the 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:16.910
 big problem it's 90 they compete 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.960
 directly audi q5 or bmw x3 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.700
 quietly restyled last year 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.079
 the xc60 has evolved its range of 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.329
 engines but look at one of 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:26.640
 specificities of the brand of engines 5 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:28.919
 otherwise our model is provided with it 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.419
 is the diesel drawing of 215 horses 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.980
 only available in 4 wheels 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.450
 but leaves the choice between 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.870
 the manual or automatic six boxes 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.239
 reports 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.980
 our xc60 is in finish range 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.230
 xenium inside found 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.000
 the volvo universe close to the s60 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.590
 v60 with a center console to 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.840
 ergonomics a little complicated for cause 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.070
 small and numerous buttons but the 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.450
 quality of presentation is at the rendezvous 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.370
 you especially in our test car 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.170
 who is entitled to optional leather until 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.520
 top of the dashboard finishing 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.020
 xenium adds in addition a panoply 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.390
 impressive comfort equipment 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.600
 and security at the back the space is 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.460
 generous for two adults even big the 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.019
 chest is more limited with less 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.360
 500 of the 6 cubic meters available a 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.380
 little just saw the jig the five 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.000
 cylinders delivers a sound 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.580
 particular not unpleasant but 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.050
 discreet with 440 newton-meters of 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.790
 early available torque and motor skills 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.350
 impeccable and accelerations are 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.760
 frank and the one that his 60 raise 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.860
 easily even on highway 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.720
 a flat all the same on the box auto 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.299
 here at six reports and not at 8 like 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.549
 on the x 60 of the 4 it is slower and 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.440
 less suitable for fast driving 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.790
 side behavior this suv likes big 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.049
 spaces but is less comfortable 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.880
 on small winding roads 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.900
 the comfort is however preserved 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.090
 even with our 20-inch wheels 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.470
 optional 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.540
 overall this xc60 combines the qualities 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.430
 both for its sound quality presentation 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.650
 habitability its general comfort or its 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.729
 safety equipment plethoric them 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.330
 dynamic benefits are more 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.820
 debatable 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.470
 apart from its sound the 5 cylinders of the d5 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.420
 does not bring much more than the 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.680
 four cylinders of the d4 all the more 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.299
 when he is associated with this box 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.580
 automatic a little slow and weighing 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.170
 especially the consumptions counted more 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.860
 of a difference goal in addition to 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.630
 the manual gearbox 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.460
 So our model is wearing a 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.000
 ecological malus of 2200 euros 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.000
 pity
