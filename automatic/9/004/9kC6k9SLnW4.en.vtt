00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
Betsy Ross was first approached to do

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.109 
Betsy Ross was first approached to do
the<00:00:16.320> flag<00:00:16.619> she<00:00:17.310> always<00:00:17.460> wanted<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.910> do<00:00:18.000> this

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
the flag she always wanted to do this

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.269 
the flag she always wanted to do this
star<00:00:18.420> but<00:00:18.630> they<00:00:18.779> did<00:00:19.020> not<00:00:19.230> because<00:00:19.859> they<00:00:20.010> said

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
star but they did not because they said

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.109 
star but they did not because they said
it<00:00:20.430> would<00:00:20.550> take<00:00:20.580> too<00:00:21.119> long<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.869> cut<00:00:22.710> out<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.310> star

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
it would take too long to cut out a star

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.849 
it would take too long to cut out a star
and<00:00:24.600> they<00:00:25.199> would<00:00:25.350> have<00:00:25.470> lots<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.890> flags<00:00:26.160> made

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
and they would have lots of flags made

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.060 
and they would have lots of flags made
so<00:00:29.660> they<00:00:30.660> they<00:00:31.140> were<00:00:31.170> like<00:00:31.410> they<00:00:31.710> very

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
so they they were like they very

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:41.020 
so they they were like they very
reluctant<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.880> let<00:00:35.780> her<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:36.989> star<00:00:38.239> and<00:00:39.649> she

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
reluctant to let her to a star and she

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.520 
reluctant to let her to a star and she
said<00:00:42.030> no<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.390> really<00:00:42.570> trust<00:00:42.989> me<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.200> won't<00:00:43.290> take

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
said no it really trust me it won't take

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.110 
said no it really trust me it won't take
that<00:00:43.559> long<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.950> do<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.280> star

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
that long to do a star

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.619 
that long to do a star
they<00:00:45.660> argued<00:00:46.110> back<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.350> forth<00:00:46.770> about<00:00:47.629> how

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
they argued back and forth about how

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.549 
they argued back and forth about how
long<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:48.989> would<00:00:49.110> take<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.320> cut<00:00:49.950> up<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.370> star<00:00:51.559> and

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
long it would take to cut up a star and

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.610 
long it would take to cut up a star and
finally<00:00:53.070> she<00:00:53.309> said<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.850> them<00:00:54.090> well<00:00:54.989> if<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.379> can

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
finally she said to them well if I can

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.139 
finally she said to them well if I can
prove<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:57.649> it<00:00:58.649> just<00:00:59.309> doesn't<00:00:59.850> take

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
prove to you that it just doesn't take

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.330 
prove to you that it just doesn't take
very<00:01:00.180> long<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.600> could<00:01:00.930> cut<00:01:01.140> out<00:01:01.170> storm<00:01:01.590> one<00:01:01.890> cut

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
very long I could cut out storm one cut

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.299 
very long I could cut out storm one cut
would<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.239> let<00:01:03.390> me<00:01:03.420> do<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.110> they<00:01:05.070> said

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
would you let me do it and they said

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.370 
would you let me do it and they said
okay<00:01:05.670> if<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.939> can<00:01:06.150> cut<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> star<00:01:06.689> out<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:07.020> one

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
okay if you can cut a star out in one

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.660 
okay if you can cut a star out in one
cut<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:08.490> can<00:01:09.330> do<00:01:09.900> stars<00:01:10.320> on<00:01:10.530> our<00:01:10.560> flag<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.610> she

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
cut you can do stars on our flag so she

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.340 
cut you can do stars on our flag so she
took<00:01:11.939> out<00:01:12.150> her<00:01:12.180> scissors<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.590> she<00:01:14.310> made<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> cut

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
took out her scissors and she made a cut

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:22.700 
took out her scissors and she made a cut
and<00:01:16.460> she<00:01:17.460> opened<00:01:17.939> up<00:01:20.330> the<00:01:21.330> paper<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.869> she<00:01:22.619> had

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
and she opened up the paper and she had

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.210 
and she opened up the paper and she had
to<00:01:22.830> start<00:01:24.110> now<00:01:25.110> frankly<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.680> wastes<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.189> lot

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
to start now frankly this wastes a lot

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:35.210 
to start now frankly this wastes a lot
of<00:01:26.369> paper<00:01:27.080> so<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.110> would<00:01:28.530> only<00:01:28.680> use<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:34.220> to

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
of paper so I would only use this to to

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.210 
of paper so I would only use this to to
make<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.400> pattern<00:01:36.350> but<00:01:37.350> it's<00:01:37.500> kind<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.740> fun<00:01:37.979> it

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
make a pattern but it's kind of fun it

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.740 
make a pattern but it's kind of fun it
is<00:01:38.310> fun<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.610> do<00:01:38.759> with<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.000> kids<00:01:39.240> let<00:01:39.540> me<00:01:39.600> do

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
is fun to do with the kids let me do

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.450 
is fun to do with the kids let me do

that with you again just quick fold your
paper<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.820> half<00:01:47.810> then<00:01:48.810> fold<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.470> again<00:01:50.149> but

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
paper in half then fold it again but

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.450 
paper in half then fold it again but
unfold<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.899> right<00:01:52.470> now<00:01:52.619> what<00:01:53.009> you're<00:01:53.130> doing<00:01:53.159> is

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
you're really just making a pattern and

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.730 
you're really just making a pattern and
fold<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.070> half<00:01:56.100> again<00:01:56.930> and<00:01:57.930> undo<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.560> so

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
fold it in half again and undo it so

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.370 
fold it in half again and undo it so
that<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.189> have<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.579> X<00:02:00.180> fold<00:02:00.799> go<00:02:01.799> with<00:02:02.790> this

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
that you have this X fold go with this

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.850 
that you have this X fold go with this
fold<00:02:04.380> side<00:02:05.930> you're<00:02:06.930> going<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.350> pull<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.799> over

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
fold side you're going to pull it over

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.720 
fold side you're going to pull it over
to<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.700> halfway<00:02:11.970> mark

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:25.180 

here<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.930> then<00:02:18.770> back<00:02:19.100> on<00:02:19.340> itself<00:02:20.530> here<00:02:21.530> I<00:02:24.190> fold

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
here and then back on itself here I fold

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.330 
here and then back on itself here I fold
this<00:02:25.370> over<00:02:25.580> this<00:02:26.240> way<00:02:26.570> I'm<00:02:26.630> not<00:02:26.810> sure<00:02:26.990> how

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
this over this way I'm not sure how

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.000 
this over this way I'm not sure how
accurate<00:02:28.340> that<00:02:28.730> is<00:02:29.330> so<00:02:29.870> I<00:02:29.900> have<00:02:29.990> it<00:02:30.290> this<00:02:30.470> way

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
accurate that is so I have it this way

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.360 
accurate that is so I have it this way
okay<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:32.660> then<00:02:33.140> I<00:02:33.200> fold<00:02:33.410> it<00:02:33.560> back<00:02:33.770> so<00:02:34.160> now<00:02:34.310> I

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
okay and then I fold it back so now I

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.180 
okay and then I fold it back so now I
have<00:02:34.930> this<00:02:35.930> kind<00:02:36.260> of<00:02:36.290> koden<00:02:36.920> shape<00:02:38.890> now<00:02:39.890> from

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
have this kind of koden shape now from

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.600 
have this kind of koden shape now from
your<00:02:40.340> shortest<00:02:40.790> edge<00:02:41.350> you<00:02:42.350> want<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:42.830> and<00:02:43.160> it's

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
your shortest edge you want to and it's

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.630 
your shortest edge you want to and it's
going<00:02:43.880> to<00:02:44.030> be<00:02:44.180> skinnier<00:02:44.810> wide<00:02:45.400> depending<00:02:46.400> on

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
going to be skinnier wide depending on

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.880 
going to be skinnier wide depending on
