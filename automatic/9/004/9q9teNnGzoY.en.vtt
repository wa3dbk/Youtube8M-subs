 you have certainly seen them at the elysÃ©e 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.629
 it's the Republican Guard time 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.700
 a show 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.130
 she abandoned her primary mission of 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.559
 security and honor service related to 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.509
 protocol of the state since the first 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.529
 kings francs the Republican Guard is 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.609
 the heiress of many military corps 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.880
 we have nine centuries of history 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.529
 behind us and we are trying through 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.119
 our daily work of doing 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.449
 to continue these traditions of doing 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.710
 to continue these know-how and 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.239
 public presentations of our 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.820
 special formations serve us to 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.969
 pull up showed what's 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.410
 we are not able and we 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.829
 allow us to keep ourselves level 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.809
 expected to be able to progress further 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.000
 the Republican Guard has two 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.910
 infantry regiments and a regiment of 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.039
 cavalry at dowling arnaud belongs this 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.140
 last each show asks him a 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.300
 great moment of preparation because the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.309
 gestures must be accurate everything must 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.530
 to be checked down to the smallest detail 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.000
 I love the military side already so 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.920
 I engaged in this 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.800
 already for that and then I'm a 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.810
 passionate about shows and could go out 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.970
 to englos of a little bit both is 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.280
 a little pride also France 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.560
 what other discipline does the jump 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.990
 hurdle jean-paul filho the practice 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.180
 since his early childhood this contest him 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.100
 will perhaps qualify for 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.600
 the championships of France which will have 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.050
 place in the sleeve in August 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.729
 next 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.140
 today it was a little bit I 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.510
 a little mixed for me because I had 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.330
 a horse that an experienced had told me 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.979
 it did not go very well I have this 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.210
 young horse there who made a mistake 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.810
 in the grand prize reserved for 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.090
 professional 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.070
 so we're pretty happy for that one 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.619
 is a little bit disappointed for the other 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.720
 the horse ball once called pato in 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.720
 argentine or booth hidden in the middle east 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.860
 the game was to throw a sheep 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.759
 death today 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.110
 the animal has been replaced by a balloon this 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.539
 weekend was the opportunity to discover 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.880
 various disciplines like this dressage 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.130
 Portuguese he was borrowed from the peasants 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.860
 who used the horse to sort and 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:11.590
 gather their cattle on the 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.590
 national events
