GE<00:00:00.659> pattern<00:00:02.990> and<00:00:03.990> you<00:00:04.110> see<00:00:04.259> a<00:00:04.290> nice<00:00:04.500> nice

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
GE pattern and you see a nice nice

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.889 
GE pattern and you see a nice nice
landscape<00:00:05.790> there<00:00:05.970> that's<00:00:06.240> pretty<00:00:06.450> cool<00:00:06.660> but

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
landscape there that's pretty cool but

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.360 
landscape there that's pretty cool but
of<00:00:07.080> course<00:00:07.319> you<00:00:07.500> know<00:00:07.589> we're<00:00:07.770> developers<00:00:08.160> do

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
of course you know we're developers do

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.129 
of course you know we're developers do
we<00:00:08.460> like<00:00:08.610> things<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:08.940> little<00:00:09.059> bit<00:00:09.210> more<00:00:09.389> busy<00:00:09.540> so

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
we like things a little bit more busy so

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.379 
we like things a little bit more busy so
that's<00:00:10.260> kind<00:00:10.500> of<00:00:10.530> neat<00:00:10.710> you<00:00:10.860> can<00:00:10.889> just<00:00:11.190> sort<00:00:11.309> of

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:11.389 
that's kind of neat you can just sort of

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:14.240 
that's kind of neat you can just sort of
slide<00:00:12.389> it<00:00:12.540> over<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:12.929> do<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.200> Google<00:00:13.530> search<00:00:13.559> go

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
slide it over and do a Google search go

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.359 
slide it over and do a Google search go
back<00:00:14.460> there<00:00:14.730> as<00:00:15.660> as<00:00:16.440> tom<00:00:16.710> was<00:00:16.890> saying<00:00:17.160> we<00:00:17.340> have

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
back there as as tom was saying we have

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.450 
back there as as tom was saying we have
a<00:00:17.520> webkit-based<00:00:17.970> browser<00:00:19.100> and<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.220> will<00:00:20.369> just

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
a webkit-based browser and I will just

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.099 
a webkit-based browser and I will just
have<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.670> look<00:00:20.820> at<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.390> guess<00:00:21.840> all<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:22.080> can

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
have a look at that I guess all I can

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.240 
have a look at that I guess all I can
turn<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.619> this<00:00:22.890> way<00:00:24.170> and<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.470> know<00:00:25.590> it's<00:00:26.189> a

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
turn it this way and you know it's a

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.179 
turn it this way and you know it's a
browser<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.670> does<00:00:27.210> what<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.510> expect<00:00:28.099> find<00:00:29.099> a

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
browser that does what you expect find a

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.540 
browser that does what you expect find a
bookmark<00:00:29.609> here<00:00:29.939> what<00:00:30.179> would<00:00:30.330> be<00:00:30.449> good

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
bookmark here what would be good

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.950 
bookmark here what would be good

course<00:00:42.899> but<00:00:43.370> I've<00:00:44.370> got<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.760> on<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.910> private

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
course but I've got it on the private

look at that more Google products who

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.390 
look at that more Google products who
would<00:01:21.630> have<00:01:21.689> thought<00:01:23.000> there<00:01:24.000> we<00:01:24.119> go

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
got mass unfortunately there's no street

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.710 
got mass unfortunately there's no street
view<00:01:43.160> data<00:01:43.370> for<00:01:43.790> Lemon<00:01:44.180> so<00:01:44.300> I<00:01:44.330> could<00:01:44.540> show<00:01:44.690> you

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
view data for Lemon so I could show you

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.790 
view data for Lemon so I could show you
a<00:01:44.810> street<00:01:45.020> view<00:01:45.170> but<00:01:45.350> it<00:01:45.440> would<00:01:45.530> have<00:01:45.590> to<00:01:45.770> be

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
a street view but it would have to be

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.670 
a street view but it would have to be
like<00:01:46.130> for<00:01:46.720> Manhattan<00:01:47.720> or<00:01:47.810> something<00:01:48.200> so<00:01:48.470> there

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
like for Manhattan or something so there

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.620 
like for Manhattan or something so there
we<00:01:48.800> go<00:01:48.830> it's<00:01:49.490> got<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:49.820> device<00:01:50.060> has<00:01:50.090> a<00:01:50.270> built-in

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
we go it's got the device has a built-in

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.290 
we go it's got the device has a built-in
GPS<00:01:51.110> you<00:01:51.350> can<00:01:51.380> see<00:01:51.650> the<00:01:51.770> little<00:01:51.950> is<00:01:52.880> a<00:01:52.940> little

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
GPS you can see the little is a little

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.610 
GPS you can see the little is a little
kind<00:01:53.510> of<00:01:53.660> satellite<00:01:53.960> dish<00:01:54.290> icon<00:01:54.740> up<00:01:54.920> here<00:01:54.950> and

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
kind of satellite dish icon up here and

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.230 
kind of satellite dish icon up here and
doesn't<00:01:57.620> look<00:01:57.800> like<00:01:57.950> it's<00:01:58.130> getting<00:01:58.790> too<00:01:59.060> good

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
doesn't look like it's getting too good

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.960 
doesn't look like it's getting too good
a<00:01:59.270> signal<00:01:59.690> because<00:01:59.870> we<00:01:59.990> got<00:02:00.140> like<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.440> big

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
a signal because we got like the big

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.010 
a signal because we got like the big
sphere<00:02:01.970> of<00:02:02.270> indeterminacy<00:02:03.260> there<00:02:04.390> I<00:02:05.390> can

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
sphere of indeterminacy there I can

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.320 
sphere of indeterminacy there I can
click<00:02:06.380> on<00:02:06.560> map<00:02:06.800> mode<00:02:07.070> and<00:02:07.520> I<00:02:07.910> can<00:02:08.119> go<00:02:08.270> to

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
click on map mode and I can go to

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.910 
click on map mode and I can go to
satellite<00:02:08.869> view<00:02:11.230> we<00:02:12.230> should<00:02:12.410> be<00:02:12.530> able<00:02:12.590> to<00:02:12.770> yes

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
satellite view we should be able to yes

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.370 
satellite view we should be able to yes
I<00:02:13.040> like<00:02:13.250> you<00:02:13.430> where<00:02:13.730> we<00:02:13.880> are<00:02:17.050> so<00:02:18.050> that's<00:02:18.170> not

of<00:02:44.210> course<00:02:44.480> you<00:02:44.750> know<00:02:44.870> this<00:02:45.500> stuff<00:02:45.710> is<00:02:45.860> pretty

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
of course you know this stuff is pretty

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.800 
of course you know this stuff is pretty
cool<00:02:46.250> but<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.850> coolest<00:02:47.180> stuff<00:02:47.360> is<00:02:47.540> of<00:02:47.660> course

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
cool but the coolest stuff is of course

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.160 
cool but the coolest stuff is of course
writing<00:02:48.170> your<00:02:48.290> own<00:02:48.440> apps<00:02:48.760> so<00:02:49.760> I<00:02:50.390> spent<00:02:50.990> like<00:02:51.110> a

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
writing your own apps so I spent like a

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.590 
writing your own apps so I spent like a
couple<00:02:51.440> of<00:02:51.590> literally<00:02:52.580> just<00:02:52.760> two<00:02:52.940> hours<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:53.540> I

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
couple of literally just two hours and I

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.710 
couple of literally just two hours and I
wrote<00:02:54.050> my<00:02:54.170> own<00:02:54.200> half<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:55.390> I'll<00:02:56.390> show<00:02:56.570> it<00:02:56.690> to

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
wrote my own half and I'll show it to

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.440 
wrote my own half and I'll show it to
you<00:02:56.840> it<00:02:56.960> uses<00:02:57.380> a<00:02:57.850> technique<00:02:58.850> with<00:02:59.150> there's<00:02:59.390> a

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
you it uses a technique with there's a

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.550 
you it uses a technique with there's a
guy<00:02:59.540> in<00:02:59.570> the<00:02:59.720> audience<00:02:59.870> here<00:03:00.200> is<00:03:00.320> actually

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
guy in the audience here is actually

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.220 
guy in the audience here is actually
writing<00:03:00.950> a<00:03:01.070> book<00:03:01.250> on<00:03:01.520> Android<00:03:02.360> so<00:03:02.660> he<00:03:02.930> really

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
writing a book on Android so he really

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.470 
writing a book on Android so he really
knows<00:03:03.440> it<00:03:03.590> well<00:03:03.680> but<00:03:04.550> use<00:03:04.700> a<00:03:04.760> technique<00:03:05.210> with<00:03:05.450> a

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
knows it well but use a technique with a

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.210 
knows it well but use a technique with a

to the hardware buffers that you can

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.190 
to the hardware buffers that you can
write<00:03:13.490> to<00:03:13.520> it<00:03:13.730> so<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.209> end<00:03:14.330> result<00:03:14.480> is<00:03:14.840> you<00:03:14.870> get

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
write to it so the end result is you get

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.320 
write to it so the end result is you get

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
frame rate which is pretty cool and it's

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.280 
frame rate which is pretty cool and it's
all<00:03:20.060> in<00:03:20.209> Java<00:03:20.420> so<00:03:20.660> you<00:03:20.750> know<00:03:20.840> you<00:03:21.050> don't<00:03:21.140> have

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290

I am you know a Google engineer so of
course<00:03:59.570> you<00:03:59.810> like<00:04:00.019> my<00:04:00.170> coding<00:04:00.530> skills<00:04:00.709> you<00:04:00.890> can

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
course you like my coding skills you can

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.539 
course you like my coding skills you can
be<00:04:01.100> pretty<00:04:01.280> amazing<00:04:02.890> so<00:04:03.890> there<00:04:04.010> you<00:04:04.040> go<00:04:04.190> the

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
be pretty amazing so there you go the

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.630 
be pretty amazing so there you go the
blue<00:04:04.700> dot<00:04:04.970> application<00:04:05.840> what<00:04:06.170> do<00:04:06.230> you<00:04:06.320> think

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
blue dot application what do you think

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.340 
blue dot application what do you think
like<00:04:07.640> it<00:04:07.850> because<00:04:08.420> but<00:04:08.630> here's<00:04:08.810> the<00:04:08.900> thing<00:04:08.959> is

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
like it because but here's the thing is

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.720 
like it because but here's the thing is
that<00:04:09.380> the<00:04:09.709> other<00:04:09.830> thing<00:04:10.070> I've<00:04:10.489> actually

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
that the other thing I've actually

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:17.229 
that the other thing I've actually
hooked<00:04:11.209> into<00:04:11.420> the<00:04:11.780> to<00:04:12.650> the<00:04:12.739> accelerometer<00:04:16.239> so

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
hooked into the to the accelerometer so

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.229 
hooked into the to the accelerometer so
you<00:04:17.299> can<00:04:17.510> actually<00:04:17.540> see<00:04:18.400> it<00:04:19.400> do<00:04:19.640> that<00:04:19.700> I<00:04:20.060> can

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
you can actually see it do that I can

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.010 
you can actually see it do that I can
tilt<00:04:20.479> it<00:04:20.570> this<00:04:20.750> way

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.810 

which<00:04:24.020> is<00:04:24.170> kind<00:04:24.410> of<00:04:24.470> fun<00:04:24.680> and<00:04:24.890> a<00:04:24.950> heady<00:04:25.400> go<00:04:25.700> in

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
which is kind of fun and a heady go in

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.400 
which is kind of fun and a heady go in
this<00:04:25.880> direction<00:04:25.940> too<00:04:26.480> and<00:04:27.190> I<00:04:28.190> direction<00:04:29.410> we're

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
this direction too and I direction we're

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:36.790 
this direction too and I direction we're
back<00:04:30.620> to<00:04:30.830> 1970s<00:04:31.580> pong<00:04:32.830> look<00:04:33.830> at<00:04:33.950> that<00:04:35.800> so

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
back to 1970s pong look at that so

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.310 
back to 1970s pong look at that so
that's<00:04:36.950> kind<00:04:37.220> of<00:04:37.250> fun<00:04:37.690> but<00:04:38.690> then<00:04:38.870> you<00:04:39.080> can<00:04:39.230> use

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
that's kind of fun but then you can use

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.780 
that's kind of fun but then you can use
the<00:04:39.440> touchscreen<00:04:39.680> and<00:04:40.460> you<00:04:40.550> get<00:04:40.640> a<00:04:40.700> little

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
the touchscreen and you get a little

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.210 
the touchscreen and you get a little
bolt<00:04:41.030> of<00:04:41.180> lightning<00:04:41.540> toward<00:04:42.230> your<00:04:42.350> blue<00:04:42.500> the

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
bolt of lightning toward your blue the

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.080 
bolt of lightning toward your blue the
blue<00:04:43.430> dot<00:04:43.670> and<00:04:44.240> then<00:04:45.020> I<00:04:45.140> can<00:04:45.320> just<00:04:45.350> sort<00:04:45.650> of

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
blue dot and then I can just sort of

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.900 
blue dot and then I can just sort of
wizard<00:04:47.090> around<00:04:47.240> like<00:04:47.450> that<00:04:48.430> and<00:04:49.430> so<00:04:49.760> when<00:04:49.850> I

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
wizard around like that and so when I

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:50.980 
wizard around like that and so when I
was<00:04:50.030> counting<00:04:50.150> the<00:04:50.330> frame<00:04:50.570> rate<00:04:50.780> I<00:04:50.810> was

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
was counting the frame rate I was

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.750 
was counting the frame rate I was
actually<00:04:51.140> getting<00:04:51.410> like<00:04:51.710> up<00:04:51.860> to<00:04:52.040> 40<00:04:52.430> frames<00:04:52.580> a

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
actually getting like up to 40 frames a

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.660 
actually getting like up to 40 frames a
second<00:04:53.150> on<00:04:53.210> this<00:04:53.330> guy<00:04:53.510> it's<00:04:53.900> just<00:04:54.020> fun<00:04:54.640> so<00:04:55.640> yeah

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
second on this guy it's just fun so yeah

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.910 
second on this guy it's just fun so yeah
actually<00:04:56.360> there's<00:04:56.660> only<00:04:56.810> about<00:04:57.020> it<00:04:57.410> you<00:04:57.830> know

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
actually there's only about it you know

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.380 
actually there's only about it you know
it's<00:04:58.070> only<00:04:58.250> a<00:04:58.280> few<00:04:58.490> minutes<00:04:58.760> to<00:04:58.910> get<00:04:59.030> the

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
it's only a few minutes to get the

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.000 
it's only a few minutes to get the
basics<00:04:59.840> of<00:04:59.960> the<00:05:00.020> code<00:05:00.230> for<00:05:00.440> this<00:05:00.560> and<00:05:00.800> the<00:05:00.860> rest

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
basics of the code for this and the rest

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.310 
basics of the code for this and the rest
of<00:05:01.130> the<00:05:01.190> time<00:05:01.370> was<00:05:01.580> me<00:05:01.760> getting<00:05:02.720> the<00:05:02.900> physics

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
of the time was me getting the physics

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.160 
of the time was me getting the physics
just<00:05:03.380> right<00:05:03.740> so<00:05:04.040> that<00:05:04.070> it<00:05:04.580> looked<00:05:04.790> ok<00:05:05.170> so

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
just right so that it looked ok so

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.090 
just right so that it looked ok so
that's<00:05:06.560> the<00:05:06.710> blue<00:05:06.890> dot<00:05:07.130> thank<00:05:07.880> you
