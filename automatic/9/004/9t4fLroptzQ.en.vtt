00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.879
 in the third and last episode of ours 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.520
 beginner jumping hour becomes 3 tv trainer 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:19.400
 hans willi weber his pupil one 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.170
 special task 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.330
 after overcoming individual jumps 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.430
 his pupil was to be mastered 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.619
 now several obstacles in a row 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.640
 overcome 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.320
 Today, if we even try 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.660
 small ones at the end of the hour 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.829
 small mini course to jump the 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.030
 is the name of the two jumps we already have 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.579
 We started with that and then 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.800
 then try a follow with 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.340
 two jumps a direct one 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.400
 Thus, connection is successively 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.510
 Overcoming several obstacles 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.480
 one after another begs the beginner 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.770
 some off after the obstacle means 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.440
 now again before the next 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.450
 obstacle the rider must follow a horse 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.890
 have the jump back to the helpers around 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.170
 it in a controlled and 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.750
 steady pace to the next 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.210
 prepare for the jump and just do it 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.070
 and in the middle of the ride 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.750
 I think that is important in one 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.850
 riding lesson no matter what level he 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.890
 So now in what amount you have indeed 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.720
 a goal but if you notice 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.060
 will not reach this goal today 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.340
 Maybe you have to do it again 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.080
 switch back to horse and rider 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.610
 to give security and that when 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.610
 Next time, then go on again 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:36.080
 very concentrated middle jump 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:41.570
 Keeping connection very good 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:43.430
 very good so super easy the okay 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.740
 distances between the jumps are from 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.050
 trainer extra long laid out so that 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.060
 His student has had enough time 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.080
 the jumps to the next task 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.360
 focus 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.280
 something should not fit 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.119
 wanted or ridden a circle 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.319
 to gather again 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.599
 that is already a small one 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:04.130
 exercise by several jumps 

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:05.390
 to do one after another and just once 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.450
 a gallop will change hands 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.450
 and the jump again lined up 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.810
 stay calm 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.689
 but absorb very well like you can with 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:27.689
 the sport 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:41.340
 get back home quietly 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.340
 brings country report very well 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.540
 456 bda better is not about about 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.540
 gallop 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.740
 goal of the hour reached 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.910
 have a successful conclusion and a good one 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.600
 basis for the coming 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.600
 training sessions
