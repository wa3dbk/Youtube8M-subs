00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
but in this game you chew through all

but in this game you chew through all
our<00:01:33.810> ammo<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.500> quickly<00:01:34.970> so<00:01:35.970> really<00:01:36.180> nice<00:01:36.360> and

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
without arms the whole time

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.020 
without arms the whole time
so<00:02:03.190> yeah<00:02:03.850> if<00:02:04.510> you<00:02:04.930> die<00:02:05.890> hard<00:02:06.190> trying<00:02:06.820> to<00:02:06.850> run

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
so yeah if you die hard trying to run

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.780 
so yeah if you die hard trying to run
this<00:02:07.150> tabletop<00:02:07.600> style<00:02:08.080> yeah<00:02:09.070> run<00:02:09.369> it<00:02:09.520> as<00:02:09.730> a

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
this tabletop style yeah run it as a

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.400 
this tabletop style yeah run it as a
support<00:02:10.240> Mac<00:02:10.390> do<00:02:10.630> not<00:02:10.780> try<00:02:10.990> to<00:02:11.020> go<00:02:11.200> toe-to-toe

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
support Mac do not try to go toe-to-toe

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.600 
support Mac do not try to go toe-to-toe
with<00:02:11.680> any<00:02:12.190> of<00:02:13.140> heavies<00:02:14.140> or<00:02:14.410> assaults<00:02:14.860> it<00:02:15.400> won't

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
with any of heavies or assaults it won't

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.820 
with any of heavies or assaults it won't
happen<00:02:15.730> well<00:02:16.230> that's<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.350> be<00:02:17.440> honest<00:02:17.680> I<00:02:17.770> think

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
happen well that's a be honest I think

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.710 
happen well that's a be honest I think
you'd<00:02:18.040> struggle<00:02:18.250> against<00:02:18.730> even<00:02:19.420> some<00:02:19.570> of<00:02:19.660> the

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
you'd struggle against even some of the

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.530 
you'd struggle against even some of the
higher<00:02:19.900> level<00:02:20.170> mediums<00:02:20.890> out<00:02:21.070> there<00:02:21.310> even<00:02:22.240> in<00:02:22.510> a

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
higher level mediums out there even in a

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.270 
higher level mediums out there even in a
sphere<00:02:22.810> ones<00:02:23.020> because<00:02:23.380> it's<00:02:23.590> just<00:02:23.860> that<00:02:24.130> the

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
sphere ones because it's just that the

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.790 
sphere ones because it's just that the
Mac<00:02:24.430> doesn't<00:02:24.790> got<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.030> heat<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:26.320> heat<00:02:26.470> sinks

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
Mac doesn't got the heat the heat sinks

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.130 
Mac doesn't got the heat the heat sinks
handled<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.550> amount<00:02:27.790> that's<00:02:27.940> generated<00:02:28.540> you

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
handled the amount that's generated you

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.690 
handled the amount that's generated you
pretty<00:02:29.440> much<00:02:29.530> have<00:02:29.800> to<00:02:29.830> fire<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.520> large

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
pretty much have to fire the large

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.930 
pretty much have to fire the large
pulses<00:02:31.150> in<00:02:31.270> single<00:02:31.660> or<00:02:31.840> chamber<00:02:32.940> hookahs

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
pulses in single or chamber hookahs

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.890 
pulses in single or chamber hookahs
firing<00:02:34.210> them<00:02:34.330> together<00:02:34.450> is<00:02:34.780> just<00:02:34.810> too<00:02:35.140> hot<00:02:36.900> so

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
firing them together is just too hot so

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.920 
firing them together is just too hot so
yeah<00:02:38.410> it's<00:02:38.650> very<00:02:38.740> hot<00:02:39.130> but<00:02:39.640> it<00:02:40.060> can<00:02:40.360> do<00:02:40.570> a<00:02:40.600> lot

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
yeah it's very hot but it can do a lot

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.050 
yeah it's very hot but it can do a lot
of<00:02:40.960> damage<00:02:41.350> and<00:02:41.530> when<00:02:41.710> used<00:02:42.010> correctly<00:02:42.310> it's

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
of damage and when used correctly it's

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.900 
of damage and when used correctly it's
quite<00:02:43.510> effective<00:02:43.600> and<00:02:44.260> I<00:02:44.320> think<00:02:44.950> this<00:02:45.070> kind<00:02:45.760> of

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
quite effective and I think this kind of

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.730 
quite effective and I think this kind of
highlights<00:02:46.270> pretty<00:02:46.630> much<00:02:46.780> its<00:02:47.230> role<00:02:47.500> in<00:02:47.680> a

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
highlights pretty much its role in a

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.120 
highlights pretty much its role in a
nutshell<00:02:48.930> majority<00:02:49.930> this<00:02:50.020> much<00:02:50.230> is<00:02:50.500> pretty

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
nutshell majority this much is pretty

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.070 
nutshell majority this much is pretty
much<00:02:51.310> just<00:02:51.520> me<00:02:51.670> stood<00:02:52.030> up<00:02:52.120> by<00:02:52.270> this<00:02:52.450> point<00:02:52.750> and

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
much just me stood up by this point and

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.720 
much just me stood up by this point and
they<00:02:53.380> just<00:02:53.590> wandering<00:02:54.130> into<00:02:54.280> my<00:02:54.370> line<00:02:54.580> of<00:02:54.610> fire

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
they just wandering into my line of fire

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.010 
they just wandering into my line of fire
and<00:02:55.060> I<00:02:55.090> just<00:02:55.300> keep<00:02:55.420> hitting<00:02:55.600> them<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:55.900> hitting

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
and I just keep hitting them and hitting

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.510 
and I just keep hitting them and hitting
with<00:02:56.170> it<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:59.470> it's<00:02:59.710> this<00:02:59.980> isn't<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.340> most

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
with it so it's this isn't the most

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.449 
with it so it's this isn't the most
eventful<00:03:00.790> match<00:03:01.000> but<00:03:01.270> it's<00:03:01.390> definitely<00:03:02.140> I

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
eventful match but it's definitely I

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.470 
eventful match but it's definitely I
think<00:03:03.459> a<00:03:03.520> good<00:03:03.640> example<00:03:03.760> just<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:04.209> show<00:03:04.420> you

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
think a good example just to show you

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.190 
think a good example just to show you
that<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.959> heat<00:03:05.470> issues<00:03:05.800> that<00:03:05.920> can<00:03:06.070> have<00:03:07.200> so

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
that the heat issues that can have so

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.460 
that the heat issues that can have so
it's<00:03:08.380> range<00:03:08.620> damage<00:03:08.890> potential<00:03:09.550> I<00:03:10.140> do<00:03:11.140> have<00:03:11.350> to

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
it's range damage potential I do have to

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.990 
it's range damage potential I do have to
apologize<00:03:11.530> it's<00:03:12.010> obviously<00:03:12.400> a<00:03:12.489> night<00:03:12.670> vision

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
apologize it's obviously a night vision

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.130 
apologize it's obviously a night vision
ball<00:03:13.180> 59<00:03:14.110> to<00:03:14.470> do<00:03:14.650> I<00:03:15.420> did<00:03:16.420> try<00:03:16.570> to<00:03:16.600> get<00:03:16.840> several

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
ball 59 to do I did try to get several

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.530 
ball 59 to do I did try to get several
recordings<00:03:17.590> of<00:03:17.709> this<00:03:17.830> this<00:03:18.070> was<00:03:18.340> probably<00:03:19.209> the

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
recordings of this this was probably the

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.030 
recordings of this this was probably the
best<00:03:19.660> one<00:03:19.930> I<00:03:19.959> think<00:03:20.080> that<00:03:20.380> emphasize<00:03:20.830> that

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
best one I think that emphasize that

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.830 
best one I think that emphasize that
it's<00:03:21.190> rolled<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:21.850> best<00:03:22.060> there's<00:03:22.390> also<00:03:22.630> on<00:03:22.750> the

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
it's rolled the best there's also on the

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.740 
it's rolled the best there's also on the
ones<00:03:23.020> were<00:03:23.140> believe<00:03:24.100> I<00:03:24.160> gotta<00:03:24.340> kill<00:03:24.640> her<00:03:25.450> heart

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
ones were believe I gotta kill her heart

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.690 
ones were believe I gotta kill her heart
I'm<00:03:25.930> gonna<00:03:26.020> kill<00:03:26.350> with<00:03:26.739> this<00:03:26.920> Mac<00:03:27.130> although<00:03:27.670> I

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
I'm gonna kill with this Mac although I

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.220 
I'm gonna kill with this Mac although I
do<00:03:28.270> really<00:03:28.480> like<00:03:28.720> it<00:03:28.989> so<00:03:29.580> I<00:03:30.580> might<00:03:31.570> dislike<00:03:31.959> I

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
do really like it so I might dislike I

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.920 
do really like it so I might dislike I
think<00:03:32.890> it's<00:03:33.450> probably<00:03:34.450> one<00:03:34.780> of<00:03:34.810> the

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
think it's probably one of the

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:43.820 
think it's probably one of the
best-looking<00:03:35.230> climax<00:03:36.780> game

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.309 

but<00:03:44.830> yeah<00:03:45.540> anyone<00:03:46.540> who's<00:03:46.750> seen<00:03:46.930> the<00:03:47.019> original

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
but yeah anyone who's seen the original

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.140 
but yeah anyone who's seen the original
cartoon<00:03:47.530> this<00:03:47.950> would<00:03:48.190> have<00:03:48.280> been<00:03:48.489> one<00:03:48.790> of<00:03:48.940> the

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
cartoon this would have been one of the

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.890 
cartoon this would have been one of the
eight<00:03:49.950> bad<00:03:50.950> guy<00:03:51.190> clan<00:03:51.610> thanks<00:03:51.970> sir<00:03:52.120> I<00:03:52.330> wasn't<00:03:52.720> a

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
eight bad guy clan thanks sir I wasn't a

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.930 
eight bad guy clan thanks sir I wasn't a
star<00:03:53.349> kept<00:03:53.620> interest<00:03:53.980> in<00:03:54.190> Redmon's<00:03:54.610> she<00:03:54.819> was

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
star kept interest in Redmon's she was

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.460 
star kept interest in Redmon's she was
always<00:03:55.620> rollin<00:03:56.620> in<00:03:56.739> a<00:03:56.800> vulture<00:03:58.019> and<00:03:59.019> I<00:03:59.170> think

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
always rollin in a vulture and I think

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.809 
always rollin in a vulture and I think
this<00:03:59.560> is<00:03:59.680> where<00:03:59.830> my<00:03:59.950> original<00:04:00.069> saw<00:04:00.550> flavor

this is where my original saw flavor

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.540 
this is where my original saw flavor
them<00:04:01.120> because<00:04:01.989> the<00:04:02.349> cartoon<00:04:02.739> the<00:04:02.860> same<00:04:03.099> before
