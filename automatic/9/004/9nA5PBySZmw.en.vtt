00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
it hasn't changed it's just a really

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.760

normally<00:02:04.740> but<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.100> outlet<00:02:05.460> i<00:02:05.549> think<00:02:05.790> it's

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
normally but the outlet i think it's

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.990 
normally but the outlet i think it's
slightly<00:02:07.110> discounted<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.280> if<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.580> buy<00:02:08.759> like

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
slightly discounted so if you buy like

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.249 
slightly discounted so if you buy like
four<00:02:09.300> items<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:09.899> get

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259
