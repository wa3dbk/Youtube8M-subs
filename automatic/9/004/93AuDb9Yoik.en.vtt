again the layout is five bolts not every
Mercedes<00:02:35.469> car<00:02:35.739> is<00:02:35.889> the<00:02:36.010> same<00:02:36.280> but<00:02:37.180> basically

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
Mercedes car is the same but basically

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.270 
Mercedes car is the same but basically
they<00:02:38.379> usually<00:02:38.620> use<00:02:38.950> a<00:02:38.980> teets<00:02:39.310> t20<00:02:40.269> Torx<00:02:41.280> so

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
they usually use a teets t20 Torx so

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.520 
they usually use a teets t20 Torx so
here<00:02:42.609> is<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.909> blower<00:02:43.150> motor<00:02:43.420> is<00:02:43.930> held<00:02:44.170> in<00:02:44.349> with

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
here is the blower motor is held in with

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.409 
here is the blower motor is held in with
four<00:02:44.799> screws<00:02:45.569> and<00:02:47.639> this<00:02:48.639> is<00:02:48.819> the<00:02:48.970> regulator

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:49.419 
four screws and this is the regulator

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.140 
four screws and this is the regulator
the<00:02:50.349> regulator<00:02:50.769> is<00:02:50.889> basically<00:02:51.340> what<00:02:51.700> controls

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
the regulator is basically what controls

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.869 
the regulator is basically what controls
the<00:02:52.329> power<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:53.159> control<00:02:54.159> the<00:02:54.310> speed<00:02:54.579> of<00:02:54.760> the

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
the power and control the speed of the

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:59.039 
the power and control the speed of the
water<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.970> here<00:02:58.180> I'm<00:02:58.299> going<00:02:58.480> to<00:02:58.540> remove<00:02:58.810> the

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
water so here I'm going to remove the

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:15.350 
water so here I'm going to remove the
four<00:02:59.260> bolts<00:02:59.500> to<00:03:00.040> get<00:03:00.219> the<00:03:00.340> blower<00:03:00.549> motor<00:03:00.879> out

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.510 

as<00:03:15.960> you<00:03:16.110> can<00:03:16.290> see<00:03:16.440> is<00:03:16.590> pretty<00:03:16.800> hard<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.190> get<00:03:17.310> to

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
as you can see is pretty hard to get to

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.230 
as you can see is pretty hard to get to
these<00:03:17.670> bolts<00:03:18.560> we<00:03:19.560> had<00:03:19.800> to<00:03:19.920> really<00:03:20.220> get<00:03:21.120> the

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
these bolts we had to really get the

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.860 
these bolts we had to really get the
camera<00:03:21.600> in<00:03:21.630> these<00:03:21.810> tight<00:03:22.110> little<00:03:23.540> spots<00:03:24.540> to

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
camera in these tight little spots to

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:33.150 
camera in these tight little spots to
get<00:03:25.050> the<00:03:25.170> good<00:03:25.350> footage

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.250 

all<00:03:33.640> right<00:03:33.760> so<00:03:33.940> I<00:03:33.970> finally<00:03:34.300> get<00:03:34.570> the<00:03:34.750> last<00:03:34.930> bolt

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
all right so I finally get the last bolt

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.530 
all right so I finally get the last bolt
loose<00:03:36.390> now<00:03:37.390> I<00:03:37.420> can<00:03:37.690> remove<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.110> regulator<00:03:39.540> I'm

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
loose now I can remove the regulator I'm

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.060 
loose now I can remove the regulator I'm
going<00:03:40.720> to<00:03:40.780> show<00:03:40.960> you<00:03:41.020> inside<00:03:41.320> what<00:03:41.800> it<00:03:41.890> looks

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
here this is the one going from the

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.740 
here this is the one going from the
regulator<00:04:36.240> to<00:04:36.570> the<00:04:36.690> blower<00:04:37.320> itself<00:04:37.860> and<00:04:38.750> then

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
regulator to the blower itself and then

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.420 
regulator to the blower itself and then
there's<00:04:39.990> if<00:04:40.350> you<00:04:40.500> look<00:04:40.680> there<00:04:40.920> there's<00:04:41.130> two

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
there's if you look there there's two

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.790 
there's if you look there there's two

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
t20 screws on the on the side just

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.890 
t20 screws on the on the side just
remove<00:04:47.100> those<00:04:47.310> and<00:04:47.610> that<00:04:48.120> pretty<00:04:48.390> much<00:04:48.480> frees

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
remove those and that pretty much frees

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.500 
remove those and that pretty much frees
up<00:04:49.080> your<00:04:49.110> regulator<00:04:49.640> and<00:04:50.640> you'll<00:04:50.790> be<00:04:50.910> able<00:04:51.090> to
