00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.590
 if all goes well i see 14 video and 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.170
 I want to go out with a pain I had 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.160
 really a great plan and that plan I'm going 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.199
 show you now 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.890
 it is it is this team goes for itself 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.360
 speak to we start with is citigo 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.770
 bit pretty standard keeper i think 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.989
 you know who is in the centrixx 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.000
 that is of course tiago soba 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.000
 with 80 ps you can never go wrong he is 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.640
 a cupboard of course to this is mine 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.680
 first old club fit I have and 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.329
 single player 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.039
 my last 1014 video i wanted with one 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.449
 bang out and I thought yes then I have to 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.020
 also do it well 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.850
 right back is then and dani alves yes with 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.770
 I drove a lot more 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.120
 m just well you know the uncertain 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.670
 lucent airbag 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.150
 then we have the judges internet and 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.770
 that is plasma to the high high were 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.840
 great and really just really not me and me 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.700
 think it's really nice 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.740
 then how else centimeters why should 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.030
 a you i try it so cool 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.040
 but I never succeed 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.729
 The left back is I think a 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.080
 Fabio is coentrao and then usual 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.060
 we go by call we really go there 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.340
 track is a logical left finally 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.170
 and that is pedro which of course is a super 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.100
 link with the dani alves 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.750
 and now it will be really nice guys 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.290
 starting with the core i have nobody 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.979
 less than so happy that I can say this 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.369
 then let honor bring which all day i'm 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.290
 slim i'm so happy alec me so shakes 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.210
 I was with those long shots 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.810
 according to the famous 90-year- old fighter 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.350
 skills 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.119
 pretty much how different it is left 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.780
 cristiano ronaldo 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.840
 oh and 6 with 725 wheel was the cheap till 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.390
 the market on it is nice on that farmers too 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.380
 crack your tent if you think me 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.810
 be done 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.890
 oh no i have leonel for you and 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.899
 see you have 3 head size 948 million 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.730
 Paid for this man it will be worth it 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.370
 said i have no idea where this is it 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.550
 team with which I am going to close fifa 14 and 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.470
 it looks really nice 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.150
 I am curious how it works and yes 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.430
 you go without winning 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.620
 and you guessed it all this team was real 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.599
 insane it incredible 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.550
 I played Feyenoord not really there 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.349
 a problem and if I am a pro amber 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.430
 suggests that even though I think learning 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.959
 om messy 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.700
 and then I think a lot of people or 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.310
 say no we are used to someone 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.590
 on someone who was headline mission 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.790
 really great in joining soccer she would 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.620
 expect 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.150
 oddly full that slomer when 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.920
 not just running was what we are now 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.239
 the ball our feet 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.190
 but the ripping lansing went on 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.690
 sprint think that much faster than people 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.860
 not the ball first so that is 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.540
 maybe a bit strange and something true 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.709
 you have to pay attention and if i have to 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.739
 saying that of course hits him mine 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.330
 first used this year 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:04.720
 unbelievable was really amazing that 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.489
 man and besides you could be the hard one 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.870
 something to say more than as moutinho too 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.250
 have a nice surprise to you 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.329
 this might be able to see a string 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.920
 yesterday 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:14.140
 rory you go to the well of course you know 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.480
 just five of us were going to make it too 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.950
 it is so I get used to it a bit 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.680
 a lot of people are your best way 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.450
 the striker misses on cam or something but you him 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.060
 find and get pussy do this and this 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.680
 moutinho is great and you want that 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.750
 great duo themselves because they are all kinds of hi 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.700
 hi then hurry we can say 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.450
 danio it really has a sick shot 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.010
 do it 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.079
 ws then once that tree with a war 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.579
 and the can shoot then I can 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.030
 unbelievable should be your example sauce 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.130
 look 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.269
 I now get a corner 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.160
 knocked out 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.980
 on the port or on your hen Jews dream 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.470
 tight at the intersection that he does and 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.970
 that is the beauty of intimate every line 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.769
 is solid 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.000
 no rework already in the back 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.049
 maybe not ideal as i seen 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.299
 david luiz 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:57.190
 and of course the opta that remains but syri 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.709
 brother really was this time just a really 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.900
 damn mike I've always said so 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.430
 many people I don't like to use 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.889
 because under one of the reasons were for 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.019
 it really but he really was a god suit 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:10.269
 so many shots 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.739
 that i really thought this is ridiculous we 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.579
 naturally does not know a better one 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.830
 Map 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:17.549

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.289

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:23.490
 stars if you can and just make the 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:25.319
 team name might be a nice variation 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.449

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:29.370
