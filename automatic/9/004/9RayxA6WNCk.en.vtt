00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.160
 seeing every time lapse a 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.109
 new nightmare 'animatronic one can 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.809
 think that this was a game 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.380
 that maybe he has turned away from history 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.859
 and this could be a nightmare but if 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.380
 this one was who would have it now 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.449
 I will show characters from this story 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.449
 who can have that terrifying dream 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.880
 probably the least credible and 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.790
 that these died but it came to me 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.040
 mind since maybe they dream that 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.010
 because they were traumatized by the 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.590
 animatronics and in the dream they imagine 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.110
 very scary more than normal whose 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.379
 goal of the animatronics be 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.040
 seize the soul of the child who has 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.040
 that nightmare 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.100
 this is one of the most possible and the 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.309
 reason why the purple man or 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.799
 sprint up had this nightmare would be 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.880
 maybe because he spends a lot thinking about 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.060
 what he had done 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.820
 perhaps provoke this with which in your 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.399
 mind do not imagine very horrible whose 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.460
 goal of the animatronics would be 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:21.409
 revenge on the one who murdered them 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.409
 it was the purple man 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.400
 I think in my opinion that this could be 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.490
 one of those that have more logic and now 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.340
 I tell them why good at the end of 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.260
 first two games leave a few checks and 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.500
 we can notice that this is a job 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.380
 passenger is to say that they did it just for 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.500
 get the money and then leave in 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.450
 the 3 was an experience and in the end it comes out 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.390
 the fire but you can say that 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.240
 After that experience I no longer wanted 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.160
 be there because of what I had seen so 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.289
 knowing that everyone went after 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.600
 the five nights they sleep 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.970
 they had the nightmare whose 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.729
 appearance of the animatronics I 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.739
 imagine in a terrifying way and everything 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.690
 that's what happened to him in his work in 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:14.310
 the first two games and in the 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.310
 experience in the third 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.940
 In my opinion, this is what I 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.030
 I consider more credible of all the listing 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.510
 and if I have a lot to base myself on this 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.360
 theory 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.910
 to start we know that the bite was 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.520
 in the day so we can assume that 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.010
 this person saw from time to time the 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.959
 animatronics when they did their routine in 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.390
 the day and being bitten by a 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:44.300
 animatronic or he was traumatized by the 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.640
 event that came to him and 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.490
 that we can say that I do not work much 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.130
 that in one night he had the nightmare where 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.010
 his mind saw them in a more 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.020
 terrifying of the normal where I dreamed that 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.800
 he watched them so that these 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:04.280
 animatronics will not attack her so 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.160
 lose your life so tell me which one to 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.620
