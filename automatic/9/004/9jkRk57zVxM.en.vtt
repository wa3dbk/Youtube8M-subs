00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.049
 tip it's a real bmw 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.239
 yes art will say that states a bmw 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.919
 logo on so that will be one 

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:22.140
 a few months ago I drove the 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:23.939
 328 that gt 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.220
 and I was surprised at that moment 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.619
 that behind the nameplate 328 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.890
 a four-cylinder two liter turbo 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.059
 here we are dealing with the new one 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.300
 435 hrs 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.910
 and moment there is 35 behind the series name 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.040
 follows then there is actually now 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.330
 great six-cylinder in-line engine 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.330
 under that flat hood 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.990
 now is the news of this car 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.750
 of course not in the fine 6 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:59.600
 cylinder with a capacity of 306 hp 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.360
 no the news is in that coupé line 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.170
 Well News BMW has decided to 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.660
 type 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.590
 especially in the program what else 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.570
 to rank 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.060
 That means when we talk we are BMW 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.120
 from now on a coupé and cabrio 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.740
 then it has an even number 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.050
 and while the normal models the in 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.960
 series 3 series 5 and 7 series 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:24.440
 just keep a fixed names 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.560
 the successor to the 3-series coupé is the 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.240
 four new series and there are coupe 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.510
 and come soon also a convertible 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.510
 pain 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.850
 the 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.250
 the 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.380
 it is customary at bmw that there 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.270
 new model series is being phased 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.820
 released therefore we know the new 3 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.580
 series sedan and touring already the only one 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.360
 time and logically follows the new one 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.820
 coupé 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.979
 and bmw has decided that 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.100
 rename the car 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.640
 but a basic chassis suspension 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.540
 engine technology 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.420
 an important part of 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.239
 interior design is the 4 series 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.130
 exactly the same as the 3 series we see 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.000
 it among other things at the front with the 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.060
 grill 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.880
 the headlights that now meet 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.840
 the roof line yes that is typically a 3 series 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.390
 coupé 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.900
 in that the car is no different than being 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.900
 predecessor 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.069
 good 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:04.000
 by various technical elements 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.709
 put bmw with that 435 not a character 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.530
 but the driver can get out 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.250
 all kinds of characters q they can prefer 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.930
 for instance 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.939
 manual switching with the flippers 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.280
 behind the wheel automatically 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:16.870
 switch or the gearbox in the 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.549
 we also have sports mode 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.750
 of course the button that we use 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.700
 a copro 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.260
 up to and including sports plus all sorts of things 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.109
 can set up making it 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:31.090
 switching behavior changes the control 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:33.310
 reactions on the gas pedal therefore to www 435 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.079
 yes that does not actually exist 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.790
 also has this car in the drive 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.530
 four wheel drive 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.180
 yes and if you go through one all in this 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.780
 time of year, winter tires 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.730
 put 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.760
 yes it must go really crazy 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.829
 does not want that car trouble-free 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.970
 follow the route that your parents took with 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.970
 have used the wheel 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.010
 I am a big fan of the 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.300
 six-cylinder engines but with the modern 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.530
 two liter turbo 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:19.150
 you actually get some performance from pw 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.890
 same values ​​so it only goes 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.370
 but for the sound and what is it 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.680
 Unfortunately 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.020
 the moment you calm down with 100 2030 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.660
 driving on the highway is about six will 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.560
 we are as quiet as a turbo so is the 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.880
 added value 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.530
 yes doubtful but the enthusiast 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:39.010
 always two extra cylinders now 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:41.070
 know how to appreciate and I will continue to do so 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.070
 to do
