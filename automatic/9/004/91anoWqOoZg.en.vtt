00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
and on the bench we can take a t15 Torx

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.090 
and on the bench we can take a t15 Torx
bit<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:28.050> we're<00:02:28.200> going<00:02:28.320> to<00:02:28.350> remove<00:02:28.650> all<00:02:28.980> the

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
inside also can use a air compressor and

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.090 
inside also can use a air compressor and
just<00:04:22.389> blow<00:04:22.630> out<00:04:22.660> the<00:04:22.990> inside<00:04:23.350> there<00:04:23.620> and<00:04:23.949> you

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.879 
just blow out the inside there and you
just<00:04:24.310> use<00:04:24.430> a<00:04:24.460> flat<00:04:24.699> edge<00:04:25.030> to<00:04:25.240> pry<00:04:25.690> this<00:04:25.889> little

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
just use a flat edge to pry this little

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.670 
just use a flat edge to pry this little
gear<00:04:27.130> off<00:04:27.340> here<00:04:27.669> so<00:04:28.270> we'll<00:04:28.389> take<00:04:28.570> this<00:04:28.750> new<00:04:29.050> or

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
gear off here so we'll take this new or

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.980 
gear off here so we'll take this new or
gear<00:04:30.039> right<00:04:30.190> here<00:04:30.220> and<00:04:30.520> put<00:04:31.419> it<00:04:31.510> on<00:04:31.600> this<00:04:31.720> motor

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.590 
gear right here and put it on this motor
and<00:04:32.199> it<00:04:32.260> may<00:04:32.350> take<00:04:32.560> a<00:04:32.620> little<00:04:32.860> bit<00:04:32.979> of<00:04:33.100> effort

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
and it may take a little bit of effort

between<00:04:43.210> the<00:04:43.479> motor<00:04:43.690> and<00:04:43.840> the<00:04:44.050> gear<00:04:44.320> there<00:04:45.150> it

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
between the motor and the gear there it

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.740 
between the motor and the gear there it
should<00:04:46.449> be<00:04:46.600> good<00:04:46.870> take<00:04:47.560> this<00:04:47.680> other<00:04:47.830> gear<00:04:48.160> here

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750

be<00:04:53.199> able<00:04:53.320> to<00:04:53.380> mess<00:04:53.590> this<00:04:53.740> up<00:04:53.949> so<00:04:54.160> don't<00:04:54.250> worry

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
be able to mess this up so don't worry

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.090 
be able to mess this up so don't worry
but<00:04:54.789> just<00:04:55.780> push<00:04:55.990> it<00:04:56.110> all<00:04:56.289> the<00:04:56.320> way<00:04:56.470> down<00:04:56.560> make

itself<00:05:04.180> and<00:05:04.389> then<00:05:04.780> to<00:05:04.900> make<00:05:05.050> sure<00:05:05.199> that<00:05:05.380> it's

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
itself and then to make sure that it's

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.200 
itself and then to make sure that it's
in<00:05:05.770> there<00:05:05.949> all<00:05:06.100> the<00:05:06.280> way<00:05:06.430> you<00:05:06.490> can<00:05:06.789> even<00:05:06.940> just

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
in there all the way you can even just

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.580 
in there all the way you can even just
spin<00:05:07.539> it<00:05:07.660> just<00:05:07.810> a<00:05:07.900> little<00:05:08.020> bit<00:05:08.169> to<00:05:08.410> make<00:05:08.530> sure

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
spin it just a little bit to make sure

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.700 
spin it just a little bit to make sure
it's<00:05:08.949> working<00:05:09.160> and<00:05:10.050> then<00:05:11.050> we'll<00:05:11.349> just<00:05:11.500> take

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
it's working and then we'll just take

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.570 
it's working and then we'll just take
this<00:05:11.979> motor<00:05:12.449> put<00:05:13.449> this<00:05:13.570> back<00:05:13.840> in<00:05:14.080> here<00:05:14.580> I'm
