00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.370 
if I was use a small mode I probably use
like<00:02:47.070> a<00:02:47.660> popsicle<00:02:48.660> stickers<00:02:49.050> my<00:02:49.170> debt<00:02:49.350> and

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
like a popsicle stickers my debt and

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.410 
like a popsicle stickers my debt and
kind<00:02:49.770> of<00:02:49.860> put<00:02:50.430> it<00:02:50.520> on<00:02:50.610> there<00:02:50.820> so<00:02:51.120> I<00:02:51.150> wouldn't

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
kind of put it on there so I wouldn't

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.580 
kind of put it on there so I wouldn't
cross<00:02:51.660> contaminate<00:02:52.200> but<00:02:52.350> I'll<00:02:52.440> probably

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
cross contaminate but I'll probably

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.950 
cross contaminate but I'll probably
using<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:52.920> whole<00:02:53.040> tube<00:02:53.220> today<00:02:53.460> on<00:02:53.550> Tad's<00:02:53.790> back
