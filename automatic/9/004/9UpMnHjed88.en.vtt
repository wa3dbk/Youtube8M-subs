the<00:00:42.550> future<00:00:42.789> of<00:00:42.910> animal<00:00:43.360> rights<00:00:43.539> and<00:00:43.750> how<00:00:43.809> are

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
the future of animal rights and how are

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.200 
the future of animal rights and how are
we<00:00:43.930> going<00:00:44.050> to<00:00:44.170> get<00:00:44.289> there<00:00:44.530> I<00:00:44.820> think<00:00:45.820> the<00:00:45.940> future

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
we going to get there I think the future

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.660 
we going to get there I think the future
of<00:00:46.239> animal<00:00:46.600> rights<00:00:46.750> is<00:00:46.899> veganism<00:00:47.289> I<00:00:47.670> firmly

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
of animal rights is veganism I firmly

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.310 
of animal rights is veganism I firmly
believe<00:00:49.120> that<00:00:49.149> we're<00:00:49.539> never<00:00:49.780> going<00:00:50.109> to<00:00:50.230> have

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
believe that we're never going to have

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.099 
believe that we're never going to have
any<00:00:50.829> changes<00:00:51.489> until<00:00:52.030> look<00:00:52.539> until<00:00:53.469> we<00:00:53.859> go<00:00:54.340> vegan

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:55.109 
any changes until look until we go vegan

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:57.779 
any changes until look until we go vegan
individually<00:00:56.109> and<00:00:56.379> as<00:00:56.829> a<00:00:57.250> social<00:00:57.519> matter

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789 
individually and as a social matter

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:00.330 
individually and as a social matter
nothing<00:00:58.390> will<00:00:58.600> change<00:00:58.629> once<00:00:59.320> we<00:00:59.559> go<00:00:59.739> vegan<00:00:59.949> as

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
nothing will change once we go vegan as

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.150 
nothing will change once we go vegan as
an<00:01:00.489> individual<00:01:01.000> matter<00:01:01.179> and<00:01:02.010> social<00:01:03.010> matter

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
an individual matter and social matter

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.120 
an individual matter and social matter
everything<00:01:03.850> change<00:01:04.089> so<00:01:04.839> I<00:01:04.869> think<00:01:05.140> veganism<00:01:05.740> is

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
everything change so I think veganism is

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.370 
everything change so I think veganism is
the<00:01:06.280> moral<00:01:06.550> baseline<00:01:06.880> basically<00:01:07.840> if<00:01:07.990> animals

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
the moral baseline basically if animals

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.430 
the moral baseline basically if animals
matter<00:01:08.800> at<00:01:09.130> all<00:01:09.310> we<00:01:09.850> cannot<00:01:10.270> eat<00:01:10.600> wear<00:01:11.080> or<00:01:11.410> use

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
matter at all we cannot eat wear or use

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.559 
matter at all we cannot eat wear or use
them<00:01:11.860> it's<00:01:12.100> that<00:01:12.220> simple<00:01:12.640> it's<00:01:13.060> really<00:01:13.420> that

00:01:13.559 --> 00:01:13.569 
them it's that simple it's really that

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:16.230 
them it's that simple it's really that
simple<00:01:13.599> and<00:01:14.170> I<00:01:14.860> think<00:01:15.160> the<00:01:15.310> movement<00:01:15.759> the<00:01:16.060> prep

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
simple and I think the movement the prep

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.960 
simple and I think the movement the prep
the<00:01:16.539> problem<00:01:16.959> is<00:01:17.110> the<00:01:17.590> animal<00:01:18.280> movement<00:01:18.880> in

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
the problem is the animal movement in

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.010 
the problem is the animal movement in
many<00:01:19.539> places<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.920> corporatized<00:01:21.849> so<00:01:22.330> the

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
many places is corporatized so the

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.620 
many places is corporatized so the
people<00:01:23.200> who<00:01:23.500> the<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.970> animal<00:01:25.330> movement<00:01:25.569> is

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
people who the the animal movement is

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.589 
people who the the animal movement is
controlled<00:01:25.869> by<00:01:26.319> these<00:01:26.619> large<00:01:26.830> organizations

00:01:27.589 --> 00:01:27.599 
controlled by these large organizations

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:30.630 
controlled by these large organizations
which<00:01:28.599> have<00:01:29.020> a<00:01:29.050> vested<00:01:29.560> interest<00:01:29.739> in<00:01:30.220> not

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
which have a vested interest in not

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.910 
which have a vested interest in not
promoting<00:01:31.149> veganism<00:01:31.270> because<00:01:32.020> they<00:01:32.530> want<00:01:32.800> to

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
promoting veganism because they want to

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.309 
promoting veganism because they want to
appeal<00:01:33.160> to<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.520> broadest<00:01:33.729> base<00:01:34.270> in<00:01:34.959> terms<00:01:35.140> of

00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:35.319 
appeal to the broadest base in terms of

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:38.010 
appeal to the broadest base in terms of
donors<00:01:35.679> and<00:01:35.890> and<00:01:36.700> this<00:01:37.000> results<00:01:37.690> in<00:01:37.840> their

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
donors and and this results in their

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.650 
donors and and this results in their
promoting<00:01:38.560> happy<00:01:38.979> exploitation<00:01:39.940> and<00:01:40.209> you

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
promoting happy exploitation and you

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.660 
promoting happy exploitation and you
know<00:01:40.750> animal<00:01:41.200> welfare<00:01:41.410> reform<00:01:42.069> and<00:01:42.250> things<00:01:42.429> of

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
know animal welfare reform and things of

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:43.979 
know animal welfare reform and things of
this<00:01:42.759> nature<00:01:42.819> and<00:01:43.360> they<00:01:43.630> don't<00:01:43.840> promote

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:43.989 
this nature and they don't promote

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:45.330 
this nature and they don't promote
veganism<00:01:44.259> if<00:01:44.649> they<00:01:44.770> provide<00:01:45.069> any

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
veganism if they provide any

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.580 
veganism if they provide any
vegetarianism

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
vegetarianism

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.289 
vegetarianism
vegetarianism<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.429> morally<00:01:47.700> incoherent

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
vegetarianism is a morally incoherent

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.529 
vegetarianism is a morally incoherent
position<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.200> think<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:50.270> that<00:01:51.270> what<00:01:51.420> we

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
position so I think that that what we

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.779 
position so I think that that what we
really<00:01:51.869> need<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.109> do<00:01:52.469> is<00:01:53.039> sort<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.340> get<00:01:53.549> away

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
really need to do is sort of get away

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.059 
really need to do is sort of get away
from<00:01:53.850> these<00:01:54.210> these<00:01:54.659> organizations<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.859> get

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 
from these these organizations and get

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:59.359 
from these these organizations and get
in<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.429> really<00:01:57.119> have<00:01:57.299> grassroots<00:01:58.170> vegan<00:01:58.859> more

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
in and really have grassroots vegan more

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.429 
in and really have grassroots vegan more
than<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.609> graduate<00:02:00.149> vegan<00:02:00.569> movement<00:02:00.719> where<00:02:01.289> we

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
than a graduate vegan movement where we

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.929 
than a graduate vegan movement where we
spend<00:02:01.829> our<00:02:02.009> time<00:02:02.959> really<00:02:03.959> focused<00:02:04.560> on

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
spend our time really focused on

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.010 
spend our time really focused on
veganism<00:02:05.939> as<00:02:06.209> a<00:02:06.240> moral<00:02:06.569> baseline

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
veganism as a moral baseline

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.320 
veganism as a moral baseline
because<00:02:07.679> as<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.250> say<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:08.429> think<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.849> whole<00:02:09.000> happy

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
because as I say I think the whole happy

the idea that you know this is something

we<00:02:58.590> do<00:02:58.709> for<00:02:58.920> one<00:02:59.130> day<00:02:59.340> I<00:02:59.519> mean<00:02:59.700> it's<00:03:00.139> sort<00:03:01.139> of

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
we do for one day I mean it's sort of

we do for one day I mean it's sort of
like<00:03:01.380> I<00:03:02.370> would<00:03:02.940> say<00:03:03.090> that<00:03:03.269> there's<00:03:03.389> an<00:03:03.510> analogy

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
like I would say that there's an analogy

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.870 
like I would say that there's an analogy
to<00:03:04.019> sort<00:03:04.200> of<00:03:04.260> say<00:03:04.440> let's<00:03:04.650> have<00:03:04.799> rape<00:03:05.040> feet<00:03:05.489> free

to sort of say let's have rape feet free

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.520 
to sort of say let's have rape feet free
Monday<00:03:06.299> but<00:03:06.359> it's<00:03:06.630> not<00:03:06.780> even<00:03:06.930> that's<00:03:07.260> not<00:03:07.410> even

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
Monday but it's not even that's not even

Monday but it's not even that's not even
an<00:03:07.920> analogy<00:03:08.430> because<00:03:08.690> because<00:03:09.690> at<00:03:09.810> least<00:03:09.959> with

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
an analogy because because at least with

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:11.479 
an analogy because because at least with
a<00:03:10.139> rape<00:03:10.349> free<00:03:10.650> Monday<00:03:10.950> you're<00:03:11.069> getting<00:03:11.340> rid<00:03:11.459> of

all right on that day with meatless
Monday<00:03:13.769> you're<00:03:13.920> not<00:03:14.069> getting<00:03:14.310> rid<00:03:14.430> of<00:03:14.459> all

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
rid of meat and I wonder if the idea

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.599 
rid of meat and I wonder if the idea
that<00:03:18.900> justice<00:03:19.829> is<00:03:19.980> something<00:03:20.130> we<00:03:20.430> do<00:03:20.579> on

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609
