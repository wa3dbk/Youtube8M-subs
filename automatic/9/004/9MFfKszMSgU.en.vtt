last<00:00:20.789> year<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.150> think<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.869> this<00:00:22.199> is<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.769> new

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
last year I think and this is the new

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.890 
last year I think and this is the new
version<00:00:23.250> it's<00:00:23.640> not<00:00:23.760> out<00:00:23.880> yet<00:00:23.910> but<00:00:24.480> we<00:00:24.720> have<00:00:24.869> a

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
version it's not out yet but we have a

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.420 
version it's not out yet but we have a
code<00:00:25.230> for<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:25.800> we're<00:00:25.920> taking<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.220> quick<00:00:26.400> look

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
code for it so we're taking a quick look

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.810

as<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:27.029> can<00:00:27.180> see<00:00:27.510> my<00:00:28.140> field<00:00:28.710> technique<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.789> a

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
as you can see my field technique is a

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.849 
as you can see my field technique is a
little<00:00:30.510> bit<00:00:30.810> rubbish<00:00:31.080> let's<00:00:31.560> have<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.710> little

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
this little stick on the left hand side

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.440

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
gore this one's got some kick to it and

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.359 
gore this one's got some kick to it and
I'm<00:01:36.450> controlling<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.290> direction<00:01:37.619> by<00:01:38.070> tilt

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
I'm controlling the direction by tilt

I'm<00:01:38.610> going<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.850> go<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.210> get<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.479> seed<00:01:39.750> teller

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
I'm going to go and get the seed teller

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.050 
I'm going to go and get the seed teller
thingy<00:01:40.530> which<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.890> just<00:01:41.040> over<00:01:41.189> here<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.700> see<00:01:41.939> it

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
thingy which is just over here I see it

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.700 
thingy which is just over here I see it
I'm<00:01:42.180> going<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.390> try<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.570> detach<00:01:42.990> let<00:01:43.470> me<00:01:43.560> see

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
I'm going to try and detach let me see

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.800 
I'm going to try and detach let me see
if<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.890> can<00:01:44.040> detach<00:01:44.310> my<00:01:44.549> coupling<00:01:44.970> here<00:01:45.509> we<00:01:45.689> go

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
if I can detach my coupling here we go

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.359 
if I can detach my coupling here we go
beautiful<00:01:45.990> then<00:01:46.710> I'm<00:01:46.799> going<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.950> try<00:01:47.340> and

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
beautiful then I'm going to try and

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.039 
beautiful then I'm going to try and
reverse<00:01:48.590> elegantly<00:01:50.119> into<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.299> right<00:01:51.479> spaces

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
reverse elegantly into the right spaces

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.649 
reverse elegantly into the right spaces
are<00:01:52.140> like<00:01:52.259> sow<00:01:52.619> some<00:01:52.799> seeds<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.790> if<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.180> back<00:01:54.630> up

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
are like sow some seeds so if I back up

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.020 
are like sow some seeds so if I back up
back<00:01:55.079> up<00:01:55.229> back<00:01:55.290> up<00:01:55.560> am<00:01:56.430> i<00:01:56.549> doing<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.850> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
back up back up am i doing that the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.160 
back up back up am i doing that the
right<00:01:57.149> way<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.689> right<00:01:57.750> way<00:01:57.930> around

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
right way is that the right way around

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.539 
right way is that the right way around
it's<00:01:58.649> probably<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.920> wrong<00:01:59.009> without<00:01:59.219> isn't<00:01:59.490> it

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
it's probably the wrong without isn't it

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.420 
it's probably the wrong without isn't it
balls<00:01:59.729> see<00:02:00.659> I'm<00:02:00.840> clearly<00:02:01.469> not<00:02:01.619> from<00:02:01.950> farming

because<00:02:08.489> i'm<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.750> terrible<00:02:09.750> hack<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.349> here<00:02:10.560> we

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
because i'm a terrible hack so here we

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.670 
because i'm a terrible hack so here we
go<00:02:10.739> let's<00:02:11.459> reverse<00:02:11.760> back<00:02:12.030> in<00:02:12.209> back<00:02:12.569> in<00:02:12.599> back<00:02:12.900> in

go let's reverse back in back in back in

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.190 
go let's reverse back in back in back in
yeah<00:02:13.829> I'm<00:02:14.280> clipped<00:02:14.519> up<00:02:14.670> now<00:02:14.909> I<00:02:15.150> can<00:02:15.989> choose<00:02:16.170> the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
yeah I'm clipped up now I can choose the

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.289 
yeah I'm clipped up now I can choose the
kind<00:02:16.530> of<00:02:16.709> thing<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.129> want<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.549> so<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:18.120> there's

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
kind of thing I want to so so there's

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.539 
kind of thing I want to so so there's
wheat<00:02:18.599> I<00:02:18.810> suppose<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.409> there's<00:02:19.590> sweet<00:02:20.280> corn

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549

wheat I suppose and there's sweet corn
corn<00:02:20.909> I<00:02:21.000> guess<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.359> is<00:02:21.390> there<00:02:21.989> some<00:02:22.200> flowers

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
corn I guess that is there some flowers

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:23.869 
corn I guess that is there some flowers
and<00:02:22.739> whatnot<00:02:23.189> so<00:02:23.219> that<00:02:23.489> gives<00:02:23.609> me<00:02:23.700> some

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
and whatnot so that gives me some

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:25.859 
options now I'm going to pile on over to

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:27.979 
options now I'm going to pile on over to
this<00:02:25.980> field<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.879> let's<00:02:27.120> sow<00:02:27.540> some<00:02:27.870> oats

just<00:02:51.569> back<00:02:51.840> big<00:02:52.139> red<00:02:52.319> button<00:02:52.500> do<00:02:52.709> that's<00:02:53.280> my

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
just back big red button do that's my

just back big red button do that's my
reverse<00:02:53.730> gear<00:02:54.060> alright<00:02:54.389> fine<00:02:54.599> it<00:02:55.590> actually

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
reverse gear alright fine it actually

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.670 
reverse gear alright fine it actually
works<00:02:56.069> a<00:02:56.159> lot<00:02:56.280> smoother<00:02:56.909> I<00:02:57.030> think<00:02:57.419> then<00:02:57.720> 2015<00:02:58.650> I

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
works a lot smoother I think then 2015 I

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.899 
works a lot smoother I think then 2015 I
did<00:02:58.950> have<00:02:59.099> a<00:02:59.129> go<00:02:59.310> at<00:02:59.340> it<00:02:59.489> on<00:02:59.549> one<00:02:59.730> of<00:02:59.819> the

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
did have a go at it on one of the

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:01.550 
did have a go at it on one of the
streams<00:03:00.180> kind<00:03:00.540> of<00:03:00.599> going<00:03:00.840> as<00:03:00.959> a<00:03:01.019> more<00:03:01.469> of<00:03:01.530> a

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
streams kind of going as a more of a

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.319 
streams kind of going as a more of a
novelty<00:03:01.709> what<00:03:02.430> on<00:03:02.519> earth<00:03:02.669> is<00:03:02.790> it's<00:03:02.969> all<00:03:03.090> about

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
novelty what on earth is it's all about

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:04.940 
novelty what on earth is it's all about
and<00:03:03.599> you<00:03:03.719> can<00:03:03.870> see<00:03:04.049> it<00:03:04.169> does<00:03:04.349> totally<00:03:04.739> work

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
and you can see it does totally work

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.440 
and you can see it does totally work

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
seen for example here there's a map of

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.789 
seen for example here there's a map of
the<00:03:08.459> area<00:03:08.489> I've<00:03:08.939> got<00:03:09.120> other<00:03:09.379> crafts<00:03:10.379> I<00:03:10.590> can
