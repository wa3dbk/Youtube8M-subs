so today's fact or fiction statement is

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.750 
so today's fact or fiction statement is
do<00:00:25.480> healthy<00:00:25.960> landscape<00:00:26.650> trees<00:00:26.859> indoor

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
do healthy landscape trees indoor

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.660 
do healthy landscape trees indoor
summertime<00:00:28.420> storms<00:00:28.990> better<00:00:29.890> than<00:00:30.130> unhealthy

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:30.670 
summertime storms better than unhealthy

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.210 
summertime storms better than unhealthy
trees<00:00:30.900> well<00:00:31.900> that<00:00:32.019> one's<00:00:32.169> pretty<00:00:32.410> easy<00:00:32.500> that

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
trees well that one's pretty easy that

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.510 
trees well that one's pretty easy that
certainly<00:00:33.700> is<00:00:33.910> a<00:00:33.940> fact<00:00:34.329> but<00:00:35.370> let's<00:00:36.370> explore

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
certainly is a fact but let's explore

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.420 
certainly is a fact but let's explore
some<00:00:37.149> of<00:00:37.270> the<00:00:37.329> questions<00:00:37.809> as<00:00:38.020> to<00:00:38.290> how<00:00:38.469> we<00:00:39.250> can

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
some of the questions as to how we can

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.639 
some of the questions as to how we can
help<00:00:39.640> keep<00:00:40.000> our<00:00:40.300> landscape<00:00:40.840> trees<00:00:41.020> healthy

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:41.649 
help keep our landscape trees healthy

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:44.639 
help keep our landscape trees healthy
there's<00:00:42.640> clues<00:00:43.000> throughout<00:00:43.300> the<00:00:43.630> tree<00:00:43.870> so

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
there's clues throughout the tree so

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.340 
there's clues throughout the tree so
let's<00:00:44.680> look<00:00:45.100> at<00:00:45.309> a<00:00:45.640> landscape<00:00:46.360> tree<00:00:46.899> from<00:00:47.200> the

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
let's look at a landscape tree from the

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.190 
let's look at a landscape tree from the
top<00:00:47.559> down<00:00:47.860> we'll<00:00:48.550> explore<00:00:49.000> the<00:00:49.210> crown<00:00:49.480> the

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 
top down we'll explore the crown the

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.650 
top down we'll explore the crown the
branches<00:00:50.800> the<00:00:51.129> trunk<00:00:51.460> and<00:00:51.640> even<00:00:52.360> the<00:00:52.450> roots

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
branches the trunk and even the roots

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.869 
branches the trunk and even the roots
and<00:00:52.950> discover<00:00:53.950> how<00:00:54.219> we<00:00:54.280> can<00:00:54.520> keep<00:00:54.670> our

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
and discover how we can keep our

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.420 
and discover how we can keep our
landscape<00:00:55.360> trees<00:00:55.539> healthy<00:00:55.899> and<00:00:56.280> resistant<00:00:57.280> to

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
landscape trees healthy and resistant to

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.970 
landscape trees healthy and resistant to
summertime<00:00:57.760> storms<00:00:58.360> so<00:00:58.960> let's<00:00:59.230> start<00:00:59.739> our

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
summertime storms so let's start our

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.639 
summertime storms so let's start our
discussion<00:01:00.129> of<00:01:00.699> healthy<00:01:01.059> trees<00:01:01.360> with<00:01:02.289> the<00:01:02.440> top

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
discussion of healthy trees with the top

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.849 
discussion of healthy trees with the top
of<00:01:02.829> the<00:01:02.920> tree<00:01:03.219> and<00:01:03.399> the<00:01:04.089> tree<00:01:04.119> crown<00:01:04.629> as<00:01:04.899> we

00:01:05.849 --> 00:01:05.859 
of the tree and the tree crown as we

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:07.410 
of the tree and the tree crown as we
know<00:01:06.009> in<00:01:06.159> the<00:01:06.249> summertime<00:01:06.729> we<00:01:06.880> get<00:01:06.999> a<00:01:07.060> lot<00:01:07.270> of

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
know in the summertime we get a lot of

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.980 
know in the summertime we get a lot of
storms<00:01:07.810> with<00:01:08.439> high<00:01:08.709> velocity<00:01:09.399> winds<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.810> what

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
storms with high velocity winds so what

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.830 
storms with high velocity winds so what
can<00:01:11.109> we<00:01:11.170> do<00:01:11.439> to<00:01:11.590> help<00:01:11.770> reduce<00:01:11.979> those<00:01:12.429> forces

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
can we do to help reduce those forces

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.999 
can we do to help reduce those forces
well<00:01:13.840> the<00:01:13.929> first<00:01:14.170> thing<00:01:14.350> that<00:01:14.380> we<00:01:14.560> can<00:01:14.709> do<00:01:14.859> is

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
well the first thing that we can do is

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.489 
well the first thing that we can do is
some<00:01:15.249> preventative<00:01:15.880> pruning<00:01:16.389> and<00:01:16.539> that's

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:17.499 
some preventative pruning and that's

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:19.709 
some preventative pruning and that's
good<00:01:17.740> not<00:01:17.920> only<00:01:17.979> for<00:01:18.279> the<00:01:18.520> tree<00:01:18.849> but<00:01:19.149> for<00:01:19.389> us<00:01:19.509> as

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:19.719 
good not only for the tree but for us as

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:22.459 
good not only for the tree but for us as
well<00:01:20.069> why<00:01:21.069> is<00:01:21.130> he<00:01:21.340> good<00:01:21.520> for<00:01:21.549> the<00:01:21.789> tree<00:01:22.060> well

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:22.469 
well why is he good for the tree well

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:25.289 
well why is he good for the tree well
because<00:01:23.469> if<00:01:23.799> we<00:01:24.310> do<00:01:24.459> some<00:01:24.729> thinning<00:01:24.939> in<00:01:25.179> the

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
because if we do some thinning in the

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.069 
because if we do some thinning in the
canopy<00:01:25.779> we'll<00:01:26.649> reduce<00:01:27.099> the<00:01:27.420> resistance<00:01:28.420> with

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
canopy we'll reduce the resistance with

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:31.409 
canopy we'll reduce the resistance with
which<00:01:29.319> the<00:01:29.560> wind<00:01:30.069> moves<00:01:30.639> through<00:01:30.969> the<00:01:31.090> canopy

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:31.419 
which the wind moves through the canopy

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:35.099 
which the wind moves through the canopy
and<00:01:31.689> therefore<00:01:32.649> will<00:01:33.340> reduce<00:01:33.759> the<00:01:34.749> forces

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:35.109 
and therefore will reduce the forces

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:36.749 
and therefore will reduce the forces
that<00:01:35.259> could<00:01:35.619> potentially<00:01:36.310> break<00:01:36.549> off

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
that could potentially break off

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.169 
that could potentially break off
branches<00:01:37.119> that<00:01:38.109> reach<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:39.520> base<00:01:39.880> of<00:01:40.090> the

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179 
branches that reach the base of the

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:42.510 
branches that reach the base of the
branches<00:01:40.599> in<00:01:40.749> the<00:01:40.869> trunk<00:01:41.169> it's<00:01:42.039> good<00:01:42.279> for<00:01:42.490> us

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
branches in the trunk it's good for us

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.969 
branches in the trunk it's good for us
because<00:01:42.909> preventative<00:01:43.779> pruning<00:01:44.139> will<00:01:44.770> help

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
because preventative pruning will help

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.819 
because preventative pruning will help
take<00:01:45.189> care<00:01:45.399> of<00:01:45.489> problems<00:01:45.609> like<00:01:46.090> this<00:01:46.619> we'll<00:01:47.619> be

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
take care of problems like this we'll be

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:50.359 
take care of problems like this we'll be
removing<00:01:48.579> dead<00:01:48.969> wood<00:01:49.209> that<00:01:49.659> could<00:01:50.020> otherwise

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
removing dead wood that could otherwise

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.889 
removing dead wood that could otherwise
fall<00:01:51.369> from<00:01:51.609> the<00:01:51.700> tree<00:01:51.969> and<00:01:52.119> damage<00:01:52.869> your

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
fall from the tree and damage your

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.299 
fall from the tree and damage your
landscape<00:01:53.529> or<00:01:53.679> worse<00:01:54.149> cause<00:01:55.149> injury<00:01:55.630> to<00:01:55.810> us<00:01:56.309> so

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:57.309 
landscape or worse cause injury to us so

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:59.760 
landscape or worse cause injury to us so
good<00:01:57.549> preventative<00:01:58.179> pruning<00:01:58.719> will<00:01:59.439> help<00:01:59.619> the

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
good preventative pruning will help the

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.789 
good preventative pruning will help the
tree<00:02:00.069> and<00:02:00.369> make<00:02:01.329> the<00:02:01.509> landscape<00:02:01.840> a<00:02:02.289> safer

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
tree and make the landscape a safer

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.069 
tree and make the landscape a safer
place<00:02:03.009> to<00:02:03.279> be<00:02:03.429> so<00:02:04.239> we<00:02:04.389> know<00:02:04.539> that<00:02:04.569> summertime

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
place to be so we know that summertime

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.859 
place to be so we know that summertime
storms<00:02:05.829> can<00:02:06.130> bring<00:02:06.369> high<00:02:06.880> wind<00:02:07.239> velocities

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
storms can bring high wind velocities

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.559 
storms can bring high wind velocities
and<00:02:08.110> those<00:02:08.920> winds<00:02:09.340> can<00:02:09.489> apply<00:02:09.759> an<00:02:10.060> awful<00:02:10.450> lot

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
and those winds can apply an awful lot

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.500 
and those winds can apply an awful lot
of<00:02:10.599> force<00:02:10.959> to<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.260> base<00:02:11.500> of<00:02:11.680> these<00:02:11.799> branches

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
of force to the base of these branches

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.370 
of force to the base of these branches
some<00:02:13.510> of<00:02:13.629> these<00:02:13.689> branches

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
some of these branches

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.410 
some of these branches
are<00:02:14.440> strong<00:02:14.800> enough<00:02:15.070> to<00:02:15.130> endure<00:02:15.610> those<00:02:15.850> forces

what<00:02:54.010> this<00:02:54.160> tells<00:02:54.490> us<00:02:54.700> is<00:02:54.910> there's

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
what this tells us is there's

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.870 
what this tells us is there's

branch and the trunk and that makes for

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.340

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
a strong attachment that's a branch we

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.740 
a strong attachment that's a branch we
can<00:03:02.530> keep<00:03:02.710> on<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:04.000> other<00:03:04.120> hand<00:03:04.390> we<00:03:04.570> have<00:03:04.720> a

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
relatively large branch here and you can

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.750 
relatively large branch here and you can
see<00:03:08.260> that<00:03:08.470> it's<00:03:08.620> attached<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.370> trunk<00:03:09.640> with

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
see that it's attached to the trunk with

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
a relatively narrow v-shaped angle what

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.870 
a relatively narrow v-shaped angle what
that<00:03:12.880> tells<00:03:13.150> us<00:03:13.360> is<00:03:13.570> there's<00:03:14.020> a<00:03:14.320> layer<00:03:15.220> of<00:03:15.490> bark

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
that tells us is there's a layer of bark

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
that tells us is there's a layer of bark
that<00:03:16.680> extends<00:03:17.680> from<00:03:17.890> the<00:03:17.980> base<00:03:18.100> of<00:03:18.490> the<00:03:18.580> branch

that extends from the base of the branch

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.350 
that extends from the base of the branch
deep<00:03:19.900> into<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.380> trunk<00:03:20.790> so<00:03:21.790> instead<00:03:22.120> of<00:03:22.180> having

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
deep into the trunk so instead of having

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.960 
deep into the trunk so instead of having
overlapping<00:03:23.050> wood<00:03:23.410> fibres<00:03:23.860> we<00:03:24.460> have<00:03:24.700> a

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
overlapping wood fibres we have a

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.060 
overlapping wood fibres we have a

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
that layer of bark that makes this

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.370 
that layer of bark that makes this
branch<00:03:30.100> attachment<00:03:30.700> relatively<00:03:31.210> weak<00:03:31.390> and<00:03:31.630> we

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
branch attachment relatively weak and we

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.200 
branch attachment relatively weak and we
should<00:03:32.590> decide<00:03:32.890> whether<00:03:33.130> we<00:03:33.370> can<00:03:33.580> prune<00:03:33.940> that

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210 
should decide whether we can prune that

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.230 
should decide whether we can prune that
branch<00:03:34.540> off<00:03:34.870> or<00:03:35.760> whether<00:03:36.760> we<00:03:36.970> can<00:03:37.120> do

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
branch off or whether we can do

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.240 
branch off or whether we can do
something<00:03:37.510> to<00:03:37.990> make<00:03:38.170> that<00:03:38.350> branch<00:03:38.650> attachment

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
something to make that branch attachment

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.760 
something to make that branch attachment
stronger<00:03:39.960> one<00:03:40.960> of<00:03:41.050> the<00:03:41.140> options<00:03:41.500> that<00:03:41.590> we

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
stronger one of the options that we

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.720 
stronger one of the options that we
might<00:03:41.950> consider<00:03:42.130> is<00:03:42.610> a<00:03:42.640> series<00:03:43.600> of<00:03:43.750> cables<00:03:44.050> in

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
might consider is a series of cables in

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.100 
might consider is a series of cables in
the<00:03:45.730> upper<00:03:46.000> portion<00:03:46.420> of<00:03:46.510> the<00:03:46.630> tree<00:03:46.840> crown

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
the upper portion of the tree crown

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.699 
the upper portion of the tree crown
those<00:03:48.040> cables<00:03:48.959> combined<00:03:49.959> with<00:03:50.230> a<00:03:50.260> series<00:03:50.680> of

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
those cables combined with a series of

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.190 
those cables combined with a series of
rigid<00:03:51.250> braces<00:03:51.790> at<00:03:52.240> the<00:03:52.480> base<00:03:52.690> of<00:03:52.720> the<00:03:52.959> branch

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
rigid braces at the base of the branch

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.500 
rigid braces at the base of the branch
attachment<00:03:53.860> can<00:03:54.640> make<00:03:54.850> that<00:03:55.120> branch

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
attachment can make that branch

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.490 
attachment can make that branch
attachment<00:03:56.230> much<00:03:56.470> stronger<00:03:56.950> and<00:03:57.250> much<00:03:57.850> safer

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
attachment much stronger and much safer

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.710 
attachment much stronger and much safer
so<00:03:59.500> we<00:03:59.680> have<00:03:59.830> two<00:04:00.010> options<00:04:00.720> preventative

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
so we have two options preventative

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.380 
so we have two options preventative
pruning<00:04:02.140> or<00:04:03.060> strengthening<00:04:04.060> the<00:04:04.150> branch

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
pruning or strengthening the branch

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.199 
pruning or strengthening the branch
attachment<00:04:05.020> with<00:04:05.590> cables<00:04:05.980> and<00:04:06.130> braces<00:04:06.580> so

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
attachment with cables and braces so

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.120 
attachment with cables and braces so
it's<00:04:07.360> important<00:04:07.900> to<00:04:07.959> keep<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.410> upper<00:04:08.709> portion

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
it's important to keep the upper portion

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.310 
it's important to keep the upper portion

that<00:05:09.099> we<00:05:09.190> can<00:05:09.370> consider<00:05:09.759> and<00:05:10.000> that's

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
that we can consider and that's

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.200 
that we can consider and that's
providing<00:05:11.680> the<00:05:12.070> nutrients<00:05:12.699> to<00:05:12.759> the<00:05:12.910> root

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
providing the nutrients to the root

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.930 
providing the nutrients to the root
system<00:05:13.660> so<00:05:13.810> that<00:05:14.470> they<00:05:14.620> can<00:05:14.800> remain<00:05:14.979> vigorous

system so that they can remain vigorous
and<00:05:16.120> we<00:05:16.900> do<00:05:17.080> that<00:05:17.259> through<00:05:17.590> the<00:05:17.620> application

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
and we do that through the application

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.420 
and we do that through the application
of<00:05:18.400> a<00:05:18.520> slow-release<00:05:19.120> fertilizer<00:05:19.900> that

talked about and that's how do we

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:40.670 
talked about and that's how do we

the street let's go take a look now
we've<00:05:48.099> talked<00:05:48.430> about<00:05:48.610> the<00:05:48.969> excessive<00:05:49.509> forces

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
we've talked about the excessive forces

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.379 
we've talked about the excessive forces
that<00:05:50.259> come<00:05:50.469> with<00:05:50.680> summertime<00:05:51.130> storms<00:05:51.669> in<00:05:51.849> the

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:52.389 
that come with summertime storms in the

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:54.629 
that come with summertime storms in the
form<00:05:52.659> of<00:05:52.780> high<00:05:52.960> winds<00:05:53.289> but<00:05:54.159> there's<00:05:54.340> one<00:05:54.460> more

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639 
form of high winds but there's one more

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:56.279 
form of high winds but there's one more
force<00:05:54.969> that<00:05:55.180> we<00:05:55.270> have<00:05:55.479> to<00:05:55.630> consider<00:05:56.050> and

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:56.289 
force that we have to consider and

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:58.409 
force that we have to consider and
that's<00:05:56.830> the<00:05:57.099> electrical<00:05:57.699> discharge<00:05:58.180> that

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
that's the electrical discharge that

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:01.110 
that's the electrical discharge that
comes<00:05:58.659> along<00:05:58.990> with<00:05:59.199> lightning<00:05:59.620> strikes<00:06:00.120> what

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
comes along with lightning strikes what

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.820 
comes along with lightning strikes what
can<00:06:01.270> we<00:06:01.389> do<00:06:01.570> to<00:06:01.840> protect<00:06:02.020> significant

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830 
can we do to protect significant

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.620 
can we do to protect significant
landscape<00:06:03.340> trees<00:06:03.669> from<00:06:04.150> the<00:06:04.300> damage

in<00:06:28.389> this<00:06:29.139> case<00:06:29.380> we've<00:06:29.620> even<00:06:29.949> installed<00:06:30.400> a<00:06:30.580> fuse

00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:30.909 
in this case we've even installed a fuse

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:33.749 
in this case we've even installed a fuse
system<00:06:31.210> so<00:06:32.050> that<00:06:32.229> the<00:06:32.860> arborist<00:06:33.370> can<00:06:33.580> come

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:33.759 
system so that the arborist can come

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:36.899 
system so that the arborist can come
back<00:06:34.050> inspect<00:06:35.050> this<00:06:35.199> tree<00:06:35.530> and<00:06:35.770> know<00:06:36.070> for<00:06:36.880> sure

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:36.909 
back inspect this tree and know for sure

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:39.540 
back inspect this tree and know for sure
when<00:06:37.510> a<00:06:37.539> tree<00:06:37.870> has<00:06:38.020> been<00:06:38.169> hit<00:06:38.380> by<00:06:38.529> lightning<00:06:38.979> so

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
when a tree has been hit by lightning so

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.399 
when a tree has been hit by lightning so
that<00:06:39.729> we<00:06:39.880> can<00:06:40.060> do<00:06:40.210> additional<00:06:40.870> checking<00:06:41.289> of

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:41.409 
that we can do additional checking of

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:41.940 
that we can do additional checking of
the<00:06:41.469> system

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:41.950 
the system

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.520 
the system
now<00:06:42.820> we've<00:06:43.030> built<00:06:43.240> an<00:06:43.450> entire<00:06:43.780> video<00:06:44.230> on
