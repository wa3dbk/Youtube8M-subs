00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
thing about rad window is that we're not

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.690 
thing about rad window is that we're not
going<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.430> declare<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:40.050> sam'l

programmatically<00:00:43.800> let's<00:00:44.190> create<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:45.030> little

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
programmatically let's create a little

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.700 
programmatically let's create a little
private<00:00:46.710> method<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.309> help<00:00:47.579> create<00:00:48.270> our<00:00:49.200> rad

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
private method to help create our rad

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.700 
private method to help create our rad
window<00:00:50.280> will<00:00:50.879> call<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.270> create<00:00:51.660> window<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.350> in

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
window will call it create window and in

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.779 
window will call it create window and in
here<00:00:53.280> we're<00:00:54.239> going<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.570> start<00:00:55.110> by<00:00:55.949> creating<00:00:56.340> an

we can run the application the window
comes<00:01:41.009> up<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.600> can<00:01:42.600> see<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:43.049> can

comes up and you can see that you can

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.460 
comes up and you can see that you can
relocate<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:44.009> window<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.840> you<00:01:45.840> have<00:01:46.049> buttons

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
relocate the window and you have buttons

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.210 
relocate the window and you have buttons
to<00:01:46.770> close<00:01:47.540> maximize<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.930> minimize<00:01:49.220> the

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
to close maximize and minimize the

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.520 
to close maximize and minimize the
window<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.820> also<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.329> restore<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:51.899> once<00:01:52.259> it's

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
window and also to restore it once it's

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.639 
window and also to restore it once it's
minimized<00:01:53.329> that's<00:01:54.329> about<00:01:54.600> as<00:01:54.750> minimal<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.409> rad

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
minimized that's about as minimal a rad

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.580 
minimized that's about as minimal a rad
window<00:01:56.040> as<00:01:56.219> we<00:01:56.520> can<00:01:56.759> get<00:01:57.030> let's<00:01:57.930> see<00:01:58.140> if<00:01:58.259> we<00:01:58.409> can

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
window as we can get let's see if we can

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.249 
window as we can get let's see if we can
add<00:01:58.799> some<00:01:59.100> content<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.090> window<00:02:00.570> rad

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
add some content to that window rad

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.510 
add some content to that window rad
window<00:02:01.710> has<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.369> content<00:02:03.320> property<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.590> so

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
window has a content property and so

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.310 
window has a content property and so
typically<00:02:06.060> you're<00:02:06.210> going<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.600> put<00:02:06.780> some<00:02:06.810> kind

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
typically you're going to put some kind

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.229

of panel in there so that you can put
additional<00:02:09.479> controls<00:02:10.489> in<00:02:11.489> as<00:02:11.790> well<00:02:12.180> let's

text block let's set the foreground for
the<00:03:10.049> text<00:03:10.470> block<00:03:10.940> set<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.090> foreground<00:03:12.359> color

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
the text block set the foreground color

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.250 
the text block set the foreground color
to<00:03:13.019> white<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:13.950> then<00:03:14.670> set<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.359> text<00:03:15.690> in<00:03:16.109> our

to white and then set the text in our

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.569 
to white and then set the text in our
new<00:03:16.470> text<00:03:16.890> box<00:03:17.359> to<00:03:18.359> hello<00:03:19.049> world<00:03:19.319> will<00:03:20.010> now<00:03:20.190> add

new text box to hello world will now add

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:25.879 
new text box to hello world will now add
that<00:03:21.470> text<00:03:22.470> lock<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:23.130> our<00:03:23.430> grid<00:03:24.389> control<00:03:24.989> which

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
that text lock to our grid control which

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:29.120 
that text lock to our grid control which
of<00:03:26.069> course<00:03:26.099> is<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:27.419> content<00:03:28.019> for<00:03:28.620> our<00:03:28.650> rad

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
of course is the content for our rad

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.319 
of course is the content for our rad
window<00:03:29.730> and<00:03:30.060> so<00:03:30.750> that<00:03:30.989> text<00:03:31.530> will<00:03:31.709> show<00:03:32.329> inside

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
window and so that text will show inside

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.039 
window and so that text will show inside
the<00:03:34.169> grid<00:03:34.470> which<00:03:34.799> is<00:03:35.010> inside<00:03:35.700> the<00:03:36.239> window<00:03:36.750> and

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
the grid which is inside the window and

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.159 
the grid which is inside the window and
you<00:03:37.590> can<00:03:37.620> extrapolate<00:03:38.549> from<00:03:38.940> this<00:03:39.239> that<00:03:39.900> you

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
you can extrapolate from this that you

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.589 
you can extrapolate from this that you
could<00:03:40.380> add<00:03:40.590> any<00:03:40.950> controls<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:41.970> wanted<00:03:42.419> to

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
could add any controls you wanted to

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.319 
could add any controls you wanted to
that<00:03:42.810> grid<00:03:43.109> or<00:03:43.470> additional<00:03:44.160> panels<00:03:44.400> as<00:03:44.819> well<00:03:44.849> I

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
that grid or additional panels as well I

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.229 
that grid or additional panels as well I
hope<00:03:45.840> you've<00:03:46.019> seen<00:03:46.230> how<00:03:46.410> very<00:03:47.190> easy<00:03:47.489> it<00:03:47.760> is<00:03:47.880> to
