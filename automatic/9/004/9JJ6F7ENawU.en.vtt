 players but the game went by 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.960
 with some normality and with good 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.500
 Goal actions like this first 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.239
 try on the part of the visiting team 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.600
 of damián suárez the Uruguayan player 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:38.870
 very even match very balanced and with 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.489
 two very beautiful goals the one that marked Pedro 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.859
 lion in the first half and the one who scored 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.649
 in the second period the footballer 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:47.120
 Ghanaian Boakye this would be the first 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.030
 controversial play of the party the 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:54.020
 Elche players claim a hand 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.630
 within the area of the Lisandro 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.580
 Argentinian 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.800
 in the second half by the way 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.450
 would leave the injured party the 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.880
 immediate reply by 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.070
 men from luis garcía plaza would arrive in 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:10.180
 the 18th minute with this individual action 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.960
 and the goal of Pedro Leon that would put the 1 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.850
 to 0 on the scoreboard 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.100
 no important things had happened but 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.970
 the blue box was put ahead 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.790
 thanks to the genius of pedro léon no 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.500
 they get overpower you have all the 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.470
 time in the world to change that 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.470
 ball from his right foot to his foot 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.340
 left and define with forcefulness 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.130
 to score 1 to 0 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.020
 distribution of the ball in the first period and 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.359
 also in the second and a footballer 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.530
 and try many times the overflow 

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:48.070
 on the right side 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.070
 carles hill 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.799
 one of the most beautiful occasions of the 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.450
 first part by part of the table 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.909
 good control with the chest and 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.340
 see how he is traveling meters to 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.369
 look for a more frank shot and be able to put 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.909
 to test the goalkeeper of getafe miguel 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.670
 angel moyá we are already 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.470
 the second period and the one that encouraged a 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.069
 little bit the second part by the 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.330
 Madrilenian painting was Pablo Sarabia 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.760
 although this action 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.300
 Diego Castro is also the protagonist 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.250
 who ends up shooting at goal is arabia 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.620
 round trip in the second 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.050
 time with a ball to space that 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.390
 try to hang to the area 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.750
 aarón ñíguez the block is Juan 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.130
 valera both teams well above the 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.990
 one of the others that's why the referee 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.710
 ended up showing as we said nine 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.360
 multiple cards of fouls and also 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.790
 of interruptions in the equator of 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.560
 second period had to leave the 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.680
 match 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.520
 Lisandro and told them I enter 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.190
 albert lopo in fact lopo did not have time 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.890
 practically heating up in the band and 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.350
 right on the next move 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.380
 would come the goal of the tie overcome already 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.620
 the first quarter of an hour the auction of 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.850
 head led to that impeccable center 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.980
 from Aaron 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.980
 and the Ghanaian footballer who scored his 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.810
 third goal in this league bbva 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.690
 was missing more than half an hour to the end 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.069
 of the party and the elche equaled the 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.069
 shock 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.200
 a party that was already being very 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:30.569
 even on the field but also 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.569
 I was already on the scoreboard had 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.180
 because I wanted to mark and in fact 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.640
 as we told you, he had several options 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.560
 to do it pablo sarabia here trying 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.110
 the strong shot from the front of the 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.800
 alternative area in the two areas now 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.620
 in turn for the team of fran writes and 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.769
 Shooting 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.500
 from the peak of the area they tried 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:55.530
 I arrived with a fantastic intervention 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.900
 by miquel àngel moyà sending the ball 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.519
 to a corner in a matter of a minute we saw 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.440
 a goal shot from each team to 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:06.379
 final distribution of points at the end in the 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.379
 coliseum zetas of 1 elche 1
