00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
pops back up as a piece of dirt ready to

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.190 
pops back up as a piece of dirt ready to
be<00:00:53.579> killed<00:00:53.850> immediately<00:00:54.149> again<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:55.050> cook

this<00:00:55.410> up<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.130> tee<00:00:56.309> flip-flop<00:00:56.730> or<00:00:56.880> something

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
this up to a tee flip-flop or something

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.970 
this up to a tee flip-flop or something
and<00:00:57.300> put<00:00:57.450> that<00:00:57.600> up<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.930> your<00:00:58.140> door<00:00:58.410> now<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
and put that up to your door now the

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.470 
and put that up to your door now the
redstone<00:00:59.399> for<00:00:59.610> this<00:00:59.790> is<00:00:59.910> actually<00:01:00.059> pretty

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
redstone for this is actually pretty

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.810 
redstone for this is actually pretty
small<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.410> I'll<00:01:01.680> give<00:01:01.829> me<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.920> second<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.520> tear

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
small so I'll give me a second to tear

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.889 
small so I'll give me a second to tear
off<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.030> dirt<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.390> then<00:01:03.510> we<00:01:03.630> could<00:01:03.750> take<00:01:03.870> a

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
off the dirt and then we could take a

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.990 
off the dirt and then we could take a
look<00:01:04.050> at<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.320> as<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:05.130> see<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.580> Redstone<00:01:05.970> is

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
look at it as you see the Redstone is

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.210 
look at it as you see the Redstone is
very<00:01:06.360> small<00:01:06.630> it's<00:01:06.810> only<00:01:06.869> two<00:01:07.259> wide<00:01:07.500> three<00:01:07.950> tall

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
very small it's only two wide three tall

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.880 
very small it's only two wide three tall
and<00:01:08.520> five<00:01:08.850> long<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.899> gives<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.290> volume<00:01:10.649> of

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
and five long that gives it a volume of

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.730 
and five long that gives it a volume of
30<00:01:11.250> blocks<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.149> that's<00:01:12.540> not<00:01:12.720> too<00:01:13.050> much<00:01:13.080> larger

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
30 blocks and that's not too much larger

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.370 
30 blocks and that's not too much larger
than<00:01:14.250> torch<00:01:14.940> keys<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.450> fact<00:01:15.660> and<00:01:15.899> speaking<00:01:16.259> of

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
than torch keys in fact and speaking of

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.770 
than torch keys in fact and speaking of
torch<00:01:16.619> keys<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.550> counts<00:01:17.940> as<00:01:18.060> one<00:01:18.240> because<00:01:18.630> as

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
torch keys this counts as one because as

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.020 
torch keys this counts as one because as
you<00:01:18.899> see<00:01:19.050> when<00:01:19.170> I'm<00:01:19.290> placing<00:01:19.470> dust<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:20.729> does

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
you see when I'm placing dust it does

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.899 
you see when I'm placing dust it does
give<00:01:21.750> an<00:01:22.049> output<00:01:22.369> however<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.640> pretty

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
give an output however this is pretty

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.160 
give an output however this is pretty

gonna want to have a dust with a lever
constantly<00:01:38.820> powering<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.510> that<00:01:39.960> just<00:01:40.140> goes

dust on the half slab and that just

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.740 
dust on the half slab and that just
powers<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.250> sticky<00:01:45.030> piston<00:01:45.330> holding<00:01:45.659> a

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
powers this sticky piston holding a

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.620 
powers this sticky piston holding a
redstone<00:01:46.049> block<00:01:46.200> now<00:01:46.979> that'll<00:01:47.490> go<00:01:47.640> into<00:01:48.360> this

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
redstone block now that'll go into this

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.499 
redstone block now that'll go into this
guy<00:01:48.869> over<00:01:49.020> here<00:01:49.140> who<00:01:49.830> is<00:01:49.860> holding<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.850> detector

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
guy over here who is holding a detector

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.600 
guy over here who is holding a detector
rail<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.990> what<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.590> detector<00:01:53.009> rail<00:01:53.159> does<00:01:53.369> is

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
rail and what that detector rail does is

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.170 
rail and what that detector rail does is
it<00:01:53.850> redirects<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.630> dust<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.700> well<00:01:56.700> usually

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
it redirects that dust and well usually

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.760 
it redirects that dust and well usually
when<00:01:57.330> this<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.570> retracted<00:01:58.079> as<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.380> see<00:01:58.530> it'll

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
when this is retracted as you see it'll

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.130 
when this is retracted as you see it'll
be<00:01:58.860> powering<00:01:59.220> that<00:01:59.310> piston<00:01:59.729> however<00:02:00.720> when

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
be powering that piston however when

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.350 
be powering that piston however when
that's<00:02:01.380> extended<00:02:02.009> it'll<00:02:02.280> be<00:02:02.400> budding<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.880> now

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
that's extended it'll be budding it now

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.550 
that's extended it'll be budding it now
to<00:02:03.420> finish<00:02:03.840> everything<00:02:04.140> off<00:02:04.320> you're<00:02:04.500> gonna

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
to finish everything off you're gonna

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.749 
to finish everything off you're gonna
want<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.829> have<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.950> dust<00:02:05.189> there<00:02:05.400> and<00:02:05.610> then<00:02:05.700> a

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
want to have a dust there and then a

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.880 
want to have a dust there and then a
repeater<00:02:06.090> there<00:02:06.299> now<00:02:06.869> as<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.259> saw<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.560> system

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
repeater there now as you saw the system

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.520 
repeater there now as you saw the system
did<00:02:08.040> a<00:02:08.100> quick<00:02:08.280> reset<00:02:08.750> now<00:02:09.750> what<00:02:09.959> happened<00:02:10.350> was

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
did a quick reset now what happened was

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.060 
did a quick reset now what happened was
the<00:02:11.459> block<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.850> dirt<00:02:11.970> cut<00:02:12.329> off<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.600> power<00:02:12.810> to

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
the block of dirt cut off the power to

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.789 
the block of dirt cut off the power to
this<00:02:14.070> dust<00:02:14.400> over<00:02:14.579> here<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:15.530> retracted<00:02:16.530> this

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
this dust over here that retracted this

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.130 
this dust over here that retracted this
piston<00:02:17.310> retracting<00:02:18.299> that<00:02:18.510> piston<00:02:18.989> which

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
piston retracting that piston which

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.410 
piston retracting that piston which
brought<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.560> back<00:02:19.709> over<00:02:20.160> this<00:02:20.400> bottom<00:02:20.910> piston

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
brought it back over this bottom piston

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.720 
brought it back over this bottom piston
and<00:02:21.570> at<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.110> same<00:02:22.320> time<00:02:22.650> this<00:02:23.040> detector<00:02:23.579> rail

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
and at the same time this detector rail

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.789 
and at the same time this detector rail
retracted<00:02:24.329> as<00:02:24.450> well<00:02:24.660> which<00:02:25.230> allowed<00:02:25.560> this

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
retracted as well which allowed this

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.860 
retracted as well which allowed this
dust<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.400> power<00:02:26.609> that<00:02:27.060> bottom<00:02:27.299> piston<00:02:27.660> and

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
dust to power that bottom piston and

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:28.470 
dust to power that bottom piston and
then<00:02:28.049> every

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
then every

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.460 
then every
thing<00:02:28.720> extended<00:02:29.530> again<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:30.180> well<00:02:31.180> that's<00:02:32.170> it

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
thing extended again and well that's it

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.250 
thing extended again and well that's it
so<00:02:33.040> this<00:02:33.430> was<00:02:33.640> a<00:02:33.670> pretty<00:02:34.180> quick<00:02:34.450> video<00:02:34.810> I<00:02:34.900> hope

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
so this was a pretty quick video I hope

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.199 
so this was a pretty quick video I hope
you<00:02:35.440> enjoyed<00:02:35.830> you<00:02:35.980> can<00:02:36.129> use<00:02:36.310> this<00:02:36.519> for<00:02:37.030> pretty

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
you enjoyed you can use this for pretty

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.350 
you enjoyed you can use this for pretty
much<00:02:37.299> anything<00:02:37.780> for<00:02:38.739> trap<00:02:39.459> doors<00:02:39.760> doors

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
much anything for trap doors doors

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.009 
much anything for trap doors doors
whatever<00:02:41.400> yeah<00:02:42.400> so<00:02:42.760> until<00:02:43.330> next<00:02:43.480> time<00:02:43.629> I<00:02:43.750> guess
