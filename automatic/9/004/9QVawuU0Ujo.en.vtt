00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:13.110
 Hi, people, look, just cut a tree. 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:18.300
 I found your son to abandon me. 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:21.630
 Dinho looks at all battered roots are 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.699
 all the dried leaves are broken 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.170
 I do not even know what kind I do not even know 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.330
 species orchids 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.859
 If anyone knows, you can put it there. 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.529
 video comment 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.690
 Look, I'm just going to sing it on that one. 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.390
 process that I explained to you as 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.950
 she was in the tree that is going to happen 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.559
 if I put in any attitude 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.719
 any substrate may be any one 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.120
 and bury these roots that are already 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.210
 dry our roots they will rot 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.460
 So it's going to be a chance for me to have 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.010
 success with her time then what I go 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.050
 do as she was in the same dirty water 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.600
 process 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.489
 I got this piece of clean coal. 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.309
 was burned right into the bag. 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.189
 charcoal and left it stored and an hour goes 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.220
 a bad day to plant on it 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.580
 he burned but not totally burned 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:18.930
 also looks like one to one 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:22.490
 I'll get her learned a sealing 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:32.960
 people for what? 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:32.960
 it's like she's still on the good tree 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:40.760
 first day here will stay with said 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:44.930
 she kept at it and I'll do 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:47.150
 I'm going to get this little boot in 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.630
 of emptiness and when you already know that I 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:59.320
 I'm the fan of coal. 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:59.320
 Let's go to safety. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.790
 people who will happen to the roots and 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:16.490
 15 are here will continue sequinhas right 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.850
 and as she was developing 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:24.730
 letting go raissa israel do not arrest 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:29.530
 in this trunk and pass through a coal 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:33.560
 that way she's already well 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:36.290
 mistreating dinha that way I think 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.330
 her recovery will be much better 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.890
 Oh people, I do not like it, I told you 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.989

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.310

 now it's just the bar put it in water 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.190
 and wait for her recovery. 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.700

 is the size of the bud already a little time and 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.820
 the roots are already getting there in the coal 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.180
