we'll<00:00:22.109> be<00:00:22.230> testing<00:00:22.529> line<00:00:22.710> X<00:00:22.890> today<00:00:23.130> Oh<00:00:23.369> Terry

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
we'll be testing line X today Oh Terry

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.390 
we'll be testing line X today Oh Terry
today<00:00:24.660> we<00:00:24.810> dropped<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.529> bunch<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.099> different

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
today we dropped a bunch of different

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.609 
today we dropped a bunch of different
objects<00:00:26.760> off<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:26.970> roof<00:00:27.720> which<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.260> still<00:00:28.560> two

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
objects off a roof which is still two

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.040 
objects off a roof which is still two
feet<00:00:28.800> high<00:00:29.039> then<00:00:29.820> we're<00:00:30.210> going<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.390> code<00:00:30.660> these

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
feet high then we're going to code these

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.860 
feet high then we're going to code these
objects<00:00:31.710> with<00:00:32.040> our<00:00:32.250> Linux<00:00:32.820> material<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.450> drop

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
objects with our Linux material and drop

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.600 
objects with our Linux material and drop
off<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.260> roof<00:00:34.469> again<00:00:34.620> see<00:00:34.950> how<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.190> goes<00:00:35.370> I

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
off the roof again see how that goes I

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.940 
off the roof again see how that goes I
think<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.360> objects<00:00:36.750> not<00:00:36.870> protected<00:00:37.469> will<00:00:37.620> be

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
think the objects not protected will be

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.100 
think the objects not protected will be
completely<00:00:38.309> destroyed<00:00:38.820> but<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.719> objects

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
completely destroyed but the objects

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.110 
completely destroyed but the objects
that<00:00:40.170> our<00:00:40.350> line<00:00:40.559> next<00:00:40.829> will<00:00:41.250> survive<00:00:41.520> well<00:00:41.940> we

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
that our line next will survive well we

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.690 
that our line next will survive well we
don't<00:00:42.239> know<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.360> we<00:00:42.540> try<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.750> start<00:00:43.140> let's<00:00:43.410> go

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
don't know that we try to start let's go

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.910 
don't know that we try to start let's go
we're<00:00:44.700> going<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.910> drop<00:00:45.270> some<00:00:45.510> objects<00:00:45.989> from

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
we're going to drop some objects from

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.560 
we're going to drop some objects from
the<00:00:47.070> top<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.700> roof<00:00:47.940> here<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.300> we're<00:00:48.480> going

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
the top of the roof here and we're going

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.049 
the top of the roof here and we're going
to<00:00:48.629> see<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.930> impact<00:00:49.129> that<00:00:50.129> happens<00:00:50.579> when<00:00:50.850> we

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
to see the impact that happens when we

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.150 
to see the impact that happens when we
protect<00:00:51.480> one<00:00:51.719> with<00:00:51.960> line<00:00:52.170> X<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.590> one<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.039> is

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
protect one with line X and one that is

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.799 
protect one with line X and one that is
not<00:00:53.250> protected<00:00:53.730> okay<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.329> what<00:00:54.539> do<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.660> think

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
not protected okay so what do you think

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.090 
not protected okay so what do you think
this<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.050> thirty<00:00:55.230> feet<00:00:55.410> high<00:00:55.469> I'm<00:00:55.620> gonna<00:00:55.800> drop

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
this is thirty feet high I'm gonna drop

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.529 
this is thirty feet high I'm gonna drop
the<00:00:56.250> stood<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.879> ground<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.300> think<00:00:57.420> it's

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
the stood of the ground you think it's

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.670 
the stood of the ground you think it's
gonna<00:00:57.629> shatter<00:00:57.870> Oh<00:00:58.140> that'll<00:00:58.530> definitely

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
gonna shatter Oh that'll definitely

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.760 
gonna shatter Oh that'll definitely
shatter<00:00:59.190> Destin<00:00:59.640> all<00:01:00.090> right<00:01:00.300> man<00:01:00.510> one<00:01:00.870> two

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
shatter Destin all right man one two

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:09.590 
shatter Destin all right man one two
three

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.690 

so<00:01:10.600> I'm<00:01:10.719> going<00:01:10.869> to<00:01:10.899> have<00:01:11.079> this<00:01:11.490> coat<00:01:12.490> it<00:01:12.579> with

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
so I'm going to have this coat it with

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.289 
so I'm going to have this coat it with
lime<00:01:13.360> X<00:01:13.600> material<00:01:14.430> when<00:01:15.430> I<00:01:15.460> drop<00:01:15.820> this<00:01:15.850> what<00:01:16.240> do

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
lime X material when I drop this what do

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.149 
lime X material when I drop this what do
you<00:01:16.360> think<00:01:16.479> is<00:01:16.539> gonna<00:01:16.630> happen<00:01:16.780> I<00:01:17.170> believe<00:01:17.950> that

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
you think is gonna happen I believe that

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:19.980 
you think is gonna happen I believe that
the<00:01:18.220> line<00:01:18.369> X<00:01:18.520> will<00:01:18.640> protect<00:01:18.939> it<00:01:19.090> from<00:01:19.329> what<00:01:19.869> had

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
the line X will protect it from what had

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.569 
the line X will protect it from what had
just<00:01:20.020> happened<00:01:20.289> to<00:01:20.560> the<00:01:20.710> unprotected<00:01:20.950> sample

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:21.579 
just happened to the unprotected sample

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:23.069 
just happened to the unprotected sample
all<00:01:21.880> right<00:01:22.090> well<00:01:22.299> then<00:01:22.479> here<00:01:22.630> we<00:01:22.750> go

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:23.079 
all right well then here we go

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:34.390 
all right well then here we go
one<00:01:23.619> two<00:01:24.399> three

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.080 

all<00:01:34.970> right<00:01:35.180> Destin<00:01:35.510> let<00:01:35.630> me<00:01:35.720> check<00:01:35.900> this<00:01:36.050> out

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
all right Destin let me check this out

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.940 
all right Destin let me check this out
any<00:01:38.090> crack<00:01:38.560> everything<00:01:39.560> looks<00:01:39.740> good<00:01:39.890> here

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
any crack everything looks good here

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.120 
any crack everything looks good here
Justin<00:01:40.520> so<00:01:41.510> so<00:01:42.080> our<00:01:42.260> line<00:01:42.470> of<00:01:42.620> material

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
Justin so so our line of material

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.950 
Justin so so our line of material
protect<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:44.030> cinder<00:01:44.300> blocks<00:01:44.510> from<00:01:44.690> being

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
protect the cinder blocks from being

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.160 
protect the cinder blocks from being
cracked<00:01:45.320> or<00:01:45.590> shattered<00:01:46.300> that<00:01:47.300> is<00:01:47.450> because<00:01:47.780> the

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
cracked or shattered that is because the

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.200 
cracked or shattered that is because the
elongation<00:01:48.800> of<00:01:49.100> physical<00:01:49.490> properties<00:01:49.940> on<00:01:50.060> our

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
elongation of physical properties on our

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.750 
elongation of physical properties on our
product<00:01:50.630> so<00:01:51.620> we<00:01:51.740> got<00:01:51.920> to<00:01:52.010> clean<00:01:52.220> up<00:01:52.250> so<00:01:52.610> what

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
product so we got to clean up so what

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.470 
product so we got to clean up so what
you<00:01:52.850> want<00:01:53.000> to<00:01:53.030> do<00:01:53.120> next

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
you want to do next

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.120 
you want to do next
but<00:01:53.930> you<00:01:54.020> haven't<00:01:54.320> have<00:01:54.410> a<00:01:54.440> watermelon<00:01:54.920> up

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
but you haven't have a watermelon up

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.570 
but you haven't have a watermelon up
there<00:01:55.990> guess<00:01:56.990> what<00:01:57.230> I<00:01:57.470> do<00:01:57.710> have<00:01:58.100> one

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
there guess what I do have one

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.790 
there guess what I do have one
all<00:01:58.880> right<00:01:59.030> Destin<00:01:59.480> do<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:00.230> same<00:02:00.410> thing<00:02:00.620> as<00:02:00.710> we

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
all right Destin do the same thing as we

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.710 
all right Destin do the same thing as we
did<00:02:00.830> with<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.370> cinder<00:02:01.820> block<00:02:02.030> let's<00:02:02.300> drop<00:02:02.540> it

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
did with the cinder block let's drop it
