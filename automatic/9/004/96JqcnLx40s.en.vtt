00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
walked out you're in the glitch it's as

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.600 
walked out you're in the glitch it's as
simple<00:00:30.689> as<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.949> then<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.189> have<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.430> run

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
simple as that and then you have to run

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.220 
simple as that and then you have to run
over<00:00:32.730> here<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.210> these<00:00:33.450> stairs<00:00:33.780> which<00:00:34.079> will

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
over here to these stairs which will

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.290 
over here to these stairs which will
actually<00:00:34.739> use<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.219> actually<00:00:35.520> do<00:00:35.820> this<00:00:35.940> next

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
actually use to actually do this next

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.450 
actually use to actually do this next
part<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.750> glitch<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.230> I'm<00:00:37.980> gonna<00:00:38.100> speed

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
part of the glitch and I'm gonna speed

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.619 
part of the glitch and I'm gonna speed
up<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.579> video<00:00:38.700> real<00:00:39.030> quick<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.420> guys

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
up the video real quick so you guys

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.600 
up the video real quick so you guys
don't<00:00:39.780> have<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.020> wade<00:00:40.230> through<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.530> but<00:00:41.340> once

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
don't have to wade through that but once

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.190 
don't have to wade through that but once
you<00:00:41.760> do<00:00:41.910> get<00:00:42.030> over<00:00:42.239> here<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.600> stairs<00:00:42.870> all

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
you do get over here to the stairs all

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.990 
you do get over here to the stairs all
you<00:00:43.379> have<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.620> do<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.370> have<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.520> run<00:00:44.760> up<00:00:44.789> the

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
you have to do is you have to run up the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.029 
you have to do is you have to run up the
stairs<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.539> then<00:00:45.690> run<00:00:45.960> back<00:00:45.989> down<00:00:46.200> it's<00:00:46.950> as

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
stairs and then run back down it's as

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.529 
stairs and then run back down it's as
simple<00:00:47.190> as<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.460> for<00:00:47.850> some<00:00:48.000> reason<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.360> didn't

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
simple as that for some reason it didn't

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.900 
simple as that for some reason it didn't
work<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.840> first<00:00:49.050> time<00:00:49.170> for<00:00:49.950> me<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.670> had<00:00:50.820> to

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
work the first time for me so I had to

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.220 
work the first time for me so I had to
run<00:00:51.030> up<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.210> stairs<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.510> second<00:00:51.930> time<00:00:52.079> which

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
run up the stairs a second time which

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.549 
run up the stairs a second time which
you'll<00:00:52.379> see<00:00:52.620> here<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.039> second<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:54.559> what

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
you'll see here in a second and what

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.709 
you'll see here in a second and what
should<00:00:55.829> happen<00:00:56.100> if<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.789> does<00:00:56.969> work<00:00:57.180> correctly

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
should happen if it does work correctly

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.200 
should happen if it does work correctly
is<00:00:57.930> when<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.890> turn<00:00:59.070> around<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.520> go<00:00:59.579> parallel

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
is when you turn around and go parallel

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.939 
is when you turn around and go parallel
with<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.510> stairs<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.320> same<00:01:01.500> direction<00:01:01.680> as

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
with the stairs in the same direction as

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.729 
with the stairs in the same direction as
the<00:01:01.980> stairs<00:01:02.870> you<00:01:03.870> should<00:01:04.049> just<00:01:04.199> go<00:01:04.439> up<00:01:04.619> an

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
the stairs you should just go up an

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.260 
the stairs you should just go up an
invisible<00:01:04.949> staircase<00:01:05.430> which<00:01:05.909> you'll<00:01:06.060> see<00:01:06.180> in

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
invisible staircase which you'll see in

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.910 
invisible staircase which you'll see in
a<00:01:06.330> second<00:01:06.689> but<00:01:06.840> right<00:01:07.020> now<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.229> can<00:01:07.590> see<00:01:07.770> that

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
a second but right now you can see that

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.020 
a second but right now you can see that
I'm<00:01:08.010> just<00:01:08.189> going<00:01:08.340> up<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.490> staircase<00:01:08.729> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
I'm just going up the staircase the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.450 
I'm just going up the staircase the
second<00:01:09.390> time<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.750> going<00:01:10.290> back<00:01:10.500> down<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.950> then

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
second time and going back down and then

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.240 
second time and going back down and then
I<00:01:11.580> turn<00:01:11.790> around<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:13.320> will<00:01:13.619> actually<00:01:14.070> be

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
I turn around and I will actually be

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.690 
I turn around and I will actually be
going<00:01:14.280> up<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:15.090> an<00:01:15.750> invisible<00:01:16.350> staircase<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.040> it

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
going up a an invisible staircase and it

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.359 
going up a an invisible staircase and it
will<00:01:17.820> continue<00:01:18.180> going<00:01:18.509> up<00:01:18.689> like<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:19.369> forever

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
will continue going up like this forever

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.100 
will continue going up like this forever
essentially<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:21.720> go<00:01:21.810> all<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.020> way

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
essentially and you can go all the way

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.649 
essentially and you can go all the way
up<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.439> sky<00:01:22.920> barrier<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.670> go<00:01:24.270> above<00:01:24.540> the
