you're<00:02:07.410> looking<00:02:07.620> to<00:02:07.680> add<00:02:07.740> more<00:02:08.010> volume<00:02:08.490> to

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
you're looking to add more volume to

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.960 
you're looking to add more volume to
your<00:02:09.180> pompadour<00:02:09.810> or<00:02:10.470> clip<00:02:11.070> you<00:02:11.460> need<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.670> blow

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
your pompadour or clip you need to blow

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.670 
your pompadour or clip you need to blow
dry<00:02:12.150> your<00:02:12.180> hair<00:02:12.330> against<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.290> way<00:02:13.410> that<00:02:13.590> you

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
dry your hair against the way that you

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.910 
dry your hair against the way that you
normally<00:02:13.830> part<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.960> so<00:02:15.960> just<00:02:16.080> go<00:02:16.200> against<00:02:16.590> the

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
normally part it so just go against the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.400 
normally part it so just go against the
grain<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.430> then<00:02:17.790> once<00:02:18.240> you<00:02:18.510> start<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.170> style

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
grain and then once you start to style

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.960 
grain and then once you start to style
your<00:02:19.560> hair<00:02:19.680> back<00:02:19.920> in<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.130> normal<00:02:20.370> direction

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
your hair back in the normal direction

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.940 
your hair back in the normal direction
that<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.180> parted<00:02:21.480> in<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:22.230> will<00:02:22.440> see<00:02:22.650> that<00:02:22.830> you

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
that you parted in you will see that you

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.190 
that you parted in you will see that you
have<00:02:23.100> so<00:02:23.370> much<00:02:23.490> more<00:02:23.700> volume<00:02:23.880> just<00:02:24.840> from<00:02:24.990> doing

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
have so much more volume just from doing

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.600 
have so much more volume just from doing
that<00:02:25.290> alone

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
that alone

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.790 
that alone
and<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.540> last<00:02:28.690> I'm<00:02:28.900> doing<00:02:29.110> here<00:02:29.290> is<00:02:29.380> using<00:02:29.530> the

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
and the last I'm doing here is using the

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.040 
and the last I'm doing here is using the
concentrator<00:02:30.460> nozzle<00:02:30.550> to<00:02:31.060> define<00:02:31.570> my<00:02:31.780> side

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
concentrator nozzle to define my side

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.900 
concentrator nozzle to define my side
part<00:02:32.320> because<00:02:32.680> instead<00:02:32.920> of<00:02:32.980> going<00:02:33.490> all<00:02:33.790> the

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
part because instead of going all the

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.300 
part because instead of going all the
way<00:02:33.940> slicked<00:02:34.360> back<00:02:34.450> he<00:02:34.870> does<00:02:35.050> have<00:02:35.350> a<00:02:35.590> defined

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
way slicked back he does have a defined

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.050 
way slicked back he does have a defined
part<00:02:36.820> on<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.210> side<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:39.220> now<00:02:39.520> I<00:02:39.550> have<00:02:39.790> my<00:02:39.910> hair

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
part on the side and now I have my hair

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.180 
part on the side and now I have my hair
drive<00:02:40.360> it<00:02:40.510> shaped<00:02:40.750> into<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.650> style<00:02:41.950> that<00:02:42.070> I

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
drive it shaped into the style that I

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.590 
drive it shaped into the style that I
want<00:02:42.460> it<00:02:42.550> to<00:02:42.670> be<00:02:42.790> in<00:02:42.910> so<00:02:43.120> it's<00:02:43.270> time<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.450> add

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
want it to be in so it's time to add

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.470 
want it to be in so it's time to add
some<00:02:43.660> product

chunks to and in this specific book if

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.699 
chunks to and in this specific book if
you<00:03:17.450> remember<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:17.810> picture<00:03:17.959> David's<00:03:18.560> hair

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
you remember the picture David's hair

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.949 
you remember the picture David's hair
was<00:03:18.920> a<00:03:18.950> little<00:03:19.310> more<00:03:19.489> chunky<00:03:20.060> and<00:03:20.269> matted<00:03:20.810> so

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
was a little more chunky and matted so

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.440 
was a little more chunky and matted so
I'm<00:03:21.049> just<00:03:21.260> kind<00:03:21.500> of<00:03:21.560> taking<00:03:22.310> out<00:03:22.459> sections<00:03:23.090> and

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
I'm just kind of taking out sections and

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.809 
I'm just kind of taking out sections and
kind<00:03:24.170> of<00:03:24.260> molding<00:03:24.590> them<00:03:24.739> together<00:03:25.129> into<00:03:25.609> the

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
kind of molding them together into the

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.259 
kind of molding them together into the
shape<00:03:26.060> that<00:03:26.329> I<00:03:27.079> want<00:03:27.410> and<00:03:27.910> trying<00:03:28.910> to<00:03:28.970> keep<00:03:29.090> it

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
shape that I want and trying to keep it

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.000 
shape that I want and trying to keep it
pretty<00:03:29.510> close<00:03:29.840> to<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:30.410> way<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:30.709> picture

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
pretty close to the way the picture

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.670 
pretty close to the way the picture
looked<00:03:31.780> and<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:33.079> whole<00:03:33.230> thing<00:03:33.379> I<00:03:33.440> like<00:03:33.590> about

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
looked and the whole thing I like about

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.559 
looked and the whole thing I like about
this<00:03:33.920> look<00:03:34.129> is<00:03:34.280> that<00:03:34.310> it's<00:03:34.700> really<00:03:35.269> just<00:03:35.420> a

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
this look is that it's really just a

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:37.930 
this look is that it's really just a
play<00:03:35.810> on<00:03:36.109> the<00:03:36.470> modern<00:03:36.799> and<00:03:36.890> slicked<00:03:37.160> back<00:03:37.190> on

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
play on the modern and slicked back on

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.699 
play on the modern and slicked back on
the<00:03:38.180> door<00:03:38.299> but<00:03:38.599> just<00:03:39.379> a<00:03:39.470> little<00:03:39.590> more

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
the door but just a little more

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.940 
the door but just a little more
deconstructed<00:03:40.640> and<00:03:41.109> allows<00:03:42.109> you<00:03:42.379> just<00:03:42.410> to

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
deconstructed and allows you just to

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.910 
deconstructed and allows you just to
kind<00:03:43.190> of<00:03:43.400> put<00:03:43.879> your<00:03:44.030> own<00:03:44.150> twist<00:03:44.510> on<00:03:44.660> it<00:03:44.720> and<00:03:44.930> not

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
kind of put your own twist on it and not

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.820 
kind of put your own twist on it and not
make<00:03:46.099> it<00:03:46.190> look<00:03:46.280> too<00:03:46.459> fussy

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
make it look too fussy

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.710 
make it look too fussy
now<00:03:48.430> I'm<00:03:48.520> just<00:03:48.610> putting<00:03:48.760> on<00:03:48.970> my<00:03:49.000> finishing

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
now I'm just putting on my finishing

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.420 
now I'm just putting on my finishing
touches<00:03:49.960> to<00:03:50.140> get<00:03:50.470> it<00:03:50.590> as<00:03:50.740> close<00:03:51.190> to<00:03:51.250> the
