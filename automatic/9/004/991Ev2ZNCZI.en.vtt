00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
let's take which

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.400 
let's take which
on<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.290> keyboard<00:01:08.510> the<00:01:09.510> keys<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:10.050> the<00:01:10.140> Sony

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
on the keyboard the keys of the Sony

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.460 
on the keyboard the keys of the Sony
Vaio<00:01:10.530> W<00:01:11.280> are<00:01:11.910> definitely<00:01:12.570> smaller<00:01:12.930> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
Vaio W are definitely smaller the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.470 
Vaio W are definitely smaller the
feedback<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.310> way<00:01:14.670> better<00:01:14.940> here<00:01:15.090> on<00:01:15.300> the

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:15.480 
feedback is way better here on the

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.650 
feedback is way better here on the
Toshiba<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.430> it's<00:01:17.430> easier<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.030> type<00:01:18.300> on<00:01:18.510> this

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
Toshiba and it's easier to type on this

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.150 
Toshiba and it's easier to type on this
one<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.860> trackpad<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:21.140> little<00:01:22.140> bit<00:01:22.290> bigger<00:01:22.800> on

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.160 
one the trackpad a little bit bigger on

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.970 
one the trackpad a little bit bigger on
the<00:01:23.280> Toshiba<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.750> like<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.080> surface<00:01:25.560> also

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:25.980 
the Toshiba and I like the surface also

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.130 
the Toshiba and I like the surface also
a<00:01:26.010> little<00:01:26.250> bit<00:01:26.340> more<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.270> Toshiba<00:01:27.630> what

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
a little bit more on the Toshiba what

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.440 
a little bit more on the Toshiba what
about<00:01:28.410> mouse<00:01:28.740> buttons<00:01:29.220> very<00:01:29.520> responsible<00:01:30.210> to

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
about mouse buttons very responsible to

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.870 
about mouse buttons very responsible to
achieve<00:01:30.660> a<00:01:30.690> very<00:01:30.870> big<00:01:31.320> easy<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.860> reach<00:01:32.040> while

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
achieve a very big easy to reach while

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.920 
achieve a very big easy to reach while
on<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.210> Sony<00:01:33.450> Vaio<00:01:33.570> W<00:01:34.440> they<00:01:35.160> seem<00:01:36.120> to<00:01:36.300> me<00:01:36.450> a

on the Sony Vaio W they seem to me a
little<00:01:37.320> bit<00:01:37.500> worn<00:01:37.770> out<00:01:37.890> but<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.460> might<00:01:38.730> be

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
little bit worn out but this might be

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.630 
little bit worn out but this might be
because<00:01:39.570> it's<00:01:40.020> also<00:01:40.229> on<00:01:40.410> this<00:01:40.560> booth<00:01:40.770> now<00:01:41.370> for

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
because it's also on this booth now for

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.060 
because it's also on this booth now for
five<00:01:42.000> days<00:01:42.270> or<00:01:42.510> so

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
five days or so

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.180 
five days or so
besides<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.479> let's<00:01:45.479> take<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.990> lot<00:01:46.290> sizes

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
besides that let's take the lot sizes

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.460 
besides that let's take the lot sizes
you<00:01:48.000> see<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.540> Toshiba<00:01:49.050> is<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.170> little<00:01:49.380> bit

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470

bigger
the<00:01:51.930> rate<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.320> almost<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.950> same<00:01:53.190> even<00:01:53.729> though

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
the rate is almost the same even though

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.609 
the rate is almost the same even though
