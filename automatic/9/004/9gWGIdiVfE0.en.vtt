you is use it don't lose it
I<00:06:11.820> think<00:06:12.240> a<00:06:12.330> lot<00:06:12.510> of<00:06:12.630> times<00:06:12.870> with<00:06:13.320> produce<00:06:13.620> you

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:13.949 
I think a lot of times with produce you

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:15.950 
I think a lot of times with produce you
want<00:06:14.130> to<00:06:14.250> make<00:06:14.760> it<00:06:14.909> last<00:06:15.060> as<00:06:15.419> long<00:06:15.510> as<00:06:15.720> possible

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
want to make it last as long as possible

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.649 
want to make it last as long as possible
and<00:06:16.409> dole<00:06:16.650> it<00:06:16.830> out<00:06:16.979> but<00:06:17.820> the<00:06:18.030> thing<00:06:18.180> is<00:06:18.210> if<00:06:18.510> it's

00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:18.659 
and dole it out but the thing is if it's

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:21.790 
and dole it out but the thing is if it's
sat<00:06:18.900> in<00:06:19.020> your<00:06:19.050> refrigerator<00:06:19.470> it's<00:06:20.159> not

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
being eaten and consumed it's more of a

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.990 
being eaten and consumed it's more of a
likelihood<00:06:24.440> that<00:06:24.560> it's<00:06:24.800> going<00:06:25.009> to<00:06:25.130> get<00:06:25.580> moldy
