sure can because my shoe is definitely

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.500 
sure can because my shoe is definitely
way<00:05:11.510> better<00:05:11.540> than<00:05:11.990> LeBrons<00:05:12.890> which<00:05:13.820> I<00:05:14.000> agree<00:05:14.240> I

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
way better than LeBrons which I agree I

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:15.940 
way better than LeBrons which I agree I
don't<00:05:14.870> think<00:05:14.900> LeBron<00:05:15.350> should<00:05:15.590> be<00:05:15.710> more<00:05:15.890> than

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
don't think LeBron should be more than

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.890 
don't think LeBron should be more than
Jordans<00:05:17.050> because<00:05:19.060> Jordans<00:05:20.060> is<00:05:20.210> very<00:05:20.720> iconic

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
Jordans because Jordans is very iconic

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.990 
Jordans because Jordans is very iconic
LeBrons<00:05:21.770> I<00:05:22.010> just<00:05:22.250> feel<00:05:22.400> like<00:05:22.520> the<00:05:22.670> hype<00:05:22.820> around

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
LeBrons I just feel like the hype around

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.710 
LeBrons I just feel like the hype around
it<00:05:23.300> is<00:05:23.450> disgusting<00:05:23.870> um<00:05:27.250> but<00:05:28.250> you<00:05:28.580> know<00:05:28.720> overall

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
it is disgusting um but you know overall

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.470 
it is disgusting um but you know overall
some<00:05:30.380> little<00:05:30.950> you<00:05:31.430> know<00:05:31.580> some<00:05:31.880> lebrons<00:05:32.060> I

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:32.480 
some little you know some lebrons I

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.950 
some little you know some lebrons I
actually<00:05:32.570> do<00:05:32.990> like<00:05:33.340> but<00:05:34.340> I<00:05:34.640> don't<00:05:35.540> know<00:05:35.690> man<00:05:35.900> I

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
actually do like but I don't know man I

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.350 
actually do like but I don't know man I
just<00:05:36.080> think<00:05:36.500> that<00:05:36.680> true<00:05:37.310> two<00:05:37.760> hundred<00:05:38.030> dollars

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
just think that true two hundred dollars

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.260 
just think that true two hundred dollars
for<00:05:38.600> LeBrons<00:05:39.020> I<00:05:39.500> mean<00:05:40.430> Jordans<00:05:40.910> not<00:05:41.030> even

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
for LeBrons I mean Jordans not even

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.730 
for LeBrons I mean Jordans not even
doing<00:05:41.450> that<00:05:41.570> Jordans<00:05:42.110> right<00:05:42.320> now<00:05:42.470> should<00:05:42.710> be

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
doing that Jordans right now should be

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:48.910 
doing that Jordans right now should be
140<00:05:44.980> no<00:05:45.980> more<00:05:46.250> maybe<00:05:46.610> 152<00:05:47.390> highest<00:05:47.780> Jordan<00:05:48.560> and

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:48.920 
140 no more maybe 152 highest Jordan and

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.550 
140 no more maybe 152 highest Jordan and
LeBron<00:05:49.490> should<00:05:49.970> be<00:05:50.090> 180<00:05:50.540> demotius<00:05:51.140> because<00:05:51.440> of

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
LeBron should be 180 demotius because of

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.690 
LeBron should be 180 demotius because of
the<00:05:51.650> material<00:05:53.260> date-date<00:05:54.260> arm<00:05:54.590> could<00:05:55.490> have

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
the material date-date arm could have

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.920 
the material date-date arm could have
that<00:05:56.060> because<00:05:57.310> the<00:05:58.310> material<00:05:58.490> on<00:05:59.330> LeBrons

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
that because the material on LeBrons

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.200 
that because the material on LeBrons
don't<00:06:00.350> crease<00:06:00.710> you<00:06:01.310> know<00:06:01.430> I<00:06:01.460> mean<00:06:01.640> we<00:06:01.820> we<00:06:02.090> have

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
don't crease you know I mean we we have

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.420 
don't crease you know I mean we we have
that<00:06:02.420> problem<00:06:02.690> of<00:06:02.990> creasing<00:06:03.500> with<00:06:03.920> Jordans

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
that problem of creasing with Jordans

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.220 
that problem of creasing with Jordans
and<00:06:04.730> trying<00:06:05.000> to<00:06:05.090> walk<00:06:05.300> funny<00:06:05.630> just<00:06:05.990> to<00:06:06.080> not

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:06.230 
and trying to walk funny just to not

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.500 
and trying to walk funny just to not
crease<00:06:06.530> it<00:06:06.770> you<00:06:07.760> know<00:06:07.850> everybody<00:06:08.150> goes

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:08.510 
crease it you know everybody goes

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:09.330 
crease it you know everybody goes
through<00:06:08.750> that

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.340 
through that

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.990 
through that
so<00:06:10.300> LeBron's<00:06:10.990> material<00:06:11.710> is<00:06:11.830> absolutely<00:06:12.730> a<00:06:12.760> lot

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
so LeBron's material is absolutely a lot

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.520 
so LeBron's material is absolutely a lot
better<00:06:13.270> because<00:06:13.449> they<00:06:13.780> barely<00:06:14.139> crease

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530 
better because they barely crease

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:15.930 
better because they barely crease
especially<00:06:15.070> the<00:06:15.190> numbers<00:06:15.490> that<00:06:15.520> recently

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
especially the numbers that recently

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.740 
especially the numbers that recently
came<00:06:16.030> out<00:06:17.669> so<00:06:18.669> I<00:06:18.729> could<00:06:18.790> understand<00:06:19.360> a<00:06:19.449> little

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
came out so I could understand a little

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.280 
came out so I could understand a little
bit<00:06:19.990> price<00:06:20.290> raised<00:06:20.590> but<00:06:21.040> not<00:06:21.760> 200<00:06:22.419> it<00:06:23.139> should

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:23.290 
bit price raised but not 200 it should

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.290 
bit price raised but not 200 it should
have<00:06:23.380> been<00:06:23.500> 180<00:06:23.889> in<00:06:24.040> LeBron<00:06:24.400> and<00:06:24.580> dumb<00:06:25.000> and

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
have been 180 in LeBron and dumb and

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.020 
have been 180 in LeBron and dumb and
Jordan<00:06:25.780> should<00:06:25.960> be<00:06:26.080> 150<00:06:26.680> right<00:06:27.430> now<00:06:27.610> that's<00:06:27.850> my

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:28.030 
Jordan should be 150 right now that's my

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.890 
Jordan should be 150 right now that's my
opinion<00:06:28.380> you<00:06:29.380> know<00:06:29.669> but<00:06:30.669> i'm<00:06:31.389> looking<00:06:31.540> through
