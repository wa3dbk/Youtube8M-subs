00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.990
 There are millions on youtube

 of videos about gift ideas 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.920
 but who should not do it? 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.770
 know if I'm a very special 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.770
 animal and that our expert the reindeer 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:29.760
 hello here i am i mentioned woman 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.949
 actually, if I 'm a lion of the forest 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.040
 I have arrived very far away 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.079
 and the studio and I got you a halt 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.780
 Some ideas were brought to you now 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.329
 still in the last week before 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.920
 Christmas can get around to it 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.809
 to give away his dearest 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.600
 they may not be great 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.329
 innovative ideas but maybe 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.890
 Something on it you do not have 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.110
 come and do not like it 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.730
 would eventually because the because even things 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.930
 personally liked as a gift 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.920
 I would just start with that now 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:05.700
 that would be the first gift idea 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:08.250
 a letter that is made of cardboard in pink 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.020
 on my now anna has somehow three 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.549
 weeks or what is there in 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.530
 you get different sizes 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.540
 also determined somewhere in other bastl 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.729
 live or something, I think that's right 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.770
 cool idea you are wondering why 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.110
 I'm just holding the letter Z in my hand 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.909
 keep the resolution to this you will find 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.920
 our facebook page and the link to it 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.479
 you can find below in the infobox 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.230
 she found like ford with the next one 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:35.340
 Gift idea and that is that here 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:38.310
 is the book that you know 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.440
 with us is that and what is like where 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.630
 willi or so or in English sweet 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.570
 william or or what that too now 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.890
 her the French version of it so 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.080
 that works is not the gift 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.030
 but that is something on what 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.520
 you can open a really good third party 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.050
 and this was always here we are 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.400
 quite a lot of pictures quite a lot of people 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.960
 are on it and then you have to give it to the 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.000
 are already looking for this guy in the 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.050
 Business takes or keeps different 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.060
 somehow pig or or a harp 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.890
 or the animals or what can you do there 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.090
 Looking and definitely you can do it 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.280
 then cut it up and on 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.010
 tinker postcards and to known ones 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.480
 Send to friends and then so 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.300
 tasks are on the postcard here 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.660
 Seek that so that search and that is 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.760
 I have a very cool set up there what 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.220
 escapes gift technical are on 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.140
 every case books yes it is currently 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.700
 difficult to pick the right topic 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.800
 because then you do not know the act of 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.720
 dear few prefer crime or yet 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.500
 dear fiction or rather a few 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.090
 normal romans therefore one 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.490
 category that always works and 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.370
 which are timeless, so to speak 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.920
 autobiography such as that of miles davis 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.930
 the super funny written and it is 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.020
 so that's jazz trumpeter mainz 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.610
 and composer and as he writes it 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.770
 really so funny i never would have 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.500
 thought that it was so much fun 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.000
 autobiographies to read really 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.950
 I think if you are ok for example 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.560
 one likes to like music and 70 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.720
 for music then he bought the miles 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.900
 davis autobiography or just any 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.460
 others from other musicians do not do it 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.140
 you sound like you're counting 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.520
 not funny, he really has to write 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.130
 it continues in the program 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.720
 which of course always by fax that 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.580
 problem is you do not know which 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.710
 format technology then you just go in 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.470
 bathroom and looks what procedure 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.690
 which frank michalak raw materials and 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.450
 then she goes through the business more 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.650
 the name and look for what products 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.170
 There are still the same 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.660
 series and usually there are also 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.750
 still so deodorant or in which sat or 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.520
 Body teams and these animals in the west 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.030
 is also much cheaper than procedural 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.950
 per se 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.570
 I have the coco mademoiselle here 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:51.990
 chambon the green there fresh or 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:55.020
 maxi measures or moisturizes 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:57.060
 spray and that's just great 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.120
 nice luxurious gift what just 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:04.970
 not too expensive and less 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.970
 are utilizing in any case and need 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.180
 so now maybe something is coming 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.190
 unusual gift idea but me 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.699
 Personally, I would be right about it 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:23.530
 It is actually quite happy 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:25.430
 simple things as well as the game plans bag 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.020
 You know gummibärchen if one of 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.840
 everyone from the haribo and the haribo 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.550
 Gummy bears from each provided a bag 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.169
 takes with and against a box car 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.970
 I would be so happy about it 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.979
 we show modest but I find 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:41.030
 but almost so maybe you do that 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:45.740
 sometimes a gift idea of ​​the same 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:48.350
 kind of bit beknackt is namely a 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.389
 Buy a series of magazines for someone 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.790
 I would really be totally personal 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.960
 happy if somehow I draw 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.030
 get different magazines 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.760
 One would then only have one month 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.030
 be careful not to be rigid 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.919
 gossip celebrity gossip and gossip 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.270
 clapping purchase because then are mostly in 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:07.310
 one high in the same month 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.289
 the pictures are the same and the share is similar 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.270
 and the gossip is somehow 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:13.400
 thematically very similar so on 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.900
 quite a lot of magazines and cases 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.860
 I think somehow magazines 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.600
 so magazine form so to speak so not 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.310
 somehow digital are not still digital 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.900
 very very nice because many like 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.330
 that's no longer use then 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.320
 ipad or what or read the articles 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.520
 do 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:33.050
 pck but yes I think it's just beautiful 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.060
 if you can hold on one hand and 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.760
 if you turn out the at &amp; t 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:40.070
 Can or pictures collages typical 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.650

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:45.389
 a nice and a little bit bit 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.330
 but moved quite original 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:49.710

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:57.449
 packed up 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:59.729

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:01.820
