00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.700 

and<00:01:23.240> obviously<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.630> main<00:01:24.780> zip<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.200> bought

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
and obviously the main zip I bought

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.649 
and obviously the main zip I bought
extra<00:01:25.890> small<00:01:26.310> because<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.790> fits<00:01:27.030> nice<00:01:27.630> and

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
extra small because it fits nice and

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.399 
extra small because it fits nice and
snug<00:01:29.360> however<00:01:30.360> when<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.540> zip<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:30.990> up<00:01:31.080> the<00:01:31.259> bottom

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
snug however when I zip it up the bottom

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.430 
snug however when I zip it up the bottom
bit<00:01:33.440> here<00:01:34.700> is<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.759> bit<00:01:36.030> too<00:01:36.210> tight<00:01:36.450> but<00:01:37.229> that's

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
bit here is a bit too tight but that's

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.620 
bit here is a bit too tight but that's
not<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.710> big<00:01:37.860> deal

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
not a big deal

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:45.080 
not a big deal
however<00:01:40.550> it<00:01:41.550> is<00:01:42.830> impermeable<00:01:43.880> if<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.000> have

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
however it is impermeable if you have

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.880 
however it is impermeable if you have
will<00:01:45.240> protect<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.810> from<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.110> rain<00:01:46.140> but

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
will protect you from the rain but

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.660 
will protect you from the rain but
notice<00:01:47.780> it's<00:01:48.780> probably<00:01:49.049> hard<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.290> tell<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:50.490> has

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
notice it's probably hard to tell it has

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.880 
notice it's probably hard to tell it has
no<00:01:50.909> Vince<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:52.200> if<00:01:52.259> you're<00:01:52.380> doing<00:01:52.560> something

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
no Vince so if you're doing something

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.080 
no Vince so if you're doing something
active<00:01:53.179> but<00:01:54.179> if<00:01:54.270> it's<00:01:54.450> you're<00:01:55.050> quite<00:01:55.259> warm<00:01:56.090> you

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
active but if it's you're quite warm you

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.620 
active but if it's you're quite warm you
may<00:01:57.300> well<00:01:57.509> build<00:01:57.750> up<00:01:57.929> this<00:01:58.350> pipe<00:01:58.740> inside<00:01:59.630> of

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
may well build up this pipe inside of

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.969 
may well build up this pipe inside of
course<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.020> can<00:02:01.170> deal<00:02:01.380> with<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.740> with<00:02:01.950> a

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
course you can deal with that with a

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.120 
course you can deal with that with a
marine<00:02:02.369> or<00:02:02.520> base<00:02:02.729> layer<00:02:03.229> but<00:02:04.229> maybe<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.009> want

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
marine or base layer but maybe you want

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.419 
marine or base layer but maybe you want
to<00:02:05.159> take<00:02:05.369> note<00:02:05.580> but<00:02:06.030> this<00:02:06.149> was<00:02:06.300> dead<00:02:06.509> she<00:02:07.429> packs

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
to take note but this was dead she packs

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.670 
to take note but this was dead she packs
away<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:09.600> easy<00:02:09.860> so<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:11.250> would<00:02:11.910> recommend<00:02:12.090> that

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680
