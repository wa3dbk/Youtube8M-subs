00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
now that's 4 mm 400 next one is sinners

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.390 
now that's 4 mm 400 next one is sinners
sinners<00:01:38.790> it's<00:01:39.330> better<00:01:39.710> to<00:01:40.710> make<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.950> shuttle

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
sinners it's better to make a shuttle

become deeper and the limit what the

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.340 
become deeper and the limit what the
opponent<00:01:48.660> can<00:01:48.930> do<00:01:49.220> only<00:01:50.220> another<00:01:50.760> net<00:01:51.350> cross

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
opponent can do only another net cross

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.120 
opponent can do only another net cross
or<00:01:52.770> left<00:01:53.250> option<00:01:53.880> he<00:01:54.660> has<00:01:54.900> so<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:55.980> a

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
or left option he has so this is a

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.660 
or left option he has so this is a
signal<00:01:56.580> let's<00:01:57.090> have<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.050> look<00:01:58.260> please<00:01:58.670> signal

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
signal let's have a look please signal

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.390 
signal let's have a look please signal
map<00:01:59.820> is<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> little<00:02:00.420> bit<00:02:00.510> high<00:02:00.660> here<00:02:01.400> but

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
map is a little bit high here but

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.020 
map is a little bit high here but
shuttle<00:02:03.180> goes<00:02:03.330> straight<00:02:04.140> down<00:02:04.490> now<00:02:05.490> watch<00:02:05.760> the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
shuttle goes straight down now watch the

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.840 
shuttle goes straight down now watch the
shuttle<00:02:06.180> fly

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.790 

now<00:02:11.850> try<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.150> lift<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.569> please

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.670 

okay<00:02:17.800> do<00:02:18.519> that<00:02:19.140> okay<00:02:20.140> try<00:02:20.709> to<00:02:20.739> live<00:02:21.180> again

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
okay do that okay try to live again

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.460 
okay do that okay try to live again
because<00:02:23.680> it's<00:02:23.860> a<00:02:23.980> very<00:02:24.550> tight<00:02:24.989> they<00:02:25.989> only<00:02:26.260> go

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
because it's a very tight they only go

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.140 
because it's a very tight they only go
half<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:28.120> you<00:02:28.269> can<00:02:28.560> kill<00:02:29.560> it

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
half and you can kill it

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.949 
half and you can kill it
okay<00:02:31.150> so<00:02:31.209> the<00:02:32.140> signal<00:02:32.470> net<00:02:32.650> is<00:02:32.890> more<00:02:33.959> little

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
okay so the signal net is more little

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.780 
okay so the signal net is more little
bit<00:02:35.080> high<00:02:35.290> doesn't<00:02:35.920> matter<00:02:36.069> because<00:02:36.310> lazy

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
bit high doesn't matter because lazy

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:54.080 
bit high doesn't matter because lazy
Center<00:02:37.650> then<00:02:39.120> shuttle<00:02:40.120> go<00:02:40.269> to<00:02:40.450> sleep<00:02:41.190> okay

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.080 

very<00:02:55.090> tight<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:56.319> the<00:02:56.470> other<00:02:56.590> side<00:02:56.910> instead<00:02:57.910> of

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
very tight to the other side instead of

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.039 
very tight to the other side instead of
doing<00:02:58.420> that<00:02:58.829> opponent<00:02:59.829> can<00:03:00.040> easily<00:03:00.459> come<00:03:01.049> okay

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
doing that opponent can easily come okay

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:08.940 
doing that opponent can easily come okay
now<00:03:03.480> next<00:03:04.480> one<00:03:04.810> is<00:03:06.150> speed<00:03:07.150> Matt<00:03:07.620> you<00:03:08.620> force

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
now next one is speed Matt you force

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.850 
now next one is speed Matt you force
your<00:03:09.130> parents<00:03:09.640> and<00:03:09.880> you<00:03:10.569> opponent<00:03:11.500> is<00:03:11.620> doing

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
your parents and you opponent is doing

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.850 
your parents and you opponent is doing
the<00:03:12.099> next<00:03:12.310> shot<00:03:12.640> and<00:03:13.329> you<00:03:13.870> take<00:03:14.110> it<00:03:14.260> early<00:03:14.620> and

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
the next shot and you take it early and

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:32.619 
the next shot and you take it early and
spin<00:03:15.640> it<00:03:15.790> to<00:03:16.540> make<00:03:16.750> opponent<00:03:18.060> harder

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:32.629 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.979 

say<00:03:33.920> shuttle<00:03:34.920> should<00:03:35.069> call<00:03:35.340> it<00:03:35.549> will<00:03:35.700> be<00:03:35.790> mod

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
say shuttle should call it will be mod

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:42.050 
say shuttle should call it will be mod
and<00:03:36.989> should<00:03:37.439> go<00:03:38.219> in<00:03:38.370> straight<00:03:38.790> down<00:03:39.920> and<00:03:41.060> I

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
and should go in straight down and I

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:58.560 
and should go in straight down and I
call<00:03:42.450> it<00:03:42.689> kind<00:03:43.049> of<00:03:43.260> idiot

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.220 

okay<00:03:59.810> so<00:04:00.500> there<00:04:01.070> are<00:04:01.100> normal<00:04:01.700> net<00:04:02.230> nomads

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
okay so there are normal net nomads

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.250 
okay so there are normal net nomads
happen<00:04:03.850> Stoppers<00:04:04.850> net<00:04:05.120> which<00:04:05.390> is<00:04:05.420> goes<00:04:05.810> flat

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
happen Stoppers net which is goes flat

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.100 
happen Stoppers net which is goes flat
single<00:04:09.260> net<00:04:09.460> little<00:04:10.460> bit<00:04:10.550> high<00:04:10.730> but<00:04:11.690> Len<00:04:11.930> the

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
single net little bit high but Len the

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.210 
single net little bit high but Len the
very<00:04:12.350> slip<00:04:12.850> steeper<00:04:14.020> last<00:04:15.020> one<00:04:15.380> is<00:04:15.590> a<00:04:15.620> spin<00:04:16.010> net

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
very slip steeper last one is a spin net

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.470 
very slip steeper last one is a spin net
you<00:04:16.760> take<00:04:17.030> it<00:04:17.150> early

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
you take it early

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.540 
you take it early
spin<00:04:18.410> it<00:04:18.610> so<00:04:19.610> apparent<00:04:20.030> find<00:04:20.750> it<00:04:20.959> difficult<00:04:21.290> to
