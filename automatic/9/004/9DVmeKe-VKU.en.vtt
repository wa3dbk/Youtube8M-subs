00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.630
 the town hall of holidays and Christmas suddenly with the secretary of 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.830
 agriculture has been benefiting the settlers of the 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.740
 knowledge and safety for the rural workers who live there 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.510
 May 16 was the closing of two more courses the first 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.710
 dairy cattle informing students about ways of feeding heifers 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.310
 insemination categories weight control 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.610
 delivery of vaccines and the vaccination schedule and the second 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.150
 nutrition of dairy cattle 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.850
 which informed the students about the latest information on 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.780
 Low-quality dairy cattle 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.150
 students also learned how to burn grass to keep 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.400
 feeding of animals in the dry season when pasture 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.729
 nor did they learn how to defend themselves against ticks and flies. 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:07.280
 with poison with zero cost to the rural producer the senar instructor speaks 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.080
 about the course of these courses of ead meeting 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.390
 almost 60 days of license to seek knowledge 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.330
 so through the secretary 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.230
 turn up and get milk and see more others that will add 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.910
 in the knowledge of each one of them here has a low cost and today 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.890
 produce more every day with the old agriculture secretariat half that 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.080
 was also present at closing in talking about things the city has a 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.530
 with senna rejane since the beginning of the mandate has been bringing 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.530
 some courses here 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.520
 But now it is already directing efforts together with the 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.740
 at the moment of productive chains of the 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.040
 then it already has a function in hand 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.520
 more specific than the courses have been brought in former employer and shows 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.200
 How long is the course? 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.620
 the course is 5 days 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.900
 goal during a period 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.090
 ef 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.360
 the vast majority of these courses we have solid results 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.490
 five days has also been used and the students have attended I do not know nor 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.589
 if you have is actually the scenarios would allow a maximum of 15 year students 

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:23.019
 so we always have a higher demand than these 15 students currently 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.239
 do not have to bring more times more courses of more than seven times same lap 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.239
 other 26 courses benefit the settlers 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.559
 then it is how it is already inserted in a proposal of a productive chain 

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:36.389
 as is the case of milk here 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:40.299
 and it will be a direct function for them so they can handle their 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:45.029
 that they are able to get a better quality 

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:45.849
 income 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.950
 the students left satisfied with the courses and confident to 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.979
 practice the dea how long you are in the settlement in anapÃº 

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:56.859
 It has been three years since I lived here. 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:59.409
 and that you learned from the situation 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:05.009
 things too much of you eg a low cost to keep cattle during drought 

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:09.259
 in some home remedies that we can also do to combat 

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:12.529
 ticks 

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:15.789
 I also learned how to make silage 

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:20.239
 it has a very low cost as it is basically we only pay the hand of 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:21.409
 obama 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:27.349
 for this your argentina during the dry season they benefited 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:29.099

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.329
 in learning more and how to care for my daughter how to feed the world are 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.329

 You already work with dairy cattle. I'm starting the police now. 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.129
 in the experience many people 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:59.939
 to feel satisfied with it if such 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:01.819

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.069
