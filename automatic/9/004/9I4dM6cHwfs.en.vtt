00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.980 

this<00:00:00.690> is<00:00:00.810> it<00:00:00.989> the<00:00:01.230> long-awaited<00:00:02.689> camera<00:00:03.689> to

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
this is it the long-awaited camera to

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.870 
this is it the long-awaited camera to
the<00:00:04.080> bottom<00:00:04.380> of<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.500> plane<00:00:07.580> this<00:00:08.580> will<00:00:08.730> be

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
the bottom of the plane this will be

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.209 
the bottom of the plane this will be
interesting<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.630> see<00:00:09.929> if<00:00:10.050> it<00:00:10.170> stays<00:00:10.440> on<00:00:10.650> this

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
interesting to see if it stays on this

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.589 
interesting to see if it stays on this
is<00:00:11.309> really<00:00:11.639> awkward<00:00:11.790> because<00:00:12.059> that<00:00:12.360> you<00:00:12.509> know

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
is really awkward because that you know

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.580 
is really awkward because that you know
it's<00:00:12.719> all<00:00:12.840> upside<00:00:13.139> down<00:00:17.840> okay<00:00:18.840> all<00:00:19.320> right<00:00:19.439> well

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
it's all upside down okay all right well

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.929 
it's all upside down okay all right well
don't<00:00:19.740> put<00:00:19.920> your<00:00:20.039> finger<00:00:20.340> in<00:00:20.369> front<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.820> that

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
don't put your finger in front of that

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.480 
don't put your finger in front of that
so<00:00:21.480> that<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:21.779> can<00:00:21.810> focus<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.439> right<00:00:23.510> difficult

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
so that you can focus it right difficult

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.660 
so that you can focus it right difficult
when<00:00:26.490> there's<00:00:26.640> tape<00:00:26.910> over<00:00:27.390> there<00:00:27.599> everything

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
when there's tape over there everything

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.510 
when there's tape over there everything
okay<00:00:30.380> okay<00:00:31.380> yeah<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.710> prop<00:00:31.920> covers<00:00:32.309> like

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
okay okay yeah the prop covers like

00:00:32.520 --> 00:01:06.700 
okay okay yeah the prop covers like
about<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.510> top<00:00:33.690> half<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.200> screen<00:00:34.290> hit<00:00:35.219> it

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:13.380 

plane<00:01:07.280> is<00:01:07.670> that's<00:01:08.360> betting<00:01:08.900> still<00:01:12.250> what

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
plane is that's betting still what

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.370 
plane is that's betting still what
wasn't<00:01:14.390> really<00:01:14.630> paying<00:01:14.750> attention<00:01:14.840> for<00:01:15.290> a

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
wasn't really paying attention for a

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.340

yeah<00:03:59.160> really<00:04:00.160> nice<00:04:00.459> it's<00:04:01.209> almost<00:04:01.420> the<00:04:01.660> camera

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
yeah really nice it's almost the camera

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.229 
yeah really nice it's almost the camera
almost<00:04:02.200> acts<00:04:02.379> like<00:04:02.470> a<00:04:02.620> flap<00:04:03.120> cuz<00:04:04.120> I<00:04:04.150> just

almost acts like a flap cuz I just

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.080 
almost acts like a flap cuz I just
create<00:04:04.750> yeah<00:04:04.959> more<00:04:05.530> maybe<00:04:06.340> a<00:04:06.459> push<00:04:06.670> up<00:04:06.819> some<00:04:07.000> of

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090

the<00:04:07.150> air<00:04:07.269> down<00:04:21.330> you<00:04:22.330> know<00:04:22.450> if<00:04:22.660> I<00:04:22.780> was<00:04:22.960> trying<00:04:23.310> to

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
the air down you know if I was trying to

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.719 
the air down you know if I was trying to
damage<00:04:24.729> that<00:04:25.360> SD<00:04:26.020> camera<00:04:26.440> I<00:04:26.770> could<00:04:27.430> not<00:04:27.610> have

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
damage that SD camera I could not have

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.770 
damage that SD camera I could not have
picked<00:04:27.910> a<00:04:28.120> better<00:04:28.260> way<00:04:29.260> to<00:04:29.290> do<00:04:29.620> it<00:04:30.510> and<00:04:31.510> also

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
picked a better way to do it and also

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.000 
picked a better way to do it and also
that<00:04:31.960> would<00:04:32.080> have<00:04:32.169> put<00:04:32.290> a<00:04:32.350> lot<00:04:32.470> of<00:04:32.590> stress<00:04:32.800> on

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
that would have put a lot of stress on

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:43.090 
that would have put a lot of stress on
them<00:04:33.160> Wow<00:04:35.880> alright

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.810 

okay<00:04:44.440> this<00:04:45.440> little<00:04:45.680> push<00:04:45.860> back<00:04:46.070> little<00:04:46.640> push

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
okay this little push back little push

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.670 
okay this little push back little push
back<00:04:47.000> but<00:04:47.330> that's<00:04:47.420> to<00:04:47.660> see<00:04:47.780> the<00:04:47.960> tape<00:04:48.170> broke<00:04:48.440> I

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
back but that's to see the tape broke I

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.290 
back but that's to see the tape broke I
bet<00:04:49.040> I<00:04:49.070> wonder<00:04:49.370> if<00:04:49.430> it's<00:04:49.520> still<00:04:49.580> recording<00:04:49.820> do

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
bet I wonder if it's still recording do

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
we can just try it again that was a

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
we can just try it again that was a
really<00:05:16.460> nice<00:05:19.960> I'll<00:05:20.960> do<00:05:21.290> really<00:05:24.880> this<00:05:25.880> is<00:05:26.090> not

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
really nice I'll do really this is not

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.040

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.490 
looking good
I<00:05:28.570> can't<00:05:29.570> believe<00:05:29.750> it<00:05:29.870> just<00:05:30.020> stayed<00:05:30.230> on<00:05:30.380> the

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
I can't believe it just stayed on the

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.930 
I can't believe it just stayed on the
plane<00:05:30.590> the<00:05:30.830> whole<00:05:30.860> time<00:05:31.750> only<00:05:32.750> to<00:05:33.080> be

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
plane the whole time only to be

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.500 
plane the whole time only to be
destroyed<00:05:34.940> on<00:05:35.120> landing<00:05:35.540> yes<00:05:35.930> you<00:05:36.740> serious

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
destroyed on landing yes you serious

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.940

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
it's not coming back out it doesn't look

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.060 
it's not coming back out it doesn't look
good<00:05:43.070> I<00:05:43.280> think<00:05:43.820> I<00:05:44.320> think<00:05:45.320> if<00:05:45.530> you<00:05:45.680> mess<00:05:45.890> with

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
good I think I think if you mess with

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.540 
good I think I think if you mess with
the<00:05:46.220> sticks<00:05:46.520> you<00:05:47.140> get<00:05:48.140> it<00:05:48.260> on<00:05:48.440> take<00:05:49.280> it<00:05:49.370> apart

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
the sticks you get it on take it apart

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.520 
the sticks you get it on take it apart
and<00:05:49.730> maybe<00:05:49.850> rebuild<00:05:50.330> the<00:05:50.540> motors<00:05:51.230> because<00:05:51.290> it

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
and maybe rebuild the motors because it

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:52.930 
and maybe rebuild the motors because it
probably<00:05:51.650> just<00:05:51.920> snapped<00:05:52.130> out<00:05:52.340> of<00:05:52.400> the<00:05:52.520> years

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
probably just snapped out of the years

00:05:52.940 --> 00:06:01.719 
probably just snapped out of the years
hmm

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:01.729 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:03.789
