if I can get the soup itself right on my
stove<00:04:01.599> here<00:04:02.129> and<00:04:03.129> I'll<00:04:03.219> actually<00:04:03.430> let<00:04:05.340> just<00:04:06.340> a

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
stove here and I'll actually let just a

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.080 
stove here and I'll actually let just a
little<00:04:06.609> too<00:04:06.790> small<00:04:07.090> huh<00:04:07.299> yeah<00:04:08.639> so<00:04:09.639> we'll<00:04:10.060> use

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
little too small huh yeah so we'll use

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.179 
little too small huh yeah so we'll use
the<00:04:10.450> 700<00:04:12.450> it's<00:04:13.450> also<00:04:13.659> just<00:04:14.170> slightly<00:04:14.620> small<00:04:15.069> we

00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:15.189 
the 700 it's also just slightly small we

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:16.949 
the 700 it's also just slightly small we
might<00:04:15.400> have<00:04:15.519> to<00:04:15.639> bend<00:04:15.879> those<00:04:16.030> tips<00:04:16.389> in<00:04:16.630> just<00:04:16.840> a

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
might have to bend those tips in just a

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:25.409 
might have to bend those tips in just a
little<00:04:17.109> bit<00:04:21.780> and<00:04:23.849> we'll<00:04:24.849> see<00:04:25.000> how<00:04:25.090> long<00:04:25.240> this

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
little bit and we'll see how long this

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.920 
little bit and we'll see how long this
takes<00:04:25.630> to<00:04:25.840> cook<00:04:26.020> this<00:04:26.889> is<00:04:27.130> a<00:04:27.509> we're<00:04:28.509> up<00:04:28.630> pretty

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
takes to cook this is a we're up pretty

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.610 
takes to cook this is a we're up pretty
close<00:04:29.380> to<00:04:29.620> 10,000<00:04:30.250> feet<00:04:30.400> I'd<00:04:30.669> say<00:04:30.849> we're<00:04:31.030> about

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
close to 10,000 feet I'd say we're about

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.860 
close to 10,000 feet I'd say we're about
95<00:04:32.620> 96<00:04:34.169> so<00:04:35.639> we<00:04:36.639> time<00:04:37.000> this<00:04:37.180> and<00:04:37.419> see<00:04:37.539> how<00:04:37.660> long

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
95 96 so we time this and see how long

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.129 
95 96 so we time this and see how long
it<00:04:38.050> takes<00:04:38.289> I'll<00:04:39.360> turn<00:04:40.360> the<00:04:40.449> camera<00:04:40.750> back<00:04:40.780> on
