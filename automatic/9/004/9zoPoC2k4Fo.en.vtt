the height the other thing that people
don't<00:02:03.960> generally<00:02:04.530> realize<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.520> team

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
don't generally realize is that a team

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.850 
don't generally realize is that a team
that<00:02:06.060> maybe<00:02:06.270> constructs<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.079> tower<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.560> nine

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
that maybe constructs a tower of nine

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.130 
that maybe constructs a tower of nine
levels<00:02:08.280> you'd<00:02:09.060> think<00:02:09.209> oh<00:02:09.390> well<00:02:09.599> next<00:02:09.840> week

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
levels you'd think oh well next week

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.100 
levels you'd think oh well next week
we'll<00:02:10.349> put<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.560> we'll<00:02:10.890> make<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.160> ten<00:02:11.340> levels

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
we'll put a we'll make it ten levels

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.510 
we'll put a we'll make it ten levels
it<00:02:12.200> can<00:02:12.350> take<00:02:12.470> four<00:02:12.800> or<00:02:12.890> five<00:02:13.040> years<00:02:13.430> to

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
it can take four or five years to

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.280 
it can take four or five years to
progress<00:02:14.000> one<00:02:14.270> extra<00:02:14.630> level<00:02:14.900> of<00:02:14.960> that<00:02:15.140> get

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
progress one extra level of that get

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.220 
progress one extra level of that get
that<00:02:15.470> kind<00:02:15.710> of<00:02:15.860> high<00:02:16.180> I'm<00:02:17.180> going<00:02:17.450> in<00:02:17.570> now<00:02:17.780> it

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
that kind of high I'm going in now it

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.230 
that kind of high I'm going in now it
was<00:02:18.350> time<00:02:18.590> for<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.860> big<00:02:19.070> moment<00:02:19.100> as<00:02:19.910> Mikael

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
was time for the big moment as Mikael

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.980 
was time for the big moment as Mikael
invites<00:02:20.630> me<00:02:20.990> to<00:02:21.230> join<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.680> main<00:02:21.830> event<00:02:22.130> here

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
invites me to join the main event here

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.870 
invites me to join the main event here
around<00:02:23.990> here<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.980> strong<00:02:25.250> base<00:02:25.430> is<00:02:25.670> so

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
around here the strong base is so

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.400 
around here the strong base is so
important<00:02:26.330> to<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.480> structure<00:02:26.870> that<00:02:27.140> if<00:02:27.290> it's

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
important to the structure that if it's

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.810 
important to the structure that if it's
too<00:02:27.590> weak<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:28.130> tower<00:02:28.550> could<00:02:28.880> collapse<00:02:29.620> and

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
too weak the tower could collapse and

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.540 
too weak the tower could collapse and
it's<00:02:31.820> getting<00:02:32.120> a<00:02:32.180> bit<00:02:32.360> too<00:02:32.570> close<00:02:32.600> for<00:02:33.050> comfort

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
it's getting a bit too close for comfort

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.770 
it's getting a bit too close for comfort
the<00:02:34.550> people<00:02:34.910> at<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.060> bottom<00:02:35.390> of<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.600> tower

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
the people at the bottom of the tower

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.900 
the people at the bottom of the tower
can't<00:02:36.200> see<00:02:36.410> what's<00:02:36.620> going<00:02:36.650> on<00:02:36.980> so<00:02:37.520> the<00:02:37.640> music

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
can't see what's going on so the music

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.420 
can't see what's going on so the music
tells<00:02:38.420> them<00:02:38.690> when<00:02:38.959> to<00:02:38.990> hold<00:02:39.260> on<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:39.709> when<00:02:40.220> to

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
tells them when to hold on and when to

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:53.530 
tells them when to hold on and when to
let<00:02:40.550> go<00:02:40.930> there<00:02:41.930> it<00:02:42.080> goes<00:02:51.430> here<00:02:52.430> comes<00:02:52.700> ina<00:02:52.940> just

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
let go there it goes here comes ina just

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.900 
let go there it goes here comes ina just
9<00:02:53.750> remember<00:02:54.200> she's<00:02:54.770> going<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.160> form<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.580> top

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
9 remember she's going to form the top

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.840 
9 remember she's going to form the top
of<00:02:56.180> this<00:02:56.390> 7<00:02:56.930> level<00:02:57.320> tower<00:03:00.550> that<00:03:01.550> sound

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
of this 7 level tower that sound

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.140 
of this 7 level tower that sound
signifies<00:03:02.270> but<00:03:02.480> almost<00:03:02.660> at<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:02.959> end<00:03:03.110> yes<00:03:03.620> and

Ines lifted her hand she's made it she's

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.740 
Ines lifted her hand she's made it she's
completed<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:07.910> tower<00:03:08.150> it's<00:03:08.690> a<00:03:09.050> success

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750

the one at the bottom I can just tell me
the<00:03:38.130> same<00:03:38.310> height<00:03:38.490> as<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:38.730> tower<00:03:39.140> so<00:03:40.140> true<00:03:40.410> any

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:40.710 
the same height as the tower so true any

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.430 
the same height as the tower so true any
longer<00:03:41.040> I'd<00:03:41.160> be<00:03:41.250> later
