00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.660
 Hello dear friends with you Nikita 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.570
 and now it will go slashers under 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.830
 named batman the arkham chronicle or 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.860
 arkham origins 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.949
 This game is from the developers of warner bros 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.880
 international and honestly tell me she 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.580
 like it but it belongs to the genre of those 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.189
 games where you have to iron a lot 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.250
 iron the screen of your device therefore 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.090
 I played it just to 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.280
 share with you your impressions and 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.350
 advise you to play if you are in it 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.410
 have not played because it is available 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.719
 free games in March, a little more weight 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.710
 one and a half gigabytes it is justified 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.829
 huge amount of content and graphics 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.690
 and that, in principle, more precisely because of what I do not 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.530
 began to run it on his old 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.590
 the tablet took off the phone too sodium on 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:03.629
 320 all will look better than on 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:06.450
 power vr 530 and so in this game we 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.060
 have you play for batman 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.939
 which which has several 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.400
 costumes again here was not without 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.890
 Donat will constantly ask you for 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.040
 Donat as in-game currency but 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.440
 buying any improvements or combos and 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.720
 and yet you can do without them on 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.910
 it will be very hard to knock you down 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.830
 because every time there will be everything 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.040
 more and more opponents of which 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.700
 need to win in one battle every costume 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.170
 gives you how but 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.960
 increase in damage increase in stock hepe 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.420
 improvements improved and stand here you can 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.310
 change racks ie defense attack or 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.320
 your skills that basically too 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.960
 cool and it needs to be pumped 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.420
 I also liked the fact that it is very 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.789
 many elements of all kinds of tests 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.429
 so on then there are boards of leaders and here 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.590
 I like such projects very much when 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.780
 developers show that they are not 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.289
 scored a game and constantly something somewhere 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.989
 holds prizes for it and so on in 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:11.930
 In general , everything else is normal 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:15.849
 slasher you fight remember new 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.440
 combo you need to have time to put blocks or 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.930
 use your abilities there super 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.079
 strikes in order to finish off or just 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.319
 about to report also you will meet 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:29.720
 bosses and just career assignments and also 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.390
 There are tasks on which you can just 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.849
 farm currency and something somewhere to improve 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.180
 although it's a very long story honestly 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:41.180
 I'll tell you, oh well, in principle, such 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.639
 here's a toy nothing special 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.340
