00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 Hi guys, how are you? You're welcome today. 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.870
 with the book's convergent book 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.639
 veronica roth that the last book of 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.809
 series I was crazy to read to 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.210
 find out what happened to the 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.519
 characters to discover the end of this 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.029
 cei and ended by saying that I did not 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.910
 like the end but then at the end of this 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.619
 video explains why and will be a 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.740
 part that will have spoiler so I go 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.480
 tell someone who has not read the book to 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.670
 Who does not want to know to close the video? 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.619
 but the first part will be no choice 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.969
 It's going to be a quick book review. 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.640
 because I can not talk too much 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.440
 thing but then I'll explain the 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.350
 because I did not like the ending 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.820
 this book that begins when the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.340
 that he is feeling that video that 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.710
 that there is a society and beyond 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.809
 of the gates that is not only that city 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.329
 that they are not alone that exists 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.039
 a world other people and is a 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.570
 book with a very fast pace everything 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.430
 happens so fast 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.039
 each country until a new event 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.230
 so very easy to read level and of course 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.270
 you must already imagine that you have a group 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.400
 who wants out and find out if this is all 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.390
 true if there is anything beyond 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.299
 gates 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.460
 and also you already imagine that the actress did not 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.369
 You will want to stay out of it all. 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.070
 But here comes Tobias' mother. 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.460
 of course she will not allow it because 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.700
 She wants the power there for her. 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.549
 keep everyone there and they changed the 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.290
 system of factions by a system not 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.630
 very different because they 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.369
 still have no more factions but 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.950
 they still have to obey not 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.079
 have the right to choose has no power of 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.060
 decision has nothing of the kind in which 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.759
 quite surprised that book was 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.850
 a lot of tobias so expect a surprise 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.430
 her and tobias also well military 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.439
 and full of confusing conflicts that 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.439
 book and actress is trying again 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.659
 But for him I'll switch between the 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.060
 vision of thirteen of rose then I can not 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.920
 count more than that , but I 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.130
 I can tell you it's a book full of action. 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.250
 full of events and has a fact 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.020
 surprising is not that I think it's 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.860
 everybody knowing why nobody 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.840
 could manage and end up talking 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.880
 But for those who do not know it's still a 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.800
 seem astonishing when he read 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.880
 the book and he said I did not like 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.650
 end of the book 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.750
 but I also think the author left 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.270
 some loose ends and some things 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.760
 she could have explored more and 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.890
 but it's still a great book, I 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.560
 I really did not like the ending, but I will. 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.650
 explain why so who does not want 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.260
 knowing who has not read the book closes the 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.830
 because you now see if the part you have 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.830
 spoiler 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.819
 You know that I really like books. 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.409
 with happy endings but it was not so 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.360
 I did not like the end of this book 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:51.909
 because I like several books that have 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.340
 the end so sad but we know 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:58.000
 that are built for this and I think 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.069
 that this was not in in books that have 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.810
 end in super sad we see that the 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.390
 book was all built by that 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.329
 end I think this one was not forgotten 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.819
 was built with the final fully 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:12.459
 different and they kind of did not know 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.290
 fit in my opinion I think because the 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.280
 author made us believe that the actress 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.170
 And survive 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.840
 the media clearly stated that it would protect 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.760
 The brother was already written that she is 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.940
 protect his brother did not have a 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.099
 doubts about this and that it also went 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.889
 author of death was already certain 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:31.930
 it was no surprise why she was 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:34.629
 immune to all other dreams that in 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.730
 other emerging is not so I had 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:39.129
 sure that the dream would survive too 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.579
 of death but she died a very 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:44.760
 silly because of course it was a death in the 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:47.109
 work died to save his brother but was 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.019
 silly because she died like shots 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:53.470
 survived everything you sold all over 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:56.440
 series and ended up dying with a 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.120
 survived the shadow of death so I 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.129
 I really think they got the tips 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.120
 loose on the level I think there are some 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.359
 things she could have explored 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.060
 better actress in munich 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:08.709
 the only one that is immune to all others 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.440
 so I think I could have explored 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.599
 and it better be really interesting is 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.389
 This is a great series. It's a great book. 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.829
 I will not stop liking sep 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.019
 that the end did not please me 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.039
 I still like the series of the same 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.449
 way 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:25.570
 so I hope you have liked 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:27.810
 from the review a super kiss until the next 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.810
 video
