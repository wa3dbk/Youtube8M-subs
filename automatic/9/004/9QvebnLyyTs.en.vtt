hi<00:00:02.970> friends<00:00:03.300> today<00:00:03.360> we<00:00:03.600> are<00:00:03.840> going<00:00:03.990> to<00:00:04.200> be

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
hi friends today we are going to be

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.000 
hi friends today we are going to be
looking<00:00:04.500> at<00:00:04.920> how<00:00:05.910> we<00:00:05.940> rename<00:00:06.870> mixed<00:00:07.560> numbers

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
looking at how we rename mixed numbers

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.089 
looking at how we rename mixed numbers
when<00:00:08.309> subtracting<00:00:09.110> so<00:00:10.110> yesterday<00:00:10.410> we<00:00:10.800> talked

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
when subtracting so yesterday we talked

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.470 
when subtracting so yesterday we talked
a<00:00:11.250> little<00:00:11.370> bit<00:00:11.550> about<00:00:11.849> adding<00:00:12.360> and

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
a little bit about adding and

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.930 
a little bit about adding and
subtracting<00:00:12.900> fractions<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.860> we<00:00:14.460> renamed

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
subtracting fractions and we renamed

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.150 
subtracting fractions and we renamed
mixed<00:00:15.299> numbers<00:00:15.690> with<00:00:16.020> an<00:00:16.139> improper<00:00:16.680> fractions

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
mixed numbers with an improper fractions

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.920 
mixed numbers with an improper fractions
when<00:00:17.340> we<00:00:17.460> are<00:00:17.550> adding<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.630> we're<00:00:18.779> going<00:00:18.900> to

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
when we are adding and we're going to

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.439 
when we are adding and we're going to
start<00:00:19.230> off<00:00:19.410> by<00:00:19.650> trying<00:00:19.980> network<00:00:20.430> today<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:21.090> I

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
start off by trying network today and I

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.240 
start off by trying network today and I
want<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.720> remind<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.109> again<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.619> all<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:23.160> the

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
things that we already know they act as

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.709 
things that we already know they act as
our<00:00:34.710> prior<00:00:35.070> knowledge<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:36.239> will<00:00:36.360> help<00:00:36.570> us

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
answer the questions we do today so we

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.869 
answer the questions we do today so we
know<00:00:39.570> how<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.780> create<00:00:40.200> models<00:00:40.860> using<00:00:41.460> pictures

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
know how to create models using pictures

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.350 
know how to create models using pictures
we<00:00:42.719> can<00:00:42.930> decompose<00:00:43.730> fractions<00:00:44.730> using<00:00:44.940> unit

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
we can decompose fractions using unit

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.170 
we can decompose fractions using unit
fractions<00:00:45.870> we<00:00:46.440> can<00:00:46.649> write<00:00:46.890> expressions<00:00:47.460> using

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
fractions we can write expressions using

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.229 
fractions we can write expressions using
unit<00:00:48.600> fractions<00:00:49.140> we<00:00:49.829> can<00:00:50.010> add<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.730> subtract

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
unit fractions we can add and subtract

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.380 
unit fractions we can add and subtract
fractions<00:00:51.629> with<00:00:52.170> like<00:00:52.379> denominators<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:53.520> we

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
fractions with like denominators and we

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.920 
fractions with like denominators and we
can<00:00:54.629> rename<00:00:55.230> mixed<00:00:55.680> numbers<00:00:56.070> with<00:00:56.640> an

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
can rename mixed numbers with an

can rename mixed numbers with an
improper<00:00:57.930> fraction<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.859> today<00:00:59.520> we're<00:00:59.760> going

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
improper fraction and today we're going

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.400 
improper fraction and today we're going
to<00:00:59.969> try<00:01:00.180> renaming<00:01:00.570> mixed<00:01:00.930> numbers<00:01:01.199> when

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
to try renaming mixed numbers when

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.450 
to try renaming mixed numbers when
subtracting<00:01:01.820> but<00:01:02.820> first<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:04.019> want<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.040> do<00:01:05.220> one

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
subtracting but first I want to do one

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.800 
subtracting but first I want to do one
of<00:01:05.489> those<00:01:05.670> problems<00:01:06.680> that<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:07.770> did<00:01:07.950> yesterday

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
of those problems that we did yesterday

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.140 
of those problems that we did yesterday
when<00:01:09.810> we<00:01:10.049> add<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.950> we<00:01:11.460> saw<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.760> the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
when we add it and we saw that the

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.480 
when we add it and we saw that the
answer<00:01:12.659> had<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> mixed<00:01:13.350> number<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:14.340> an

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
answer had a mixed number and an

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.609 
answer had a mixed number and an
improper<00:01:15.119> fraction<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.750> what<00:01:15.869> we<00:01:16.020> had<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.439> do

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
improper fraction and what we had to do

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.190 
improper fraction and what we had to do
to<00:01:17.280> fix<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:18.060> let's<00:01:18.270> do<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.659> example

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
to fix that so let's do the example

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.330 
to fix that so let's do the example
three<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:20.490> four<00:01:21.150> fifths<00:01:21.750> plus<00:01:23.509> one<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:25.340> two

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
three and four fifths plus one and two

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.600 
three and four fifths plus one and two
fifths<00:01:27.140> so<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.170> know<00:01:28.320> when<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.680> answer<00:01:29.189> this<00:01:29.340> i

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
fifths so I know when I answer this i

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.660 
fifths so I know when I answer this i
use<00:01:30.180> my<00:01:30.450> mixed<00:01:30.960> numbers<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.740> break<00:01:32.400> them<00:01:32.610> down

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
use my mixed numbers I break them down

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.359 
use my mixed numbers I break them down
into<00:01:32.909> whole<00:01:33.810> numbers<00:01:34.350> first<00:01:34.650> three<00:01:34.979> plus<00:01:35.250> one

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
into whole numbers first three plus one

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.469 
into whole numbers first three plus one
is<00:01:35.729> four<00:01:36.740> then<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:38.070> look<00:01:38.579> for<00:01:38.850> my<00:01:38.939> denominator

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
is four then I look for my denominator

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.140 
is four then I look for my denominator
which<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.650> five<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:40.920> know<00:01:41.189> that's<00:01:41.640> going<00:01:42.030> to

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
which is five I know that's going to

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.410 
which is five I know that's going to
stay<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.720> same<00:01:43.189> then<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.220> add<00:01:44.520> my<00:01:44.549> numerator

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
stay the same then I add my numerator

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.020 
stay the same then I add my numerator
four<00:01:46.140> plus<00:01:47.270> 24<00:01:48.270> plus<00:01:48.299> two<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:49.079> six<00:01:50.070> now<00:01:50.909> I'm

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
four plus 24 plus two is six now I'm

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.880 
four plus 24 plus two is six now I'm
looking<00:01:51.329> at<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.479> sensing<00:01:51.930> great<00:01:52.619> i'm<00:01:52.770> all

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
looking at the sensing great i'm all

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.230 
looking at the sensing great i'm all
done<00:01:53.040> but<00:01:53.939> i'm<00:01:54.470> noticing<00:01:55.520> that<00:01:56.520> this<00:01:56.850> mixed

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
done but i'm noticing that this mixed

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.609 
done but i'm noticing that this mixed
number<00:01:57.600> includes<00:01:58.259> an<00:01:58.790> improper<00:01:59.790> fraction<00:02:00.619> so

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
number includes an improper fraction so

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.280 
number includes an improper fraction so
i<00:02:01.890> need<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.280> change<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:03.060> improper<00:02:03.960> fraction

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
i need to change that improper fraction

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.199 
i need to change that improper fraction
so<00:02:07.290> i'm<00:02:07.380> going<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.619> rewrite<00:02:08.000> four<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.720> six<00:02:10.349> six

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
so i'm going to rewrite four and six six

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.400 
so i'm going to rewrite four and six six
this<00:02:12.209> six<00:02:12.660> myth

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
this six myth

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.520 
this six myth
is<00:02:13.530> what<00:02:13.710> i<00:02:13.740> need<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.130> change<00:02:14.610> so<00:02:15.420> i'm<00:02:15.690> going<00:02:16.200> to

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
is what i need to change so i'm going to

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.620 
is what i need to change so i'm going to
count<00:02:17.180> thighs<00:02:18.180> thighs<00:02:18.660> because<00:02:19.080> that's<00:02:19.500> my

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
count thighs thighs because that's my

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.140 
count thighs thighs because that's my
denominator<00:02:21.710> so<00:02:22.710> i<00:02:23.010> need<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.460> count<00:02:23.700> by<00:02:23.850> 5's

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
denominator so i need to count by 5's

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.060 
denominator so i need to count by 5's
until<00:02:24.600> i<00:02:24.630> get<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.960> six<00:02:25.380> so<00:02:25.620> i<00:02:25.680> can<00:02:25.830> count<00:02:26.090> five

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
until i get to six so i can count five

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.230 
until i get to six so i can count five
plus<00:02:29.420> one<00:02:30.420> gives<00:02:31.290> me<00:02:31.590> 6<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.430> this<00:02:32.640> is<00:02:32.880> going<00:02:33.090> to

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
plus one gives me 6 and this is going to

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.730 
plus one gives me 6 and this is going to
be<00:02:33.330> fit<00:02:33.600> as<00:02:33.870> well<00:02:33.930> we<00:02:34.230> keep<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.560> denominator

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
be fit as well we keep the denominator

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.850 
be fit as well we keep the denominator
the<00:02:35.310> scene<00:02:35.720> so<00:02:36.720> now<00:02:36.870> i'm<00:02:36.990> looking<00:02:37.110> this<00:02:37.410> NSYNC

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
the scene so now i'm looking this NSYNC

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.800 
the scene so now i'm looking this NSYNC
for<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.970> i<00:02:39.630> just<00:02:39.810> changed<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.290> six<00:02:40.590> fifths

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
for and i just changed the six fifths

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:49.460 
for and i just changed the six fifths
256<00:02:43.640> and<00:02:44.720> one-fifth<00:02:46.640> so<00:02:47.640> four<00:02:48.300> plus<00:02:48.660> five

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
256 and one-fifth so four plus five

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.900 
256 and one-fifth so four plus five
fifths<00:02:50.040> plus<00:02:50.270> 150<00:02:51.270> Qualls<00:02:52.490> I'm<00:02:53.490> going<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.730> make

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
fifths plus 150 Qualls I'm going to make

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.770 
fifths plus 150 Qualls I'm going to make
one<00:02:53.940> more<00:02:54.300> change<00:02:54.360> i<00:02:54.810> know<00:02:54.870> 5<00:02:55.260> 6<00:02:55.680> equals<00:02:56.310> 1<00:02:56.790> so<00:02:57.450> 4

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
one more change i know 5 6 equals 1 so 4

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.770 
one more change i know 5 6 equals 1 so 4
plus<00:02:57.810> 1<00:02:58.350> is<00:02:58.620> 5<00:02:59.190> plus<00:02:59.670> 1<00:03:00.510> 5th<00:03:01.230> is<00:03:01.440> five<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.780> 16

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
plus 1 is 5 plus 1 5th is five and 16

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.480 
plus 1 is 5 plus 1 5th is five and 16
we're<00:03:04.710> going<00:03:05.130> to<00:03:05.250> use<00:03:05.460> the<00:03:05.730> same<00:03:06.140> idea<00:03:07.490> when

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
we're going to use the same idea when

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.170 
we're going to use the same idea when
we're<00:03:08.700> subtracting<00:03:09.410> so<00:03:10.410> take<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:10.650> minute<00:03:11.180> get

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
we're subtracting so take a minute get

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.310 
we're subtracting so take a minute get
this<00:03:12.420> in<00:03:12.630> and<00:03:12.810> we're<00:03:12.900> going<00:03:13.020> to<00:03:13.080> try<00:03:13.260> the

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
this in and we're going to try the

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:21.350 
this in and we're going to try the
subtraction<00:03:19.310> ok<00:03:20.310> friends<00:03:20.670> let's<00:03:21.000> try<00:03:21.300> this

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
subtraction ok friends let's try this

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.160 
subtraction ok friends let's try this
subtraction<00:03:21.930> problem<00:03:22.650> 7<00:03:23.340> and<00:03:23.790> 1<00:03:24.030> 5th<00:03:24.360> minus<00:03:24.720> 4

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
subtraction problem 7 and 1 5th minus 4

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.990 
subtraction problem 7 and 1 5th minus 4
and<00:03:25.350> 3<00:03:25.530> bits<00:03:25.740> now<00:03:26.070> I<00:03:26.100> know<00:03:26.220> I<00:03:26.370> can<00:03:26.610> do<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.790> same

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
and 3 bits now I know I can do the same

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.380 
and 3 bits now I know I can do the same
steps<00:03:27.360> as<00:03:27.480> I<00:03:27.600> did<00:03:27.780> before<00:03:27.900> I<00:03:28.730> look<00:03:29.730> at<00:03:29.880> my<00:03:30.030> whole

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
steps as I did before I look at my whole

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.440 
steps as I did before I look at my whole
number<00:03:31.050> first<00:03:33.140> 7-4<00:03:34.140> is<00:03:34.440> three<00:03:35.190> then<00:03:35.820> I<00:03:35.850> look<00:03:36.209> at

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
number first 7-4 is three then I look at

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:43.340 
number first 7-4 is three then I look at
my<00:03:36.890> denominator<00:03:39.860> that's<00:03:40.860> five<00:03:41.480> now<00:03:42.480> I<00:03:42.810> look<00:03:43.230> at

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
my denominator that's five now I look at

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:50.420 
my denominator that's five now I look at
my<00:03:43.440> numerator<00:03:44.300> 1-3<00:03:45.300> oh<00:03:45.920> I<00:03:47.000> cannot<00:03:48.000> do<00:03:48.739> 1-3<00:03:49.739> so

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
my numerator 1-3 oh I cannot do 1-3 so

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.780 
my numerator 1-3 oh I cannot do 1-3 so
you<00:03:50.489> know<00:03:50.760> what<00:03:50.970> I<00:03:51.239> have<00:03:52.140> to<00:03:52.200> backtrack<00:03:52.790> this

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
you know what I have to backtrack this

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.380 
you know what I have to backtrack this
is<00:03:54.030> not<00:03:54.300> going<00:03:54.660> to<00:03:54.750> work<00:03:55.670> we<00:03:56.670> need<00:03:56.700> to<00:03:56.910> think<00:03:57.180> of

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
is not going to work we need to think of

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.199 
is not going to work we need to think of
something<00:03:57.420> else<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.170> I'm<00:03:58.290> thinking<00:03:58.800> of

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
something else and I'm thinking of

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.199 
something else and I'm thinking of
subtraction<00:04:00.209> I<00:04:00.810> know<00:04:01.380> I<00:04:01.530> can<00:04:01.920> remain<00:04:02.430> when<00:04:03.180> i

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
subtraction I know I can remain when i

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.390 
subtraction I know I can remain when i
subtract<00:04:03.750> so<00:04:03.870> i'm<00:04:03.959> going<00:04:04.050> to<00:04:04.110> write<00:04:04.200> this<00:04:04.500> one

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
subtract so i'm going to write this one

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.300 
subtract so i'm going to write this one
more<00:04:05.790> time<00:04:06.120> 7<00:04:06.720> in<00:04:06.840> 1<00:04:07.080> 5th<00:04:09.620> minus<00:04:10.620> four<00:04:11.160> and

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
more time 7 in 1 5th minus four and

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.360 
more time 7 in 1 5th minus four and
three<00:04:11.489> fifths<00:04:12.230> when<00:04:13.230> i<00:04:13.260> see<00:04:13.860> that<00:04:13.890> now<00:04:14.160> i

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
three fifths when i see that now i

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.830 
three fifths when i see that now i
notice<00:04:14.820> that<00:04:15.030> one<00:04:15.690> is<00:04:16.400> less<00:04:17.400> than<00:04:17.940> three<00:04:18.510> and

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
notice that one is less than three and

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
notice that one is less than three and
that<00:04:19.140> needs<00:04:19.410> to<00:04:19.560> change<00:04:19.709> and<00:04:20.489> I<00:04:21.120> know<00:04:21.180> today

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:21.860 
that needs to change and I know today

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.740 
that needs to change and I know today
when<00:04:22.860> we<00:04:23.010> were<00:04:23.070> working<00:04:23.340> I<00:04:23.669> saw<00:04:24.120> some<00:04:24.390> friends

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
when we were working I saw some friends

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.690 
when we were working I saw some friends
able<00:04:25.200> to<00:04:25.410> rename

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
able to rename

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.930 
able to rename
their<00:04:26.850> whole<00:04:27.090> numbers<00:04:28.220> so<00:04:29.220> I'm<00:04:29.310> thinking<00:04:29.730> how

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
their whole numbers so I'm thinking how

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.570 
their whole numbers so I'm thinking how
can<00:04:30.000> i<00:04:30.330> rename<00:04:30.780> this<00:04:30.990> whole<00:04:31.230> number<00:04:31.620> so<00:04:31.830> i<00:04:32.280> get

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
can i rename this whole number so i get

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
can i rename this whole number so i get
another<00:04:33.120> fraction<00:04:34.080> hmm<00:04:34.980> well<00:04:35.910> i<00:04:36.060> know<00:04:36.180> i<00:04:36.420> can

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
another fraction hmm well i know i can

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.050 
another fraction hmm well i know i can
make<00:04:37.050> this<00:04:37.230> six<00:04:38.660> and<00:04:39.660> i<00:04:39.990> can<00:04:40.230> add<00:04:40.550> one<00:04:41.550> more<00:04:41.580> to

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
make this six and i can add one more to

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.000 
make this six and i can add one more to
get<00:04:42.210> seven<00:04:42.690> but<00:04:43.260> i<00:04:43.290> want<00:04:43.560> this<00:04:43.680> to<00:04:43.860> be<00:04:43.980> a

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
get seven but i want this to be a

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.300 
get seven but i want this to be a
fraction<00:04:44.640> so<00:04:45.360> to<00:04:45.450> rename<00:04:46.170> i'm<00:04:46.560> going<00:04:47.250> to

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
fraction so to rename i'm going to

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:53.480 
fraction so to rename i'm going to
change<00:04:47.550> that<00:04:47.760> one<00:04:48.620> to<00:04:49.620> five<00:04:51.140> fifths<00:04:52.140> and<00:04:52.490> six

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
change that one to five fifths and six

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.330 
change that one to five fifths and six
plus<00:04:53.880> five<00:04:54.120> fifths<00:04:54.780> or<00:04:54.930> six<00:04:55.380> plus<00:04:55.680> one<00:04:55.830> is

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
plus five fifths or six plus one is

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:02.000 
plus five fifths or six plus one is
still<00:04:57.330> the<00:04:57.720> same<00:04:58.340> as<00:04:59.340> seven<00:05:00.470> and<00:05:01.470> i<00:05:01.590> can<00:05:01.770> add

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
still the same as seven and i can add

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.840 
still the same as seven and i can add
that<00:05:02.250> one<00:05:02.490> fit<00:05:03.320> right<00:05:04.320> back<00:05:04.530> in<00:05:04.710> there<00:05:04.890> so<00:05:05.610> now

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
that one fit right back in there so now

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.360 
that one fit right back in there so now
my<00:05:06.090> fraction<00:05:06.660> we're<00:05:06.900> turning<00:05:07.440> it<00:05:07.560> into<00:05:07.800> that

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
my fraction we're turning it into that

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.190 
my fraction we're turning it into that

the six and A five fifths plus 1 5th is

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:27.440 
the six and A five fifths plus 1 5th is
six<00:05:23.100> fifths<00:05:24.770> now<00:05:25.770> I'm<00:05:26.040> putting<00:05:26.430> my<00:05:26.610> fractions

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
six fifths now I'm putting my fractions

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.000 
six fifths now I'm putting my fractions
together<00:05:27.980> so<00:05:28.980> I<00:05:29.010> have<00:05:29.310> a<00:05:29.340> higher<00:05:30.230> numerator<00:05:31.230> to

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
together so I have a higher numerator to

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.250 
together so I have a higher numerator to
subtract<00:05:32.550> so<00:05:32.940> now<00:05:33.090> i<00:05:33.120> can<00:05:33.240> do<00:05:33.540> the<00:05:33.780> rest<00:05:33.930> of<00:05:34.140> my

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
subtract so now i can do the rest of my

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:41.030

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
minus four and three fifths now i can

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.270 
minus four and three fifths now i can
follow<00:05:45.240> those<00:05:45.540> regular<00:05:46.200> steps<00:05:46.830> that<00:05:47.130> we

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
follow those regular steps that we

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:55.690 
follow those regular steps that we
practice<00:05:48.500> underline<00:05:50.330> my<00:05:51.330> whole<00:05:51.630> numbers<00:05:52.370> and

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.980 

6-4<00:05:56.700> gives<00:05:57.330> me<00:05:58.070> too<00:05:59.070> now<00:05:59.820> I<00:05:59.880> can<00:06:00.300> circle<00:06:00.870> my

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
6-4 gives me too now I can circle my

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.950 
6-4 gives me too now I can circle my
denominators<00:06:01.800> which<00:06:01.980> will<00:06:02.220> stay<00:06:02.400> the<00:06:02.610> same

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 
denominators which will stay the same

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.840 
denominators which will stay the same
that's<00:06:03.960> fifths<00:06:04.950> and<00:06:06.320> 6-3<00:06:07.320> now<00:06:07.680> I'm<00:06:08.190> so<00:06:08.520> excited

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:08.850 
that's fifths and 6-3 now I'm so excited

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.080 
that's fifths and 6-3 now I'm so excited
because<00:06:09.150> I<00:06:09.360> have<00:06:09.720> a<00:06:09.750> larger<00:06:10.380> number<00:06:10.590> here

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
because I have a larger number here

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:17.300 
because I have a larger number here
because<00:06:12.090> we<00:06:12.270> re<00:06:12.630> named<00:06:13.460> 6-3<00:06:14.460> is<00:06:15.380> three<00:06:16.380> I<00:06:16.650> know

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
because we re named 6-3 is three I know

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.000 
because we re named 6-3 is three I know
this<00:06:17.730> was<00:06:17.970> tricky<00:06:18.570> so<00:06:19.020> I<00:06:19.230> want<00:06:19.500> to<00:06:19.560> try<00:06:19.770> one

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 
this was tricky so I want to try one

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.380 
this was tricky so I want to try one
more<00:06:20.730> example<00:06:20.970> with<00:06:21.780> you<00:06:22.280> so<00:06:23.280> we<00:06:23.700> are<00:06:23.940> going<00:06:24.120> to

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:24.390 
more example with you so we are going to

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:29.150 
more example with you so we are going to
write<00:06:24.570> another<00:06:24.750> fraction<00:06:25.500> let's<00:06:25.770> try<00:06:28.160> five

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 
write another fraction let's try five

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:35.960 
write another fraction let's try five
and<00:06:29.810> two<00:06:30.810> forks<00:06:32.540> minus<00:06:33.800> three<00:06:34.800> and<00:06:35.100> three

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:35.970 
and two forks minus three and three

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.120 
and two forks minus three and three
fourths<00:06:36.360> so<00:06:36.450> I<00:06:36.780> know<00:06:36.900> now<00:06:37.410> I've<00:06:37.590> trained<00:06:37.920> my

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.130 
fourths so I know now I've trained my

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.430 
fourths so I know now I've trained my
brain<00:06:38.460> to<00:06:39.120> look<00:06:39.270> at<00:06:39.390> those<00:06:39.570> numerators

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
brain to look at those numerators

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.770 
brain to look at those numerators
and<00:06:40.530> I'm<00:06:40.620> noticing<00:06:40.860> the<00:06:41.730> two<00:06:42.000> is<00:06:42.180> smaller<00:06:42.600> and

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:42.780 
and I'm noticing the two is smaller and

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.530 
and I'm noticing the two is smaller and
that<00:06:42.990> doesn't<00:06:43.320> work<00:06:43.470> for<00:06:43.710> me<00:06:43.740> so<00:06:43.980> I<00:06:44.010> need<00:06:44.340> to

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:44.540 
that doesn't work for me so I need to

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.330 
that doesn't work for me so I need to
rename<00:06:45.540> so<00:06:46.110> I'm<00:06:46.200> going<00:06:46.350> to<00:06:46.410> change<00:06:46.740> my<00:06:46.890> whole

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 
rename so I'm going to change my whole

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:52.550 
rename so I'm going to change my whole
number<00:06:47.940> to<00:06:48.870> a<00:06:48.900> mixed<00:06:49.590> number<00:06:49.700> that<00:06:50.700> has<00:06:51.560> four

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 
number to a mixed number that has four

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.350 
number to a mixed number that has four
fourths<00:06:53.070> as<00:06:53.400> one<00:06:53.670> whole<00:06:53.940> and<00:06:54.920> 4<00:06:56.330> because<00:06:57.330> 4

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 
fourths as one whole and 4 because 4

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.760 
fourths as one whole and 4 because 4
plus<00:06:58.350> 4<00:06:58.710> 430<00:06:59.310> four<00:06:59.610> Forks<00:06:59.910> is<00:07:00.060> 14<00:07:00.930> plus<00:07:00.960> 1<00:07:01.470> is<00:07:01.590> 5

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:01.770 
plus 4 430 four Forks is 14 plus 1 is 5

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.800 
plus 4 430 four Forks is 14 plus 1 is 5
okay<00:07:02.100> so<00:07:02.160> i<00:07:02.340> know<00:07:02.430> that<00:07:02.580> i<00:07:02.760> renamed<00:07:03.300> correctly

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:03.810 
okay so i know that i renamed correctly

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:07.340 
okay so i know that i renamed correctly
plus<00:07:04.590> the<00:07:04.950> two<00:07:05.280> works<00:07:05.910> now<00:07:06.900> I'm<00:07:06.990> going<00:07:07.080> to<00:07:07.170> add

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:07.350 
plus the two works now I'm going to add

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:09.920 
plus the two works now I'm going to add
together<00:07:07.740> this<00:07:08.190> part<00:07:08.610> so<00:07:09.330> i<00:07:09.360> can<00:07:09.600> have<00:07:09.780> a

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:09.930 
together this part so i can have a

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:13.010 
together this part so i can have a
larger<00:07:10.830> fraction<00:07:11.400> we're<00:07:12.360> going<00:07:12.450> to<00:07:12.510> have<00:07:12.660> four

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.020 
larger fraction we're going to have four

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.030 
larger fraction we're going to have four
and<00:07:13.380> six<00:07:14.190> sports<00:07:14.960> we're<00:07:15.960> going<00:07:16.050> to<00:07:16.140> 46<00:07:16.770> force

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:17.040 
and six sports we're going to 46 force

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.510 
and six sports we're going to 46 force
minus<00:07:17.490> three<00:07:18.270> and<00:07:18.540> three<00:07:19.290> fourths<00:07:19.920> and<00:07:20.100> now<00:07:20.460> we

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:20.520 
minus three and three fourths and now we

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.510 
minus three and three fourths and now we
can<00:07:20.790> use<00:07:20.970> our<00:07:21.150> regular<00:07:21.870> steps<00:07:22.260> mixed<00:07:23.220> numbers
