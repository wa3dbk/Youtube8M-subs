00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 all sports are in the spotlight at 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.430
 tennis internationals we talk about 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.529
 handball you could see on alsace20 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.960
 obviously live beautiful match 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.690
 selestat créteil in splinters dream team there 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.269
 we are with vincent my father jean luc le 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.480
 gall and with christian romeyer back 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.070
 on this game I loved I tell you 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.519
 how did that happen 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.420
 we all loved it really was 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.699
 certainly the most beautiful match of this 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.400
 season to selestate and I really believe 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.320
 that we can be proud of that at two this 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.610
 what other teams did 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.980
 then a desire determines a 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.350
 extraordinary determination and so we 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.739
 is proud today of getting his 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.309
 retention 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.530
 and for the little story ago there is 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.829
 in 1990 he was part of the team 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.059
 who climbs for the first time in d1 and 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.030
 next year it will be our 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.129
 twentieth season on this level out of 23 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.250
 years what for selestat is a 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.239
 miracle I believe and I hope this 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.940
 miracle will last the longest 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.500
 possible then jean-luc I saw this day 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.250
 there a great team 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.420
 this was very very high level 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.860
 what had to be said to them 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.790
 what do you have them coach and 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.229
 what was the beta of a low I'm 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.520
 totally agree with the analysis I 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.650
 believe we saw a very large team 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.310
 especially aulas and especially especially what 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.490
 impressed me 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.409
 that was solidity and solidarity 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.640
 who could have in that group on on 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.200
 this game I think it's the match 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.570
 reference even on these data to the 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.360
 last season after what did he 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.560
 had to tell them I always thought that 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.420
 it was a group that was who was 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.619
 smart and so there and he knew 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.930
 that he had to be at the foot of the wall 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.490
 had to go out the match and arm my role 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.759
 it was more to guide them but I 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.950
 think I think it's deep down 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.439
 all who were first looking for this 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.549
 match there christian omeyer director 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.200
 technical 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.899
 we know that there is basically in the 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.210
 championship eight big teams that 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.090
 will have eight big budget what does it 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.149
 should 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.659
 to get to be not in the 14 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.340
 may in these eight there necessarily a budget 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.130
 a bit higher because currently 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.810
 the 13th budget out of 14 teams and we 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.849
 still stop seventh case the year 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.989
 passed this year we are still in the running 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.879
 to finish in the first eight 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.400
 so here I think we have two weapons to 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:17.799
 highlighting young people from 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.170
 quality that progresses each year with 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.910
 some elders for for the experience 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.989
 what is always necessary 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.060
 and then next year we'll have a 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.930
 new player stevanovic who will come 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.060
 strengthen the team 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.230
 so Montenegro is only 23 years old 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.569
 who participated in the last championship 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.849
 of the world who get noticed and who 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.569
 I hope will bring us a plus for 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.950
 next season 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.160
 so vincent what does it bring 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.010
 and play Rhenus in Strasbourg for 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.540
 the selestate club for us a I the 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.680
 always say ambition is to be the 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.400
 club of all Haitians 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:51.519
 so ben selestat that of 2200 seats 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.510
 the rhenus c5500 so here we can do 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:57.040
 3000 happy more at the rhénus it is 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.859
 this is really the big party of 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.540
 Alsatian handball twice at rhénus 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:04.150
 it is hoped that next year we will 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.889
 will be able to renew its rest two 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.329
 matches you can as said 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:09.579
 christian at the moment hung the 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:12.069
 eighth place in terms of what to do 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:14.769
 better than last year it's 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.299
 the goal of both matches yes everything to 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.310
 does it's going to be our goal on this 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.590
 end of season we were finished with 22 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.239
 points last year we have nineteen 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.190
 today the victory these two points 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.849
 so we quickly calculate four 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.370
 points to take 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:28.359
 nineteen and 4 23 years old would beat in beating 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.160
 did we do last year 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:32.200
 so here we go 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.400
 we will take both matches 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.800
 behind the others at first he's at 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.110
 home against ivry have to thank 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.400
 once again our audience already who 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.260
 supported us all year long and so 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.660
 make a big big game and then after 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.370
 it will be necessary to go for a big shot at aix 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.770
 since we know that with the advent of 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.170
 karabatic ex brothers is a team that 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.550
 is formidable but when I see the 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.430
 temperament of the team 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.380
 in any case on this last game nothing 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.970
 is impossible and in any case it's the 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.790
 mission we know we have been assigned 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.620
 for this end of the season 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.820
 the three that made us dream who 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.430
 have made you dream have you seen these 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.500
 images that's a wonderful match that we could 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.480
 discover good luck to you we hope 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.890
 in any case we cross our fingers for 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.890
 this eighth place
