first<00:00:12.750> we<00:00:12.960> have<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.200> kind<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.530> understand<00:00:14.420> what

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
first we have to kind of understand what

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.750 
first we have to kind of understand what
London<00:00:15.990> broil<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.500> it's<00:00:16.740> usually<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:17.130> lower<00:00:17.369> cut

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
London broil is it's usually a lower cut

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.470 
London broil is it's usually a lower cut
a<00:00:18.060> lower<00:00:18.720> quality<00:00:19.199> cut<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.740> meat<00:00:20.060> with<00:00:21.060> the

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
a lower quality cut of meat with the

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.570 
a lower quality cut of meat with the
denser<00:00:22.080> fiber<00:00:22.439> than<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:22.890> would<00:00:23.039> find<00:00:23.220> in<00:00:23.460> and

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
denser fiber than you would find in and

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.220 
denser fiber than you would find in and
maybe<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.850> tenderloin<00:00:24.210> or<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.600> New<00:00:24.750> York<00:00:24.930> steak

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
maybe a tenderloin or a New York steak

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.560 
maybe a tenderloin or a New York steak
so<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.039> demonstrate<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:27.060> I'm<00:00:27.210> going<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.449> use

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
so to demonstrate that I'm going to use

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.800 
so to demonstrate that I'm going to use
the<00:00:27.689> flank<00:00:27.990> steak<00:00:28.250> and<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:29.369> can<00:00:29.550> see<00:00:29.849> that

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
the flank steak and you can see that

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.340 
the flank steak and you can see that
they've<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.619> long<00:00:32.309> fibers<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.450> here<00:00:33.809> run<00:00:34.079> from

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
they've the long fibers in here run from

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.209 
they've the long fibers in here run from
one<00:00:34.559> end<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.950> other<00:00:35.210> so<00:00:36.710> once<00:00:37.710> we<00:00:37.920> cook

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
one end to the other so once we cook

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.100 
one end to the other so once we cook
that<00:00:38.250> we're<00:00:38.760> going<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:38.940> slice<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.390> against<00:00:39.989> the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
that we're going to slice it against the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.310 
that we're going to slice it against the
grain<00:00:41.000> making<00:00:42.000> those<00:00:42.149> fibers<00:00:42.629> much<00:00:42.899> smaller

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
grain making those fibers much smaller

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.560 
grain making those fibers much smaller
then<00:00:44.129> if<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.789> was<00:00:44.969> cut<00:00:45.780> with<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.289> grain<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:47.570> let

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
then if it was cut with the grain so let

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.920 
then if it was cut with the grain so let
me<00:00:48.690> show<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:51.890> just<00:00:52.890> what<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.129> mean<00:00:53.219> here's<00:00:53.670> a

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
me show you just what I mean here's a

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.180 
me show you just what I mean here's a
flank<00:00:54.930> steak<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.559> we<00:00:55.649> just<00:00:55.800> took<00:00:55.949> off<00:00:56.160> the

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
flank steak that we just took off the

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.389 
flank steak that we just took off the
grill<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:57.329> I'm<00:00:57.840> going<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.020> cut<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:59.250> can

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
grill and I'm going to cut it you can

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.479 
grill and I'm going to cut it you can
see<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.480> grain<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.899> going<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:01.260> way<00:01:01.399> so<00:01:02.399> I'm

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
see the grain is going this way so I'm

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.590 
see the grain is going this way so I'm
going<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.699> cut<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:02.969> against<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.329> grain<00:01:03.420> on<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:04.430> a

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
going to cut it against the grain on a a

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:15.410 
going to cut it against the grain on a a
bias<00:01:06.600> on<00:01:07.170> an<00:01:07.680> angle<00:01:08.040> here<00:01:13.610> just<00:01:14.610> like<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.090> and

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
bias on an angle here just like that and

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.149 
bias on an angle here just like that and
that's<00:01:15.630> going<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.960> be<00:01:16.020> very<00:01:16.170> juicy<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.890> tender

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
that's going to be very juicy and tender

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.390 
that's going to be very juicy and tender
you<00:01:17.369> can<00:01:17.430> see<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:18.890> juices<00:01:19.890> come<00:01:20.009> out<00:01:20.250> there

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
you can see the juices come out there

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.310 
you can see the juices come out there
because<00:01:20.580> I've<00:01:20.700> let<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.030> rest<00:01:21.299> about<00:01:21.659> ten

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
because I've let it rest about ten

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.469 
because I've let it rest about ten
minutes<00:01:22.530> before<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.979> sliced<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.580> now<00:01:24.420> to

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
minutes before I sliced it now to

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.649 
minutes before I sliced it now to
demonstrate<00:01:28.070> I'm<00:01:29.070> going<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.310> cut<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.670> piece

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
demonstrate I'm going to cut this piece

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.910 
demonstrate I'm going to cut this piece
right<00:01:30.840> here<00:01:31.170> with<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.250> grain<00:01:32.600> and<00:01:33.710> you<00:01:34.710> see

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
right here with the grain and you see

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.350 
right here with the grain and you see
you<00:01:35.250> can't<00:01:35.579> tear<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.780> because<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:38.360> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
you can't tear that because of the the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.140 
you can't tear that because of the the
the<00:01:39.869> grain<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:40.590> long<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.009> tough<00:01:41.250> but<00:01:41.460> by

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
the grain is so long and tough but by

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.679 
the grain is so long and tough but by
slicing<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.689> on<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.020> bias<00:01:43.909> it<00:01:44.909> just<00:01:45.270> pops<00:01:45.509> it

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
slicing it on a bias it just pops it

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.630 
slicing it on a bias it just pops it
just<00:01:46.200> makes<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.500> real<00:01:46.680> tender<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.220> easy<00:01:47.399> to

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
just makes it real tender and easy to

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.260 
just makes it real tender and easy to
eat<00:01:48.229> so<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.829> how<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.040> properly<00:01:50.280> cut<00:01:51.210> a

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
eat so that is how to properly cut a

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.020 
eat so that is how to properly cut a
