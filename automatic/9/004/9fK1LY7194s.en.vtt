00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
in science because when you're really

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.830 
in science because when you're really
thinking<00:00:22.320> about<00:00:22.410> like<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.280> dorm<00:00:23.700> room<00:00:23.820> space<00:00:24.510> is

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
thinking about like a dorm room space is

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.470 
thinking about like a dorm room space is
huge<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:25.830> want<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.760> be<00:00:26.880> able<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.180> use

huge that you want to be able to use

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.550 
huge that you want to be able to use
something<00:00:27.750> that's<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.080> little<00:00:28.200> bit<00:00:28.320> more

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
something that's a little bit more

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.859 
something that's a little bit more
compact<00:00:29.010> if<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.490> turn<00:00:29.730> these<00:00:29.880> sideways<00:00:30.570> you

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
compact if you turn these sideways you

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.260 
compact if you turn these sideways you
can<00:00:30.900> see<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.250> mini<00:00:32.489> really<00:00:32.879> does<00:00:33.030> take

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270

out<00:00:33.390> quite<00:00:33.629> a<00:00:33.660> bit<00:00:33.870> less<00:00:34.140> space<00:00:34.650> so<00:00:35.030> that's<00:00:36.030> a

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
out quite a bit less space so that's a

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.800 
out quite a bit less space so that's a
huge<00:00:36.510> feature<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:38.120> checked<00:00:39.120> these<00:00:39.450> online

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
of how these work and because it's a

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.880 
of how these work and because it's a
little<00:01:02.820> bit<00:01:02.940> different<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:04.110> larger<00:01:04.619> turret

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
little bit different the larger turret

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.580 
little bit different the larger turret
has<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.489> reservoir<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.539> your<00:01:07.109> water<00:01:07.319> is

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
has the reservoir so your water is

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.929 
has the reservoir so your water is
already<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.100> man<00:01:08.399> with<00:01:08.999> the<00:01:09.209> smaller<00:01:09.600> cherry

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.330 

you<00:01:14.939> actually<00:01:15.329> put<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> water<00:01:15.869> in<00:01:16.229> here<00:01:16.740> so

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
you actually put the water in here so

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.279 
you actually put the water in here so
you<00:01:17.399> just<00:01:17.670> take<00:01:17.939> your<00:01:17.999> cut<00:01:18.600> fill<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.109> up<00:01:19.170> with

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:19.289 
you just take your cut fill it up with

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:22.429 
you just take your cut fill it up with
water<00:01:19.529> just<00:01:20.009> pour<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.029> in<00:01:21.209> there<00:01:21.509> there's<00:01:22.380> a

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
water just pour it in there there's a

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.899 
water just pour it in there there's a
little<00:01:22.799> Brian<00:01:23.039> and<00:01:23.279> then<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.459> can't<00:01:23.670> see<00:01:23.819> it

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
little Brian and then you can't see it

coffee<00:01:52.799> glass<00:01:53.159> like<00:01:53.459> mine<00:01:53.669> you<00:01:53.939> have<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.419> be

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
coffee glass like mine you have to be

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.920 
coffee glass like mine you have to be
because<00:01:55.110> that's<00:01:55.680> not<00:01:55.979> gonna<00:01:56.219> fit<00:01:57.000> whereas<00:01:57.570> on

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
because that's not gonna fit whereas on

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.459 
because that's not gonna fit whereas on
the<00:01:58.560> Platinum<00:01:59.130> carrying<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.240> can't<00:02:00.659> fit<00:02:01.020> my<00:02:01.049> big

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
the Platinum carrying I can't fit my big

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.889 
the Platinum carrying I can't fit my big
clunky<00:02:01.950> glass<00:02:02.159> under<00:02:02.549> there<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.240> that's<00:02:03.539> kind

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
clunky glass under there so that's kind

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.260 
clunky glass under there so that's kind
of<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.049> disadvantage<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:05.159> one<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:05.729> that

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
of a disadvantage to this one is that

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.570 
of a disadvantage to this one is that
you<00:02:06.450> can't<00:02:06.810> really<00:02:07.320> use<00:02:07.649> like<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.130> larger

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
you can't really use like the larger

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.219 
you can't really use like the larger
travel<00:02:09.060> leg<00:02:09.239> you<00:02:09.479> would<00:02:09.599> have<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.840> like<00:02:09.959> brew

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
travel leg you would have to like brew

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.509 
travel leg you would have to like brew
it<00:02:10.380> in<00:02:10.410> something<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:10.920> then<00:02:11.009> pour<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.370> into

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
it in something and then pour it into

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:12.979 
it in something and then pour it into
something<00:02:11.760> else<00:02:12.030> which<00:02:12.239> gets<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.750> things

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
something else which gets to things

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.860 
something else which gets to things
dirty<00:02:13.200> but<00:02:14.069> for<00:02:14.730> most<00:02:14.880> people<00:02:15.360> if<00:02:15.450> you're<00:02:15.630> just

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
dirty but for most people if you're just

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.390 
dirty but for most people if you're just
drinking<00:02:16.019> a<00:02:16.349> glass<00:02:16.530> of<00:02:16.800> coffee<00:02:16.980> while<00:02:17.280> you're

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
drinking a glass of coffee while you're

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.460 
drinking a glass of coffee while you're
studying<00:02:17.730> or<00:02:18.180> something<00:02:18.540> like<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:18.720> this<00:02:19.410> is

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
studying or something like that this is

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.490 
studying or something like that this is
gonna<00:02:19.769> work<00:02:19.950> just<00:02:20.010> fine<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:21.090> both<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:22.050> them

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
gonna work just fine and both of them

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.120 
gonna work just fine and both of them
you<00:02:23.250> open<00:02:23.790> so<00:02:24.540> this<00:02:25.080> one<00:02:25.349> you<00:02:25.380> push<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.830> button

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
you open so this one you push the button

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.710 
you open so this one you push the button
and<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.430> opens<00:02:26.489> this<00:02:26.940> one<00:02:27.090> has<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.360> lever<00:02:27.599> that

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
and it opens this one has the lever that

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.920 
and it opens this one has the lever that
opens<00:02:27.930> on<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:29.370> mini<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:30.090> insert<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.630> just

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
opens on the mini you insert it just

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.620 
opens on the mini you insert it just
like<00:02:31.230> normal<00:02:32.000> same<00:02:33.000> thing

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
like normal same thing

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.330 
like normal same thing
closed<00:02:34.970> closed<00:02:36.230> my<00:02:37.230> water<00:02:37.500> pour<00:02:38.099> your<00:02:38.220> water

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
closed closed my water pour your water

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.979 
closed closed my water pour your water
and<00:02:38.459> so<00:02:38.700> technically<00:02:39.209> you<00:02:39.360> would<00:02:39.450> put<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.810> cup

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
and so technically you would put the cup

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.710 
and so technically you would put the cup
and<00:02:40.230> then<00:02:40.860> pour<00:02:41.190> your<00:02:41.220> water<00:02:41.549> then<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.390> light

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
and then pour your water then the light

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.990 
and then pour your water then the light
is<00:02:42.930> splashing<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:43.650> brew<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.310> this<00:02:44.730> light<00:02:44.970> is

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
is splashing to brew and this light is

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.660 
is splashing to brew and this light is
from<00:02:45.330> flashings<00:02:46.049> brew<00:02:46.380> with<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.160> mini<00:02:47.400> you

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
from flashings brew with the mini you

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.960 
from flashings brew with the mini you
just<00:02:47.880> have<00:02:48.060> one<00:02:48.360> size<00:02:48.750> of<00:02:49.110> bringing<00:02:49.590> with<00:02:50.400> the

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
just have one size of bringing with the

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.059 
just have one size of bringing with the
there's<00:02:51.660> a<00:02:51.720> mini<00:02:51.959> plus<00:02:52.319> where<00:02:52.650> you<00:02:52.769> can<00:02:52.920> get

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
there's a mini plus where you can get

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.580 
there's a mini plus where you can get
three<00:02:53.549> different<00:02:54.269> sizes<00:02:54.450> for<00:02:54.840> brewing<00:02:55.349> so

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
three different sizes for brewing so

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.199 
three different sizes for brewing so
that<00:02:56.130> matters<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.549> thing<00:02:56.730> that<00:02:56.849> you<00:02:56.940> want<00:02:57.120> to

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
that matters the thing that you want to

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.120 
that matters the thing that you want to
consider<00:02:57.360> if<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:57.870> like<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.440> brew<00:02:58.650> more<00:02:58.890> coffee

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
consider if you like to brew more coffee

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.920 
consider if you like to brew more coffee
you<00:02:59.790> might<00:02:59.819> want<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.180> hit<00:03:00.269> the<00:03:00.420> mini<00:03:00.569> plus

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
you might want to hit the mini plus

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.140 
you might want to hit the mini plus
versus<00:03:01.319> just<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.650> mini<00:03:01.920> although<00:03:02.730> this<00:03:02.940> is

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
versus just the mini although this is

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.000 
versus just the mini although this is
already<00:03:03.480> brewing<00:03:03.720> you<00:03:03.930> can't<00:03:04.170> hear<00:03:04.440> you<00:03:04.980> can't

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
already brewing you can't hear you can't

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.530 
already brewing you can't hear you can't
see<00:03:05.340> that<00:03:05.489> I<00:03:05.549> can<00:03:05.850> hear<00:03:06.090> it<00:03:06.150> right<00:03:06.180> here<00:03:06.450> it's

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
see that I can hear it right here it's

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.900 
see that I can hear it right here it's
already<00:03:06.840> brewing<00:03:07.079> so<00:03:07.920> this<00:03:08.130> is<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:08.310> little<00:03:08.760> bit

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
already brewing so this is a little bit

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.180 
already brewing so this is a little bit
faster<00:03:09.540> because<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:10.019> water<00:03:10.260> driving<00:03:10.739> in<00:03:10.859> here

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
faster because the water driving in here

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.440 
faster because the water driving in here
and<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.400> rest<00:03:11.579> of<00:03:11.700> our<00:03:11.819> and<00:03:12.000> it's<00:03:12.120> already

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
and the rest of our and it's already

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.330 
and the rest of our and it's already
staying<00:03:13.049> warm<00:03:13.410> if<00:03:13.680> you've<00:03:13.859> got<00:03:14.010> this<00:03:14.160> line

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
staying warm if you've got this line

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.180 
staying warm if you've got this line
whereas<00:03:15.150> with<00:03:15.329> the<00:03:15.450> mini<00:03:15.720> it's<00:03:16.109> warming<00:03:17.010> it<00:03:17.100> up

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
whereas with the mini it's warming it up

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.660 
whereas with the mini it's warming it up
as<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:17.790> goes<00:03:18.090> so<00:03:18.989> it's<00:03:19.650> gonna<00:03:19.859> take<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.310> little

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
as it goes so it's gonna take a little

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.120 
as it goes so it's gonna take a little
bit<00:03:20.970> longer<00:03:21.299> to<00:03:22.109> actually<00:03:22.530> have<00:03:22.739> this<00:03:22.889> ready

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
bit longer to actually have this ready

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.650 
bit longer to actually have this ready
but<00:03:23.430> if<00:03:23.730> you<00:03:23.940> were<00:03:24.060> getting<00:03:24.269> ready<00:03:24.450> in<00:03:24.600> the

that's headed off to college or get an
apartment<00:04:42.110> by<00:04:42.410> themselves<00:04:43.250> or<00:04:43.820> maybe<00:04:44.330> you

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 
apartment by themselves or maybe you

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:45.820 
apartment by themselves or maybe you
want<00:04:44.690> to<00:04:44.720> have<00:04:44.930> something<00:04:45.259> like<00:04:45.410> this<00:04:45.530> in<00:04:45.710> your

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
want to have something like this in your

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.089 
want to have something like this in your
office<00:04:46.009> then<00:04:46.820> the<00:04:47.330> middie<00:04:47.660> might<00:04:48.470> be<00:04:48.740> a<00:04:48.770> way<00:04:49.039> to

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:49.099 
office then the middie might be a way to

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:53.290 
office then the middie might be a way to
go<00:04:49.490> to<00:04:49.820> save<00:04:50.060> space<00:04:50.510> and<00:04:51.099> and<00:04:52.099> still<00:04:53.090> save

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
go to save space and and still save

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.210 
go to save space and and still save
yourself<00:04:53.419> some<00:04:53.840> time<00:04:54.080> because<00:04:54.440> this<00:04:54.770> is<00:04:54.979> still

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
yourself some time because this is still

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.100 
yourself some time because this is still
much<00:04:55.460> faster<00:04:55.940> than<00:04:56.060> brewing<00:04:56.360> a<00:04:56.449> whole<00:04:56.630> pot<00:04:56.960> of

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
much faster than brewing a whole pot of

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.550 
much faster than brewing a whole pot of
coffee<00:04:57.320> just<00:04:57.710> the<00:04:57.860> one<00:04:58.099> cup<00:04:58.550> so<00:04:59.270> here<00:04:59.930> it<00:05:00.050> comes

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
coffee just the one cup so here it comes

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.129 
coffee just the one cup so here it comes
so<00:05:01.070> you<00:05:01.460> can<00:05:01.610> see<00:05:01.820> that<00:05:02.030> the<00:05:02.210> the<00:05:02.690> larger

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
so you can see that the the larger

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:05.350 
so you can see that the the larger
brewery<00:05:03.560> did<00:05:04.130> actually<00:05:04.430> go<00:05:04.880> a<00:05:04.909> little<00:05:05.180> bit

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
brewery did actually go a little bit

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.379 
brewery did actually go a little bit
faster<00:05:05.990> so<00:05:06.260> that's<00:05:07.250> kind<00:05:07.610> of<00:05:07.729> a<00:05:07.849> little<00:05:08.030> bit<00:05:08.270> of

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
faster so that's kind of a little bit of

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:10.480 
faster so that's kind of a little bit of
a<00:05:08.479> disadvantage<00:05:09.110> if<00:05:09.260> you're<00:05:09.470> used<00:05:09.770> to<00:05:09.889> this<00:05:10.190> if

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
a disadvantage if you're used to this if

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:11.950 
a disadvantage if you're used to this if
you're<00:05:10.639> used<00:05:10.820> to<00:05:10.909> the<00:05:11.120> larger<00:05:11.510> wine<00:05:11.690> that's

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
you're used to the larger wine that's

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.350 
you're used to the larger wine that's
really<00:05:12.229> fast<00:05:12.440> it<00:05:13.130> can<00:05:13.490> take<00:05:13.699> some<00:05:13.909> adjustment

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
really fast it can take some adjustment

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.820 
really fast it can take some adjustment
it<00:05:14.840> would<00:05:14.960> be<00:05:15.050> more<00:05:15.229> of<00:05:15.260> a<00:05:15.349> scheduling

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
it would be more of a scheduling

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.730 
it would be more of a scheduling
adjustment<00:05:16.310> than<00:05:16.460> anything<00:05:16.669> but<00:05:17.630> it<00:05:18.229> does

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
adjustment than anything but it does

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.710 
adjustment than anything but it does
come<00:05:19.159> out<00:05:19.190> and<00:05:19.490> it's<00:05:19.639> hot<00:05:19.940> when<00:05:20.150> it<00:05:20.270> comes<00:05:20.479> out

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
come out and it's hot when it comes out
