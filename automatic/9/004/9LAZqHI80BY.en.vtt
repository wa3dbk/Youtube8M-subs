00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
time and you know we're just having a

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.910 
time and you know we're just having a
blast<00:01:10.670> and<00:01:10.880> for<00:01:11.450> me<00:01:11.540> it's<00:01:11.659> great<00:01:11.900> I<00:01:11.930> don't<00:01:12.770> play

blast and for me it's great I don't play

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.160 
blast and for me it's great I don't play
too<00:01:12.980> much<00:01:13.220> tennis<00:01:13.490> now<00:01:13.730> so<00:01:13.940> it's<00:01:14.060> kind<00:01:14.240> of<00:01:14.300> a

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
too much tennis now so it's kind of a

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.530 
too much tennis now so it's kind of a
little<00:01:15.830> bit<00:01:15.920> of<00:01:15.980> a<00:01:16.010> time<00:01:16.190> warp<00:01:16.400> back<00:01:16.550> into<00:01:16.850> the

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
little bit of a time warp back into the

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.600 
little bit of a time warp back into the
way<00:01:17.660> through<00:01:18.350> when<00:01:18.440> I<00:01:18.530> was<00:01:18.680> a<00:01:18.710> tennis<00:01:19.400> player

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
way through when I was a tennis player

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.420 
way through when I was a tennis player
so<00:01:19.910> selfishly<00:01:20.420> it's<00:01:20.900> fun<00:01:21.140> and<00:01:21.350> you<00:01:22.280> know

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
so selfishly it's fun and you know

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.770 
so selfishly it's fun and you know
hopefully<00:01:22.580> we<00:01:22.820> can<00:01:22.910> build<00:01:23.090> some<00:01:23.390> momentum<00:01:23.480> for

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
hopefully we can build some momentum for

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:32.200 
hopefully we can build some momentum for
14<00:01:24.440> tennis<00:01:24.680> as<00:01:24.800> well<00:01:30.550> well<00:01:31.550> I'm<00:01:31.760> smart<00:01:32.150> enough

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
14 tennis as well well I'm smart enough

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.540 
14 tennis as well well I'm smart enough
to<00:01:32.390> know<00:01:32.510> that<00:01:32.630> you<00:01:33.440> only<00:01:33.590> do<00:01:33.800> practical<00:01:34.340> jokes

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
to know that you only do practical jokes

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.040 
to know that you only do practical jokes
when<00:01:34.700> they<00:01:34.850> have<00:01:35.300> enough<00:01:35.510> time<00:01:35.630> to<00:01:35.690> get<00:01:35.900> you

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
when they have enough time to get you

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.480 
when they have enough time to get you
back<00:01:36.080> so<00:01:36.410> I<00:01:36.440> certainly<00:01:36.680> wouldn't<00:01:37.070> pull<00:01:37.220> any<00:01:37.400> at

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
back so I certainly wouldn't pull any at

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:38.560 
back so I certainly wouldn't pull any at
the<00:01:37.580> beginning<00:01:37.910> of<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.060> week<00:01:38.210> when<00:01:38.390> they<00:01:38.480> had

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
the beginning of the week when they had

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.540 
the beginning of the week when they had
plenty<00:01:38.750> of<00:01:38.900> time<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:39.380> and<00:01:39.530> thought<00:01:40.160> to<00:01:40.190> get<00:01:40.460> me

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
plenty of time and and thought to get me

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.170 
back so but was gonna do something it
may<00:01:42.920> or<00:01:43.010> may<00:01:43.100> not<00:01:43.130> be<00:01:43.280> at<00:01:43.460> the<00:01:43.610> end<00:01:43.730> of<00:01:43.850> my

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
may or may not be at the end of my

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.300 
may or may not be at the end of my
tenure<00:01:44.630> with<00:01:44.930> the<00:01:44.960> Springfield<00:01:45.410> lasers<00:01:45.740> my

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
tenure with the Springfield lasers my

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.460 
tenure with the Springfield lasers my
wife<00:01:46.520> convinced<00:01:46.760> me<00:01:47.060> that<00:01:47.090> she<00:01:47.480> had<00:01:47.690> that<00:01:48.320> are

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
wife convinced me that she had that are

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.670 
wife convinced me that she had that are
she'd<00:01:49.190> taken<00:01:49.370> our<00:01:49.550> boat<00:01:49.730> out<00:01:49.880> and<00:01:50.350> I<00:01:51.350> guess<00:01:51.650> I

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
she'd taken our boat out and I guess I

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.840 
she'd taken our boat out and I guess I
did<00:01:51.860> stopped<00:01:52.040> working<00:01:52.400> and<00:01:52.490> so<00:01:52.610> instead<00:01:52.730> of

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
did stopped working and so instead of

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.220 
did stopped working and so instead of
figuring<00:01:53.150> out<00:01:53.330> she<00:01:53.450> said<00:01:53.630> she<00:01:53.750> just<00:01:53.780> left<00:01:54.080> it

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.230 
figuring out she said she just left it

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.270 
figuring out she said she just left it
and<00:01:54.410> that<00:01:54.680> we'd<00:01:54.770> go<00:01:54.890> back<00:01:55.040> and<00:01:55.160> get<00:01:55.220> it

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
and that we'd go back and get it

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.860 
and that we'd go back and get it
tomorrow<00:01:55.610> and<00:01:55.850> I<00:01:55.880> actually<00:01:56.030> believed<00:01:56.450> her<00:01:56.570> for

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 
tomorrow and I actually believed her for

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.040 
tomorrow and I actually believed her for
for<00:01:57.620> a<00:01:57.650> good<00:01:57.770> half<00:01:57.920> hour<00:01:58.100> and<00:01:58.400> I<00:01:58.460> was<00:01:59.020> less<00:02:00.020> than

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
for a good half hour and I was less than

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.440 
for a good half hour and I was less than
pleased<00:02:00.470> I<00:02:00.740> guess<00:02:01.190> would<00:02:01.370> be<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:01.970> politically

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
pleased I guess would be the politically

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.470 
pleased I guess would be the politically
correct<00:02:02.480> way<00:02:02.840> yeah
