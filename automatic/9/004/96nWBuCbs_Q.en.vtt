rolled oats kind as opposed to the
instant<00:00:48.329> oatmeal<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:48.989> it's<00:00:49.170> really<00:00:49.469> worth<00:00:49.680> it

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
instant oatmeal so it's really worth it

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.150 
instant oatmeal so it's really worth it
to<00:00:50.899> actually<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.410> know<00:00:52.500> spend<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.949> little<00:00:53.070> bit

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
to actually you know spend a little bit

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.010

longer<00:00:53.370> time<00:00:53.699> preparing<00:00:54.180> oatmeal<00:00:54.660> getting

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
longer time preparing oatmeal getting

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.930 
longer time preparing oatmeal getting
the<00:00:55.170> rolled<00:00:55.800> oats<00:00:56.070> as<00:00:56.309> opposed<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
the rolled oats as opposed to the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.150 
the rolled oats as opposed to the
instant<00:00:57.480> oatmeal<00:00:57.629> because<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.680> rolled<00:00:58.920> oats

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
instant oatmeal because the rolled oats

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.880 
instant oatmeal because the rolled oats
is<00:00:59.370> digested<00:01:00.030> much<00:01:00.510> more<00:01:00.719> slowly<00:01:00.960> which<00:01:01.649> means

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
is digested much more slowly which means

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.670 
is digested much more slowly which means
that<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.070> keeps<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.550> full<00:01:02.760> longer<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:03.690> opt<00:01:04.320> out

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
that it keeps you full longer so opt out

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.399 
that it keeps you full longer so opt out
of<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.430> instant<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.150> choose<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:07.049> rolled

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
of the instant and choose the rolled

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.130 
of the instant and choose the rolled
oats<00:01:07.650> instead<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:09.030> second<00:01:09.510> food<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.990> is
