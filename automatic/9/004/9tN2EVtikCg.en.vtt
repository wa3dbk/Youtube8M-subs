he's already moving which is just a

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.030 
he's already moving which is just a
little<00:01:38.970> bit<00:01:39.060> creepy<00:01:39.420> but<00:01:40.140> if<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.380> click<00:01:40.439> play<00:01:43.040> so

you can see it needs a little bit of

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.450 
you can see it needs a little bit of
tweaking<00:01:45.869> plus<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.439> has<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> woman's<00:01:46.920> voice<00:01:47.070> but

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.180 

so<00:02:03.899> that's<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.490> the<00:02:05.490> male<00:02:05.759> version<00:02:06.119> but<00:02:07.079> if<00:02:08.009> I

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
so that's the the male version but if I

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.859 
so that's the the male version but if I
click<00:02:08.250> on<00:02:08.610> this<00:02:08.849> right<00:02:09.090> here<00:02:09.300> it's<00:02:09.420> detailed

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
click on this right here it's detailed

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.660 
click on this right here it's detailed
facial<00:02:10.140> mode<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.770> can<00:02:10.890> see<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.130> it's<00:02:11.250> it's

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
facial mode you can see that it's it's

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.240 
facial mode you can see that it's it's
close<00:02:12.260> but<00:02:13.260> what<00:02:13.530> I<00:02:13.560> would<00:02:13.770> do<00:02:13.860> here<00:02:14.010> is<00:02:14.069> I

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
close but what I would do here is I

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.360 
close but what I would do here is I
would<00:02:14.400> grab<00:02:15.390> these<00:02:15.599> points<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.260> drag<00:02:17.190> them

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
would grab these points and drag them

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.000 
would grab these points and drag them
around<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.670> head<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:19.019> probably<00:02:19.620> if<00:02:19.830> I<00:02:19.890> was

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
around the head and I probably if I was

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.800 
around the head and I probably if I was
gonna<00:02:20.099> really<00:02:20.489> use<00:02:20.640> this<00:02:20.849> for<00:02:21.090> something<00:02:21.480> I

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
gonna really use this for something I

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:22.970 
gonna really use this for something I
was<00:02:21.900> gonna<00:02:22.110> put<00:02:22.260> online<00:02:22.380> or<00:02:22.680> something<00:02:22.920> I

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
was gonna put online or something I

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.270 
was gonna put online or something I
would<00:02:23.099> probably<00:02:24.019> take<00:02:25.019> my<00:02:25.200> time<00:02:28.040> okay<00:02:29.040> and

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
would probably take my time okay and

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.949 
would probably take my time okay and
just<00:02:29.580> kind<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:29.819> get<00:02:30.360> this<00:02:30.510> in<00:02:30.660> here<00:02:30.930> and

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
just kind of get this in here and

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.490 
just kind of get this in here and
doesn't<00:02:31.470> have<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.650> be<00:02:31.769> perfect<00:02:33.200> what<00:02:34.200> I<00:02:34.230> would

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
doesn't have to be perfect what I would

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.990 
doesn't have to be perfect what I would
like<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.769> do<00:02:34.860> is<00:02:34.980> kind<00:02:35.100> of<00:02:35.220> fine-tune<00:02:35.459> some<00:02:35.700> of

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
like to do is kind of fine-tune some of

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.610 
like to do is kind of fine-tune some of
the<00:02:36.060> facial<00:02:36.330> stuff<00:02:36.750> because<00:02:37.019> that<00:02:37.049> makes<00:02:37.410> it

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
the facial stuff because that makes it

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.229 
the facial stuff because that makes it
looks<00:02:37.799> a<00:02:37.890> little<00:02:38.010> look<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.910> little<00:02:38.940> more

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
looks a little look a little more

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:46.789 
looks a little look a little more
natural<00:02:42.680> okay<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:44.730> would<00:02:44.790> probably<00:02:45.799> click

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
natural okay and I would probably click

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.000 
natural okay and I would probably click
on<00:02:47.569> this<00:02:48.569> and<00:02:48.840> make<00:02:48.930> his<00:02:49.080> lips<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.739> little<00:02:49.920> bit

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
on this and make his lips a little bit

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.680 
on this and make his lips a little bit
more<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.430> makes<00:02:50.760> his<00:02:50.940> mouth<00:02:51.090> move<00:02:51.390> a<00:02:51.480> little

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
more that makes his mouth move a little

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.020 
more that makes his mouth move a little
bit<00:02:51.780> better<00:02:51.959> and<00:02:52.440> this<00:02:53.430> part<00:02:53.670> right<00:02:53.730> here<00:02:53.790> the

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
bit better and this part right here the

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.690 
bit better and this part right here the
yellow<00:02:54.330> dots<00:02:54.599> go<00:02:54.810> on<00:02:54.930> top<00:02:55.459> so<00:02:56.459> I<00:02:56.489> would

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
yellow dots go on top so I would

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.780 
yellow dots go on top so I would
probably<00:02:56.849> drag<00:02:57.390> these<00:02:57.660> dots<00:02:58.280> down<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.670> the

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
probably drag these dots down to the

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.170 
probably drag these dots down to the
bottom<00:03:00.239> of<00:03:00.390> his<00:03:00.480> open<00:03:00.870> mouth<00:03:01.730> it<00:03:02.730> would<00:03:02.910> pull

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
bottom of his open mouth it would pull

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.089 
bottom of his open mouth it would pull
that<00:03:03.299> in<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.480> little<00:03:03.660> bit<00:03:03.780> more<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.830> yellow

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
that in a little bit more and the yellow

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.520 
that in a little bit more and the yellow
dots<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:05.640> top<00:03:05.880> and<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:07.170> reason<00:03:07.440> I'm

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
dots to the top and the reason I'm

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.680 
dots to the top and the reason I'm
specifying<00:03:07.799> this<00:03:08.400> as<00:03:08.579> an<00:03:08.700> open<00:03:09.000> mouth<00:03:09.209> you<00:03:09.540> can

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
specifying this as an open mouth you can

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.490 
specifying this as an open mouth you can
see<00:03:09.840> right<00:03:10.230> here<00:03:10.260> is<00:03:11.420> that<00:03:12.420> his<00:03:12.989> teeth<00:03:13.290> are

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
see right here is that his teeth are

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.599 
see right here is that his teeth are
showing<00:03:13.650> a<00:03:13.829> little<00:03:14.040> bit<00:03:14.130> I<00:03:14.220> want<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.400> kind<00:03:14.519> of
