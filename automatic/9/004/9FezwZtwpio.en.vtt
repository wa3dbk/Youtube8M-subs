00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hello youtube friends talk to them keops 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.250
 truck and welcome to the tutorial 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.930
 how will they be able to send me their plays 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.560
 for what is being the top 10 of 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.780
 Halo 4 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.610
 remember that I made a mechanical change 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.590
 because in the two methods that we use 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.450
 previously there were many errors of 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.369
 that I missed the clips then 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.570
 This is the definitive tutorial for 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.520
 that you can send me your plays 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.050
 weekly and they can come out in this that 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.000
 is the top 10 that I upload all the 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.189
 Friday the first thing you have to do 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.779
 is to go to your file browser 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.699
 halo 4 that is in the menu 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.859
 pause and go to videos and clips and 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.320
 select the clip you have saved 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.690
 let's say at the precise moment where 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.510
 it happened to win fail you guessed that you're going to 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.219
 select it you will press the yy 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.680
 you are going to send files 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.870
 shared nothing else would only be 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.059
 wait for the clip to go up and you're done 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.450
 would be that clip uploaded to your files 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.450
 shared 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.600
 once your clip has been uploaded to your files 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.970
 shared and with a name that 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.640
 remember you are going to send messages and 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.840
 you are going to create new you are going to write 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.119
 exactly how the game is written 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.700
 ter that is on the top 10 halo screen 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.950
 4 good do not matter if what are the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.750
 capitals that corrects it alone but the 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.360
 joke is that they put everything together and with 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.820
 there's how it showed then they're going to put 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.790
 in adding text and they will put the reason 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.159
 which is the top 10 and next are going to put 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.810
 the name of his pib this so that I 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.240
 can enter their shared files 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.470
 and can download the clip with the name 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.470
 that put me there 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.520
 already once all the only thing that 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.520
 would be to send the message 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.900
 do not forget to send your plays for the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.700
 top 10 ice 4 I upload all the 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.250
 Friday and remember that it can be 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.010
 any category that goes into what 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.690
 are the wings fails and water fox so 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.030
