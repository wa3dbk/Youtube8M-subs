later in the tutorial you may see me
using<00:00:55.580> some<00:00:55.760> different<00:00:56.390> tools<00:00:56.510> here<00:00:56.780> and

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
using some different tools here and

using some different tools here and
there<00:00:57.280> that<00:00:58.280> doesn't<00:00:58.670> mean<00:00:58.820> that<00:00:58.850> I'm<00:00:59.180> using

00:00:59.469 --> 00:00:59.479 
there that doesn't mean that I'm using

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:01.689 
there that doesn't mean that I'm using
tools<00:00:59.750> that<00:00:59.900> you<00:01:00.170> need<00:01:00.250> that<00:01:01.250> I<00:01:01.280> didn't

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
tools that you need that I didn't

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.460 
tools that you need that I didn't
mention<00:01:01.790> I'm<00:01:02.299> just<00:01:02.869> using<00:01:03.019> different

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
mention I'm just using different

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.890 
mention I'm just using different
variations<00:01:04.100> of<00:01:04.280> some<00:01:04.489> of<00:01:04.610> this<00:01:04.699> stuff<00:01:04.970> maybe

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
variations of some of this stuff maybe

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.690 
variations of some of this stuff maybe
just<00:01:06.200> to<00:01:06.320> speed<00:01:06.560> up<00:01:06.680> the<00:01:06.799> process<00:01:07.280> or<00:01:07.460> make<00:01:07.610> it

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
just to speed up the process or make it

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.999 
just to speed up the process or make it
a<00:01:07.760> little<00:01:07.850> bit<00:01:08.030> easier<00:01:08.330> and<00:01:09.229> also<00:01:09.650> saying<00:01:09.890> that

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
a little bit easier and also saying that

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.550 
a little bit easier and also saying that
you're<00:01:10.520> not<00:01:10.549> confined<00:01:11.270> to<00:01:11.630> just<00:01:11.780> these<00:01:12.259> tools

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
you're not confined to just these tools

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.980 
you're not confined to just these tools
you<00:01:13.520> just<00:01:13.549> need<00:01:13.820> something<00:01:14.210> similar<00:01:14.509> to<00:01:14.840> what

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
you just need something similar to what

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.440 
you just need something similar to what
I<00:01:15.020> have<00:01:15.320> here<00:01:15.670> just<00:01:16.670> like<00:01:16.820> with<00:01:17.000> the<00:01:17.090> parts

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
I have here just like with the parts

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.550 
I have here just like with the parts
you're<00:01:17.600> not<00:01:17.720> gonna<00:01:17.840> have<00:01:18.020> all<00:01:18.110> the<00:01:18.260> exact<00:01:18.530> same

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
you're not gonna have all the exact same

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.220 
you're not gonna have all the exact same
stuff<00:01:19.070> so<00:01:19.820> that's<00:01:20.090> ok<00:01:20.480> just<00:01:20.510> make<00:01:20.900> sure<00:01:21.050> you

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.230 
stuff so that's ok just make sure you

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.740 
stuff so that's ok just make sure you
have<00:01:21.560> you<00:01:22.490> know<00:01:22.610> some<00:01:22.880> variation<00:01:23.450> of<00:01:23.570> this

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
have you know some variation of this

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.750 
have you know some variation of this
stuff<00:01:24.020> because<00:01:24.890> you're<00:01:25.040> gonna<00:01:25.160> see<00:01:25.430> me<00:01:25.550> using

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
stuff because you're gonna see me using

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.090 
stuff because you're gonna see me using
it<00:01:26.030> all<00:01:26.210> throughout<00:01:26.510> the<00:01:26.750> tutorial<00:01:26.900> for<00:01:27.830> every

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
it all throughout the tutorial for every

00:01:28.100 --> 00:02:41.500 
it all throughout the tutorial for every
step

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.360 

now<00:02:42.510> one<00:02:42.900> thing<00:02:42.930> in<00:02:43.260> this<00:02:43.380> video<00:02:43.590> I<00:02:43.800> can<00:02:44.100> safely

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
now one thing in this video I can safely

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.330 
now one thing in this video I can safely
say<00:02:44.610> you're<00:02:45.000> probably<00:02:45.300> not<00:02:45.570> going<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:45.840> use<00:02:45.990> is

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
say you're probably not going to use is

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.290 
say you're probably not going to use is
this<00:02:47.340> large<00:02:47.760> orange<00:02:48.510> handle<00:02:48.990> tax<00:02:49.440> off<00:02:49.760> so<00:02:50.760> you

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
this large orange handle tax off so you

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.180 
this large orange handle tax off so you
can<00:02:51.450> ignore<00:02:51.750> that<00:02:51.810> basically<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.770> point<00:02:53.070> of

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
can ignore that basically the point of

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.520 
can ignore that basically the point of
that<00:02:53.310> was<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.610> represent<00:02:53.940> something<00:02:54.750> that<00:02:55.410> you

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
that was to represent something that you

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.870 
that was to represent something that you
could<00:02:55.710> use<00:02:55.890> to<00:02:56.100> chop<00:02:56.370> some<00:02:56.610> screws<00:02:56.940> down<00:02:57.150> later

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
could use to chop some screws down later

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.940 
could use to chop some screws down later
even<00:02:59.880> the<00:02:59.970> original<00:03:00.150> RepRap<00:03:00.810> tutorial<00:03:01.470> says

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
even the original RepRap tutorial says

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.500 
even the original RepRap tutorial says
you<00:03:02.100> may<00:03:02.280> have<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.550> chop<00:03:02.760> some<00:03:02.970> screws<00:03:03.270> down

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
you may have to chop some screws down

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.780 
you may have to chop some screws down
here<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:03.959> there<00:03:04.110> in<00:03:04.739> order<00:03:05.130> to<00:03:05.250> make<00:03:05.430> them<00:03:05.550> fit

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
here and there in order to make them fit

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.060 
here and there in order to make them fit
well<00:03:06.570> a<00:03:06.600> better<00:03:06.959> alternative<00:03:07.560> is<00:03:07.650> just<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:07.980> use

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
well a better alternative is just to use

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.370 
well a better alternative is just to use
more<00:03:08.310> flat<00:03:08.610> washers<00:03:09.120> instead<00:03:09.870> of<00:03:09.989> having<00:03:10.170> to

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
more flat washers instead of having to

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.640 
more flat washers instead of having to
actually<00:03:10.530> chop<00:03:11.010> a<00:03:11.250> screw<00:03:11.610> in<00:03:11.730> half<00:03:11.940> so<00:03:12.750> it's

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
actually chop a screw in half so it's

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.100 
actually chop a screw in half so it's
safe<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.160> say<00:03:14.190> ignore<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:15.120> saw<00:03:15.330> you<00:03:15.900> don't

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
safe to say ignore the saw you don't

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.440 
safe to say ignore the saw you don't
need<00:03:16.290> it
