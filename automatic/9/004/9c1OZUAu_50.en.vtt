00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.890
 on Wednesday morning she started 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.800
 with a little temperature when 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.869
 we arrived to 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.359
 oh and the insurance this attended me the 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.880
 doctor who is on duty in the emergency room 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:33.410
 that because apparently it could be dengue 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.900
 that had symptoms 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.730
 you do not have the ones you do not have the 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.309
 medicines or the means to 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.090
 serve them here in san blas we got to 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.820
 tepic 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:47.030
 the girl this already got up from the chair 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.960
 I carefully grabbed the serum and my 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:54.980
 wife opened the door the time went by 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:57.830
 this was already approached by two girls who 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:04.009
 that I notice in them is that they are 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:07.430
 medical interns 22 female doctors that they 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:10.759
 two began to check the as the 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:14.600
 doctor and the pediatrician who was there the 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:17.149
 boss gave them instructions then the 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.850
 doctor already said no because your girl I'm already 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:25.020
 reacting well is stable 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:29.320
 does not present any other type of table 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.259
 Then the nurse who has her 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.909
 materials there and told me we're going to give 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:39.790
 a little pill I gave him this 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.640
 little pill to the questions of five 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.850
 minutes I gave the girl you are 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.430
 he wanted to get up to vomit like the 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.850
 pill that was given to him did not fall 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.509
 then she vomited she is a bit of the 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.600
 food that I had given him and water 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:01.539
 then when the nurse saw her and that 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.490
 he said he also medicated the pill 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.560
 We are going to give you another but I am going to 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.289
 put in a syringe so that it 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.660
 dissolve because it is bad to take it 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.340
 I was told you are going to give it little to 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:18.970
 little bit and I grabbed the girl and gave her 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:23.050
 when I gave it to the 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:27.810
 5 minutes again she started flipping 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:31.590
 separates one side to the other side and this 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:34.560
 and he told me I feel like throwing up me and me 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:39.180
 so I'm going to seat you mommy embrace her 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:44.099
 I smile and again I vomit everything but 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:46.349
 this one when she vomited she lost strength and 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.200
 she started to put me in that moment 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:52.859
 dwelling 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:56.340
 whole body his lips and I yelled at 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:59.760
 the doctor doctor my child is being 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.519
 putting malita then he told me 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.260
 see let me allow myself and they removed me 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.030
 from there if they do the 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:11.250
 nurses and everything and the girl started to 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:16.200
 lose the numbering of the apparatus 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:19.709
 be in 130 began to go down to 60 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:23.430
 but it was in matters of second 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:28.620
 then it anguishes me in my reactions 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:31.799
 this scream please please attend because 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.829
 my girl dies me then and I ran with 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:39.569
 all my strength to get where 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:42.659
 he was because I felt that without a doubt 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:46.960
 I was going to reach when it arrived and I tried 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:49.900
 to locate someone else 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.390
 as someone else reference for us 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.820
 give more information or me or me 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.420
 will help someone else attend 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:01.300
 because I had the impression that they 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.580
 They were not doing what they should 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.920
 do with my girl or maybe an option 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.040
 to take her out of insurance and take her to another 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.620
 where there would be more attention for 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.260
 that she would look good told me 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.050
 robert the girl is malite we have to 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.200
 be strong and I told him not the girl 

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:22.810
 she was fine since she took that 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:27.070
 my little girl's pill was the jorge something 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:29.320
 it's not good when then when 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.900
 he returned Jorge and everything with her and 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.570
 asked the doctor she did not know how to give the 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:38.170
 diagnosis neither to him nor to me of what 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:40.600
 I really had told me is it is a 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.590
 bacteria is a bacterium that complicated him 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.010
 all 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.570
 but a bacterium that does not then does not 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:49.180
 we need is that it allows us a 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:52.870
 momentito say but what 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:56.530

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:59.290
 when he came in he was told exactly 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:02.200
 the same but I for all the time that 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.960
 I was there they wanted to put oxygen 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:08.350
 have a device the connections do not 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.690
 they served this they had to change the 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:13.900
 hoses I do not know what because they were not 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:16.840

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:20.890
 they worked and my child occupied his 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:23.800
 Apparatus indicated worked but 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:26.160
 there were signs above the 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.700
 property 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:33.580
 I had to go out and electro when he 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:35.820
 when he was going to enter because he already 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:39.610
 had spoken to be helped 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:41.530
 for which we doctors was not 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:45.300

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.300
 when the uncle arrived and he
