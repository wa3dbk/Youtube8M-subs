00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
corn planted here and so what we've done

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.499 
corn planted here and so what we've done
is<00:02:08.679> we<00:02:08.769> come<00:02:09.009> through<00:02:09.190> and<00:02:09.340> harvested<00:02:09.849> all<00:02:10.450> the

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
is we come through and harvested all the

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.089 
is we come through and harvested all the
corn<00:02:11.440> and<00:02:11.650> then<00:02:12.370> we<00:02:13.030> pulled<00:02:13.299> the<00:02:13.360> plants<00:02:13.780> and

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
corn and then we pulled the plants and

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.039 
corn and then we pulled the plants and
left<00:02:15.099> them<00:02:15.340> in<00:02:15.519> the<00:02:15.610> beds<00:02:15.849> to<00:02:16.150> this<00:02:16.209> decay<00:02:16.720> and

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
left them in the beds to this decay and

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.949 
left them in the beds to this decay and
then<00:02:17.590> that<00:02:18.549> gradually<00:02:19.120> they<00:02:19.299> decay<00:02:19.599> into

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
then that gradually they decay into

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.990 
then that gradually they decay into

far<00:04:05.610> as<00:04:05.700> an<00:04:05.820> you<00:04:06.000> know<00:04:06.150> embedded<00:04:06.810> energy<00:04:06.990> and

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
far as an you know embedded energy and

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.130 
far as an you know embedded energy and
how<00:04:08.640> far<00:04:08.910> it's<00:04:09.030> been<00:04:09.120> transported<00:04:09.870> to<00:04:09.900> get

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
how far it's been transported to get

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.300 
how far it's been transported to get
here<00:04:10.470> and<00:04:10.620> you<00:04:10.680> know<00:04:10.860> there's<00:04:11.040> all<00:04:11.130> those

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
here and you know there's all those

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.810 
here and you know there's all those
things<00:04:11.550> that<00:04:11.640> go<00:04:11.730> into<00:04:12.030> it<00:04:12.180> and<00:04:13.610> where<00:04:14.610> some

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
things that go into it and where some

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.050 
things that go into it and where some
things<00:04:15.030> might<00:04:15.240> have<00:04:15.390> an<00:04:15.570> initial<00:04:16.020> high<00:04:17.060> energy

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
things might have an initial high energy

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.090 
things might have an initial high energy
used<00:04:18.299> to<00:04:18.480> make<00:04:18.660> it<00:04:18.810> like<00:04:18.989> a<00:04:19.020> zinc<00:04:19.410> roof<00:04:19.770> or

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
used to make it like a zinc roof or

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.400 
used to make it like a zinc roof or
something<00:04:20.610> but<00:04:20.820> it<00:04:20.940> could<00:04:21.480> last<00:04:21.660> 25<00:04:22.380> years

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
something but it could last 25 years

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.100 
something but it could last 25 years
also<00:04:22.890> so<00:04:23.340> if<00:04:23.490> you<00:04:23.580> do<00:04:23.730> it<00:04:23.850> over<00:04:24.120> time<00:04:24.150> you<00:04:24.990> know

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
also so if you do it over time you know

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.750 
also so if you do it over time you know
it<00:04:25.260> it's<00:04:26.130> very<00:04:26.520> effective<00:04:27.240> over<00:04:27.480> time

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
it it's very effective over time

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.720 
it it's very effective over time
energetically<00:04:29.760> let's<00:04:30.180> say<00:04:31.160> we<00:04:32.160> have<00:04:32.340> local

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
energetically let's say we have local

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.310 
energetically let's say we have local
wood<00:04:33.120> mills<00:04:33.390> that<00:04:33.600> are<00:04:33.720> just<00:04:33.870> at<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.050> top<00:04:34.260> of

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
wood mills that are just at the top of

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.440 
wood mills that are just at the top of
the<00:04:34.470> valley<00:04:34.680> so<00:04:35.070> you<00:04:35.520> know<00:04:35.640> less<00:04:36.000> than<00:04:36.030> 2<00:04:36.300> miles

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
the valley so you know less than 2 miles

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.810 
the valley so you know less than 2 miles
away<00:04:36.780> we<00:04:37.020> have<00:04:37.140> wood<00:04:37.320> mills<00:04:37.500> that<00:04:37.770> we<00:04:37.890> use<00:04:38.130> so

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
away we have wood mills that we use so

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.050 
away we have wood mills that we use so
wood<00:04:39.300> is<00:04:39.420> typically<00:04:40.700> obtained<00:04:41.700> you<00:04:42.000> know

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
wood is typically obtained you know

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.700 
wood is typically obtained you know
local<00:04:42.330> local<00:04:43.290> woods<00:04:43.500> and<00:04:45.230> there<00:04:46.230> are<00:04:46.380> you<00:04:46.650> know

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
local local woods and there are you know

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.230 
local local woods and there are you know
there<00:04:46.890> are<00:04:46.980> more<00:04:47.190> sustainable<00:04:47.760> woods<00:04:48.000> than

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
there are more sustainable woods than

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.510 
there are more sustainable woods than
than<00:04:48.570> others<00:04:48.960> to<00:04:49.620> people<00:04:49.920> on<00:04:50.010> the<00:04:50.130> farm<00:04:50.310> now

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520

you<00:05:02.220> know<00:05:02.280> we<00:05:02.400> are<00:05:02.520> an<00:05:02.610> organic<00:05:03.090> farm<00:05:03.360> and<00:05:03.650> so

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
you know we are an organic farm and so

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.800 
you know we are an organic farm and so
wants<00:05:05.550> to<00:05:05.580> live<00:05:05.729> with<00:05:05.850> an<00:05:05.940> off-gassing<00:05:06.389> house

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
wants to live with an off-gassing house

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.290 
wants to live with an off-gassing house
so<00:05:07.110> yeah<00:05:07.320> we<00:05:07.500> definitely<00:05:08.250> avoid<00:05:08.669> those<00:05:08.880> then

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
so yeah we definitely avoid those then

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
in the air took nine guys to lift it up

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.659 
in the air took nine guys to lift it up
there<00:05:18.060> held<00:05:18.509> up<00:05:18.720> by<00:05:18.900> one<00:05:19.259> piece<00:05:19.590> of<00:05:19.830> teak<00:05:20.070> split

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
there held up by one piece of teak split

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:23.779

lengthwise<00:05:20.880> 17<00:05:21.690> foot<00:05:21.930> long<00:05:22.110> and<00:05:22.610> then<00:05:23.610> that's

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
lengthwise 17 foot long and then that's

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:27.800 
lengthwise 17 foot long and then that's
sitting<00:05:24.150> on<00:05:24.590> tropical<00:05:25.590> Cypress<00:05:26.750> it's<00:05:27.750> a

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
sitting on tropical Cypress it's a

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.260 
sitting on tropical Cypress it's a
little<00:05:27.990> bit<00:05:28.080> thicker<00:05:28.350> and<00:05:28.820> it's<00:05:29.820> not<00:05:30.030> tongue

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
little bit thicker and it's not tongue

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.390 
little bit thicker and it's not tongue
and<00:05:30.449> groove<00:05:30.660> so<00:05:31.020> I<00:05:31.050> have<00:05:31.320> gaps<00:05:31.590> so<00:05:32.100> the<00:05:32.220> floor

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
and groove so I have gaps so the floor

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.969 
and groove so I have gaps so the floor
breathes<00:05:32.729> a<00:05:32.970> little<00:05:33.150> bit<00:05:33.240> better<00:05:33.919> and<00:05:34.919> then

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
breathes a little bit better and then

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:37.370 
breathes a little bit better and then
the<00:05:35.880> floor<00:05:36.120> is<00:05:36.300> all<00:05:36.449> setting<00:05:36.810> on<00:05:36.930> the<00:05:37.169> wood

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
the floor is all setting on the wood

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.629 
the floor is all setting on the wood
called<00:05:37.949> pelón<00:05:38.460> which<00:05:39.300> is<00:05:40.400> taken<00:05:41.400> from<00:05:41.490> a

called pelón which is taken from a
single<00:05:42.000> tree<00:05:42.210> the<00:05:42.690> wood<00:05:42.900> is<00:05:43.639> really

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 
single tree the wood is really

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:46.580 
single tree the wood is really
world-class<00:05:45.090> there's<00:05:45.630> just<00:05:45.900> a<00:05:46.020> ton<00:05:46.289> of<00:05:46.320> it

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
world-class there's just a ton of it

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.890 
world-class there's just a ton of it
there's<00:05:47.130> nine<00:05:47.520> types<00:05:47.850> of<00:05:48.030> wood<00:05:48.240> in<00:05:48.479> the<00:05:48.750> house

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
there's nine types of wood in the house

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.650 
there's nine types of wood in the house
so<00:05:49.169> far<00:05:49.580> and<00:05:50.580> that's<00:05:50.760> just<00:05:50.970> because<00:05:51.120> each

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
so far and that's just because each

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.110 
so far and that's just because each
piece<00:05:51.900> of<00:05:51.960> wood<00:05:52.110> has<00:05:52.530> a<00:05:52.560> specific<00:05:53.160> use<00:05:53.370> use<00:05:54.090> a

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
piece of wood has a specific use use a

piece of wood has a specific use use a
type<00:05:54.389> of<00:05:54.510> wood<00:05:54.630> based<00:05:54.840> on<00:05:55.020> what<00:05:55.260> you're<00:05:55.380> going

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
type of wood based on what you're going

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.960 
type of wood based on what you're going
to<00:05:55.560> do<00:05:55.650> with<00:05:55.770> it<00:05:55.949> and<00:05:56.400> I'm<00:05:56.490> doing<00:05:56.639> it<00:05:56.820> all

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
to do with it and I'm doing it all

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.740 
to do with it and I'm doing it all
primarily<00:05:57.870> myself<00:05:58.430> I<00:05:59.430> find<00:06:00.120> that<00:06:00.419> it's<00:06:00.570> very

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
primarily myself I find that it's very

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.159 
primarily myself I find that it's very
therapeutic

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.169 
therapeutic

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:05.540 
therapeutic
we<00:06:04.169> have<00:06:04.259> several<00:06:04.560> water<00:06:04.740> sources<00:06:05.220> that<00:06:05.400> we

we have several water sources that we

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.960 
we have several water sources that we
could<00:06:05.729> use<00:06:06.419> our<00:06:06.660> main<00:06:06.960> small<00:06:07.710> river<00:06:07.979> which<00:06:08.849> is

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:08.970 
could use our main small river which is

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.689 
could use our main small river which is
very<00:06:09.150> dynamic<00:06:09.660> in<00:06:09.840> the<00:06:10.770> wet<00:06:10.919> season<00:06:11.130> or<00:06:11.490> our

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:11.699 
very dynamic in the wet season or our

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:14.860

internal spring that's on our farm to

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:20.180 
internal spring that's on our farm to
maybe<00:06:15.870> produce<00:06:16.199> 1<00:06:17.630> 1<00:06:18.630> to<00:06:18.750> 2<00:06:18.780> kilowatts<00:06:19.410> you

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
maybe produce 1 1 to 2 kilowatts you

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.370 
maybe produce 1 1 to 2 kilowatts you
know<00:06:20.280> that<00:06:20.460> we<00:06:20.550> could<00:06:20.699> put<00:06:20.880> back<00:06:21.090> into<00:06:21.479> our<00:06:21.630> we

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 
know that we could put back into our we

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.600 
know that we could put back into our we
have<00:06:22.500> our<00:06:22.620> you<00:06:22.919> know<00:06:22.979> I've<00:06:23.099> created<00:06:23.370> our<00:06:23.580> own

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
have our you know I've created our own

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.279 
have our you know I've created our own
grid<00:06:24.210> or<00:06:24.419> electric<00:06:24.720> we<00:06:25.020> have<00:06:25.110> our<00:06:25.229> own

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:25.289 
grid or electric we have our own

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:27.200 
grid or electric we have our own
electric<00:06:25.620> grid<00:06:25.830> here<00:06:26.099> that<00:06:26.699> we<00:06:26.820> you<00:06:27.120> know

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.210 
electric grid here that we you know

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.450 
electric grid here that we you know
bring<00:06:27.720> in<00:06:27.840> the<00:06:27.930> main<00:06:28.080> lines<00:06:28.320> -<00:06:28.650> and<00:06:28.830> then<00:06:28.919> all

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
bring in the main lines - and then all

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.180 
bring in the main lines - and then all
the<00:06:29.669> homes<00:06:29.849> are<00:06:30.000> wired<00:06:30.210> internally<00:06:31.039> with<00:06:32.039> our

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
the homes are wired internally with our

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.939 
the homes are wired internally with our
own<00:06:32.310> system<00:06:32.760> so<00:06:33.389> we<00:06:33.750> could<00:06:33.930> do<00:06:34.080> a<00:06:34.110> grid<00:06:34.440> tied<00:06:34.710> to

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:34.949 
own system so we could do a grid tied to

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:38.240 
own system so we could do a grid tied to
hydro<00:06:35.400> that<00:06:35.940> would<00:06:36.030> offset<00:06:36.180> our<00:06:36.720> use<00:06:37.620> from<00:06:38.099> the

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.250 
hydro that would offset our use from the

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.219 
hydro that would offset our use from the
utility<00:06:38.610> company<00:06:38.639> people<00:06:39.360> that<00:06:39.570> do<00:06:39.690> well<00:06:39.900> in

Costa Rica in this environment obviously

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.320 
Costa Rica in this environment obviously
have<00:06:42.539> to<00:06:42.690> be<00:06:42.810> adaptable<00:06:43.440> we<00:06:44.220> we<00:06:44.580> find<00:06:44.909> that<00:06:45.090> the

have to be adaptable we we find that the
