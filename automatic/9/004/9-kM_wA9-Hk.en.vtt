behave like this but there is an urgency

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.870 
behave like this but there is an urgency
midway<00:01:39.499> through<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:39.859> race<00:01:39.890> if<00:01:40.490> you<00:01:40.670> think

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
midway through the race if you think

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.789
