different about the LAN setting versus

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.090 
different about the LAN setting versus
the<00:01:50.929> online<00:01:51.020> setting<00:01:51.409> because<00:01:51.560> recently<00:01:51.830> a

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
the online setting because recently a

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.249 
the online setting because recently a
lot<00:01:52.280> of<00:01:52.310> teams<00:01:52.520> thought<00:01:52.850> MSI<00:01:53.630> is<00:01:53.690> really<00:01:54.080> good

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
lot of teams thought MSI is really good

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.139 
lot of teams thought MSI is really good
for<00:01:54.440> coming<00:01:54.830> into<00:01:54.950> this<00:01:55.159> land<00:01:55.399> they've<00:01:55.909> not

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
for coming into this land they've not

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.240 
for coming into this land they've not
been<00:01:56.179> doing<00:01:56.390> so<00:01:56.630> well<00:01:56.659> on<00:01:57.049> the<00:01:57.440> online<00:01:57.619> circuit

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
been doing so well on the online circuit

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.580 
been doing so well on the online circuit
so<00:01:58.520> what<00:01:59.390> is<00:01:59.539> so<00:01:59.720> different<00:01:59.929> about<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.440> LAN

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
so what is so different about the LAN

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.900 
so what is so different about the LAN
environment<00:02:00.739> that<00:02:01.190> really<00:02:01.369> sets<00:02:01.700> you<00:02:01.789> guys

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
environment that really sets you guys

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.589 
environment that really sets you guys
apart<00:02:01.970> from<00:02:02.360> everyone<00:02:02.569> else<00:02:04.030> like<00:02:05.030> on<00:02:05.270> land

00:02:05.589 --> 00:02:05.599 
apart from everyone else like on land

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:07.869

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
like when I came up here and I sort of

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.430 
like when I came up here and I sort of
still<00:03:02.700> do<00:03:02.879> because<00:03:03.180> now<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.510> have<00:03:03.870> like<00:03:04.079> lack<00:03:04.290> of

sleep and basically I think it's just
like<00:03:07.680> stress<00:03:08.040> or<00:03:08.280> something<00:03:08.579> and<00:03:08.940> then<00:03:09.870> I<00:03:10.200> went

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
they just I don't know what they

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.710 
they just I don't know what they
expected<00:06:11.039> but<00:06:11.280> I<00:06:11.340> guess<00:06:11.639> more<00:06:11.789> from<00:06:11.970> 0to<00:06:12.270> and

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
expected but I guess more from 0to and

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.589 
expected but I guess more from 0to and
they<00:06:12.870> really<00:06:13.199> show<00:06:13.409> that<00:06:13.650> off<00:06:13.830> and<00:06:14.099> so<00:06:14.940> for<00:06:15.479> me

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:15.599 
they really show that off and so for me

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:17.960 
they really show that off and so for me
personally<00:06:15.630> this<00:06:16.530> win<00:06:16.800> was<00:06:17.009> not<00:06:17.550> only<00:06:17.849> about

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:17.970

beating<00:06:18.360> them<00:06:18.509> but<00:06:18.690> beating<00:06:18.960> them<00:06:19.139> to<00:06:19.349> to<00:06:19.620> zero

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:19.889

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:21.830 
beating them but beating them to to zero
