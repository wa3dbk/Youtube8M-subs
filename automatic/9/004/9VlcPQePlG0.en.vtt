00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 or youtube kicks like this one 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.940
 welcome to a new android video 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.980
 angle I think it's going to be to give you some 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.710
 features such as information the 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.870
 image of theft devices 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.640
 submitted by samsung which is the 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:23.519
 samsung galaxy to 5 and the galaxy to 3 these 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.099
 Those who seek mainly are to be 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.939
 premium for its construction material 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:33.480
 which is the metal of the same and the design 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.660
 these devices are of the mid-range 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.170
 but with specifications higher than 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.610
 motogp that would be the king of this 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.850
 spectrum 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.500
 so they seem to be very promising and 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.110
 and to use with packaging is one thing that 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:54.690
 they already did these metal experiments 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.850
 with the alpha galaxy and the galaxy nose 4 and 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.710
 So far they seem to have succeeded 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.840
 but let's see how the thing continues 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.720
 that stands out from these devices is 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.390
 its large screen size has a 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.400
 good ram and a lower weight to 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.640
 125 grams 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.890
 now soon we will see 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.290
 your full specifications of each 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.920
 one of the five and the three with 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.680
 some images and things that stand out 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.740
 of these mobiles so for more 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.110
 specifications and now already if we are going to 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:37.400
 go to see the specifications of galaxy 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:39.530
 3 that the 5 starting with the a 3 that is 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.020
 a little lower at 5 and while we go 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.860
 leaving with some images so that 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.409
 see how good we are to start the 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:53.390
 clay 3 has dimensions of 131 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:57.380

 operative android 4.4 kit kat 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:24.040
 Reasoning of 16 GB of internal memory 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.680
 plus the clot for a micro memory 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.989
 the camera has the main one of 8 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.709
 megapixels and a front 5 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:36.540
 megapixels the battery is 12 thousand 900 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:39.010
 milliamps and the departure date is 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.500
 considers that it is in November and the 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.439
 exit price is still around 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.829
 confirm so now let's see the 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:53.139

 300,000 amps and the departure date is 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.910
 same in November and the price has 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.130
 confirmed and now 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.170
 except the technical specifications of 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.990
 every device we are going to see them and 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.100
 quickly those lives and the differences 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:43.190
 among all 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.260
 the first thing all ram memory was 5 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.260
 has 2 and the 3 100 euros 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.630
 we buried the main chamber of the 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:56.130
 513 against 8 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:04:00.960
 but they are 52 out of 300 against 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:06.270
 1900 pirates has a density of being 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:11.640
 is 293 against 245 in front of 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:15.270
 5.0 amore super amoled screen of the 5 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:20.730
 against a 4.5-inch screen with 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:22.170
 a quad hd super amoled of 3 these two 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.630
 devices are going to get in 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:28.650
 the colors white gold blue gray 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.180
 black and pink so we're not 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.300
 we inform 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.300
 in this time and another thing is that they are 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.009
 want to sell we had 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.949
 the last ones could be undone 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:42.710
 positive about mental of children 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:45.470
 These materials can be submerged 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.330
 nor resistant to water then it is something 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.729
 as weird that this one will not have more 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:54.259
 samsung device submersible to water 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:56.030
 as in s5 the 75 is one 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:59.960
 plastic construction and is submersible 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:02.479
 water resistant in pop but that 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.580
 the 61 metal society that is a 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:07.039
 material plus awards will make them more 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.750
 resistant the cell-hitters and 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:12.349
 this is something very important for many 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:14.780
 as in the 46 cause resistant but or 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:17.569
 it also has in all 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.819
 values and good constructions we are going to 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:22.310
 see shares sighing color penalty 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.810
 answer so good this has been all 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.879
 for today but that you liked the
