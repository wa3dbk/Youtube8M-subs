00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:19.189 
okay here's a big ugly piece of fur
we<00:00:05.310> gotta<00:00:05.609> contend<00:00:06.150> with<00:00:17.449> what<00:00:18.449> circle<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:19.050> my

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
we gotta contend with what circle is my

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:26.720 
we gotta contend with what circle is my
classes<00:00:19.939> so<00:00:20.939> that's<00:00:21.060> better<00:00:25.160> start<00:00:26.160> again

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
classes so that's better start again

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.210 
classes so that's better start again
okay<00:00:27.180> now<00:00:27.449> I'm<00:00:27.660> talking<00:00:27.930> strictly<00:00:28.439> meters

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
okay now I'm talking strictly meters

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.970

here<00:00:29.779> so<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:30.810> had<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.230> cut<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.500> four<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:33.440> six<00:00:34.440> three

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
here so I had to cut a four to six three

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.940 
here so I had to cut a four to six three
off<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.820> this<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.780> rest<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.190> log<00:00:38.430> was

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
off of this and the rest of the log was

00:00:39.950 --> 00:03:26.270 
off of this and the rest of the log was
strictly<00:00:42.559> jump
