00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:04.029
 hello my name is poppy and now i'm 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:06.310
 I will tell you a little and so do the reference 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.299
 card combat operation locked up mode 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:12.089
 big grip 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:13.709
 direction of opera 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:15.829
 pretty simple you don't go to the point 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:17.599
 charlie inside the facility 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.150
 or kids but charlie dot down the street 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.490
 seizing the point is the one who first come running 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.689
 shoot off several enemies and support 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.550
 defense for at least some time 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.960
 stretch the rest of the threads and thousands 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.480
 to move quickly at the beginning 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.730
 I advise you to put the round 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.640
 attack specialization 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.680
 on the first level of this specialization you 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.310
 get Becky's ability 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.130
 will run faster than others 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.130
 respectively on the point you are first and 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.700
 offer them 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.660
 to get to charlie point faster 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.600
 the rest I just specializations there 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.050
 attacks pass verification throwing a rope 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.930
 for enemies who run to the point as well 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.140
 as I 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.090
 then before the capture point is optional 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.060
 to run over the towers this capture can stand 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.700
 near her on the first level 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.780
 this position is a small board rat pups 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.860
 bidding future through the tunnel but get up 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.830
 you also need so that you are not seen by enemies with 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.830
 balcony to the street 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.520
 if you decide to run down the street then 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.540
 do not need straight Mitsuno balcony 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.160
 first you need to gently leak 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.160
 dulles that enemies can run and there already 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.460
 decide the situation 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.400
 if the proportion of enemies is much better to take 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.250
 defense position 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.220
 prevent enemies from approaching 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.670
 if enemies are near the shore at the target point 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.180
 shootout or even a point 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.340
 owned by enemies 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.670
 better go inside 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.280
 get up on the balconies and try lp 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.920
 kill several enemies 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.920
 and maybe even help capture 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.970
 if the share of enemies is not present, ours or soon 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.460
 will our Too can try to go up 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.460
 next goal 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.280
 taxes and any class can be helpful 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.210
 for the team 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.479
 but the most useful group of attack aircraft 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.220
 because it is very common 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.600
 shooting at the near and middle 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.040
 distances 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.510
 and in the blood to a full arsenal of weapons and 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.790
 gadgets to attack defense breakthrough 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:04.970
 treatment 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.340
 can watch battle nut attack aircraft on 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.850
 this link is really outdated 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.419
 with the latest updates 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:13.799
 but the main things in it remained unchanged 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:16.799
 it's all clear 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:20.829
 but here or the situation may change 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:22.139
 pretty fast and 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:24.179
 ammo can quickly run out 

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:26.169
 here support with ammunition skills 

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:26.710
 will help 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.390
 second in importance i put the class 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.510
 support with specialization 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.179
 perimeter defense 

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:33.419
 This specialization at the second level gives 

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:35.050
 enhanced repression skill 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.660
 which is good for breaking big 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.070
 clusters of opponents or 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.359
 defense point 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.579
 still in the game chat often see a boxer 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.259
 about the use of xm25 

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:46.899
 supposedly all their sanchi tina would fear them 

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:47.549
 resident of 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.029
 I personally do not see any special problems here 

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:52.909
 xm25 is effective against its cows on the roof in 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:54.159
 the first place 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:55.730
 secondly, it is effective in places 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.669
 clusters of enemies who have nowhere 

00:02:57.669 --> 00:02:58.709
 move 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.899
 and since most picasa coachmen are people 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:02.579
 not far that not just gonna shoot 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.269
 in the same place until the phrase gets 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.260
 so if you see about your position 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.449
 shoots pixar 25 

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:11.439
 do not go there 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:12.799
 everything is very simple 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.649
 the same goes for mortar 

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:17.319
 see that you have your hands off 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:18.879
 mortar is more effective against 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.759
 tigers and recharge him for a long time 

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:24.459
 so you just need to move and you 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.459
 one mortar will not reach 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:32.919
 the third most important class is an engineer with 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:34.419
 rate of carbines or 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:35.209
 to file 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.299
 in general befits very well 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.509
 for close range and October shooting 

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:41.709
 taxes just such situations are pretty 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.109
 often found but from gadgets 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.099
 the engineer can only be useful 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:47.349
 any grenade launcher 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.149
 again can petrakov more on 

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:51.779
 close range or break walls and towers 

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:53.569
 for getting tactical 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.569
 advantage 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:00.309
 in the fourth most important place for me 

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:02.780
 to develop a peccident precisely his mother of development 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.120
 the one who will give the information to the positions 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.869
 of enemies 

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:08.469
 from cities need to use 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:11.439
 motion sensor or thinking outside 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:13.659
 the lighthouse is of little use because the locker 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:15.529
 the map is quite small and penalized 

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:17.109
 lighthouse can hear easily 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.120
 you can put a lighthouse near the line 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.620
 defense so in case of death reso 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.969
 price it 

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:25.699
 grain is advised carbine 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.699
 I do not recommend playing on the forest crown block 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.069
 the keeperâ€™s sniper team benefits almost 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:32.700
 no card small closed 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.640
 battles take place at close range 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.270
 only spring can it come in handy 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.879
 keep it in the street at point q 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:40.789
 but he should do it very well 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:42.729
 not even very good 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.729
 really ohrimenko 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:53.830
 this ends the first part 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.030
 so such operations are no solutions 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.779
 big salary 

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:59.809
 if you liked this idea do that 

00:04:59.809 --> 00:05:01.389
 subscribe to the channel 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:03.120
 by the way thumbs up 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.529
 also rate my other videos 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:06.179
 bye everyone
