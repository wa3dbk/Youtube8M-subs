you to figure out there's no hint button

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.250 
you to figure out there's no hint button
so<00:04:11.400> you're<00:04:11.550> forced<00:04:11.850> to<00:04:11.910> skip<00:04:12.300> and<00:04:12.510> not<00:04:12.750> get<00:04:13.110> any

type of satisfaction it takes anywhere

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.830
