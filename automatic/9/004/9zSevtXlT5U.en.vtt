00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
hi this is a short video on the moose

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.400 
hi this is a short video on the moose
racing<00:00:03.720> easy<00:00:04.230> pole<00:00:04.680> clutch<00:00:05.069> system<00:00:05.370> and<00:00:06.410> when

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
racing easy pole clutch system and when

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.230 
racing easy pole clutch system and when
I<00:00:07.440> was<00:00:07.770> thinking<00:00:08.160> of<00:00:08.370> purchasing<00:00:08.849> this<00:00:09.000> I

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
I was thinking of purchasing this I

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.350 
I was thinking of purchasing this I
looked<00:00:09.599> all<00:00:09.719> over<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.960> internet<00:00:10.380> for<00:00:10.800> a

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360 
looked all over the internet for a

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.400 
looked all over the internet for a
description<00:00:12.360> of<00:00:12.480> how<00:00:12.599> it<00:00:12.719> worked<00:00:12.929> or<00:00:13.200> how<00:00:13.290> it

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
description of how it worked or how it

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.810 
description of how it worked or how it
was<00:00:13.530> put<00:00:13.710> together<00:00:13.830> or<00:00:14.160> what<00:00:14.309> was<00:00:14.460> inside<00:00:14.790> of

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
was put together or what was inside of

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.000 
was put together or what was inside of
that<00:00:15.089> little<00:00:15.330> box<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.529> couldn't<00:00:16.770> find

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
that little box and I couldn't find

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.890 
that little box and I couldn't find
anything<00:00:17.250> so<00:00:17.400> I'm<00:00:18.300> putting<00:00:18.600> this<00:00:18.690> video

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
anything so I'm putting this video

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.450 
anything so I'm putting this video
together<00:00:19.199> in<00:00:19.740> case<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:20.070> have<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.279> same

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
together in case you have the same

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.570 
together in case you have the same
curiosity<00:00:21.500> before<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.590> purchase<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.310> did

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
curiosity before you purchase that I did

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.960 
curiosity before you purchase that I did
so<00:00:24.510> I'm<00:00:25.019> rebuilding<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:26.869> Honda<00:00:27.869> CR<00:00:28.140> 250<00:00:28.680> here

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
so I'm rebuilding a Honda CR 250 here

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.060 
so I'm rebuilding a Honda CR 250 here
from<00:00:29.970> scratch<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:31.140> tore<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.380> down<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.859> frame

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
from scratch I tore it down to the frame

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.959 
from scratch I tore it down to the frame
and<00:00:33.590> just<00:00:34.590> getting<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:34.950> all<00:00:35.100> powder-coated<00:00:35.820> up

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
and just getting it all powder-coated up

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.200 
and just getting it all powder-coated up
and<00:00:36.270> doing<00:00:37.020> all<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.260> stuff<00:00:37.579> and<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:39.000> think

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
and doing all that stuff and I think

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.819 
and doing all that stuff and I think
probably<00:00:39.660> most<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.200> bike<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.469> new<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:40.770> I'm

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
probably most of the bike is new so I'm

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.139 
probably most of the bike is new so I'm
putting<00:00:41.070> some<00:00:41.250> new<00:00:41.370> levers<00:00:41.670> on<00:00:41.850> it

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
putting some new levers on it

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.250 
putting some new levers on it
these<00:00:42.450> are<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.629> SVC<00:00:43.290> sixes<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.930> I'm<00:00:45.930> attaching

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
these are a SVC sixes and I'm attaching

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.450 
these are a SVC sixes and I'm attaching
it<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:47.450> this<00:00:48.450> little<00:00:48.719> box<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.950> make<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.250> clutch

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
it to this little box to make the clutch

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.090 
it to this little box to make the clutch
bowl<00:00:50.670> easier<00:00:50.940> because<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.780> engine<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.350> put

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
bowl easier because in the engine I put

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.380 
bowl easier because in the engine I put
stiffer<00:00:53.430> clutch<00:00:54.239> springs<00:00:54.629> in<00:00:55.379> there<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.640> and

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
stiffer clutch springs in there so and

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.459 
stiffer clutch springs in there so and
also<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:58.020> put<00:00:58.559> some<00:00:59.449> risers<00:01:00.449> on<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.020> handlebars

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
also I put some risers on the handlebars

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.130 
also I put some risers on the handlebars
that<00:01:01.739> make<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.219> quite<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.460> bit<00:01:02.520> taller<00:01:02.899> on<00:01:03.899> these

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
that make it quite a bit taller on these

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.990 
that make it quite a bit taller on these
Pro<00:01:04.470> Taper<00:01:04.680> contour<00:01:05.640> handlebars<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.420> I

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
Pro Taper contour handlebars and I

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.940 
Pro Taper contour handlebars and I
needed<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.090> extra<00:01:09.390> length<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.470> couldn't

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
needed the extra length and I couldn't

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.050 
needed the extra length and I couldn't
find<00:01:11.220> an<00:01:11.580> extra<00:01:12.030> long<00:01:12.180> cable<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.110> a

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
find an extra long cable so this is a

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.240 
find an extra long cable so this is a
motion<00:01:15.060> Pro<00:01:15.210> Terminator<00:01:15.750> cable<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.770> has<00:01:16.920> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
motion Pro Terminator cable it has the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.010 
motion Pro Terminator cable it has the
straight<00:01:17.549> pulled<00:01:17.820> fibers<00:01:18.299> inside<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:18.869> it's<00:01:18.990> a

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
straight pulled fibers inside so it's a

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.859 
straight pulled fibers inside so it's a
little<00:01:19.200> easier<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.470> pull<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.390> I<00:01:21.390> needed

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
little easier to pull and I needed

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.990 
little easier to pull and I needed
another<00:01:22.110> three<00:01:22.740> or<00:01:22.830> four<00:01:22.979> inches<00:01:23.310> or<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:23.610> to

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
another three or four inches or so to

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.929 
another three or four inches or so to
make<00:01:24.119> everything<00:01:24.360> work<00:01:24.630> nicely<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.320> thought

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
make everything work nicely so I thought

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.340 
make everything work nicely so I thought
that<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.180> would<00:01:27.390> do<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.659> trick<00:01:27.750> by<00:01:28.020> adding

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
that this would do the trick by adding

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.819 
that this would do the trick by adding
some<00:01:28.590> distance<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.420> circuit<00:01:30.829> and

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
some distance in the in the circuit and

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.730 
some distance in the in the circuit and
it<00:01:31.979> did<00:01:32.100> just<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:33.240> but<00:01:33.600> as<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.079> bonus<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.680> get

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
it did just that so but as a bonus I get

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.880 
it did just that so but as a bonus I get
the<00:01:35.040> easy<00:01:35.700> pull<00:01:36.000> feature<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:37.439> can<00:01:37.619> see

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
the easy pull feature and you can see

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.910 
the easy pull feature and you can see
that<00:01:38.670> there's<00:01:39.180> an<00:01:39.329> adjustable<00:01:39.780> pin<00:01:40.530> that

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
that there's an adjustable pin that

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.090 
that there's an adjustable pin that
changes<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.520> fulcrum<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:43.170> pole<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:44.009> the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
changes the fulcrum of the pole of the

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.710 
changes the fulcrum of the pole of the
lever<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.579> might<00:01:44.970> have<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.210> on<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.390> easiest

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
lever you might have it on the easiest

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.630 
lever you might have it on the easiest
and<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.020> thought<00:01:46.200> why<00:01:46.530> not<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:47.310> know<00:01:47.399> make<00:01:47.610> it

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
and I thought why not you know make it

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.730 
and I thought why not you know make it
as<00:01:47.850> easy<00:01:48.000> as<00:01:48.149> possible<00:01:48.290> kind<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.380> mimic<00:01:49.619> a

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
as easy as possible kind of mimic a

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.190 
as easy as possible kind of mimic a
hydraulic<00:01:50.250> clutch<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.820> that's<00:01:51.570> an<00:01:51.750> ASP

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
hydraulic clutch and that's an ASP

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.819 
hydraulic clutch and that's an ASP
shorty<00:01:52.860> lever<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:54.409> it<00:01:55.409> should<00:01:55.649> all<00:01:55.799> work

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
shorty lever and it should all work

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.850 
shorty lever and it should all work
together<00:01:56.310> quite<00:01:56.820> nicely<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:58.229> don't<00:01:58.590> have<00:01:58.770> it

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
together quite nicely so I don't have it

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.990 
together quite nicely so I don't have it
on<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.070> bike<00:01:59.219> we'll<00:01:59.490> try<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.729> give<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> little

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
on the bike we'll try and give a little

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.639 
on the bike we'll try and give a little
tug<00:02:00.210> here<00:02:00.479> but<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.659> see<00:02:00.810> when<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:00.960> squeeze<00:02:01.469> the

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
tug here but you see when I squeeze the

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.800 
tug here but you see when I squeeze the
lever<00:02:02.149> kind<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.240> squeeze<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.570> together

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
lever kind of squeeze it together

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.300 
lever kind of squeeze it together
one-handed<00:02:04.500> there<00:02:06.740> you<00:02:07.740> can<00:02:07.890> see<00:02:08.039> how<00:02:08.190> it

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
one-handed there you can see how it

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.050 
one-handed there you can see how it
moves<00:02:08.550> inside<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.690> that's<00:02:09.840> all<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.170> is

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060
