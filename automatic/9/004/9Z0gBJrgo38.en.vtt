00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:14.820
 Today I 'm going to teach you how to make a tripod 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:17.700
 calling in some way is to support the 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.800
 mobile or the ipod or the iphone or whatever 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.259
 to watch videos 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.099
 or anything can be loaded too 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:28.960
 with a piece of cardboard removed outside 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.509
 of a box, but it can be 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.500
 any type of cardboard whenever it is 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.500
 a little resistant 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.340
 a piece of cardboard 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:45.480
 a pair of scissors a glue gun or 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.570
 normal glue and current bow for 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.350
 cut and hairs 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.129
 certain 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.129
 skewers 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:00.050
 and a good Chinese toothpick let's start 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:03.320
 here we have the cardboard and we are going to take 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.640
 one of the skewers and we're going to cut it 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.640
 about five centimeters 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.050
 good once we cut the two 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.140
 pieces of skewer both give me 5 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.130
 centimeters we take the device that 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.930
 we want 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:23.710
 I'm going to take my mobile nokia lumia and what 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.710
 let's put it like this 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.840
 let's measure it 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.930
 what measures more or less the screen 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:40.259
 and this measures five centimeters 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:40.259
 we take the marker 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.200
 and we mark it 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.620
 and there's going to be where we're going to hit the 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.200
 two sticks 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.010
 we take the glue gun we put 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.010
 a droplet 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.570
 we press for the one that is proven 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.000
 but not 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.000
 I'm like this 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.120
 so that it is almost dry, we take 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.950
 we do the same with the other we put 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.950
 a drop of glue here 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.140
 I see 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:35.050
 well I have them stuck I recommend 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.620
 use the hot silicone gun 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:42.460
 because it dries fast and then it's more 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.710
 easy now I'm going to reinforce them because 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.890
 with a droplet of glue can not 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:51.160
 last a lot good in the glue already 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.320
 is dry is already reinforced and so that 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.090
 the mobile can support this is the 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.550
 foundation is valid but you can do that because 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:02.160
 can stand but so that it does not 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:05.380
 slide let's use the stick 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:09.850
 and we are going to cut it into pieces of 1 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:12.430
 three centimeters to hold the phone 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.520
 let's run after several and so you can 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.280
 recline as you want 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:22.600
 the chopsticks I 'm not going to cut you with 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.970
 the marquetry saw a hacksaw a 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.440
 Once we have it cut, I've done three 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.290
 for my size 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.690
 the cardboard each person can catch a 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.840
 Smallest bigger carton and make 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.160
 more depends on your mobile would also serve 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.770
 for tablet but you would have to use 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.370
 another thing for this because he can not stand 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:46.470
 so much weight 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:49.390
 and well I'm going to catch and one I'm going to 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:53.250
 paste here 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.250
 other then here 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.480
 and other 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:02.239
 here 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.239
 well this I'm going to remove 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:09.459
 so i'm going to put 2 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.150
 so I'm going to hit him with the gun 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.150
 of glue 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:19.430
 you can use the normal glue and 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.430
 current or tail like this 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.020
 this white school or carpentry 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:33.970
 but 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.970
 I like to stick with the gun 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:38.169
 since you can not paste 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.990
 at the time and dried fast 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.080
 and this we put it 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.080
 here 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:02.419
 let it dry and as you will see the piece 

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:05.059
 cardboard is a little dirty then 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:07.999
 each person can decorate it as 

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:10.990
 you can put stickers on it 

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:14.350
 paint it with a spray 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.900
 and that's good now it's dry and we're going to 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.639
 do the test 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:22.249
 we put it and it goes perfectly 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:25.400
 this is to leave it like that and it goes too 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:30.169
 very well if you want us to make a video 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:34.189
 for tablets for the ipad for a 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:36.230
 samsung tablet for whatever it is to stop 

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:38.800
 the comments 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.800
 cast
