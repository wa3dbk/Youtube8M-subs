transform<00:04:05.950> him<00:04:06.190> mainly<00:04:06.550> because<00:04:06.790> it<00:04:07.270> would

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
transform him mainly because it would

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.910

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:11.609 

it's<00:05:09.229> just<00:05:09.499> really<00:05:10.159> nice<00:05:10.490> figure<00:05:10.939> dealing

00:05:11.609 --> 00:05:11.619 
it's just really nice figure dealing

00:05:11.619 --> 00:05:16.439 
it's just really nice figure dealing
downsize<00:05:12.619> really<00:05:13.869> and<00:05:14.869> there<00:05:15.349> are<00:05:15.529> people

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
downsize really and there are people

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:20.070 
downsize really and there are people
they<00:05:17.449> do<00:05:17.509> is<00:05:17.689> just<00:05:17.899> turn<00:05:18.169> the<00:05:18.289> head<00:05:18.439> around<00:05:18.709> to

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
they do is just turn the head around to

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.070 
they do is just turn the head around to
hide<00:05:21.080> it<00:05:21.259> I<00:05:21.469> read<00:05:21.889> online<00:05:22.039> though<00:05:22.369> so<00:05:22.729> I<00:05:23.080> see

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
hide it I read online though so I see

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:30.369 
hide it I read online though so I see
like<00:05:24.259> that<00:05:25.300> and<00:05:27.039> yeah<00:05:28.039> it's<00:05:28.309> just<00:05:28.550> a<00:05:29.379> really

00:05:30.369 --> 00:05:30.379 
like that and yeah it's just a really

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:32.589 
like that and yeah it's just a really
nice<00:05:30.619> trip<00:05:30.919> mode<00:05:31.159> I<00:05:31.429> think<00:05:32.119> there's<00:05:32.270> another

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:32.599 
nice trip mode I think there's another

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:34.600 
nice trip mode I think there's another
thing<00:05:32.839> take<00:05:33.409> time<00:05:33.649> out<00:05:33.800> but<00:05:34.009> I<00:05:34.189> think<00:05:34.580> that

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
thing take time out but I think that

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.929 
thing take time out but I think that
looks<00:05:34.789> such<00:05:35.330> as<00:05:35.479> a<00:05:35.509> eat<00:05:36.199> here<00:05:36.709> just<00:05:37.429> look<00:05:37.639> to<00:05:37.669> my

00:05:37.929 --> 00:05:37.939 
looks such as a eat here just look to my

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:43.089 
looks such as a eat here just look to my
sukkah<00:05:38.149> to<00:05:38.389> robot<00:05:41.319> alright<00:05:42.319> and<00:05:42.529> size

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:43.099 
sukkah to robot alright and size

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:50.019 
sukkah to robot alright and size
comparison<00:05:44.050> to<00:05:45.309> premium<00:05:46.309> black<00:05:47.119> out<00:05:48.849> if<00:05:49.849> you

00:05:50.019 --> 00:05:50.029 
comparison to premium black out if you

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:56.350 
comparison to premium black out if you
can<00:05:50.180> see<00:05:51.189> blackout<00:05:52.189> is<00:05:53.469> longer

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
can see blackout is longer

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.080 
can see blackout is longer
and<00:05:56.449> he<00:05:57.379> probably<00:05:57.949> should<00:05:58.250> be<00:05:58.370> supposed<00:05:58.879> to<00:05:59.030> be

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
and he probably should be supposed to be

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:08.239 
and he probably should be supposed to be
a<00:05:59.360> really<00:05:59.900> big<00:06:00.789> chopper

00:06:08.239 --> 00:06:08.249 

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:13.429 

and<00:06:08.339> so<00:06:09.239> that's<00:06:10.339> pretty<00:06:11.339> much<00:06:11.519> it<00:06:12.439> the

00:06:13.429 --> 00:06:13.439 
and so that's pretty much it the

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:15.739 
and so that's pretty much it the
self-serve<00:06:13.949> scream<00:06:14.309> unfortunately<00:06:15.239> he<00:06:15.569> will

00:06:15.739 --> 00:06:15.749 
self-serve scream unfortunately he will

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:18.469 
self-serve scream unfortunately he will
probably<00:06:16.409> end<00:06:16.919> up<00:06:17.069> being<00:06:17.339> a<00:06:17.519> shelf<00:06:18.059> well

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 
probably end up being a shelf well

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:20.509 
probably end up being a shelf well
that's<00:06:19.109> good<00:06:19.349> and<00:06:19.499> bad<00:06:19.649> you'll<00:06:19.829> probably<00:06:20.129> end

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:20.519 
that's good and bad you'll probably end

00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:23.779 
that's good and bad you'll probably end
up<00:06:20.699> being<00:06:20.939> a<00:06:21.059> shelf<00:06:21.359> warmer<00:06:22.429> due<00:06:23.429> to<00:06:23.579> the<00:06:23.639> fact

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:23.789 
up being a shelf warmer due to the fact

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:26.749 
up being a shelf warmer due to the fact
that<00:06:23.939> he<00:06:24.479> came<00:06:24.989> out<00:06:25.259> the<00:06:25.829> same<00:06:26.189> day<00:06:26.249> that

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:26.759 
that he came out the same day that

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:30.799 
that he came out the same day that
animated<00:06:27.539> was<00:06:28.169> officially<00:06:28.739> released<00:06:29.729> and<00:06:30.089> the

00:06:30.799 --> 00:06:30.809 
animated was officially released and the

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:36.409 
animated was officially released and the
fact<00:06:31.319> that<00:06:32.749> the<00:06:33.749> mold<00:06:34.019> has<00:06:34.379> been<00:06:34.669> done<00:06:35.669> and<00:06:35.999> be

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 
fact that the mold has been done and be

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:39.979 
fact that the mold has been done and be
done<00:06:36.629> a<00:06:36.659> couple<00:06:37.019> times<00:06:38.059> so<00:06:39.059> it's<00:06:39.419> pretty<00:06:39.779> much

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:39.989 
done a couple times so it's pretty much

00:06:39.989 --> 00:06:42.079

like<00:06:47.519> a<00:06:47.759> year<00:06:49.069> which<00:06:50.069> is<00:06:50.159> unfortunate<00:06:50.729> because

00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:50.759 
like a year which is unfortunate because

00:06:53.429 --> 00:06:55.159 
this video is really nice and it's much
better<00:06:53.699> than<00:06:53.879> the<00:06:53.999> original<00:06:54.029> release<00:06:54.599> and<00:06:54.899> i

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:55.169 
better than the original release and i

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:57.709 
better than the original release and i
personally<00:06:56.009> think<00:06:56.189> it's<00:06:56.399> spares<00:06:56.759> in<00:06:56.909> the<00:06:57.119> key

00:06:57.709 --> 00:06:57.719 
personally think it's spares in the key

00:06:57.719 --> 00:07:01.609 
personally think it's spares in the key

and<00:07:06.340> so<00:07:06.819> that's<00:07:07.569> it<00:07:07.930> for<00:07:08.490> start<00:07:09.490> screen<00:07:11.610> so

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:12.610 
and so that's it for start screen so

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.120 
and so that's it for start screen so

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:21.090 
as opposed to no sound so we'll see

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.850 
as opposed to no sound so we'll see
anyway<00:07:22.090> this<00:07:22.240> is<00:07:22.449> some<00:07:22.780> ways<00:07:22.960> you're<00:07:23.380> a<00:07:23.440> seven

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:23.860
