this<00:00:04.460> is<00:00:04.670> the<00:00:04.819> lifecycle<00:00:05.390> of<00:00:05.810> a<00:00:06.319> milk<00:00:06.590> thistle

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:07.149 
this is the lifecycle of a milk thistle

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:09.970 
this is the lifecycle of a milk thistle
the<00:00:08.149> very<00:00:08.420> beginning<00:00:08.660> is<00:00:09.170> down<00:00:09.500> here<00:00:09.800> where

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:09.980 
the very beginning is down here where

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.130 
the very beginning is down here where
you<00:00:10.010> have<00:00:10.130> the<00:00:10.550> first<00:00:10.850> leaves<00:00:11.510> that<00:00:11.810> you<00:00:11.990> will

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:12.140 
you have the first leaves that you will

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.689 
you have the first leaves that you will
see<00:00:12.440> and<00:00:13.480> they<00:00:14.480> look<00:00:14.990> pretty<00:00:15.200> common<00:00:15.769> you<00:00:16.519> can

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:16.699 
see and they look pretty common you can

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:18.940 
see and they look pretty common you can
see<00:00:16.910> in<00:00:17.060> there<00:00:17.240> just<00:00:17.660> the<00:00:18.140> little<00:00:18.439> beginning

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:18.950 
see in there just the little beginning

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.600 
see in there just the little beginning
of<00:00:19.070> the<00:00:19.640> two<00:00:19.850> first<00:00:20.240> two<00:00:20.539> true<00:00:20.840> leaves<00:00:21.110> and

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:21.610 
of the two first two true leaves and

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.250 
of the two first two true leaves and
then<00:00:22.610> here<00:00:23.360> you<00:00:24.130> see<00:00:25.130> that<00:00:25.310> even<00:00:25.670> better<00:00:26.260> here

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
then here you see that even better here

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.439 
then here you see that even better here
you<00:00:27.289> can<00:00:27.650> see<00:00:27.860> the<00:00:28.070> true<00:00:28.310> leaves<00:00:28.550> developing

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
you can see the true leaves developing

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.010 
you can see the true leaves developing
and<00:00:30.100> then<00:00:31.100> pretty<00:00:31.400> soon<00:00:31.660> you'll<00:00:32.660> get<00:00:32.840> to

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
and then pretty soon you'll get to

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.500 
and then pretty soon you'll get to
something<00:00:33.410> a<00:00:33.500> little<00:00:33.649> bigger<00:00:34.010> like<00:00:34.760> this<00:00:34.789> and

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
something a little bigger like this and

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.779 
something a little bigger like this and
by<00:00:36.199> the<00:00:36.260> time<00:00:36.559> it<00:00:36.739> gets<00:00:36.890> here<00:00:37.039> you<00:00:37.370> know<00:00:37.609> you've

00:00:37.779 --> 00:00:37.789 
by the time it gets here you know you've

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:39.759 
by the time it gets here you know you've
got<00:00:38.030> a<00:00:38.059> milk<00:00:38.390> thistle<00:00:38.629> you<00:00:38.929> can<00:00:39.109> see<00:00:39.289> by<00:00:39.499> all

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:39.769 
got a milk thistle you can see by all

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:42.549 
got a milk thistle you can see by all
those<00:00:40.120> milky<00:00:41.120> pretty<00:00:41.449> lines<00:00:41.809> in<00:00:42.170> the<00:00:42.289> veins

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
those milky pretty lines in the veins

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.049 
those milky pretty lines in the veins
and<00:00:42.920> this<00:00:43.069> is<00:00:43.280> a<00:00:43.309> milk<00:00:43.670> thistle<00:00:44.379> and<00:00:45.379> then<00:00:46.059> it's

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
and this is a milk thistle and then it's

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.629 
and this is a milk thistle and then it's
going<00:00:47.329> to<00:00:47.449> grow<00:00:47.659> a<00:00:48.159> little<00:00:49.159> bit<00:00:49.339> bigger<00:00:51.639> like

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:52.639 
going to grow a little bit bigger like

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:57.369 
going to grow a little bit bigger like
this<00:00:54.909> now<00:00:55.909> this<00:00:56.089> one<00:00:56.329> is<00:00:56.479> actually<00:00:56.659> do<00:00:57.079> place

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
this now this one is actually do place

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.229 
this now this one is actually do place
where<00:00:57.620> it's<00:00:57.769> flowering<00:00:58.249> I<00:00:58.459> basically<00:00:58.999> have

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
where it's flowering I basically have

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.049 
where it's flowering I basically have
four<00:00:59.449> seasons<00:00:59.749> of<00:01:00.079> milk<00:01:00.319> thistle<00:01:00.530> here<00:01:00.949> we<00:01:01.879> had

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
four seasons of milk thistle here we had

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.229 
four seasons of milk thistle here we had
a<00:01:02.089> rain<00:01:02.649> which<00:01:03.649> spread<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:04.250> leaves<00:01:04.489> that<00:01:04.879> came

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
a rain which spread the leaves that came

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.220 
a rain which spread the leaves that came
from<00:01:05.420> this<00:01:05.600> mature<00:01:06.049> one<00:01:06.350> and<00:01:07.540> after<00:01:08.540> these

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.230 
from this mature one and after these

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.210 
from this mature one and after these
spread<00:01:09.790> after<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:11.150> first<00:01:11.420> batch<00:01:11.720> that<00:01:12.220> you

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
spread after the first batch that you

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.940 
spread after the first batch that you
can<00:01:13.430> see<00:01:13.640> all<00:01:13.850> around<00:01:14.240> you<00:01:14.840> this<00:01:15.380> is<00:01:15.560> how<00:01:15.710> they

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
look after they get the flower after

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.310 
look after they get the flower after
they<00:01:19.370> go<00:01:19.580> to<00:01:19.610> seed<00:01:19.970> they<00:01:20.600> spread<00:01:20.930> all<00:01:20.990> those

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
they go to seed they spread all those

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.070 
they go to seed they spread all those
seeds<00:01:21.590> around<00:01:22.040> in<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:22.310> first<00:01:22.490> rain<00:01:23.080> you're

seeds around in the first rain you're
going<00:01:24.260> to<00:01:24.350> see<00:01:24.530> lots<00:01:24.740> of<00:01:24.950> little<00:01:25.010> milk

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
going to see lots of little milk

thistles and that's what you're seeing
all<00:01:27.520> around<00:01:28.520> here<00:01:29.530> we'll<00:01:30.530> also<00:01:30.740> find<00:01:31.160> some

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
all around here we'll also find some

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.820 
all around here we'll also find some
flowers<00:01:31.970> so<00:01:32.540> you<00:01:32.570> can<00:01:32.870> see<00:01:33.050> that<00:01:33.230> stage<00:01:33.620> of<00:01:33.800> the

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
flowers so you can see that stage of the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:40.540 
flowers so you can see that stage of the
game<00:01:36.850> this<00:01:37.850> one<00:01:38.200> this<00:01:39.200> was<00:01:39.440> a<00:01:39.470> flower<00:01:39.890> this<00:01:40.280> one

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
game this one this was a flower this one

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.190 
game this one this was a flower this one
flower<00:01:40.970> is<00:01:41.270> staying<00:01:41.510> pretty<00:01:41.720> low<00:01:41.990> to<00:01:42.050> the

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
flower is staying pretty low to the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.100 
flower is staying pretty low to the
ground<00:01:42.290> for<00:01:42.800> what<00:01:42.860> reason<00:01:43.370> I<00:01:43.490> don't<00:01:43.700> know<00:01:44.110> we

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
ground for what reason I don't know we

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.230 
ground for what reason I don't know we
had<00:01:45.290> whole<00:01:45.500> tall<00:01:45.800> forests<00:01:46.430> of<00:01:46.550> these<00:01:46.730> as<00:01:47.090> you

had whole tall forests of these as you

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.910 
had whole tall forests of these as you
can<00:01:47.270> see<00:01:47.630> they<00:01:47.780> usually<00:01:47.990> get<00:01:48.350> to<00:01:48.530> be<00:01:48.680> about

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
can see they usually get to be about

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.210 
can see they usually get to be about
this<00:01:49.520> high<00:01:49.820> you<00:01:51.400> can<00:01:52.400> see<00:01:52.659> this<00:01:53.659> one<00:01:54.220> getting

this high you can see this one getting

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.740 
this high you can see this one getting
ready<00:01:55.550> to<00:01:56.090> turn<00:01:56.300> into<00:01:56.540> this<00:01:58.180> same<00:01:59.180> here<00:01:59.600> you

they're going to plant another milk
thistle<00:02:09.379> forest

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:10.359 
thistle forest

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:14.170 
thistle forest
just<00:02:11.359> like<00:02:11.829> you<00:02:12.829> are<00:02:12.980> seeing<00:02:13.249> the<00:02:13.400> remains<00:02:13.819> up

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
just like you are seeing the remains up

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.250 
just like you are seeing the remains up
here

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
here

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.070 
here
pretty<00:02:17.260> soon<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.710> leaves<00:02:17.920> will<00:02:18.130> die<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:19.080> what

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
pretty soon the leaves will die and what

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.400 
pretty soon the leaves will die and what
you<00:02:20.260> see<00:02:20.620> that<00:02:21.430> remained<00:02:21.910> is<00:02:22.780> going<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.200> look

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
you see that remained is going to look
