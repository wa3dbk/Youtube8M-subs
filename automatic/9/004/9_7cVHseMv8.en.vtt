00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
still working on it myself but I think

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.649

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
that the more you work it out the more

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.170 
that the more you work it out the more
you<00:01:39.689> have<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.170> go<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.549> more<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.820> push

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.800 
you have a go and the more you push
yourself<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.869> more<00:01:42.990> confident<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.590> become

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
yourself the more confident you become

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.300 
yourself the more confident you become
particularly<00:01:45.810> when<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.439> comes<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.979> meeting
