00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.620 

I<00:02:38.890> don't<00:02:39.370> think<00:02:39.430> that<00:02:39.640> works<00:02:39.850> very<00:02:40.060> well<00:02:40.180> but

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
I don't think that works very well but

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.470 
I don't think that works very well but
whatever<00:02:40.900> it's<00:02:41.200> funny<00:02:41.470> anyway<00:02:41.860> because<00:02:42.580> you

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
I still don't know how it makes sense

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
way okay if you can make it work somehow

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.010 
way okay if you can make it work somehow

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
we can get them stuck to the windshield

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.730 
we can get them stuck to the windshield
you<00:03:45.300> know<00:03:45.420> of<00:03:45.870> their<00:03:46.050> fighter<00:03:46.260> parts<00:03:46.620> are

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
you know of their fighter parts are

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.350 
you know of their fighter parts are
gonna<00:03:46.860> fall<00:03:47.160> anyway<00:03:47.580> because<00:03:47.730> their<00:03:47.940> chemical

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
gonna fall anyway because their chemical

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.360 
gonna fall anyway because their chemical
and<00:03:48.510> why<00:03:48.630> do<00:03:48.690> we<00:03:48.870> have<00:03:48.990> fire<00:03:49.260> in<00:03:49.470> our<00:03:49.560> why<00:03:50.190> do<00:03:50.250> we

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
and why do we have fire in our why do we

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.870 
and why do we have fire in our why do we
have<00:03:50.459> firing<00:03:50.790> are<00:03:50.910> playing<00:03:51.830> crap<00:03:52.830> okay<00:03:53.520> well

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
have firing are playing crap okay well

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.490 
have firing are playing crap okay well
that's<00:03:53.970> not<00:03:54.150> good<00:03:54.360> for<00:03:54.390> us<00:03:54.600> but<00:03:55.020> then<00:03:55.380> again

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
that's not good for us but then again

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.280 
that's not good for us but then again
nothing<00:03:56.070> is<00:03:56.430> basically<00:03:59.570> yeah<00:04:00.570> we're<00:04:00.780> bit<00:04:00.930> odd

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
nothing is basically yeah we're bit odd

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.350 
nothing is basically yeah we're bit odd
basically<00:04:02.220> have<00:04:02.400> guesstimated<00:04:03.000> by<00:04:03.120> now<00:04:03.300> that

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
basically have guesstimated by now that

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.820 
basically have guesstimated by now that
we're<00:04:03.630> screwed<00:04:03.959> but<00:04:04.110> apparently<00:04:04.500> somehow<00:04:04.770> we

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
we're screwed but apparently somehow we

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:13.580 
we're screwed but apparently somehow we
live<00:04:07.430> there<00:04:08.430> aren't<00:04:08.700> too<00:04:08.790> many<00:04:08.819> zeros<00:04:12.590> you'd

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
live there aren't too many zeros you'd

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.740 
live there aren't too many zeros you'd
have<00:04:13.709> too<00:04:13.890> many<00:04:14.010> zeros<00:04:14.459> if<00:04:14.610> you<00:04:14.730> had<00:04:14.970> like<00:04:15.180> ten

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
have too many zeros if you had like ten

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.000 
have too many zeros if you had like ten
tube<00:04:15.930> infinity<00:04:16.440> power<00:04:16.590> but<00:04:16.980> they're<00:04:17.130> for

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
tube infinity power but they're for

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.440 
tube infinity power but they're for
you'd<00:04:18.880> be<00:04:19.000> doing

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
you'd be doing

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:25.830 
you'd be doing
really<00:04:20.050> queer<00:04:20.290> there<00:04:24.000> okay<00:04:25.000> okay<00:04:25.330> yeah<00:04:25.600> we

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840
