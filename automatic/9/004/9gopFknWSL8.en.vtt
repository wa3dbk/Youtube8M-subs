00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.630
 hello to all and iso we are found 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.119
 today for a very video 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.119
 particular since I was lucky 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.470
 to test call of duty ghost at the 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.310
 paris games week and to register you 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.660
 gameplay 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.519
 so today we will focus 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.189
 about the sniper since I know that 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.200
 interests a lot of people then 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.230
 in this gameplay so I was playing at 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.559
 wings 115 without accessories in secondary 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.140
 I had the peace pistol 226 equipped with a 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.360
 silent deadly gear I had a 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.550
 kind of flash but that explode in 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.320
 tactical garnet a paralyzing then 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.090
 for the trumps you know how it gets 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.710
 pass you have the right to eight points 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.739
 of assets then makes you a little bit 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.750
 your market so I had pass-pass 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.850
 recharge running ninja and looters 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.670
 and finally for the strict javel poles 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.010
 assad as the support dog and the 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.979
 so behemoth during these parts 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.299
 bass I tried to vary a little 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.010
 little pleasure so as to you 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.619
 show a little bit the whole panel 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.240
 of actions that is possible to sniper and 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.280
 show you the qualities like 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.590
 flaws then there will be a part in 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.210
 the blitz mode and another in domination 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.759
 that I put end-to-end so 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.729
 really have a little bit of all type 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.320
 of action then what I wanted to say 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.590
 also it was that I played in the amap 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.200
 white out so bah there you already see that 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.640
 graphically it's pretty beautiful eh he 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.329
 must still admit I was I was 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.799
 delighted to see really relatively surprised 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.270
 so quality but what it takes 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.810
 know that it was on pc and 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.030
 mules xbox one so on ps3 and xbox 360 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.530
 I do not think the rendering will be the same 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.930
 so here you see I'm doing a hit 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.310
 marker so there right now I you 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.320
 see a little bit will tell you now 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.229
 that's the markers and are back 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.799
 and it's really reassuring you this is 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.320
 not the case I did extremely little 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.149
 maybe two or three during my two 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.069
 hours of game and I played a lot of 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.340
 snipers so do not worry there 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.110
 above 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.970
 so here I made a little stop on 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.080
 picture on which range for you 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.300
 show a little bit 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.430
 new design so you see down to 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.910
 left we see the assets that the player 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.560
 use his weapon at the top left you 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.170
 so see his agent card with his 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.080
 grade and you see that den is pretty 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.460
 sober so pretty nice 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.100
 so now let's talk about the quick 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.090
 scope so there you see that for me 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.400
 I was on the enemy 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.710
 and yet nothing happened then 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.410
 simply because the quick scope 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.120
 and still not so free 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.990
 want to say that in black ops 2 it's 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.810
 to say that there must still be 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.950
 wait until the telescope is finished being 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.200
 setting to trigger his shot and 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.090
 especially with the l 115 because it 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.650
 put a little more time so bah 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.300
 the cucs as is quite feasible 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.950
 you will see other actions where I 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.170
 make quick scope so you go 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.150
 see that it's quite feasible by 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.950
 against actually it is less easy 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.300
 than in black ops 2 so I would put it 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:12.209
 a little bit between them black ops 1 and 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:15.360
 mw3 so for its use for the 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.800
 way to realize them then then this 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.989
 that I wanted to tell you is that you 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.769
 have the opportunity to mount your 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.570
 sensitivity up to 20 so bah there for 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.980
 the shatter tricks I think they're going 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.940
 to be able to have fun on the 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.400
 rotations etc 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.040
 except that you can not 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.739
 do double y or double triangle 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.810
 you know to cancel your 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.940
 reloading so there you have to start 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.190
 run as well of course you do not have 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.040
 not the asset recharge in current otherwise 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.900
 it does not work necessarily but here you are 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.910
 can no longer do double y for 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.110
 cancel their load so it's true 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.300
 that for the tricks shot it's going to be a 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.800
 little bit complicated but hey I know 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.810
 that in general we always adapt or 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.850
 if not maybe a patch that will arrive 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.160
 later so also what to note 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.750
 is that there is no reticule when 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.640
 we play sniper is when how 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.750
 hardcore in fact I had the four 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.820
 small dots that allow you to 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.440
 see the center of your screen they are 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.010
 more present so again 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.890
 much more difficult to 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.780
 score for here there is no one 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.060
 not see the center of your screen and in 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.609
 plus there is more help to the aim 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.160
 whether snipers and also to 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.500
 weapons so there really the shoot of 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.090
 player is going to be strained and he 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.680
 will have to really work on it 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.389
 accuracy and maybe lower a little 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.760
 little sensitivity 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:34.010
 so now we're going to get very 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.590
 quickly at the end of this video because 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.630
 that I had the right only to five 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:41.060
 minutes of gameplay but I have you 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.340
 reserved a nice little surprise that 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.960
 I was able to actually during the games 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.580
 and I must say that I was pretty 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.190
 surprised just because there is no reiki 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.139
 kull balaidos coop art a little bit 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.000
 anywhere and you'll see that ben 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.250
 I still had a lot of luck 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.539
 so I leave you on it and I will 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.660
 say to the next one hi all the 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:58.660
 world
