00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
that quality but is definitely a spicy a

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.780 
that quality but is definitely a spicy a
bit<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.930> loud<00:01:37.259> type<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.770> rice<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.610> do

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
bit of a loud type of rice so you do

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.280 
bit of a loud type of rice so you do
have<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.000> wash<00:01:39.270> your<00:01:39.299> applications<00:01:40.079> on<00:01:40.200> this

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
have to wash your applications on this

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.010 
have to wash your applications on this
one<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.159> great<00:01:41.490> for<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.329> cooler<00:01:42.570> season

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
one this is great for the cooler season

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.249 
one this is great for the cooler season
so<00:01:43.200> fall<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:44.040> winter<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.810> but<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.840> do<00:01:45.930> think

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
so fall in winter and but I do think

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.800 
so fall in winter and but I do think
that<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.560> can<00:01:46.770> be<00:01:46.979> used<00:01:47.189> for<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:48.180> early<00:01:48.509> spring

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
that it can be used for the early spring

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.679 
that it can be used for the early spring
days<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:49.530> like<00:01:49.680> early<00:01:50.490> let's<00:01:50.790> say<00:01:50.880> early<00:01:51.210> April

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
days so like early let's say early April

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.730 
days so like early let's say early April
and<00:01:51.899> maybe<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:53.610> occasional<00:01:54.229> cold<00:01:55.229> or<00:01:55.470> summer

they got the green but that's not even

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.110 
they got the green but that's not even
worth<00:02:33.270> looking<00:02:33.660> into<00:02:33.780> but<00:02:34.760> they<00:02:35.760> also<00:02:35.880> have

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.110 
worth looking into but they also have
the<00:02:36.270> polo<00:02:36.480> black<00:02:36.780> so<00:02:37.080> this<00:02:37.590> this<00:02:38.400> in<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.910> black

fragrances<00:02:41.340> that<00:02:41.460> I've<00:02:41.700> come<00:02:41.940> across<00:02:42.740> so<00:02:43.740> when

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
fragrances that I've come across so when

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.270 
fragrances that I've come across so when
it<00:02:44.700> comes<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:45.120> longevity<00:02:45.770> it's<00:02:46.770> a<00:02:46.890> little<00:02:47.130> bit

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
it comes to longevity it's a little bit

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.070 
it comes to longevity it's a little bit
spotty<00:02:47.700> I<00:02:47.940> would<00:02:48.090> get<00:02:48.240> anywhere<00:02:48.600> from<00:02:48.660> three

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
spotty I would get anywhere from three

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.930 
spotty I would get anywhere from three
and<00:02:49.200> a<00:02:49.230> half<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.770> five<00:02:50.070> hours<00:02:50.460> at<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.760> very

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
and a half to five hours at the very

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.910 
and a half to five hours at the very
most<00:02:51.180> so<00:02:51.780> that's<00:02:51.900> pretty<00:02:52.110> disappointing<00:02:52.800> on

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
most so that's pretty disappointing on

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.650 
most so that's pretty disappointing on
such<00:02:53.130> a<00:02:53.280> wonderful<00:02:53.790> fragrance<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.300> smells

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
such a wonderful fragrance that smells

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.200 
such a wonderful fragrance that smells
just<00:02:55.110> so<00:02:55.650> good<00:02:56.570> I<00:02:57.570> think<00:02:58.080> that<00:02:58.880> because<00:02:59.880> I<00:02:59.910> went

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
just so good I think that because I went

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.600 
just so good I think that because I went
a<00:03:00.360> little<00:03:00.450> bit<00:03:00.720> more<00:03:01.110> liberal<00:03:01.410> I<00:03:01.800> got<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.430> little

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
a little bit more liberal I got a little

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.520 
a little bit more liberal I got a little
bit<00:03:02.790> more<00:03:02.820> of<00:03:03.270> a<00:03:03.360> longevity<00:03:03.930> so<00:03:04.080> when<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.350> was

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
bit more of a longevity so when it was

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.890 
bit more of a longevity so when it was
close<00:03:04.770> closer<00:03:05.520> to<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.820> five<00:03:06.150> hour<00:03:06.420> mark<00:03:06.750> I

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
close closer to the five hour mark I

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.750 
close closer to the five hour mark I
think<00:03:06.990> it<00:03:07.200> was<00:03:07.290> born<00:03:07.500> four<00:03:08.130> or<00:03:08.250> five<00:03:08.400> sprays

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
think it was born four or five sprays

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.520 
think it was born four or five sprays
normally<00:03:09.600> with<00:03:09.720> a<00:03:09.750> fragrance<00:03:09.960> like<00:03:10.230> this<00:03:10.380> I

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
normally with a fragrance like this I

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.070 
normally with a fragrance like this I
would<00:03:10.680> only<00:03:10.800> do<00:03:11.010> three<00:03:11.460> sprays<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.210> the

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
would only do three sprays and the

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.050 
would only do three sprays and the
projection<00:03:13.650> was<00:03:13.830> only<00:03:14.130> 90<00:03:14.550> minutes<00:03:14.640> at<00:03:14.940> the

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
projection was only 90 minutes at the

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.950 
projection was only 90 minutes at the
most<00:03:15.090> so<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:16.380> quality<00:03:16.740> is<00:03:17.540> when<00:03:18.540> it<00:03:18.630> comes<00:03:18.750> to

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960 
most so the quality is when it comes to

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.330 
most so the quality is when it comes to
the<00:03:19.050> smell<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.710> quality<00:03:20.160> is<00:03:20.220> definitely

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
the smell the quality is definitely

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.560 
the smell the quality is definitely
there<00:03:20.700> but<00:03:20.730> when<00:03:20.940> it<00:03:21.030> comes<00:03:21.180> to<00:03:21.270> the<00:03:21.360> quality

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
there but when it comes to the quality

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.450 
there but when it comes to the quality
in<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.870> longevity<00:03:22.080> and<00:03:22.620> just<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.160> overall

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
in the longevity and just the overall

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.820 
in the longevity and just the overall
performance<00:03:24.020> unfortunately<00:03:25.020> it's<00:03:25.140> not<00:03:25.470> um

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
performance unfortunately it's not um

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.370 
performance unfortunately it's not um
it's<00:03:26.790> a<00:03:26.910> great<00:03:27.210> step<00:03:27.600> in<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:28.200> right<00:03:28.350> direction

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
it's a great step in the right direction

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.030 
it's a great step in the right direction
for<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.100> house<00:03:29.250> alert<00:03:29.580> of<00:03:29.820> a<00:03:30.210> brothel<00:03:30.930> run<00:03:31.200> but

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
for the house alert of a brothel run but

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.320 
for the house alert of a brothel run but
I<00:03:32.070> just<00:03:32.340> wish<00:03:32.460> they'd<00:03:32.610> put<00:03:32.640> a<00:03:32.790> little<00:03:33.030> bit<00:03:33.180> more

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
I just wish they'd put a little bit more

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.560 
I just wish they'd put a little bit more
time<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:33.660> effort<00:03:33.930> into<00:03:34.320> it<00:03:34.710> so<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:36.060> price<00:03:36.330> is

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
time and effort into it so the price is

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:37.940 
time and effort into it so the price is
now<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:36.780> prices<00:03:37.230> could<00:03:37.380> be<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.500> little<00:03:37.740> bit

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
now the prices could be a little bit

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.830 
now the prices could be a little bit
expensive<00:03:38.340> like<00:03:39.000> this<00:03:39.150> just<00:03:39.330> came<00:03:39.510> out<00:03:39.660> last

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
expensive like this just came out last

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.120 
expensive like this just came out last
year<00:03:40.050> so<00:03:40.260> you're<00:03:40.380> really<00:03:40.530> not<00:03:40.650> going<00:03:40.860> to<00:03:40.920> find

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
year so you're really not going to find
