00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
stuff there's some floaties bits I guess

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.330 
stuff there's some floaties bits I guess
to<00:00:33.149> build<00:00:33.360> your<00:00:33.480> house<00:00:33.660> on<00:00:33.870> I'm<00:00:34.829> not<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.070> big<00:00:35.309> fan

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
of floaty bits let's see there is water

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.060 
of floaty bits let's see there is water
somewhere<00:00:43.200> here<00:00:44.059> so<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.620> promise<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.860> and

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:49.700 
just caught that okay okay and now the
next<00:01:39.840> one<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.170> testificandum<00:01:48.470> and<00:01:49.470> there's

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
next one is testificandum and there's

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.370 
next one is testificandum and there's
gravel<00:01:50.310> just<00:01:50.640> from<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.909> start<00:01:51.540> which<00:01:52.229> is

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
gravel just from the start which is

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.230 
gravel just from the start which is
actually<00:01:52.560> extremely<00:01:53.100> rare<00:01:55.189> because

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
actually extremely rare because

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.719 
actually extremely rare because
basically<00:01:57.240> nothing<00:01:57.869> has<00:01:58.020> gravel<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:58.920> that's

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
basically nothing has gravel so that's

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.139 
basically nothing has gravel so that's
pretty<00:02:00.090> awesome<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:01.640> found<00:02:02.640> this<00:02:02.820> out<00:02:03.000> myself

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
pretty awesome I found this out myself

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.350 
pretty awesome I found this out myself
no<00:02:03.840> one<00:02:03.990> else<00:02:04.140> found<00:02:04.320> this<00:02:04.469> before<00:02:04.829> me<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.360> it's

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
no one else found this before me so it's

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.779 
no one else found this before me so it's
the<00:02:06.750> seed<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.200> found<00:02:07.770> which<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.459> pretty

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
the seed that I found which is pretty

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.490 
the seed that I found which is pretty
cool<00:02:09.979> I<00:02:11.150> found

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
cool I found

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.340 
cool I found
us<00:02:13.370> probably<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.390> majority<00:02:14.540> of<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:14.990> ones

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
us probably the majority of the ones

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.950 
us probably the majority of the ones
you've<00:02:15.470> seen<00:02:15.650> so<00:02:15.860> far<00:02:16.040> too<00:02:16.250> but<00:02:16.960> gravels

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
you've seen so far too but gravels

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.790 
you've seen so far too but gravels
actually<00:02:18.320> well<00:02:19.870> just<00:02:20.870> as<00:02:20.990> rare<00:02:21.200> as<00:02:21.230> finding

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
actually well just as rare as finding

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.920 
actually well just as rare as finding
lava<00:02:22.360> because<00:02:23.360> it's<00:02:23.570> really<00:02:24.110> hard<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.440> find<00:02:24.680> so

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
lava because it's really hard to find so

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.410 
lava because it's really hard to find so
it's<00:02:26.930> not<00:02:27.020> the<00:02:27.110> best<00:02:27.440> but<00:02:27.740> I<00:02:28.160> found<00:02:28.940> this<00:02:29.120> which

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
it's not the best but I found this which

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.170 
it's not the best but I found this which
is<00:02:29.570> pretty<00:02:29.750> cool<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:32.390> I<00:02:33.340> like<00:02:34.340> it<00:02:34.550> there's

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
is pretty cool so I like it there's

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.360 
is pretty cool so I like it there's
pretty<00:02:35.750> big<00:02:35.990> mountains<00:02:36.440> you<00:02:36.980> don't<00:02:37.130> really

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
pretty big mountains you don't really

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.720 
pretty big mountains you don't really
find<00:02:37.670> big<00:02:38.000> mountains<00:02:38.360> like<00:02:38.480> this<00:02:38.740> so<00:02:39.740> that's

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
find big mountains like this so that's

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.820 
find big mountains like this so that's
basically<00:02:40.940> it<00:02:41.240> guys<00:02:41.480> remember<00:02:42.440> to<00:02:42.560> comment
