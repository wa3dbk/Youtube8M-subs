into wearing this makeup tutorial lately

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.930 
into wearing this makeup tutorial lately
I<00:00:46.289> think<00:00:46.710> since<00:00:46.920> it's<00:00:47.070> gonna<00:00:47.340> be<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.670> spring

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
I think since it's gonna be the spring

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.459 
I think since it's gonna be the spring
soon<00:00:48.210> it's<00:00:48.510> almost<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.050> spring<00:00:49.289> actually

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
soon it's almost the spring actually

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.260 
soon it's almost the spring actually
think<00:00:50.010> wearing<00:00:50.280> minimal<00:00:50.760> makeup<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
think wearing minimal makeup in the

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.610 
think wearing minimal makeup in the
spring<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.629> really<00:00:51.930> gorgeous<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.590> think

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
spring is really gorgeous I think

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.229 
spring is really gorgeous I think
because<00:00:53.070> your<00:00:53.250> skin<00:00:53.489> starts<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.910> get<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.090> little

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
because your skin starts to get a little

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.180 
because your skin starts to get a little
more<00:00:54.510> tan<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.379> just<00:00:55.559> show<00:00:55.739> off<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.890> more

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
more tan and you just show off a more

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.160 
more tan and you just show off a more
natural<00:00:56.610> glow<00:00:56.879> in<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.300> spring<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.780> don't<00:00:58.109> know
