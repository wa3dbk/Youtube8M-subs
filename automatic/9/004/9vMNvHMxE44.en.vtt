 Germany is looking for germany's next 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.260
 topmodel had so much trash potential 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.500
 I wanted to leave my new talent 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.120

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.910

 lamberg a nice couple you have to say 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:09.700
 but that did not help her anymore 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:13.030
 not all done and also Linda 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.040
 the bff of kay one got the drain 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.960
 she was shown again and again as well 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.550
 like this micaela shepherd look alike 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.930
 Models became a bit like that 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.270
 Characters built up a bit 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.310
 within the a joy about it then on 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.140
 end of the series do not allow further 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.509
 it was also a video of cape 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.729
 displayed and countries together but that 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.469
 everything did not help , so the two of them 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.390
 ladies invite potential real resch 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:38.350
 were not left as well 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.270
 little like party this transgender model 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.100
 My husband was now a woman 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.950
 and real looked very good 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.899
 i remember wolfgang joop says in 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.360
 the first episode looks like one 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.979
 American top model and I can 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.869
 only agree so I would have 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.939
 could already imagine in the 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.859
 nineties look like that media 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:58.859
 cindy crawford and before naomi campell 

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:02.350
 but to run over the catwalk 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:05.079
 somehow she seemed as well as yes 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.050
 Male model stand for the rest 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:09.789
 I found the jury too ladylike a bit 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.440
 too bad I had a bit too 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.480
 Potential seen in me so I would have 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.830
 you would have two of them quietly 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.530
 and you can just grind 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.940
 Another roll reinbringen you just 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.620
 times another look might also give 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.160
 when we share the next episode 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:27.590
 she just comes 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:30.200
 less ladylike but here 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.800
 There was also a lot of potential trash 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.840
 thus renounces the gina lisas and sarah 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.880
 became scarce of the past 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.680
 not built this time and not further 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:45.020
 left and then it was also sad 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.270
 first candidate dennis from berlin 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.510
 through he comes in the first episode 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.700
 already as a poorly disguised woman about 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.370
 the catwalk ran and now has this time 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.800
 made without the cheap long hair wig 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.150
 and then in the then one more 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.120
 put on it is then still in bikini 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.340
 lattice happens again the face 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.890
 for a nice model male model 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.720
 wheelchair women was over the head 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.160
 so to come that little further 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.690
 serenity that's why I was grateful because 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.220
 sixth we would have bikini 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.570
 I suppose it was the long one 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.190
 the castings have been finished then 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.920
 and finally stayed by the 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.440
 Thousands of heidis girls then 50 over 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.750
 and then hips directly for one 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.020
 turkish designer i believe in cologne 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.180
 and they 're running over a fawn, though 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.100
 kies insisted I have such a 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.900
 bit asked what should that why one 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.790
 present very nice fashion 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.100
 when you go there we chicken when the chicken is over 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.230
 the gravel goes well it was one 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.360
 challenge him well for the first round 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.650
 Now as for the 50 models it was 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.670
 maybe it's a bit hard 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.500
 only beautiful furniture pictures given and 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.670
 Well you could have had one before 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.200
 Maybe a bit soon 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.180
 sort out because ultimately 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.890
 could not 50 girls with after 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.360
 California 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.190
 that would have been far too expensive for 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.730
 Prosieben I have extreme star march 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:08.220
 you want to be around 23 around 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.010
 Before this fashion show, Sarah then did 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.659
 the first drama close up the 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.400
 enrollment now too small 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:17.340
 the other was not so great the 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.579
 each other too shallow for already separate 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.320
 the cells dig when the militia get it 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.240
 It is not about her at last 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.800
 it is about fashion 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.430
 present whether you like it or not 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.070
 Not 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.720
 Laura is expected to open the fashion show 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.530
 And of course, not everybody has it 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.260
 like 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.960
 there were already scratched the nails 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.060
 big song just before the 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:43.020
 Announcement who of the 50 ladies because 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:46.020
 sat down with eltville or stood up 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.280
 the jury together and then aired pari 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.900
 still fast her secret that she 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.690
 once a man was and he was very nice 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.340

 beautiful a nice maudlin moment 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.440
 but in the end, as I said 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:03.380
 then the monetary of the jury then 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.449
 just together 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:09.030

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:10.889
 The rule time can be there then 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.470

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.880

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.789
 I 'll do it again 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.930

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:20.930
 subscribed and commented 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:31.469

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.539

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:35.729
