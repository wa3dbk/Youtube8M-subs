for<00:02:06.270> developers<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.140> can<00:02:07.290> get

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
for developers so that you can get

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:32.189 
very soon now obviously a lot of ideas

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:33.710 
very soon now obviously a lot of ideas
were<00:02:32.760> throwing<00:02:33.030> around<00:02:33.150> as<00:02:33.359> are<00:02:33.480> saying

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
were throwing around as are saying

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.720 
were throwing around as are saying
earlier<00:02:33.989> some<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:34.590> them<00:02:34.709> outright<00:02:35.189> diculous

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
some of them not so bad but they all

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.800 
some of them not so bad but they all
laid<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.069> groundwork<00:02:38.400> for<00:02:38.549> xbox<00:02:39.239> live<00:02:39.510> in<00:02:39.750> a

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
laid the groundwork for xbox live in a

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.710 
laid the groundwork for xbox live in a
cool<00:02:39.959> sec<00:02:40.170> for<00:02:40.349> 360<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.010> now<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.939> xbox<00:02:42.329> one<00:02:42.540> as

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
cool sec for 360 and now the xbox one as

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.300 
cool sec for 360 and now the xbox one as
some<00:02:42.900> of<00:02:42.989> those<00:02:43.079> really<00:02:43.620> early<00:02:43.890> ideas<00:02:44.159> of

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
some of those really early ideas of

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.530 
some of those really early ideas of
having<00:02:44.549> windows<00:02:44.730> of<00:02:45.000> course<00:02:45.239> as<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.510> said

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
having windows of course as I said

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.920 
having windows of course as I said
previously<00:02:45.709> have<00:02:46.709> now<00:02:46.950> come<00:02:47.190> into<00:02:47.370> play<00:02:47.930> so

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
previously have now come into play so

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.089 
previously have now come into play so
it's<00:02:49.049> really<00:02:49.290> interesting<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.739> see<00:02:49.950> how

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
it's really interesting to see how

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.250 
it's really interesting to see how
previous<00:02:50.549> ideas<00:02:50.730> have<00:02:51.480> now<00:02:51.750> actually<00:02:52.109> come

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
previous ideas have now actually come

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.470 
previous ideas have now actually come
into<00:02:52.470> play<00:02:52.680> although<00:02:52.889> in<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.400> highly<00:02:53.909> evolved

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
into play although in a highly evolved

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.059 
into play although in a highly evolved
form<00:02:54.840> of<00:02:55.049> course<00:02:55.260> are<00:02:55.379> not<00:02:55.470> get<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.680> bit<00:02:55.889> have

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
form of course are not get a bit have

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.710 
form of course are not get a bit have
survived<00:02:56.459> all<00:02:56.730> those<00:02:56.909> years<00:02:57.239> completely

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
survived all those years completely

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.170 
survived all those years completely
untouched<00:02:58.500> they<00:02:58.739> will<00:02:58.889> have<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.189> evolve<00:02:59.909> with

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
untouched they will have to evolve with

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.729 
untouched they will have to evolve with
the<00:03:00.209> times<00:03:00.299> and<00:03:00.720> of<00:03:00.840> course<00:03:01.049> to<00:03:01.170> platform<00:03:01.620> in

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
the times and of course to platform in

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.819 
the times and of course to platform in
question<00:03:02.420> so<00:03:03.420> yeah<00:03:04.170> some<00:03:04.470> rather<00:03:04.680> interesting

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
question so yeah some rather interesting

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.589 
question so yeah some rather interesting
stuff<00:03:05.639> and<00:03:05.879> it<00:03:05.970> also<00:03:06.150> would<00:03:06.389> have<00:03:06.420> been

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
stuff and it also would have been

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.030 
stuff and it also would have been
completely<00:03:06.780> free<00:03:07.409> it<00:03:07.530> probably<00:03:07.829> would<00:03:07.950> have

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
completely free it probably would have

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.190 
completely free it probably would have
been<00:03:08.189> like<00:03:08.370> a<00:03:08.430> subscription-based<00:03:09.209> thing<00:03:09.810> or

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
been like a subscription-based thing or

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.929 
been like a subscription-based thing or
something<00:03:10.590> like<00:03:10.739> that<00:03:10.799> it<00:03:11.310> wouldn't<00:03:11.849> have

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:11.939 
something like that it wouldn't have

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:14.179 
something like that it wouldn't have
been<00:03:12.120> what<00:03:12.720> it<00:03:12.840> was<00:03:13.049> if<00:03:13.560> they<00:03:13.829> had<00:03:14.010> gone

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
been what it was if they had gone

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:15.500 
been what it was if they had gone
through<00:03:14.430> this<00:03:14.549> which<00:03:14.760> is<00:03:14.849> of<00:03:14.970> course<00:03:15.030> pay<00:03:15.329> your

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
through this which is of course pay your

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.490 
through this which is of course pay your
three<00:03:15.689> hundred<00:03:15.900> dollars<00:03:16.139> or<00:03:16.260> whatever

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
three hundred dollars or whatever

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.619 
three hundred dollars or whatever
upfront<00:03:16.829> and<00:03:17.129> that's<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.459> lot<00:03:17.639> it<00:03:18.449> would<00:03:18.540> have

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
upfront and that's a lot it would have

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:19.640 
upfront and that's a lot it would have
been<00:03:18.690> something<00:03:18.959> else<00:03:19.199> it<00:03:19.379> would<00:03:19.470> have<00:03:19.560> found

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
been something else it would have found

another<00:03:19.799> method<00:03:20.459> of<00:03:20.519> monetization<00:03:21.090> I<00:03:21.569> don't

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
another method of monetization I don't

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.659 
another method of monetization I don't
know<00:03:22.109> a<00:03:22.139> subscription<00:03:22.799> could<00:03:23.099> really<00:03:23.340> work

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:23.669 
know a subscription could really work

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:26.659 
know a subscription could really work
for<00:03:23.730> a<00:03:24.180> console<00:03:24.720> I<00:03:24.989> don't<00:03:25.470> really<00:03:25.590> know<00:03:25.859> but

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669 
for a console I don't really know but

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.309 
for a console I don't really know but
obviously<00:03:27.540> that's<00:03:27.720> not<00:03:27.780> something<00:03:28.199> we've

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
obviously that's not something we've

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.039 
obviously that's not something we've
ever<00:03:28.500> seen<00:03:28.799> really<00:03:29.310> no<00:03:30.239> company<00:03:30.870> has<00:03:31.019> ever

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.569 
ever seen really no company has ever
done<00:03:31.409> that<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:31.769> I<00:03:31.799> dug<00:03:31.949> that<00:03:32.069> the<00:03:32.220> other<00:03:32.340> will

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
done that and I dug that the other will

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:33.800 
done that and I dug that the other will
to<00:03:32.819> be<00:03:32.909> completely<00:03:33.299> honest<00:03:33.510> with<00:03:33.569> you<00:03:33.690> as
