00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
rocket launcher I don't really want to

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.210 
rocket launcher I don't really want to
show<00:00:21.510> how<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.779> make<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:22.020> paper<00:00:22.140> rocket<00:00:22.920> launcher

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
show how to make a paper rocket launcher

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.740 
show how to make a paper rocket launcher
but<00:00:23.369> i<00:00:23.430> will<00:00:23.699> show<00:00:23.939> how<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.150> make<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.720> paper

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
but i will show how to make a paper

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.750 
but i will show how to make a paper
rocket<00:00:25.710> what<00:00:26.490> you'll<00:00:26.699> need<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:27.119> scissors<00:00:27.779> tape

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
rocket what you'll need a scissors tape

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.880 
rocket what you'll need a scissors tape
or<00:00:29.760> glue<00:00:29.820> if<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:30.840> want<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.140> take<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.560> longer

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
or glue if you want to take in a longer

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.840 
or glue if you want to take in a longer
time<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:33.260> some<00:00:34.260> paper<00:00:34.530> scrap<00:00:35.309> paper<00:00:35.610> or

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
time and some paper scrap paper or

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.200 
time and some paper scrap paper or
anything<00:00:36.450> if<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.739> got<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.309> holes<00:00:38.610> inside

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
anything if you got the holes inside

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.190 
anything if you got the holes inside
your<00:00:39.450> paper<00:00:39.770> what<00:00:40.770> you'll<00:00:41.070> want<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.430> do<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:44.090> cut

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
your paper what you'll want to do is cut

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:52.200 
your paper what you'll want to do is cut
right<00:00:46.200> in<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.649> middle<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:47.450> these<00:00:48.450> two<00:00:49.160> holes

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:01:03.810 

but<00:00:52.719> up<00:00:52.930> near<00:00:53.469> the<00:00:53.790> this<00:00:54.790> whole<00:00:55.120> even<00:00:55.570> more

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.920 

then<00:01:04.960> take<00:01:05.960> it<00:01:06.170> this<00:01:06.380> way

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.600 

and<00:01:10.870> if<00:01:11.870> you<00:01:12.320> ever<00:01:12.350> made<00:01:12.770> a<00:01:12.800> paper<00:01:13.100> bullet

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
and if you ever made a paper bullet

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.440 
and if you ever made a paper bullet
before<00:01:13.790> it's<00:01:14.420> the<00:01:14.570> same<00:01:14.870> difference<00:01:16.450> just

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
before it's the same difference just

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.070 
before it's the same difference just
going<00:01:17.960> to<00:01:18.020> be<00:01:18.110> bigger

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.020 

it<00:01:22.380> might<00:01:22.830> be<00:01:22.980> a<00:01:23.010> little<00:01:23.280> bit<00:01:23.490> harder<00:01:23.880> because

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
it might be a little bit harder because

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.090 
it might be a little bit harder because
it's<00:01:24.300> flogger<00:01:25.170> stuff

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.340 

and<00:01:29.640> if<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.939> don't<00:01:30.180> got<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> paper<00:01:30.780> rocket

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
and if you don't got a paper rocket

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.060 
and if you don't got a paper rocket
launcher<00:01:32.090> you<00:01:33.090> should<00:01:33.330> really<00:01:33.570> try

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.149 

try<00:01:37.790> throwing<00:01:38.060> it<00:01:38.510> because<00:01:39.350> I<00:01:39.650> did<00:01:39.950> that

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
try throwing it because I did that

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:52.349 
try throwing it because I did that
before<00:01:40.990> it<00:01:41.990> was<00:01:42.050> pretty<00:01:42.320> cool

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:52.359 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:56.560 

after<00:01:53.359> you're<00:01:53.659> done<00:01:54.289> making<00:01:54.920> a<00:01:55.399> favor<00:01:56.149> bullet

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
after you're done making a favor bullet

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
after you're done making a favor bullet
it<00:01:56.689> should<00:01:56.869> look<00:01:57.020> like<00:01:57.079> this<00:01:59.110> take<00:02:00.110> a<00:02:00.140> piece<00:02:00.560> of

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
it should look like this take a piece of

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:09.190 
it should look like this take a piece of
tape<00:02:06.490> put<00:02:07.490> out<00:02:07.729> of<00:02:07.880> this<00:02:07.969> triangle<00:02:08.599> right<00:02:08.989> here

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
tape put out of this triangle right here

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.950 
tape put out of this triangle right here
that's<00:02:09.709> a<00:02:09.890> loose

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
that's a loose

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.440 
that's a loose
that's<00:02:12.560> your<00:02:12.770> paper<00:02:14.470> rocket

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
that's your paper rocket

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.150 
that's your paper rocket
it's<00:02:16.989> actually<00:02:17.170> like<00:02:17.590> a<00:02:17.650> paperboy<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:18.550> watch

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
it's actually like a paperboy and watch

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.050 
it's actually like a paperboy and watch
you<00:02:21.160> can<00:02:21.340> throw<00:02:21.550> it<00:02:21.580> to<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:24.610> got<00:02:24.760> a<00:02:24.790> paper

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
you can throw it to you got a paper

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.290 
you can throw it to you got a paper
rocket<00:02:25.599> launcher<00:02:26.140> you<00:02:27.129> can<00:02:29.790> shoot<00:02:30.790> it<00:02:30.940> out<00:02:31.120> of

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
rocket launcher you can shoot it out of

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.730 
rocket launcher you can shoot it out of
it<00:02:31.450> if<00:02:31.629> it's<00:02:31.930> uh

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
it if it's uh

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.280 
it if it's uh
smart<00:02:34.740> enough<00:02:34.890> for<00:02:35.099> it<00:02:36.050> sometimes<00:02:37.050> they<00:02:37.230> can

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
smart enough for it sometimes they can

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.860 
smart enough for it sometimes they can
be<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.620> little<00:02:37.709> bit<00:02:38.130> big<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:39.709> that's<00:02:40.709> about<00:02:41.220> it

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
be a little bit big and that's about it
