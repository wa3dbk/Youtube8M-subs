and when was taken buying activity is

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.510 
and when was taken buying activity is
highest<00:01:55.480> it's<00:01:56.380> really<00:01:56.980> hard<00:01:57.190> to<00:01:57.340> see<00:01:57.490> a

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
highest it's really hard to see a

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.880 
highest it's really hard to see a
pattern<00:01:58.060> and<00:01:58.330> keep<00:01:59.050> in<00:01:59.230> mind<00:01:59.440> there's<00:01:59.590> a<00:01:59.650> lot

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
pattern and keep in mind there's a lot

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:00.960 
pattern and keep in mind there's a lot
of<00:02:00.010> other<00:02:00.130> factors<00:02:00.400> that<00:02:00.610> are<00:02:00.730> going<00:02:00.850> to

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
of other factors that are going to

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.570 
of other factors that are going to
affect<00:02:01.210> price<00:02:01.480> so<00:02:01.810> to<00:02:01.870> me<00:02:02.170> it<00:02:02.500> seems<00:02:02.620> kind<00:02:03.430> of

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
affect price so to me it seems kind of

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.030 
affect price so to me it seems kind of
inconclusive<00:02:04.390> and<00:02:04.660> it's<00:02:05.050> even<00:02:05.380> easier<00:02:05.620> to<00:02:05.950> be

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
inconclusive and it's even easier to be

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.740 
inconclusive and it's even easier to be
inconclusive<00:02:06.400> when<00:02:06.850> you<00:02:06.940> look<00:02:07.120> at<00:02:07.270> price<00:02:07.510> per

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
inconclusive when you look at price per

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.150 
inconclusive when you look at price per
square<00:02:08.020> foot<00:02:08.259> which<00:02:08.440> to<00:02:08.679> me<00:02:08.800> is<00:02:08.890> like<00:02:09.009> the

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
square foot which to me is like the

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.740 
square foot which to me is like the
great<00:02:09.340> equalizer<00:02:09.910> because<00:02:10.330> you<00:02:10.420> know<00:02:10.539> maybe

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
great equalizer because you know maybe

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.510 
great equalizer because you know maybe
people<00:02:10.990> buy<00:02:11.230> bigger<00:02:11.590> houses<00:02:12.040> in<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.250> summer

or something along those lines price per
square<00:02:15.160> foot<00:02:15.430> it<00:02:15.820> doesn't<00:02:16.300> really<00:02:16.480> seem<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.870> be

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
square foot it doesn't really seem to be
