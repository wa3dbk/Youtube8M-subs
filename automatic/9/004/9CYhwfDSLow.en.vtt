00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.810
 this is the challenge so today I'm doing with this party evian team 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.550
 she could show that gp2's world of double pocket problem 

00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:14.089
 while claims that he does not need strong on the solidarity of the eu of 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.830
 cream 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.460
 themselves according to cultures 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.750
 a man who lies a jersey game 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.769
 where he economic 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:23.310
 it's easy to return 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.289
 round shape preference 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.939
 so that they can know better he is not comfortable 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.449
 in the pack 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.520
 a small office 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.050
 gilles duceppe 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.070
 so you have to declare yourself 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.900
 father such son 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.320
 the only three things that all closets to create cinema5 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.370
 scattered the ballot makes it a little 48 seconds only on laps 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.149
 call to order at the blue line 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.839
 now that people's mood disorders or 16go black lips have all 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:54.970
 the air 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.290
 the head he is currently 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.240
 so 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.980
 I'm going to show you the lack of landmarks for them 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.370
 you make the beaches for the entire mobile phone while driving 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.700
 as such the team 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.970
 so why are we going to stay hannezo 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.970
 finally a very small net is the cotton below 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.390
 here is somewhere 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.990
 in the ports 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.900
 we have to manage quickly it will be very complicated 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.640
 in fact you take cotton 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.640
 and you for the address above 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.180
 and you have finished well 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.410
 you know what you're doing too much 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.480
 for good but the man is not a panacea is full of water actually 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.130
 according to him to put him in the freezer 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.130
 why is the fact that we throw 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.810
 ouattara 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.960
 we are being born we must not 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.260
 one of the parts of the agreement 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.230
 and norway have thresholds of 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.690
 investigators stopped at packing 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.190
 for packing this time 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.790
 you talk to your coaching or a boon at the center of a sheet of 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.000
 stretch film paper that you have cut out 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.919
 with which I fought elsewhere for left 

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:09.699
 we will say three good minutes 

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:11.519
 it is true that I am not very talented 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.909
 so that's good for children's health 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:15.689
 if you have a moisturizer 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.769
 like them it is the case for example 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:18.629
 Hand cream 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.629
 god or whatever 

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:23.979
 in fact 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:26.459
 just he stung 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.319
 by applying the stipule 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.129
 different cantons 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.119
 me that makes five points 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:34.430
 this is for the little road 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.430
 quoted on your grave 

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:42.699
 here we are 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:44.259
 to further lengthen 

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:46.329
 in the cotentin 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:49.679
 then as follows 

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:50.899
 in one layer 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:54.359
 roxy the other side 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.359
 and this one the same thing 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:00.459
 here to remember the layer 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:01.540
 on which m 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.439
 you were going to 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:04.439
 at the end of your nose 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:06.219
 your moisturizer 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:08.989
 what could its choices do five regions 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.009
 coldness too 

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:13.109
 ouf we did not abdicate to me I will take my little% 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:14.469
 of Michel the directory 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:18.140
 disturbing except that I 32 teeth having made a small point so as to 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:18.889
 power 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:22.809
 on the face the moans of the moisturizer the operation on the 

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:23.929
 any end 

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:26.709
 an ice cream but if you do not have one 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.659
 it is possible not to have cream for the eye area or for what 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:32.989
 whether it's about the gods 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.820
 so I put them in the middle 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.859
 the premises are slightly modified 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.409
 joe torre finishing 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:43.229
 ap the edges 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:45.929
 like this one 

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:48.239
 or its subsidiaries 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.349
 and the area and in the freezer 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:55.189
 if I intend to use it to the ten girls who surround it at the cloister 7% serve this 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:57.589
 evening use farrar winner 

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:58.560
 the summary 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.560
 at one time of the year 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:06.509
 I know how deep I have to say against when we have contact 

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:09.540
 of the matter that the fed ends up trying to deflate 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:11.859
 beaulieu 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:15.789
 because he lacks sleep because you are stressed because you like 

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:17.759
 exhausting day could not arrive 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.759
 the goal conceded in es7 silves 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:27.729
 and display your fed tone 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:28.639
 on the haye 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.039
 having done better than all will have been crazed in the cotton 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.080
 and that he is completely free 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.669
 you will not have for tunis 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.400
 finally will not sink without forgetting the beautiful and the absorbed animal in cotton 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.000
 and we call a lot already bad on tar remains wet so 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.889
 when you are abroad 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.309
 it will harden 

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:49.099
 and then at the bar 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:52.529
 ends up yet you do not have to remove the one-stop shop but putting 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:53.330
 your skin 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.360
 so that's an economical way 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.159
 quick 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:02.520
 to make it disappear the pockets that you have under the eyes 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.990
 we at the end of the golden age left the fire of the plain on them in the 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.710
 talk shows both 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.759
 eugen on sale to create a video as part of the week 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.050
 the body burned all our members of the volunteers who helped to 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.150
 postpone your achievements before the crisis 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.319
 as underlines that the problem is still it will not be with that 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.900
 dominique here they are going to be inactive partners 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.469
 to save money for activists 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:34.789
 far from us the idea is so again 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:38.139
 for the moment everything is complete you can compose a menu with some 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:40.639
 small means created at best 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:45.270
 do this he makes me laugh his ton makeup i'm going to propose that local 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.370
 rafael perez who did particular 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.890
 to give you all the time among them that of the simplest makeup 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:53.409
 the most charged 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:56.009
 for all situations in which you can find yourself 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:58.610
 a total peace and that will continue 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.610
 so here I left team b in the lighter group 

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:06.739
 and to activate them and for the perilous journey of dota 2 and there is in 

00:06:06.739 --> 00:06:09.739
 effect in comments like vincent defrasne site 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.650
 which is useful or not to do it for me I wanted to talk 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.669
 and as for me I'll see you soon for new tadic videos
