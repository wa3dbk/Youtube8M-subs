00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.289
 among all friends of love analysis for the 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:18.369
 videorecensione today we present to 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:21.099
 edoardo and the are the first headphones of the 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.550
 distributed by her fan to be and 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:23.650
 bluetooth 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.429
 naturally they are not only from 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.560
 Integrated hand headphones also include a microphone 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:33.760
 so we can use them on our own 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:36.640
 liking both to listen to music 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.430
 but not only on these mobile devices 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.010
 like iphone samsung galaxy s iii but 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.750
 even maybe on our mac on ours 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.720
 pc 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:50.799
 there is also a microphone on board 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.129
 we could in addition to the various calls that 

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:57.540
 we can make on our smartphones 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:00.460
 or we could also interact on 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.670
 different voice assistants or if 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:07.119
 we are on a PC like a personal computer 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.280
 windows or mac we can use them for 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:12.479
 converse with skype as you see they are 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.550
 bluetooth headphones have an attack 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.810
 micro usb inside the case 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.970
 you will find the micro usb cable for 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.980
 feeding them the pavilions are removable 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.980
 depending on the size we want 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.230
 it is the particularity as I said that 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.230
 however I am also a microphone of 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:35.380
 we can make calls and all the 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:38.710
 complete management is performed by 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:42.190
 this selector the central key for 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:46.390
 turn on to connect to bluetooth a 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:49.030
 change the various tracks with forward and 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.820
 back with the respective keys and 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:57.159
 increase and decrease what is the 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:02:00.640
 sound volume that is is optimal is 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:03.070
 a headset that I tried on 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.790
 different devices but also on mac 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.400
 with skype and I had no problem 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.790
 of 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.860
 for example of rustling or noise of 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.200
 background 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.760
 once the configuration is complete 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.210
 initial than that of the setting 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.790
 of the buttock liter both on the iphone and on the 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:26.180
 galaxy s3 we could go and listen to 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:29.360
 our headsets well then 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:34.940
 let's select a music then 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.650
 we will first hear the main audio and 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:47.270
 we will have to go and select the one that 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:53.450
 is our country we connect ours 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:55.850
 and I heard it now feel low 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.660
 just increase through the selector 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.660
 than on the headphones 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.760
 so you are hearing the volume 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.680
 of the current music currently it 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:21.560
 we can increase by phone and have 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:26.410
 a greater sound then increase e 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.410
 decrease directly from the typical 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:39.580
 we could also change the passage as 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:39.580
 you see it's going on 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:04:00.950
 once we tried ours 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:02.560
 things we could also try ours 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.940
 gas 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.220
 same thing we could do it too 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.959
 on a galaxy s3 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.790
 so we should go and connect the 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.600
 our via bluetooth in the 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:17.079
 settings then go into bluetooth 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:20.630
 I now already associate it 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:22.970
 just associate it if you haven't 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.979
 the procedure is what I did to him 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.220
 see before holding for a while 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:31.610
 the power button when it flashes 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.930
 red and blue will be in transmission 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.740
 therefore it will be recognized directly 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:39.200
 from your galaxy s3 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:43.539
 so once that was 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:46.640
 recognized we can go and listen 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:49.700
 a music from our reader 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:55.210
 musical rest in this case that I do 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.210
 have a head music 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:08.539
 you hear it down because anyway 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:08.539
 low the type of volume already preset 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:26.240
 to increase ok how you feel I am 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:32.490
 even a little distant feels good 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:35.219
 peculiarity of this device is and 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:40.619
 that I have tried it in two different ones 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:44.129
 mode in a home fans 

00:05:40.619 --> 00:05:46.499
 declares it functioning in a range of 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:49.319
 10 meters I went a lot more 

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:50.039
 I am very picky about it 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:52.889
 measures 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:55.830
 I have over 20 meters with two walls has 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:58.649
 front and felt perfectly 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:02.699
 of course you don't have to get your hands on it 

00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:07.769
 in front of the transmission system 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:11.519
 well we said this about music but 

00:06:07.769 --> 00:06:16.589
 we could also interact with that 

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:19.610
 for example siri of iphone or bordeaux 

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:23.779
 in the latest apple iphone 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:26.999
 therefore the functionality and multiple is a 

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:30.300
 produced by green design 

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:31.199
 I these days I've been going 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.379
 on a skateboard 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:37.289
 so I found myself very comfortable not 

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:40.229
 bring me the curves in outline characters the 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:44.189
 phone in your pocket and skateboard headphones e 

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:44.939
 away well their price is 69 euros e 

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:47.789
 99 

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:50.610

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:53.279
 product of beautiful and versatile design 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:55.469
 why not work because the audio is 

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:57.930
 optimal 

00:06:55.469 --> 00:07:00.440
 all you have to do is go to the 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:03.320
 website for fans 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:06.080
 buy these headphones of course 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.910
 this is an example coloring but ce 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.780
 there are much more beautiful ones 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:13.790
 the one with the white face and the other one 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:17.210
 red that much more beautiful risks 

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:20.420
 all the others however all the colors do 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:21.980
 yes this is a product either it is 

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:25.250
 exalted to the maximum even in the 

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:27.470
 technical features he does not have 

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:29.420
 of which we cannot limit handsome boys 

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:32.950
