00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.229 
pricked a lot so just be careful and
these<00:00:30.750> are<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:32.059> stems<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.180> are<00:00:33.420> left<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
these are the stems that are left of the

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.459 
these are the stems that are left of the
sticker<00:00:36.239> bushes<00:00:36.510> or<00:00:36.960> blackberry<00:00:37.680> bushes<00:00:39.469> so

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
sticker bushes or blackberry bushes so

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.780 
sticker bushes or blackberry bushes so
what<00:00:40.649> you're<00:00:40.770> going<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.040> do<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.550> need<00:00:41.670> to

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
what you're going to do is you need to

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.720 
what you're going to do is you need to
pull<00:00:42.090> them<00:00:42.300> from<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.960> stems<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.649> get<00:00:44.579> them

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
pull them from the stems and get them

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.630 
pull them from the stems and get them
all<00:00:44.969> out<00:00:45.300> through<00:00:46.170> by<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.710> roots<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.430> need

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
all out through by the roots so you need

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.880 
all out through by the roots so you need
to<00:00:47.789> pull<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.480> roots<00:00:48.660> out<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.930> ground<00:00:49.020> now

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
to pull the roots out of the ground now

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.400 
to pull the roots out of the ground now
in<00:00:50.039> my<00:00:50.190> case<00:00:50.329> there<00:00:51.329> were<00:00:51.480> weed<00:00:51.690> barriers<00:00:52.170> that

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
in my case there were weed barriers that

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.290 
in my case there were weed barriers that
will<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.980> were<00:00:53.100> laid<00:00:53.280> out<00:00:53.600> before<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:55.820> so<00:00:56.820> I

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
will that were laid out before and so I

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.799 
will that were laid out before and so I
need<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.719> peel<00:00:58.350> them<00:00:58.559> back<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.480> get<00:01:00.480> all<00:01:00.660> the

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
need to peel them back and get all the

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.240 
need to peel them back and get all the
roots<00:01:00.989> out<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.289> there<00:01:01.410> otherwise<00:01:01.680> they'll

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
roots out of there otherwise they'll

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.910 
roots out of there otherwise they'll
keep<00:01:02.399> growing<00:01:02.760> back<00:01:02.969> for<00:01:03.960> instance<00:01:04.379> there's

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
keep growing back for instance there's

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.039 
keep growing back for instance there's
already<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.519> couple<00:01:05.880> sprouts<00:01:06.330> over<00:01:06.570> there<00:01:06.750> that

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
already a couple sprouts over there that

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.590 
already a couple sprouts over there that
weren't<00:01:07.200> there<00:01:07.380> last<00:01:07.590> week<00:01:08.330> so<00:01:09.330> as<00:01:09.420> long<00:01:09.540> as

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
weren't there last week so as long as

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.210 
weren't there last week so as long as
the<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.049> roots<00:01:10.380> are<00:01:10.530> still<00:01:10.710> underneath<00:01:11.070> there

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
the the roots are still underneath there

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.000 
the the roots are still underneath there
you're<00:01:11.340> going<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.549> keep<00:01:11.729> growing<00:01:11.850> back<00:01:13.010> so

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
you're going to keep growing back so

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.649 
you're going to keep growing back so
you'll<00:01:14.400> need<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.760> just<00:01:15.060> pull<00:01:15.240> all<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.479> roots

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
you'll need to just pull all the roots

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.770 
you'll need to just pull all the roots
out<00:01:16.520> and<00:01:17.520> those<00:01:17.820> probably<00:01:18.119> still<00:01:18.360> get<00:01:18.540> some

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
out and those probably still get some

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.570 
out and those probably still get some
more<00:01:18.930> little<00:01:19.619> sprouts<00:01:19.890> here<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.220> there<00:01:20.369> so

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
more little sprouts here and there so

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.740 
more little sprouts here and there so
you<00:01:20.670> just<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.000> keep<00:01:21.150> pulling<00:01:21.479> them<00:01:21.570> out

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
you just have to keep pulling them out

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.940 
you just have to keep pulling them out
until<00:01:22.740> they<00:01:23.210> eventually<00:01:24.210> go<00:01:24.600> away<00:01:24.680> but<00:01:25.680> it'll

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
until they eventually go away but it'll

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.819 
until they eventually go away but it'll
take<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> few<00:01:26.909> years<00:01:27.150> probably<00:01:27.600> until<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.680> can

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
take a few years probably until you can

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.800 
take a few years probably until you can
get<00:01:28.950> rid<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.130> all<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.340> them<00:01:29.579> yeah<00:01:30.479> they<00:01:30.689> get

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
get rid of all of them yeah they get

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.630 
get rid of all of them yeah they get
kind<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.229> out<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.380> hand<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.280> how<00:01:32.430> they

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
kind of out of hand this is how they

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.050 
kind of out of hand this is how they
look<00:01:32.790> before<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.799> hack<00:01:34.799> them<00:01:35.009> down<00:01:35.250> actually

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
look before I hack them down actually

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.740 
look before I hack them down actually
mine<00:01:36.509> were<00:01:36.630> almost<00:01:36.810> 5<00:01:37.710> 6<00:01:38.159> feet<00:01:38.340> tall<00:01:38.750> they

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
mine were almost 5 6 feet tall they

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.910 
mine were almost 5 6 feet tall they
really<00:01:39.990> got<00:01:40.140> out<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.259> hand<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:43.530> thing

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
really got out of hand and the thing

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.950 
really got out of hand and the thing
with<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.490> blackberries<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.329> birds<00:01:45.570> tend

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
with the blackberries is the birds tend

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.480 
with the blackberries is the birds tend
to<00:01:46.110> spread<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.439> seeds<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.070> when<00:01:47.220> they<00:01:47.310> pick

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
to spread the seeds so when they pick

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.399 
to spread the seeds so when they pick
the<00:01:47.610> berries<00:01:47.970> they<00:01:48.119> eat<00:01:48.299> them<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.780> that's<00:01:49.290> how

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
the berries they eat them and that's how

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.740 
the berries they eat them and that's how
they<00:01:49.530> also<00:01:49.710> propagate<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.430> from<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.540> birds

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
they also propagate is from the birds

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.510 
they also propagate is from the birds
and<00:01:51.990> possibly<00:01:52.619> other<00:01:52.829> animals<00:01:53.340> like

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
and possibly other animals like

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.120 
and possibly other animals like
squirrels<00:01:54.200> spreading<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.290> seeds<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.890> so

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
squirrels spreading the seeds and so

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.679 
squirrels spreading the seeds and so
they<00:01:56.250> grow<00:01:56.399> everywhere<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:57.119> they<00:01:57.420> can<00:01:57.570> get

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
they grow everywhere and they can get

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.389 
they grow everywhere and they can get
out<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.899> control<00:01:58.140> especially<00:01:58.710> when<00:01:59.100> trying<00:01:59.250> to

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
out of control especially when trying to

protective<00:02:14.650> gloves<00:02:15.250> that<00:02:15.879> these<00:02:16.000> are<00:02:16.120> only

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
protective gloves that these are only

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.390 
protective gloves that these are only
garden<00:02:17.170> gloves<00:02:17.260> but<00:02:17.590> they<00:02:17.890> work<00:02:18.040> for<00:02:18.219> me

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
garden gloves but they work for me

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.910 
garden gloves but they work for me
they're<00:02:18.640> pretty<00:02:19.060> thick<00:02:19.299> anyway<00:02:19.689> so<00:02:20.560> when<00:02:20.829> you

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
they're pretty thick anyway so when you

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.170 
they're pretty thick anyway so when you
see<00:02:21.099> these<00:02:21.250> when<00:02:21.609> you<00:02:21.730> get<00:02:21.819> down<00:02:21.969> to<00:02:22.090> these

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
see these when you get down to these

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.990 
see these when you get down to these
stems<00:02:22.480> so<00:02:22.659> that<00:02:22.810> one's<00:02:22.989> already<00:02:23.890> right<00:02:24.819> up

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
stems so that one's already right up

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.970 
stems so that one's already right up
that's<00:02:25.900> why<00:02:26.049> you<00:02:26.109> have<00:02:26.319> to<00:02:26.469> pull<00:02:26.680> them<00:02:26.799> from

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
that's why you have to pull them from

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.759 
that's why you have to pull them from
it's<00:02:27.639> kind<00:02:27.909> of<00:02:28.030> hard<00:02:28.269> so<00:02:28.540> you<00:02:28.629> might<00:02:29.439> need<00:02:29.560> some

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
it's kind of hard so you might need some

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.349 
it's kind of hard so you might need some
help<00:02:29.799> with<00:02:30.219> their<00:02:30.340> songs<00:02:30.609> I<00:02:30.730> use<00:02:30.849> a<00:02:30.879> shovel<00:02:31.180> to

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.270 
help with their songs I use a shovel to
UM<00:02:32.049> dig<00:02:32.439> them<00:02:32.560> out<00:02:32.680> of<00:02:32.829> there

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
UM dig them out of there

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.979 
UM dig them out of there
now<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.849> little<00:02:34.030> ones<00:02:34.269> are<00:02:34.389> easier<00:02:34.750> like

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
now the little ones are easier like

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.349 
now the little ones are easier like
these<00:02:35.200> but<00:02:35.889> then<00:02:36.040> see<00:02:36.310> in<00:02:36.370> my<00:02:36.760> case<00:02:36.819> again

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:37.359 
these but then see in my case again

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:39.479 
these but then see in my case again
there's<00:02:37.540> a<00:02:37.629> weeds<00:02:37.810> area<00:02:38.200> so<00:02:38.920> we'd<00:02:39.069> have<00:02:39.099> to

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
there's a weeds area so we'd have to

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.869 
there's a weeds area so we'd have to
peel<00:02:40.239> this<00:02:40.389> back<00:02:40.719> and<00:02:41.370> there's<00:02:42.370> all<00:02:42.519> the<00:02:42.669> roots

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
peel this back and there's all the roots

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:49.729 
peel this back and there's all the roots
underneath<00:02:46.260> which<00:02:47.260> is<00:02:47.290> predicted<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.250> this

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
underneath which is predicted to this

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.509 
underneath which is predicted to this
stems<00:02:50.739> here<00:02:51.780> so<00:02:52.780> yeah<00:02:52.900> I<00:02:52.959> see<00:02:53.169> all<00:02:53.290> these<00:02:53.519> roots

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
stems here so yeah I see all these roots

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.179 
stems here so yeah I see all these roots
in<00:02:54.669> the<00:02:54.730> bottom<00:02:55.109> of<00:02:56.109> this<00:02:56.290> barrier<00:02:56.560> this<00:02:57.040> from

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:57.189 
in the bottom of this barrier this from

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:59.789 
in the bottom of this barrier this from
vines<00:02:57.480> but<00:02:58.480> anyway<00:02:58.840> so<00:02:59.230> those<00:02:59.379> are<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.620> roots

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
vines but anyway so those are the roots

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:05.460 
vines but anyway so those are the roots
that<00:03:00.010> you<00:03:00.069> need<00:03:00.189> to<00:03:00.280> get<00:03:00.430> rid<00:03:00.579> of<00:03:00.689> pull<00:03:01.689> out
