00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.309
 the procedure to win is the same 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.800
 that in the previous examples the black king 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.980
 is gradually driven towards the edge 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.070
 of the board under the coordinated action of 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.580
 the bishops who have to control their 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:25.320
 escape boxes the next line of 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:28.430
 game is easily understandable let's see 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.430
 they play white 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:45.340
 this force the black king get away from 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.400
 center now the white king is so 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.860
 owned the center 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.680
 and the black king is completely 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:58.380
 cut by the bishops and can be 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.380
 carried easily to the corner 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.400
 the movements of the black king are 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.710
 quite restricted but it's still 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.710
 I need to take him to the corner 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.640
 ah 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.650
 ah 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:54.590
 no doubt there can be faster roads 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.750
 was the winning method in any case is the 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.830
 same 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.830
 good luck
