00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.090
 we have all the ingredients 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.800
 organized as they are going to find the 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.110
 quantities of the ingredients in the 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.210
 box of video descriptions 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:36.059
 but here we will still name them 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:39.720
 we put a frying pan or pan to heat 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:43.980
 medium high fire and we already have the chicken 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:46.020
 cut that they are is a kilo or two pounds 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.159
 of chicken breast can use 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.059
 also leg and thigh boned if so 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:52.500
 He prefers 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.659
 here we put a little salt 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.430
 nothing more to give to give it a bit of 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:01:00.960
 taste and good since our pan 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.650
 Bozate is enough 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.450
 hot because we're going to seal it from the 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.299
 two sides the chicken first is that not 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.640
 we are in the pan this two 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.880
 hot enough 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.670
 let's go here we have 3 tablespoons 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.800
 of olive oil we are going to put more 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.510
 or less than half of that first because 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.510
 let's use a little more after 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.330
 since we see that the oil is hot 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:34.170
 let's put the chicken and we're going to 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.119
 go up from medium high to high so that 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.369
 we lower the chicken latency in a minute 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.890
 a minute and a half we already sealed it from 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.540
 down as you can see 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.540
 to mount arno you can realize 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.130
 and it 's how we want it to be clear from 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.410
 down and now we're going to turn it like that 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.990
 high fire and it's going to be the same now 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.910
 ready already on the other side also now what 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.730
 let's take out the pan and 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.610
 let's take the chicken out of the pan for 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:05.370
 do the rest and we already take them out as 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.190
 you can see it was already sealed now 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.220
 We put it back on fire already 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.640
 low medium here is all the 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.830
 caramelization right now that's why 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.080
 we needed to seal it first to 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.090
 get the flavor but do not take your 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.190
 game so that it is not too hard 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.930
 chicken that's why we take it out now let's 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:30.850
 put the rest of the oil that was left 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:34.870
 we hope that hot in a little 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.730
 and let's sauté the chopped onion 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.630
 it's a soup spoon of onion 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.630
 chopped white 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.670
 let's fry a little in the same way 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.010
 let's put 2 cloves of garlic here the 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.120
 we have squeezed but you can still 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:55.260
 Finely chop 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:59.250
 we are going to sauté them and also 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:02.299
 half a teaspoon of chopped ginger 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.299
 finely chopped 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.880
 then we offered ourselves a little bit since 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:13.760
 take out and let out all its aroma 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.920
 taking care that we do not want it since it comes out 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.690
 all its aroma we are going to put the 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.580
 apple cider vinegar that are two 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.580
 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.300
 this will help us clean 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.180
 or the pan 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.950
 and get all that flavor out of your face 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.129
 meditation 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:43.400
 now we put the orange juice that 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:45.879
 We have a third cup of juice 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.879
 orange 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.750
 we are alright to clean well the 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.620
 pan with that to take out all the 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.620
 flavors from there 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:04.290
 and we're going to put the rest of the 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:08.510
 ingredients that are 3 tablespoons 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.510

 we also have a third cup of 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.039

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:33.539
 one - third cup soy sauce 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:36.690
 and this we are going to mix well and on fire 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:39.210
 medium we are going to bring it to a boil 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.849
 low boiling breaks a little in a boil 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.930
 was making fire and medium we're going to put the 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:44.930
 return chicken 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:51.069
 how we did not finish cooking in the 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.370
 nothing else was to seal it to get him out 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:54.860
 the taste 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:58.160
 but come on let's finish your cooking 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:01.100
 in the sauce so boiling to a fire 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.800
 low leaves me a medium fire but at a 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.169
 boil low we mix it well and we're going 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.660
 to leave at least 10 more minutes and 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:11.830
 let's check that it's already cooked would be 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:15.229
 10 minutes and we already checked if we bring 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:17.930
 one of the largest pieces of chicken 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:20.060
 to see that it is well cooked is already 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.699
 well now here is where the 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:28.220
 cornstarch we have a quarter cup of 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:31.160
 water with a teaspoon of cornstarch 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:34.479
 we mix well and this is going to swell 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.479
 our sauce 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:41.719
 we're going to boil it a little bit, we're going to 

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:44.599
 see but let's live a little bit like 

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:47.689
 for example about a minute to 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:50.389
 the taste or two minutes will be 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:54.739
 go the taste of the cornstarch we leave it 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:58.519
 two and a half minutes already for me it's fine 

00:05:54.739 --> 00:06:00.379
 thick the sauce if you want to leave 

00:05:58.519 --> 00:06:03.019
 a little more to which species a little more the 

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:04.759
 salsa is also fine and if you want it 

00:06:03.019 --> 00:06:08.689
 spicy this is optional we are going to 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:11.089
 put a teaspoon of chile de árbol 

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:13.039
 shredded shredded japanese chili 

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:16.369
 that is to taste if the child because 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:19.150
 we do not put it together and mix well 

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:24.990
 we put out the fire 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:27.210
 and our bourbon chicken is ready 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:30.180
 we also put what we can put a 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:32.520
 little bit of sesame seeds that 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:36.120
 they are going very well now we are going to serve 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:38.910
 to introduce yourself here we already serve them 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.620
 we accompanied with white rice we put 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.180
 a little broccoli just can 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:46.690
