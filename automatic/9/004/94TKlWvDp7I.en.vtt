where you can click on any fish and then

where you can click on any fish and then
you're<00:02:04.350> asked<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.560> identify<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:05.250> which<00:02:05.790> is

you're asked to identify it which is

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.609 
you're asked to identify it which is
extremely<00:02:06.450> hard<00:02:06.780> if<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:06.960> do<00:02:07.110> not<00:02:07.229> know<00:02:07.409> the

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
extremely hard if you do not know the

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.550 
extremely hard if you do not know the
fish<00:02:08.090> but<00:02:09.090> as<00:02:09.450> far<00:02:09.660> as<00:02:09.720> like<00:02:09.929> classroom<00:02:10.379> use

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
fish but as far as like classroom use

fish but as far as like classroom use
goes<00:02:10.800> if<00:02:11.069> your<00:02:11.190> teacher<00:02:11.400> looking<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.940> possibly

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
goes if your teacher looking to possibly

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.910 
goes if your teacher looking to possibly
use<00:02:12.569> this<00:02:12.690> in<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:12.930> classroom<00:02:13.140> setting

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
use this in a classroom setting

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.080 
use this in a classroom setting
doesn't<00:02:14.220> get<00:02:14.280> much<00:02:14.400> better<00:02:14.459> than<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:14.849> and

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
doesn't get much better than that and

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.000 
doesn't get much better than that and
that's<00:02:15.209> pretty<00:02:15.450> functional<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:16.140> it's<00:02:16.590> pretty

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
that's pretty functional and it's pretty

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.130 
that's pretty functional and it's pretty
fun<00:02:17.250> too<00:02:17.550> likewise<00:02:18.420> there's<00:02:18.660> a<00:02:18.720> memorizing

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
fun too likewise there's a memorizing

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.199 
fun too likewise there's a memorizing
game<00:02:19.500> which<00:02:19.680> is<00:02:19.709> basic<00:02:20.220> tile<00:02:20.400> swapping<00:02:20.940> fair

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
game which is basic tile swapping fair

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.390 
game which is basic tile swapping fair
where<00:02:21.840> you<00:02:21.959> flip<00:02:22.349> over<00:02:22.470> two<00:02:22.739> tiles<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.310> then

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
where you flip over two tiles and then

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.100 
where you flip over two tiles and then
try<00:02:23.520> to<00:02:23.550> memorize<00:02:23.760> where<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.150> fish<00:02:24.330> are<00:02:24.510> when

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
try to memorize where the fish are when

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.800 
try to memorize where the fish are when
you<00:02:25.170> match<00:02:25.319> them<00:02:25.470> up<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.709> pair's<00:02:25.950> scored<00:02:26.430> and

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
you match them up the pair's scored and

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.420 
you match them up the pair's scored and
yeah<00:02:27.810> so<00:02:28.110> that's<00:02:28.260> great<00:02:28.500> there<00:02:28.770> to<00:02:28.950> know<00:02:29.220> game

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
yeah so that's great there to know game

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.770 
yeah so that's great there to know game
center<00:02:29.730> integration<00:02:30.209> or<00:02:30.330> anything<00:02:30.630> like<00:02:30.660> that

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
center integration or anything like that

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.479 
center integration or anything like that
but<00:02:31.170> then<00:02:31.290> again<00:02:31.410> this<00:02:31.650> isn't<00:02:31.860> so<00:02:32.040> much<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.220> game

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
but then again this isn't so much a game

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.970 
but then again this isn't so much a game
