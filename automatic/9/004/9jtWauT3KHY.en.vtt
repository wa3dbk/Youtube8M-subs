00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.930 
hi I'm Bob hotrod roar from clapping now
we're<00:00:19.440> going<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.620> talk<00:00:19.830> about<00:00:19.860> automatic<00:00:20.700> flow

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:20.940 
we're going to talk about automatic flow

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.700 
we're going to talk about automatic flow
valves<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.450> flow<00:00:21.660> Cal<00:00:21.930> Series<00:00:22.290> from<00:00:22.470> Coletti

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
valves the flow Cal Series from Coletti

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.050 
valves the flow Cal Series from Coletti
this<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.890> cutaway<00:00:26.280> of<00:00:26.400> what<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.610> flow<00:00:26.850> Cal

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
this is the cutaway of what a flow Cal

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.700 
this is the cutaway of what a flow Cal
looks<00:00:27.300> like<00:00:27.450> inside<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.080> this<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.290> a<00:00:28.470> pressure

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
looks like inside and this is a pressure

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.860 
looks like inside and this is a pressure
independent<00:00:29.430> balancing<00:00:29.910> valve<00:00:30.120> so<00:00:30.600> what<00:00:30.720> this

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:30.870 
independent balancing valve so what this

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.870 
independent balancing valve so what this
valve<00:00:31.140> does<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.800> maintains<00:00:31.950> a<00:00:32.400> constant

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
valve does is it maintains a constant

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.580 
valve does is it maintains a constant
flow<00:00:33.059> regardless<00:00:33.330> the<00:00:33.809> pressure<00:00:34.050> changes<00:00:34.530> in

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
flow regardless the pressure changes in

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.260 
flow regardless the pressure changes in
the<00:00:34.739> system<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:35.370> for<00:00:35.610> an<00:00:35.700> example<00:00:35.790> on<00:00:36.180> the

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
the system so for an example on the

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.180 
the system so for an example on the
graphic<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.780> can<00:00:36.840> see<00:00:36.960> it's<00:00:37.590> different<00:00:37.739> zone

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
graphic you can see it's different zone

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.500 
graphic you can see it's different zone
valves<00:00:38.520> in<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.640> system<00:00:39.030> would<00:00:39.150> turn<00:00:39.330> on<00:00:39.480> and

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
valves in the system would turn on and

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.120 
valves in the system would turn on and
off<00:00:39.750> for<00:00:39.960> different<00:00:40.290> heat<00:00:40.410> emitters<00:00:40.770> it's

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.130 
off for different heat emitters it's

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.040 
off for different heat emitters it's
going<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.400> maintain<00:00:41.580> a<00:00:41.820> constant<00:00:42.090> GPM<00:00:42.809> rate

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
going to maintain a constant GPM rate

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.690 
going to maintain a constant GPM rate
through<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.410> valve<00:00:43.650> and<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.250> does<00:00:44.400> that<00:00:44.580> with

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
through the valve and it does that with

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.940 
through the valve and it does that with
this<00:00:44.820> patented<00:00:45.390> cartridge<00:00:45.900> that<00:00:46.440> Chloe<00:00:46.680> has

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
this patented cartridge that Chloe has

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.880 
this patented cartridge that Chloe has
built<00:00:47.220> a<00:00:48.290> couple<00:00:49.290> things<00:00:49.590> about<00:00:49.680> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
built a couple things about the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.350 
built a couple things about the
cartridge<00:00:50.310> we<00:00:50.430> make<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.730> cartridge<00:00:51.090> out<00:00:51.270> of

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
cartridge we make that cartridge out of

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.420 
cartridge we make that cartridge out of
polymer<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.080> it's<00:00:52.200> noise<00:00:52.410> free<00:00:52.830> some<00:00:53.310> of

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
polymer so that it's noise free some of

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.010 
polymer so that it's noise free some of
the<00:00:53.490> other<00:00:53.670> types<00:00:54.450> out<00:00:54.600> there<00:00:54.660> have<00:00:54.990> a

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
the other types out there have a

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.630 
the other types out there have a
metallic<00:00:55.410> cartridge<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.040> they<00:00:56.130> can<00:00:56.280> set<00:00:56.460> up<00:00:56.490> a

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
metallic cartridge and they can set up a

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.250 
metallic cartridge and they can set up a
little<00:00:56.790> little<00:00:57.270> buzzing<00:00:57.450> a<00:00:57.630> little<00:00:57.810> resonant

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
little little buzzing a little resonant

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.080 
little little buzzing a little resonant
sound<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.680> they're<00:00:58.770> sometimes<00:00:59.220> by<00:00:59.700> making<00:01:00.000> it

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
sound and they're sometimes by making it

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.550 
sound and they're sometimes by making it
with<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.240> polymer<00:01:00.720> it's<00:01:00.810> a<00:01:00.870> very<00:01:01.050> quiet<00:01:01.410> very

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:01.560 
with a polymer it's a very quiet very

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.290 
with a polymer it's a very quiet very
smooth<00:01:02.040> acting<00:01:02.460> control<00:01:03.979> cartridge<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.100> there

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
smooth acting control cartridge in there

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.520 
smooth acting control cartridge in there
so<00:01:06.300> let<00:01:06.450> me<00:01:06.509> show<00:01:06.660> you<00:01:06.690> what<00:01:06.869> happens<00:01:07.229> here<00:01:07.380> so

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
so let me show you what happens here so

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.960 
so let me show you what happens here so
the<00:01:07.649> fluid<00:01:07.920> comes<00:01:08.130> into<00:01:08.369> this<00:01:08.490> valve<00:01:08.700> like

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
the fluid comes into this valve like

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.030 
the fluid comes into this valve like
here<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.750> goes<00:01:09.869> down<00:01:10.080> here<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.830> then<00:01:10.920> it

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
here and it goes down here and then it

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.680 
here and it goes down here and then it
comes<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.399> comes<00:01:11.580> around<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.940> outside<00:01:11.970> of

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
comes and it comes around the outside of

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.060 
comes and it comes around the outside of
this<00:01:12.810> cartridge<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.470> you'll<00:01:13.560> notice<00:01:13.740> on<00:01:13.950> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
this cartridge and you'll notice on the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.639 
this cartridge and you'll notice on the
cartridge<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:15.000> has<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.360> characterized<00:01:16.050> slot

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
cartridge it has a characterized slot

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:18.170 
cartridge it has a characterized slot
that's<00:01:16.860> been<00:01:17.070> machined<00:01:17.250> into<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.790> side<00:01:18.000> of

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
that's been machined into the side of

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.030 
that's been machined into the side of
that<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.509> that's<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.229> key<00:01:19.410> how<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.770> works

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
that and that's the key how this works

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.740 
that and that's the key how this works
so<00:01:20.250> as<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.399> pressure<00:01:20.640> in<00:01:20.789> the<00:01:20.880> system<00:01:21.210> changes

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
so as the pressure in the system changes

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.200 
so as the pressure in the system changes
it<00:01:22.020> moves<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.800> inside<00:01:23.280> piston<00:01:23.759> in<00:01:23.880> there<00:01:24.030> and

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
it moves that inside piston in there and

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.090 
it moves that inside piston in there and
it<00:01:24.479> changes<00:01:24.899> the<00:01:25.050> characteristic<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.039> that

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
it changes the characteristic of that

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.980 
it changes the characteristic of that
slot<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.729> there<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.360> assures<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.869> you're

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
slot in there so it assures that you're

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.300 
slot in there so it assures that you're
going<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.170> get<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.380> constant<00:01:28.890> flow<00:01:29.009> through

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
going to get the constant flow through

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.219 
going to get the constant flow through
the<00:01:29.399> valve<00:01:29.580> as<00:01:29.819> pressure<00:01:30.390> from<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.869> pump<00:01:31.110> in

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
the valve as pressure from the pump in

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.870 
the valve as pressure from the pump in
the<00:01:31.319> system<00:01:31.649> changes<00:01:32.100> valves<00:01:32.429> turn<00:01:32.610> on<00:01:32.700> and

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
the system changes valves turn on and

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.219 
the system changes valves turn on and
off<00:01:32.940> different<00:01:33.270> heat<00:01:33.509> emitters<00:01:33.869> are<00:01:33.959> coming

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
off different heat emitters are coming

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.990 
off different heat emitters are coming
and<00:01:34.319> going<00:01:34.380> that's<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.369> key<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.550> this<00:01:35.729> valve

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
and going that's the key to this valve

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.559 
and going that's the key to this valve
that's<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.750> secret<00:01:37.080> to<00:01:37.170> how<00:01:37.289> it<00:01:37.440> works

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:38.569 
that's the secret to how it works

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:41.480 
that's the secret to how it works

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
it out

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.279 
it out
so<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.850> can<00:01:44.940> take<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.240> cap<00:01:45.509> out<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.959> you<00:01:46.110> can

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
so you can take that cap out and you can

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.139 
so you can take that cap out and you can
just<00:01:46.319> with<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.069> isolation<00:01:47.399> valve<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.030> we

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
just with the isolation valve that we

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.710 
just with the isolation valve that we
provide

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
provide

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.210 
provide
now<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.050> can<00:01:49.259> shut<00:01:49.410> it<00:01:49.530> off<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.800> you<00:01:49.890> can<00:01:50.009> back

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
now you can shut it off and you can back

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.830 
now you can shut it off and you can back
flush<00:01:50.520> any<00:01:50.700> debris<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.060> might<00:01:51.240> settle<00:01:51.720> down

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
flush any debris that might settle down

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.540 
flush any debris that might settle down
into<00:01:52.080> the<00:01:52.200> bottom<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.709> you<00:01:53.100> can<00:01:53.280> also

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
into the bottom of that you can also

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.919 
into the bottom of that you can also
there's<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.789> bigger<00:01:54.000> thread<00:01:54.330> on<00:01:54.509> here<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.750> you

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
there's a bigger thread on here that you

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:56.389 
there's a bigger thread on here that you
can<00:01:55.050> take<00:01:55.229> apart<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.800> can<00:01:55.920> actually<00:01:56.100> take

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
can take apart and you can actually take

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.550 
can take apart and you can actually take
that<00:01:56.610> cartridge<00:01:57.000> out<00:01:57.209> of<00:01:57.270> there<00:01:57.569> notice<00:01:58.470> that

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
that cartridge out of there notice that

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.020 
that cartridge out of there notice that
everything's<00:01:58.950> machined<00:01:59.310> with<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.459> fine<00:01:59.729> thread

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
everything's machined with a fine thread

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.309 
everything's machined with a fine thread
and<00:02:00.179> o-ring<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:00.599> if<00:02:00.690> you<00:02:00.780> do<00:02:00.899> have<00:02:01.050> to<00:02:01.170> take

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:01.319 
and o-ring so if you do have to take

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:02.749 
and o-ring so if you do have to take
that<00:02:01.500> apart<00:02:01.800> to<00:02:01.920> service<00:02:02.250> it's<00:02:02.459> going<00:02:02.580> to<00:02:02.640> be

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
that apart to service it's going to be

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:03.980 
that apart to service it's going to be
easy<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.030> unscrew<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.569> get<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.840> back

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
easy to unscrew that and get it back

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.550 
easy to unscrew that and get it back
together<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.619> leak<00:02:05.130> free<00:02:05.459> a<00:02:06.200> little<00:02:07.200> bit<00:02:07.319> on<00:02:07.440> the

together a leak free a little bit on the

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.760 
together a leak free a little bit on the

Pete's ports are known as
pressure-temperature<00:02:12.690> ports<00:02:13.410> is<00:02:13.530> what<00:02:13.680> it

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
pressure-temperature ports is what it

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.440 
pressure-temperature ports is what it
stands<00:02:14.010> for<00:02:14.160> that<00:02:14.819> allows<00:02:15.060> you<00:02:15.209> to<00:02:15.240> put<00:02:15.420> a

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
stands for that allows you to put a

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.760 
stands for that allows you to put a
gauge<00:02:15.690> across<00:02:16.080> there<00:02:16.319> and<00:02:16.349> see<00:02:16.560> what<00:02:16.680> the

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
gauge across there and see what the

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.970 
gauge across there and see what the
differential<00:02:17.370> pressure<00:02:17.400> is<00:02:17.790> across<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.980> we

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
differential pressure is across that we

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.190 
differential pressure is across that we
also<00:02:20.130> have<00:02:20.400> an<00:02:20.520> optional<00:02:20.940> extension<00:02:21.630> that<00:02:21.990> for

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
also have an optional extension that for

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.240 
also have an optional extension that for
that<00:02:22.319> so<00:02:22.560> if<00:02:22.650> you're<00:02:22.740> going<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:22.890> insulate

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
that so if you're going to insulate

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.350 
that so if you're going to insulate
around<00:02:23.520> this<00:02:23.670> that's<00:02:23.849> going<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.030> get<00:02:24.180> wrapped

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
around this that's going to get wrapped

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.640 
around this that's going to get wrapped
where<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:24.629> don't<00:02:24.810> have<00:02:24.959> access<00:02:25.349> to<00:02:25.409> those

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
where you don't have access to those

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.619 
where you don't have access to those
ports<00:02:25.980> anymore<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.790> can<00:02:26.939> put<00:02:27.120> that<00:02:27.239> on<00:02:27.299> there

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
ports anymore you can put that on there

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:28.940 
ports anymore you can put that on there
and<00:02:27.689> now<00:02:27.840> you've<00:02:28.049> got<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.379> ability<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.709> get

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
and now you've got the ability to get

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:29.540 
and now you've got the ability to get
your

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
your

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.070 
your
you're<00:02:30.090> gauging<00:02:30.600> on<00:02:30.690> top<00:02:30.960> of<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.320> there<00:02:33.080> so

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
you're gauging on top of it there so

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.990 
you're gauging on top of it there so
that's<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.530> flow<00:02:34.980> Kelly<00:02:35.280> not<00:02:35.490> in<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.850> Y

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
that's the flow Kelly not in the Y

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.850 
that's the flow Kelly not in the Y
pattern<00:02:36.420> now<00:02:36.510> we<00:02:36.570> make<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.810> compact<00:02:37.440> version<00:02:37.560> of

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
pattern now we make a compact version of

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.150 
pattern now we make a compact version of
this<00:02:37.920> also<00:02:38.160> let<00:02:38.610> me<00:02:38.640> show<00:02:38.850> you<00:02:38.910> that<00:02:40.160> same

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
this also let me show you that same

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.070 
this also let me show you that same
technology<00:02:41.520> inside<00:02:42.000> same<00:02:42.330> cartridge<00:02:42.750> same

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
technology inside same cartridge same

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.080 
technology inside same cartridge same
characteristic<00:02:43.770> port<00:02:44.070> and<00:02:44.220> everything<00:02:44.280> the

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
characteristic port and everything the

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.120 
characteristic port and everything the
same<00:02:45.300> composite<00:02:46.230> type<00:02:46.380> of<00:02:46.530> cartridge<00:02:46.830> is<00:02:47.040> the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
same composite type of cartridge is the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.570 
same composite type of cartridge is the
union<00:02:47.490> connection<00:02:47.790> now<00:02:48.440> so<00:02:49.440> you<00:02:49.500> can<00:02:49.770> use<00:02:50.280> some

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
union connection now so you can use some

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.980 
union connection now so you can use some
tighter<00:02:50.790> applications<00:02:51.510> that's<00:02:51.630> what<00:02:51.810> tip

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
tighter applications that's what tip

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.420 
tighter applications that's what tip
would<00:02:52.020> you<00:02:52.290> use<00:02:52.470> maybe<00:02:52.710> I'm<00:02:52.830> an<00:02:52.950> air<00:02:53.100> handler

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
would you use maybe I'm an air handler

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.680 
would you use maybe I'm an air handler
something<00:02:53.790> where<00:02:53.910> you<00:02:53.970> want<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.210> set<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.480> flow

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
something where you want to set the flow

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.390 
something where you want to set the flow
rate<00:02:54.870> that<00:02:55.020> can<00:02:55.110> be<00:02:55.260> used<00:02:55.440> in<00:02:55.620> different<00:02:56.010> sizes

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
rate that can be used in different sizes

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.520 
rate that can be used in different sizes
well<00:02:57.120> build<00:02:57.420> this<00:02:57.630> to<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.930> flow<00:02:58.110> rate<00:02:58.140> that

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
well build this to the flow rate that

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.380 
well build this to the flow rate that
you're<00:02:58.680> required<00:02:59.130> so<00:02:59.400> have<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.730> seal<00:03:00.000> on<00:03:00.210> there

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
you're required so have a seal on there

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.090 
you're required so have a seal on there
it'll<00:03:00.570> have<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.780> label<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:01.710> that<00:03:01.770> tells<00:03:02.040> you

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
it'll have a label and that tells you

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.360 
it'll have a label and that tells you
what<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.310> flow<00:03:02.490> rate<00:03:02.700> is<00:03:03.920> that's<00:03:04.920> a<00:03:05.040> threaded

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
what the flow rate is that's a threaded

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.190 
what the flow rate is that's a threaded
version<00:03:05.670> of<00:03:05.790> it<00:03:05.880> there<00:03:06.090> now<00:03:06.480> this<00:03:06.750> one<00:03:06.930> is<00:03:07.170> a

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
version of it there now this one is a

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.470 
version of it there now this one is a
low<00:03:08.100> led<00:03:08.310> brass<00:03:08.640> so<00:03:08.880> it<00:03:08.940> can<00:03:09.060> be<00:03:09.150> used<00:03:09.330> and

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
low led brass so it can be used and

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.210 
low led brass so it can be used and
combined<00:03:09.960> system<00:03:10.350> to<00:03:10.440> open<00:03:10.530> systems<00:03:11.070> where

the heating water and the domestic water
is<00:03:13.260> mixed<00:03:13.650> so<00:03:13.680> that's<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.490> nice<00:03:14.670> thing<00:03:14.700> about

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
is mixed so that's the nice thing about

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.260 
is mixed so that's the nice thing about
that<00:03:15.120> that<00:03:15.770> valve<00:03:16.770> there<00:03:17.100> now<00:03:17.670> another<00:03:18.060> thing

solid<00:03:57.990> with<00:03:58.140> something<00:03:58.470> but<00:03:58.590> this<00:03:58.740> is<00:03:58.890> just

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
solid with something but this is just

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.530 
solid with something but this is just
going<00:03:59.160> to<00:03:59.250> protect<00:03:59.610> anything<00:03:59.850> downstream
