brushes in their collections so this

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.759 
brushes in their collections so this
struck<00:00:29.849> me<00:00:30.060> as<00:00:30.240> something<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.840> would<00:00:31.560> be

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
struck me as something that would be

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.580 
struck me as something that would be
great<00:00:32.070> for<00:00:32.399> blending<00:00:32.969> out<00:00:33.090> creamy<00:00:33.600> or<00:00:33.989> liquidy

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
great for blending out creamy or liquidy

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.650 
great for blending out creamy or liquidy
type<00:00:34.980> concealers<00:00:35.730> maybe<00:00:36.090> in<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.329> under<00:00:36.630> eye

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
type concealers maybe in the under eye

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.720 
type concealers maybe in the under eye
area<00:00:37.170> or<00:00:37.410> wherever<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:38.100> might<00:00:38.250> need<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.579> use

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
area or wherever you might need to use

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.760 
area or wherever you might need to use
then<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.120> actually<00:00:39.329> thought<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:40.110> might<00:00:40.559> be<00:00:40.739> a

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
then I actually thought it might be a

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.190 
then I actually thought it might be a
good<00:00:41.280> product<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:42.030> compare<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.870> Sigma

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
good product to compare to the Sigma

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.250 
good product to compare to the Sigma
precision<00:00:43.980> angled<00:00:44.430> p84<00:00:45.239> brush<00:00:45.600> this<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.110> a

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
precision angled p84 brush this is a

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.720 
precision angled p84 brush this is a
breast<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.739> I've<00:00:46.860> used<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.309> lot<00:00:47.670> for

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
breast so that I've used a lot for

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.610 
breast so that I've used a lot for
concealers<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.719> you're<00:00:49.020> looking<00:00:49.350> at<00:00:49.469> these

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
concealers and you're looking at these

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.650 
concealers and you're looking at these
side-by-side<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.850> you're<00:00:51.059> seeing<00:00:51.449> the

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
side-by-side and you're seeing the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.049 
side-by-side and you're seeing the
angles<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.260> brush<00:00:52.620> they<00:00:53.370> look<00:00:53.640> pretty

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
angles of the brush they look pretty

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.479 
angles of the brush they look pretty
similar<00:00:54.420> there's<00:00:54.960> just<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.440> similar<00:00:55.829> width<00:00:56.160> to

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
similar there's just a similar width to

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.770 
similar there's just a similar width to
them<00:00:56.699> but<00:00:56.910> then<00:00:57.059> when<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.300> turn<00:00:57.480> them<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
them but then when you turn them the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.200 
them but then when you turn them the
other<00:00:57.840> direction<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:59.100> think<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.609> can<00:00:59.760> see<00:01:00.030> that

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
other direction I think you can see that

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.510 
other direction I think you can see that
the<00:01:00.359> Sigma<00:01:00.870> one<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.590> little<00:01:01.980> more<00:01:02.129> thick

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
the Sigma one is a little more thick

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.889 
the Sigma one is a little more thick
with<00:01:02.730> bristles<00:01:03.149> it's<00:01:03.329> just<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.570> little<00:01:03.719> bit

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
with bristles it's just a little bit

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.509 
with bristles it's just a little bit
more<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.199> fat<00:01:04.470> brush<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.129> guess<00:01:05.309> you'd<00:01:05.489> say

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
more of a fat brush I guess you'd say

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.880 
more of a fat brush I guess you'd say
and<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.360> could<00:01:06.570> definitely<00:01:06.659> see<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.770> know

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
and I could definitely see that you know

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.500 
and I could definitely see that you know
as<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.189> look<00:01:08.220> at<00:01:08.549> them<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:09.000> front<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.299> me<00:01:09.479> right

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
as I look at them in front of me right

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.870 
as I look at them in front of me right
here<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.170> when<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.380> use<00:01:10.650> this<00:01:10.890> Sigma<00:01:11.340> brush<00:01:11.580> you

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
here so when I use this Sigma brush you

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.340 
here so when I use this Sigma brush you
know<00:01:12.000> whether<00:01:12.180> it's<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.540> under<00:01:12.780> eye<00:01:12.810> or

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
know whether it's the under eye or

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.230 
know whether it's the under eye or
wherever<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:14.040> might<00:01:14.159> be<00:01:14.369> on<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.640> face<00:01:14.880> it

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
wherever it might be on the face it

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.570 
wherever it might be on the face it
covers<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> little<00:01:15.900> more<00:01:16.200> surface<00:01:16.680> area<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.400> if

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
covers a little more surface area so if

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.999 
covers a little more surface area so if
you<00:01:17.700> like<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.360> kind<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.110> stipple<00:01:19.500> over

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
you like to kind of stipple over

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.820 
you like to kind of stipple over
concealer<00:01:20.460> which<00:01:21.000> i<00:01:21.210> think<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:22.080> method<00:01:22.619> that

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
concealer which i think is a method that

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.890 
concealer which i think is a method that
can<00:01:22.890> result<00:01:23.490> in<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.729> best<00:01:24.090> coverage<00:01:24.750> from

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
can result in the best coverage from

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.330 
can result in the best coverage from
that<00:01:24.990> concealer<00:01:25.560> because<00:01:25.680> you're<00:01:25.890> not<00:01:26.040> really

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
that concealer because you're not really

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.460 
that concealer because you're not really
like<00:01:26.759> blending<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.450> away<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.900> think<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.200> brush

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
like blending it away I think a brush

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.590 
like blending it away I think a brush
like<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:28.979> works<00:01:29.280> really<00:01:29.579> well<00:01:29.970> because<00:01:30.270> you

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
like this works really well because you

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.929 
like this works really well because you
can<00:01:30.780> pat<00:01:31.049> over<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.979> still<00:01:32.400> not<00:01:32.430> end<00:01:32.790> up

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
can pat over it and still not end up

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.660 
can pat over it and still not end up
with<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.150> streaky<00:01:33.810> looking<00:01:34.110> application<00:01:34.860> when

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
with a streaky looking application when

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.429 
with a streaky looking application when
I've<00:01:35.820> tried<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.360> kind<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.659> method<00:01:36.900> with<00:01:37.200> this

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
I've tried that kind of method with this

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.310 
I've tried that kind of method with this
brush<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:38.729> thin<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.780> don't<00:01:40.110> think

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
brush it is so thin that I don't think

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.889 
brush it is so thin that I don't think
it<00:01:40.439> does<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.680> as<00:01:41.130> effectively<00:01:41.850> now<00:01:42.450> because

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
it does that as effectively now because

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.050 
it does that as effectively now because
it's<00:01:43.110> cut<00:01:43.380> at<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.649> angle<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.369> mean<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.729> angle

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
it's cut at the angle I mean that angle

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.300 
it's cut at the angle I mean that angle
is<00:01:45.210> really<00:01:45.720> helpful<00:01:46.229> for<00:01:46.259> getting<00:01:46.829> right<00:01:47.100> in

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
is really helpful for getting right in

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.160 
is really helpful for getting right in
here<00:01:47.579> around<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.970> inner<00:01:48.119> part<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.630> eye<00:01:48.659> I

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
here around the inner part of the eye I

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.679 
here around the inner part of the eye I
also<00:01:49.680> in<00:01:50.130> my<00:01:50.310> application<00:01:50.460> found<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.360> very

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
also in my application found it very

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.139 
also in my application found it very
easy<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.140> get<00:01:52.380> right<00:01:52.740> up<00:01:52.770> under<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.700> eye<00:01:53.729> as

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
easy to get right up under the eye as

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.120 
easy to get right up under the eye as
well<00:01:54.390> very<00:01:54.570> close<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.229> lash<00:01:55.439> line<00:01:55.470> in<00:01:56.070> my

creamy kinds that come in pots as well
it's<00:02:04.590> just<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.860> thinner<00:02:05.130> more<00:02:05.399> precise<00:02:05.880> brush

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
it's just a thinner more precise brush

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.169 
it's just a thinner more precise brush
than<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.630> p84<00:02:07.380> or<00:02:07.770> say<00:02:08.069> any<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.399> those<00:02:08.610> sigma

precision type brushes but personally i

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.760 
precision type brushes but personally i
just<00:02:11.970> don't<00:02:12.239> think<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.569> does<00:02:12.720> quite<00:02:13.080> as<00:02:13.290> good

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
just don't think it does quite as good

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.710 
just don't think it does quite as good
job<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.190> blending<00:02:14.610> in<00:02:14.730> concealer<00:02:15.270> as<00:02:15.480> those

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
other brushes that I mentioned like I

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.550 
other brushes that I mentioned like I
said<00:02:17.310> precise<00:02:17.970> areas<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:18.750> really<00:02:18.780> works<00:02:19.260> well

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
said precise areas it really works well

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.830 
said precise areas it really works well
but<00:02:19.890> I<00:02:20.100> can<00:02:20.310> still<00:02:20.640> get<00:02:20.880> in<00:02:21.120> pretty<00:02:21.510> much<00:02:21.690> as

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
but I can still get in pretty much as

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.980 
but I can still get in pretty much as
close<00:02:22.110> as<00:02:22.320> I<00:02:22.440> would<00:02:22.500> need<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:23.130> with<00:02:23.700> this<00:02:24.630> brush

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
close as I would need to with this brush

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.970 
close as I would need to with this brush
the<00:02:25.260> p80

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
the p80

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.070 
the p80
I<00:02:26.160> could<00:02:26.370> also<00:02:26.580> see<00:02:26.910> this<00:02:27.060> being<00:02:27.450> good<00:02:27.780> if<00:02:27.960> you

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
I could also see this being good if you

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.870 
I could also see this being good if you
wanted<00:02:28.350> to<00:02:28.500> like<00:02:28.650> contour<00:02:29.190> down<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.550> sides<00:02:29.760> of

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
wanted to like contour down the sides of

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.610 
wanted to like contour down the sides of
your<00:02:29.940> nose<00:02:30.270> I<00:02:30.540> don't<00:02:30.600> do<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.110> whole<00:02:31.350> lot

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
your nose I don't do that a whole lot

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.130 
your nose I don't do that a whole lot
but<00:02:32.010> I<00:02:32.070> mean<00:02:32.370> just<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.760> size<00:02:33.090> of<00:02:33.450> this<00:02:33.690> seems

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
but I mean just the size of this seems

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.810 
but I mean just the size of this seems
like<00:02:34.230> it<00:02:34.530> could<00:02:34.770> be<00:02:34.950> good<00:02:35.160> in<00:02:35.370> that<00:02:35.550> way

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
like it could be good in that way

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.670 
like it could be good in that way
overall<00:02:36.480> I<00:02:36.510> don't<00:02:36.660> see<00:02:37.020> it<00:02:37.110> as<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.260> must-have

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
overall I don't see it as a must-have

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.650 
overall I don't see it as a must-have
brush<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.430> know<00:02:38.550> it's<00:02:38.700> not<00:02:38.820> going<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.180> replace

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
brush you know it's not going to replace

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.110 
brush you know it's not going to replace
other<00:02:40.200> brushes<00:02:40.620> that<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:41.010> like<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.490> use<00:02:41.730> in<00:02:41.940> that

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
other brushes that I like to use in that

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.120 
other brushes that I like to use in that
way<00:02:42.360> only<00:02:42.630> wise<00:02:42.990> it's<00:02:43.230> every<00:02:43.530> bit<00:02:43.680> as<00:02:43.740> good<00:02:44.070> as

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
way only wise it's every bit as good as

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.010 
way only wise it's every bit as good as
the<00:02:44.340> other<00:02:44.610> Real<00:02:44.850> Techniques<00:02:45.090> brushes<00:02:45.630> that<00:02:45.960> I

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.840 
have you know from their regular line I
think<00:02:48.270> it's<00:02:48.540> plenty<00:02:49.200> soft<00:02:49.620> it<00:02:50.040> cleans<00:02:50.580> up

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
think it's plenty soft it cleans up

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.480 
think it's plenty soft it cleans up
easily<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:51.720> don't<00:02:51.930> notice<00:02:52.140> any<00:02:52.490> discrepancies

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
easily I don't notice any discrepancies

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.430 
easily I don't notice any discrepancies
like<00:02:53.790> with<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.240> bristles<00:02:54.480> like<00:02:54.900> some<00:02:55.170> coming

like with the bristles like some coming

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.500 
like with the bristles like some coming
out<00:02:55.530> longer<00:02:55.830> than<00:02:55.980> others<00:02:56.520> or<00:02:56.820> anything<00:02:57.300> and

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
out longer than others or anything and

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.060 
out longer than others or anything and
just<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.720> whole<00:02:57.840> construction<00:02:58.410> of<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:58.800> seems

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
just the whole construction of it seems

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.800 
just the whole construction of it seems
nice<00:02:59.370> for<00:02:59.700> me<00:02:59.820> it's<00:02:59.970> just<00:03:00.030> more<00:03:00.390> about<00:03:00.480> this

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
nice for me it's just more about this
