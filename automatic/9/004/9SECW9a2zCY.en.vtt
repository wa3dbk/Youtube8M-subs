 exactly who would be with so many special would be just for the World Cup too 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.970
 Special price around 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.330
 to endure the walls they are so worried about doing 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.720
 that costs us x award single usually costs for to 9 90 + shipping + 4 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.570
 Percent found 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.479

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.590
 The CRF Institute is pretty steep when you go to the TV 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.930
 Beverage next to has already appeared so a bit so Dr

 Exactly so many people otherwise buy Klaus for free 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.450
 to still cheaper than a bouquet of flowers and frater better effect 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.900
 and around 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.940
 yes so percent is just the game of money, people just pay it more 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.039
 as just normal beer 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:55.870

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.969
 well, almost six months online 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:12.290
 In any case, there are enough 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.430
 Geneva's genre variety of enough hear events and so on

 when companies Kettering companies custom that companies 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.720

 So turnover is currently around 50 50 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.549
 Turnover of the season with figures in the sights of the investors clearly canceled 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.679

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.459
 Drinks divisions to go 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.139
 she first worked at Locarno ever say so what a configurator 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:18.469
 is something you can do now in the more recent freshman computer science 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:19.459
 make 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.369
 she was part of celebration 

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:25.809
 So we did that with umpteen super guys Makoto space 

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:27.989
 Coburg Robert Veres Berlin 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.809
 and then back in the field is rector free space 

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:33.809
 Unzen cooperation with Norman or its shipping company 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.599
 which I know very well here who today simply demanded a move because 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.890
 they made the DEG accidents and us5 rice that we can afford 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:42.439
 come up to bend this 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:46.589
 Rabat yes, our brother does not bring me unfortunately also already tried 

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:48.410
 percent for this 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.119
 percent 

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:53.759
 sometimes the one or the other beer jumps on it okay who okay 

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:58.309
 he came to Wieseck CW, he should be backround and spicy this whole as 

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:01.249
 Bebbi had a bit of a taste for the malaise 

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:04.529
 So to be honest, that's just the idea of ​​the Mass 

00:04:04.529 --> 00:04:06.059
 Customization 

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:10.369
 about 1 German that of course the front we thought we would take with you 

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:13.069
 Beer in the future should also have other drinks 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:14.109
 the son stood 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:18.410
 in one of the founders and also in the ICE so initial idea to Bet of oil 

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:22.999
 the trained brewer as Dan Brown honors the APANI® who studies 

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:26.309
 and has scored twelve points for not only there only around Robert Enke 

00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:29.349
 The business model has just been developed at the University of Bern together 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:31.939
 and the graduation thesis of the university about it written so the business plan 

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:37.110
 constantly coming out of the online 10 with the 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.370
 together they implemented and realized 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.880
 what's on it but he himself in the hand what's in it is not what is in the direction 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:44.770
 Werster is in it 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.500
 First of all, that is premium Pilsener and Hellas export beer there are two 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.219
 Roads now take care of Radel moment 

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:54.510
 that of the small castle especially Bavaria and thus around 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.930
 We especially have mosquitoes Thomé doing quite well with beer here 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.300
 Now he's back on since he's done intensive tours and he's got everything 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.930
 You also have to be aware of a good and well in advance we decided 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.069
 because just the effect 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:12.969
 Percent of what after waking up just happened to say nothing 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:16.869
 so that people again mistake so seldom in super form if we are not up 

00:05:16.869 --> 00:05:17.870
 destiny but 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.430
 on the small form of a Hallervorden 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.310
 so the Romand he set the set premium as he has the last of the team 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.310
 Markus Nipkow 

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:32.249
 to pull those perpetrators 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:36.240
 Barroso and renewed he is problematic when this becomes 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:46.180
 well 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.360
 King showed Schönherr unsubscribe Kranig 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.169
 Losses off more so beats 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:54.599
 according to the green bottle 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:55.719
 logical 

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:57.710
 he is buying something 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.430
 really buy 18 euros and 6 3 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.270
 tortured individual round that is much too expensive for me, so as far as it goes 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.159
 He left open percent of the guests with it 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:08.830
 also the water 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.749
 Can you do that tomorrow? 

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:13.379
 when he hears from the school the case 

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:14.860
 and how much they look 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.159
 not good for that yes » 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:19.849
 Olpe in Zanzibar thank you and lsc that hide 

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:23.529
 his teaching 

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:26.529
 both Peter proves the example Schmidt buy so 

00:06:28.869 --> 00:06:31.869
 in our sense for the Finma the house surrounds six but on 

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:36.369
 I want to tell you six on it so the margin is about 50 

00:06:36.369 --> 00:06:37.039
 percent 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:39.360
 not quite handsome 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.310
 Well Baumann I would say has noticed there are worse jobs percent like 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.139
 test now for the debut in the middle was selling in which this 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:48.139
 year 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:53.310
 so we want to percent this year so our sales figures continue to increase 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.659
 Doubling monthly for that until now 

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:59.069
 we want a new round of beverage division new elections we want 

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:02.150
 Probably into the champagne bar unlikely a schnapps division 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.899
 it worked for Conergy 

00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:08.569
 I can not quite talk to customers about numbers, though 

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:13.289
 that is already percent so a good double-digit range per day 

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:14.349
 orders 

00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:18.169
 and we also have times where which had to three-digit orders application 

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:20.839
 to be able to practice Valentine's Day and so on 

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:24.279
 where we even sold 15 thousand bottles in one week 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.849
 Everything was already good and is suprised that Mistress the art market 

00:07:27.849 --> 00:07:28.550
 are 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.229
 and percent for the expectations of other divisions 

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:34.020
 so call for much success APA thank you beautiful and great
