00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.840 

so<00:01:47.500> what<00:01:47.650> I'm<00:01:47.740> going<00:01:47.860> to<00:01:47.920> do<00:01:48.010> in<00:01:48.160> this<00:01:48.280> video<00:01:48.430> is

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
so what I'm going to do in this video is

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.370 
so what I'm going to do in this video is
I'm<00:01:49.330> going<00:01:49.480> to<00:01:49.540> show<00:01:49.720> you<00:01:49.750> a<00:01:49.930> little<00:01:50.140> easier

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
I'm going to show you a little easier

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.740 
I'm going to show you a little easier
way<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:51.070> make<00:01:51.520> some<00:01:51.850> of<00:01:51.970> these<00:01:52.060> wooden<00:01:52.330> pulleys

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
way to make some of these wooden pulleys

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.300 
way to make some of these wooden pulleys
if<00:01:52.900> you've<00:01:53.050> seen<00:01:53.290> my<00:01:53.500> other<00:01:53.530> video<00:01:53.950> showing

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
if you've seen my other video showing

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.430 
if you've seen my other video showing
the<00:01:54.460> the<00:01:55.270> wooden<00:01:55.540> pulley<00:01:55.750> and<00:01:56.050> you'll<00:01:56.200> see

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
the the wooden pulley and you'll see

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.120 
the the wooden pulley and you'll see
that<00:01:56.620> spinning<00:01:57.160> quite<00:01:57.310> a<00:01:57.370> bit<00:01:57.550> slower<00:01:57.820> now<00:01:57.970> so

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
that spinning quite a bit slower now so

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.740 
that spinning quite a bit slower now so
see<00:02:00.130> my<00:02:00.310> mark<00:02:00.580> there<00:02:00.850> so<00:02:00.880> it's<00:02:01.210> been<00:02:01.420> in<00:02:01.540> less

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
see my mark there so it's been in less

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.360 
see my mark there so it's been in less
than<00:02:01.990> weight<00:02:02.410> so<00:02:02.710> here's<00:02:02.890> a<00:02:02.950> little<00:02:03.220> better

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
than weight so here's a little better

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.860 
than weight so here's a little better
look<00:02:03.610> at<00:02:03.730> this<00:02:03.850> thing<00:02:03.910> now<00:02:04.300> that<00:02:04.330> I've<00:02:04.570> got<00:02:04.750> it

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
look at this thing now that I've got it

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.000 
look at this thing now that I've got it
together<00:02:04.990> so<00:02:05.470> I<00:02:06.750> got<00:02:07.750> like<00:02:07.990> I<00:02:08.020> said<00:02:08.260> I<00:02:08.290> shorten

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.010 
together so I got like I said I shorten

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:10.350 
together so I got like I said I shorten
things<00:02:09.130> up<00:02:09.369> here<00:02:09.550> now<00:02:09.760> I've<00:02:09.940> got<00:02:10.060> a<00:02:10.090> nice

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
things up here now I've got a nice

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.440 
things up here now I've got a nice
little<00:02:10.540> base<00:02:10.810> geared<00:02:11.230> up<00:02:11.410> here<00:02:11.650> on<00:02:11.890> it<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:13.270> you

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
little base geared up here on it and you

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.360 
little base geared up here on it and you
can<00:02:13.630> see<00:02:13.810> that<00:02:14.200> I<00:02:14.470> took<00:02:14.710> it<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:15.010> step<00:02:15.160> further

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
can see that I took it a step further

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.150 
can see that I took it a step further
and<00:02:15.700> I<00:02:15.790> also<00:02:16.000> edit<00:02:16.510> my<00:02:16.720> dis<00:02:17.500> sander<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.070> the

and I also edit my dis sander to the
side<00:02:18.340> of<00:02:18.520> this<00:02:18.580> thing<00:02:18.790> I<00:02:18.910> didn't<00:02:19.150> think<00:02:19.390> there

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
side of this thing I didn't think there

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.200 
side of this thing I didn't think there
was<00:02:19.660> much<00:02:19.720> need<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:20.580> having<00:02:21.580> two<00:02:21.790> separate

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
was much need and having two separate

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.600 
was much need and having two separate
machines<00:02:22.660> hey<00:02:23.230> folks<00:02:23.470> welcome<00:02:23.650> back<00:02:23.860> so<00:02:24.310> I've
