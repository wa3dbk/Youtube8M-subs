00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.880 

there<00:01:23.420> are<00:01:23.630> a<00:01:23.660> bunch<00:01:23.870> of<00:01:24.050> different<00:01:24.110> types<00:01:24.650> of

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
there are a bunch of different types of

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.630 
there are a bunch of different types of
resins<00:01:25.520> I<00:01:25.700> like<00:01:25.940> using<00:01:26.300> a<00:01:26.510> one-to-one<00:01:27.080> I<00:01:27.640> think

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
resins I like using a one-to-one I think

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.590 
resins I like using a one-to-one I think
that's<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:29.030> easiest<00:01:30.640> okay<00:01:31.640> so<00:01:31.910> now<00:01:32.090> you<00:01:32.150> got

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600

bit<00:01:37.160> of<00:01:37.610> this<00:01:37.820> that<00:01:38.810> goes<00:01:39.020> off<00:01:39.290> the<00:01:39.530> colorant

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.380 

they<00:01:45.110> all<00:01:45.290> recognize<00:01:45.890> that<00:01:45.920> you<00:01:46.340> can<00:01:46.550> use<00:01:46.730> and

I'm going to mix that up and waiting
bottle<00:02:18.710> of<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:19.930> epoxy<00:02:20.930> lasts<00:02:21.560> a<00:02:21.800> really<00:02:22.220> long

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
bottle of the epoxy lasts a really long

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.060 
bottle of the epoxy lasts a really long
time<00:02:22.970> if<00:02:23.150> you<00:02:23.180> see<00:02:23.540> these<00:02:23.870> little<00:02:24.710> glasses

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
go ahead and fill those up - I like this

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:24.750 
go ahead and fill those up - I like this
that<00:03:12.670> some<00:03:13.000> of<00:03:13.120> these<00:03:13.209> so<00:03:15.420> ice<00:03:16.420> cubes<00:03:23.760> this

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
that some of these so ice cubes this

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.520 
that some of these so ice cubes this
gives<00:03:25.090> a<00:03:25.209> little<00:03:25.480> more<00:03:25.660> of<00:03:25.750> that<00:03:25.780> realistic

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
gives a little more of that realistic

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:34.199 
gives a little more of that realistic
touch<00:03:32.519> and<00:03:33.519> that's<00:03:33.730> it

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
touch and that's it

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.400 
touch and that's it
um<00:03:34.360> that<00:03:35.140> takes<00:03:35.440> about<00:03:35.560> 24<00:03:36.280> hours<00:03:36.459> to<00:03:36.670> harden

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
um that takes about 24 hours to harden

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.890 
um that takes about 24 hours to harden
so<00:03:39.150> put<00:03:40.150> it<00:03:40.269> somewhere<00:03:40.480> where<00:03:40.720> you're<00:03:40.840> not
