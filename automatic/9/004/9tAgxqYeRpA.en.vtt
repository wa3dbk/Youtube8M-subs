00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 and it was all right with you is making a 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.230
 different video make a video there about 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:13.049
 the processors and computers there 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:15.950
 wanting you will use which will be 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.950
 the best 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:27.090
 setting up the computer 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:32.820
 nowadays for games if in the edition of 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:35.790
 video or even by addressing the 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.020
 matter referring to processors 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.770
 beauty 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.170
 Let's get the first doubt that you 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.879
 will have there in relation to the processors 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.980
 it will be which brand you will choose 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.260
 because there are two brands there that have 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.800
 markets that I think you already know 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.730
 sound amd and intel spoke the following about 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:00.320
 these brands there amd better 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:05.850
 cost-effective providers 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.560
 cost-effective intel performance better 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.610
 performance with intel but you will 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.490
 pay more 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.030
 there is now talking to you which there 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.830
 are the processor threads there 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.950
 certain brands and for which it would 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:24.060
 use and such processor is starting 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.890
 Amd is talking to us there. 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.439
 processors have to talk about sockets 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:34.229
 that only they are the support of 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:37.250
 processors each generation the generation of 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:42.150
 processors each model and was 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:48.960
 designed to operate such a support by 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:51.210
 example the emeief m2 or m2 and m3 one 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.799
 example of a socket and fall in love with 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.439
 you are now one of the amd the fmi 2 is 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:02.040
 you see that he has the tires there 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:05.520
 where do you put the processor i speak 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:09.030
 for you too that the providers of 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.250
 md he has course rapping his tires 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.390
 its the direct in the intel processor 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.460
 that already comes in a 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.310
 directly on the motherboard the 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:22.209
 processors developed there for the 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.890
 socket type it well in conjunction with 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.890
 your processor is well advised 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.290
 graphic accelerator 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.300
 this processor is most recommended for 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.040
 people who did not go there had not 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.250
 with your video card 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.020
 Then you end up buying your processor. 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:43.150
 with the integrated graphics processor in it 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:49.120
 an example there is the amd 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:56.769
 the dash x 45 800 falls a priest runs with 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:03:04.600
 a rate of 4 megs and she has 117 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:09.190
 graphic is a radeon rd hd 7660 b that 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:12.330
 has directx 11 support and even a clock 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.330
 of 800 win says 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.070
 you can see in the chart here a good 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.079
 performance with stop and the plates 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:24.750
 dedicated to getting up close and 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.750
 top of some boards it 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:35.900
 now no output there on the socket 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:45.290
 am3 socket am3 is the successor of the kit 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:04:02.620
 m2 plus the socket is compatible and 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:04:18.620
 the idea is tron ​​2 234 phenom ii x6 is the 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:47.660
 the newest line and ea and fex - are 32 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:05:01.360
 nanometer the best it currently has 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:05:01.360
 the eight cores some surpasses the 5 2 and 4 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:19.490
 a big difference from the 8124 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:22.510
 you are buying from this level and you 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:27.560
 can forget to look at your motherboard 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:33.500
 if it has normal power design the tpb is 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:37.370
 compatible with processor is 81 and 83 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.810
 51 tp of 125 watts 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.090
 it means that only because the mother has to 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.810
 have such a power 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.810
 or superior
