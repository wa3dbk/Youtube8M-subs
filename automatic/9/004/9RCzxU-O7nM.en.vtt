00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.560
 he imagines that leaving his house he 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:08.660
 find a deep hole in the 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.299
 land disappearing part of the sector 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.430
 that's how south inhabitants are today 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:15.469
 from china that this past September and is 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.190
 the found with about 20 holes 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.190
 of this type 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.629
 the neighbors of the province yunnan today 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:45.429
 they fear for their lives and that is 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.719
 any time you can swallow them 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:48.719
 earth literally 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.680
 the mystery of the holes that appear 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.330
 mysteriously in china according to the 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.460
 government would look the excessive and 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.440
 reckless mining work that is done 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.120
 in the vicinity and what today would be 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.520
 causing damage to the system 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.380
 groundwater however in others 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.280
 countries has also happened this 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.280
 unfortunate fact 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.630
 in June of the year 2010 in new city of 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.940
 guatemala a building disappeared 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.950
 three floors completely after the 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.280
 ground would look and form a hole 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.710
 30 meters deep and really 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:41.420
 they were lying down with that what 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:43.700
 rain when it felt like shivering 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.619
 to the wires of the light they went away and you see 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.619
 well and something like that would have solved 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.650
 more precarious because it's the news that 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.650
 it came out last night 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.050
 noted the others are chickens products 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.790
 could open time to zealand 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.560
 Ã¡lvarez he said that they were like 13 days 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.330
 the exact directions 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.560
 that is to live 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.690
 researchers concluded that everything 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.239
 owed the agatha storm that he suffered for 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.190
 those days the Guatemalans doing that 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.489
 the rocks will disappear with the water 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.489
 underground 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.410
 another particular case lived a lady 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.120
 Guatemalan 65 years old when 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.220
 when waking up by the sound of a 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.230
 explosion realized that under his bed 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.480
 a 12 meter hole had formed 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.480
 deep and without explanation 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.160
 these strange events that have occurred 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.020
 more often understands and 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.120
 Guatemala has also been present 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.490
 in other countries but to a lesser extent 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.060
 reaching sucking cars and even 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.060
 people 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.020
 experts say that in Chile it is very 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.850
 unlikely to happen these 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.650
 however, situations have occurred 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.290
 few cases in the cordilleran sector 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.600
 of the country as for example in the reservoir 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.260
 the plaster that has suffered from its soil 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.260
 these craters 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.300
 could these strange holes be work 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.400
 the human being or are we so fragile that 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.530
 We are naturally exposed to be 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.959
 swallowed by the earth draw their 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.959
 conclusions below is tomorrow
