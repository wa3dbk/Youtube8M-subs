00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.220
 do not 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.050
 as is the current scenario be 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.810
 a game does not sell enough or 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.070
 they receive a lot of criticism it is possible that 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.920
 much of the workers of the 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.490
 responsible developer studio can 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.029
 get to lose your job something that 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.330
 unfortunately we are seeing 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.920
 too much of a time to this part 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.050
 let's hope this does not happen to city 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.140
 interactive responsible for the games 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.570
 sniper ghost warrior whose second 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.790
 delivery has just premiered without 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.920
 too successful being a game that 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.940
 directly recommend for 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.470
 rent it a couple of days at the most 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.149
 direct continuation of the previous one this 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.550
 that occupies us not only suffers from the 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.410
 defects of the first ghost warrior but 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.210
 also it falls far short of what 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.910
 we could expect so much in his 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.910
 playability as in its graphic section 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.079
 supported by the cry engine 3.0 the offer 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.720
 that is offered to us in the individual mode 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.240
 it is not going to fulfill different missions of 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.180
 a good duration but vapid and 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.800
 lack of tension we will be displacing 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.350
 towards the goals that are going away 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.070
 checking in order to complete the missions 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.380
 but no story is presented 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.510
 look for high places or places in 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.210
 that the thickness camouflages us and cover us 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.979
 between rocks or parts of buildings is 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.050
 the best option to present our 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.210
 rifle in order to shoot more 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.130
 accurate to hold your breath 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.840
 pressing the stick also gives us some 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.810
 seconds to fine tune our 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.250
 marksmanship there are elements of the environment that 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.530
 they allow us to draw the attention of 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.330
 enemies so that they change of route thus 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.570
 as destructible elements that we 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.740
 will be more effective in our progress 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.780
 the interest that could have enhanced 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.670
 this delivery is to find the 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.649
 most striking ways to kill the 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.970
 enemies we liked that we could 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.039
 kill two birds with one stone 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.590
 shooting at a grenade that one of the 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.149
 enemies carry in the belt or do 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.160
 burst gasoline deposits of 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.750
 vehicles but they are actions that we 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.970
 come almost proposed by the own 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.820
 game as if we are forced to perform 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.920
 this or that action, noting the lack of 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.040
 freedom and possibility of initiative that 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.390
 queen in the game the situation gets worse 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.760
 when we see that the mechanics of 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.160
 missions is quite repetitive in its 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.989
 concept the possibilities that we are 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.760
 offer to advance are not always so 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.799
 open as you would expect 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.170
 start the game in most 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:32.689
 Sometimes we will base our progress on 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.849
 trial and error this becomes patent 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:36.980
 when we notice excessive times that 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.290
 our advance depends on here enemy 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.420
 let's eliminate first then not always in the 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.180
 enemy artificial intelligence results 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.129
 logic we can kill an enemy that 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.799
 be close to others and these are not 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:51.490
 Immute or instead shoot a very 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.860
 far and raise the alarms 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.480
 this kind of games offer different 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.880
 possibilities to the player at the time of 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.800
 choose from where to attack be flush 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.350
 floor be it from high points be 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.210
 attacking stealthily with the knife or 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.840
 trying to pass the most unnoticed 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.640
 possible using our camouflage something 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.920
 that only seems to draw this delivery in 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.560
 certain moments with very 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.330
 closed there are these options in addition 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.980
 we found bottlenecks in the 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.980
 yes or yes you have to eliminate the 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.800
 enemies that will wait to be killed if 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.780
 we hide quickly just by coming 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.510
 for us if we are detected at 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.040
 maximum or it is completely like the 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.860
 red circle that surrounds the mapping 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.810
 lower left so we have 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.760
 could feel it becomes difficult for the 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.500
 game catch as much as to keep the 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.390
 attention to the player during 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.940
 approximately 8 hours that can last 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.610
 we the main mode the section 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.190
 graphic does not stand out at all 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.950
 use of the cry engine 3.0 seems not to be 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.870
 well treated in this proposal the three 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.670
 crisis stars for consoles have 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.610
 used this graphic engine offering us 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.270
 an impeccable visual aspect with wide 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.000
 scenarios of 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.520
 beauty and detail in stripper ghost 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.800
 warrior 2 is just the opposite is like 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.020
 have a ferrari or a maserati and 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.240
 drive them less than 30 kilometers 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.830
 time in case we have not had enough 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.020
 with the main mode we have a 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.660
 multiplayer with a single mode and several 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.340
 maps killing the rivals at a distance is 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.650
 everything it offers by presenting a 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.160
 boring and insufficient multiplayer 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.750
 as to put hours is curious that 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.670
 the day he laments up hyper ghost 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.180
 warrior 2 is released the game version 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.890
 of the year of the great sniper elite v2 the 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.540
 excellent game of rebellion that we 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.060
 led to World War II in 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.950
 the skin of a sniper having 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.690
 analyzed both titles and although it is not 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.730
 usual in us we assure you that 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.500
 invest is much better money if you 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.620
 do with the game version of the year of 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:51.030
 sniper elite v2 not with that hyper 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.030
 ghost warrior 2
