joke or anything going to work on your
copy<00:00:50.190> too<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:51.530> it's<00:00:52.530> dead<00:00:52.800> ops<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.430> i<00:00:53.460> don't

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
copy too and it's dead ops so i don't

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.130 
copy too and it's dead ops so i don't
even<00:00:53.789> know<00:00:53.910> how<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.149> initiate<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.809> dead<00:00:54.960> ops

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
even know how to initiate the dead ops

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.900 
even know how to initiate the dead ops
game<00:00:55.379> i<00:00:55.559> think<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.890> might<00:00:56.010> be<00:00:56.070> time<00:00:56.160> based<00:00:56.699> on

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
game i think it might be time based on

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.369 
game i think it might be time based on
mashing<00:00:57.270> every<00:00:57.480> button<00:00:57.690> here<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.050> i<00:00:58.170> can't

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
mashing every button here and i can't

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.869 
mashing every button here and i can't
tell<00:00:58.590> any<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.829> them<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.010> actually<00:00:59.399> do<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.699> i

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
tell any of them that actually do it i

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.610 
tell any of them that actually do it i
think<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.570> guy<00:01:00.690> goes<00:01:00.899> back<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.289> forth<00:01:01.320> across

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
think the guy goes back and forth across

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.460 
think the guy goes back and forth across
the<00:01:01.800> screen<00:01:02.160> twice<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.820> here<00:01:03.510> we<00:01:03.629> are<00:01:03.840> dead
