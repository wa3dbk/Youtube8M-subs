isn't<00:05:01.530> a<00:05:01.620> shooting<00:05:01.979> we're<00:05:02.190> not<00:05:02.460> even<00:05:09.350> married

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
isn't a shooting we're not even married

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.590 
isn't a shooting we're not even married
anymore<00:05:10.740> and<00:05:11.220> now<00:05:11.550> thousands<00:05:12.419> they're
