00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.730
 time for another new fpv monitor and 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.259
 a hefty this time the view worldpay 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.169
 1432 10 point 1 inch 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:29.699
 fpv monitor with built-in 85 i geerts 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.199
 diversity receiver 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.759
 as usual we go first 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.800
 see what's in the package 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.780
 and that is of course the monitor itself 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.839
 and what immediately stands out 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.400
 great for a fpv monitor but yes what 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:42.089
 expect you with a team point 1 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.089
 inch display 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:47.100
 the whole thing is 28 centimeters wide 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.739
 16 centimeters high and two points 8 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.449
 centimeters thick and weighs a nice 700 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.100
 and 66 grams 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.720
 the manual is in english and offers 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.699
 a table with the channel layout of the 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.470
 built-in receiver that also 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.290
 on the back of the monitor itself 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.360
 handy then we have a fabric here 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.949
 lens hood to control sunlight from the display 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.439
 to learn that with Velcro on the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.939
 monitor must be fixed and in 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.189
 this compartment of the package 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.009
 we find the lipo battery for it 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.020
 screen 22 100 million per two cells 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.540
 pack with thereby discharging plug 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.409
 in the monitor but there is no balance 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.210
 plug 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.560
 so how are the two cells then 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.810
 balanced 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.400
 that's a good question here in everyone 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.230
 the Velcro straps on the monitor 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.230
 to paste for use with the lens hood 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.600
 and two mounting syringes a 12 volt 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.360
 500 million per drawer for the monitor 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.630
 with round dc plug and clickable european 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.729
 plug and finally 2 5 point 8 gigahertz 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.010
 linear polarized rubber duck that 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.630
 antennas you could use wouldn't it 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.430
 do because there is with circular 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.320
 polarized antennas or good ones 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.870
 directional antenna of course a lot bigger 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.700
 to reach the monitor 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.560
 use the screw on the battery cover 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.270
 and the lipo can be placed 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.330
 plug in the connectors in the 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.860
 monitor and the club can be put back on 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.990
 if we take the protective film off the screen 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.710
 get us a nasty surprise 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.049
 to wait 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.479
 it is namely a glossy screen like 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.760
 in gigantic reflective how to imagine 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.500
 so you have to get out most in it 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.000
 sunlight and you also need something 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.120
 can see on the screen 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.400
 the resolution is 1024 by 600 pixels and 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.319
 the brightness is with 500 candlestick 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.680
 high but come on 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.909
 it's just like a mirror 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.400
 we just have to see how that is 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:28.540
 all of them will soon look below 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.000
 on the screen we have in any case 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.920
 a lot of buttons to the video input 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.900
 to open the menu 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.879
 choose the channel including one 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.709
 auto search function is present and 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:41.980
 on the right a second menu for the dvr 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:44.409
 functionality because you can use the pvr 1032 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.719
 app so sweet air through the built-in dvr 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:48.400
 Recording function on the recorder 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:50.650
 right side a tripod screw opening 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.359
 to mount the screen vertically and 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.090
 a micro sd memory card slot for 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:57.220
 tickets up to 32 gigabytes where the dvr 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.230
 recorder images are saved on 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.790
 the ticket is not included on the 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.129
 left also a tripod screw hole 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.780
 for vertical mounting and here you see the 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.340
 cut-outs for the Velcro fasteners 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.180
 you need to fix the sun visor 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.519
 make on the back and speaker 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.419
 and for this rca composite connections 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:19.209
 video out and video and audio in the pvr 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:21.639
 1032 also has an HDMI import 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:24.310
 and mini usb connection for firmware 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:26.079
 updates and this is the dc connection 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.340
 the lipo battery in the screen 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.989
 load 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.329
 the bottom of the third tripod screw hole 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.239
 for normal horizontal mounting and 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:36.010
 on top are 240 rps him connections 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.500
 because the monitor therefore has a diversity ' 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.240
 recipient has 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.250
 the monitor switches on with the power switch 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.510
 on the back and the screen 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.250
 light up 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.050
 At the top right you will briefly see the current one 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.240
 battery status and now it's an issue 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.980
 choose the correct video input 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.530
 you do this with the source button with the 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.740
 channels video in analogue 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.570
 rf that is the 85 i geerts receiver 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.570
 The DVR has the four included 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.610
 to view images and via HDMI 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.410
 you can therefore connect to a connected HDMI device 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.170
 in good quality images on the 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.989
 pvda viewing 32 or even him like 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.420
 use an external computer monitor 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.980
 the fell worldpay 1432 has two 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.570
 built-in minute 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.370
 the first is a simple one and is primarily 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.950
 to display the image 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.810
 looks a bit like a television 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.460
 the second menu is for the dvr 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.980
 and therefore only accessible in the DVR 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.260
 display with option specific to your DVR 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.090
 recording as a resolution 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.770
 looping did voice but also it 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.390
 formatting the micro sd 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.150
 date and time for the files 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:38.130
 recording quality et cetera 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.990
 the 22 100 million per must walked 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.890
 leave the screen non-stop for about two hours 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.210
 to work 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.450
 charging is therefore via the supplied 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.340
 adapter and charging takes a long time 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.140
 really plan should proceed quickly with the 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.880
 500 million per charger 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.950
 But you can take the screen for five hours 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.570
 leave it hanging on the socket 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.000
 the red light is on while charging 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.620
 and goes out when it's ready and how 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.820
 the two-cell pack exactly 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.650
 balanced 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.970
 it may therefore take so long 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.810
 there is still a balance bridge on the 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.070
 battery 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.440
 we still want to go that for a while 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.940
 inquiring thereby fell world 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.550
 for you , we at least want to 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.860
 know how the pvr 1032 behaves like 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.810
 85 driven by first the f those four 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.550
 monitor we place a circular 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.800
 polarized spw 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.600
 and and 7 turn spiral antenna and take 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.590
 the very glossy screen 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.600
 outwards 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.550
 see if he with 500 candlestick without 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.650
 Lens hood clear enough to top 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.360
 reflection come true 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.120
 well and that is not entirely true 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.800
 unexpectedly against it is first 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.930
 of course very cool for such a large real 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.210
 who can keep your screen on your channel 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.350
 as you see mirror mirror on 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.240
 the wall 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.409
 the image is almost invisible 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.629
 single side 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:47.580
 no seriously, we simply understand 

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:49.769
 not how the manufacturer of a 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.989
 fp4 screen that you say pretty well 

00:05:49.769 --> 00:05:54.059
 unwise outside where the say 

00:05:51.989 --> 00:05:55.949
 but it is daylight in your head 

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:57.029
 around such a thing with a highland screen 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:58.439
 to rest 

00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:00.330
 no that 's suffering flat really 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:01.709
 absolutely wrong 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.599
 but the sun canopy is of course good 

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:05.699
 also for good reason and as you see 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:07.649
 it gets a lot better with that 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:09.209
 yet the screen remains very reflective and 

00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:12.869
 is the screen with the lens hood real 

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:14.249
 only visible from the front right 

00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:16.229
 as we said, there is a bee 

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:18.659
 versity receiver in the monitor but 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:21.089
 our good antennas despite the range 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:23.999
 falls against the wheel starts quite quickly 

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:26.969
 to disturb you are watching a tvr recording 

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:29.639
 from eg 1432 and at a height of 100 meters 

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:31.529
 flying past the 350 meters is far 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.339
 so much lessons almost nothing can 

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:34.769
 see 

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:36.389
 for info on this same flight spot with 

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:38.129
 same fpv channel 

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:40.619
 yourself the antennas and everything on the same 

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:42.869
 channel we have about fp4 with our sky 

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:45.319
 monitor a range of more than 17 100 

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:45.319
 meter achieved 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:53.720
 No this can not such a lot of them 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.670
 Yes 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:59.600
 what remains about the fact that this one 

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:00.410
 view worldpay 1432 around 300 to 350 euros 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.600
 costs 

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.070
 well we leave it up to you or 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.030
 you the screen worth that amount 

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.770
 find 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:09.470
 small tip you can probably do 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.850
 spend better 

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:13.550
 keep us informed through our
