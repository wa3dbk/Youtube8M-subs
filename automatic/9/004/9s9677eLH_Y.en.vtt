00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.220
 hi friends how were we one in this 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.910
 occasion is I bring a small video 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:17.120
 about the seven points or seven things 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.100
 you do not know the apple watch good what 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:23.180
 only we know about the apple watch up 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.820
 now is that it will cost $ 300 49 that 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.180
 will come out in 2015 that will have its own 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.520
 store and others but good 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.770
 it's really quite father has 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.590
 I really like it, I look forward to it 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.199
 I loved the watch and now you 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.510
 I bring seven points that perhaps or what 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.640
 better do not know about this new 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.800
 device that has presented us support 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.629
 of September 9 and well the first 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.719
 point is that we can not submerge it 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.249
 water this means that if it rains 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:56.030
 we sweat or wash our hands 

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:58.370
 the watch will hold up perfectly but 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.309
 if we get some pool some 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.800
 pool if we want to bathe with him 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.990
 well, we'll take a 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.320
 unpleasant surprise for him to discover 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.690
 that our watch is not against water 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.680
 first generation of apple watch 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.660
 that is not submersible we also have in 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.540
 point number 2 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.090
 that will have two sizes two possible 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.920
 sizes will have availability of 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:32.130
 sizes one of 1.7 inches and one of 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.470
 1.5 inches was reading a little bit and 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.710
 the 1.5 inches recommend it more for 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.680
 women the 1 forgiveness 1.5 inches for 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.020
 1.7 inch women for men already 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.640
 what can you do a little bigger looks 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.380
 more in the hand of a good man doll 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.810
 of a man and do a little more 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.670
 small looks better on the wrist of a 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:57.900
 good woman also this new watch goes 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:01.620
 to be 100% adaptable for lefties or that 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.840
 we will be able to adapt it either to the 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.580
 left or right to be able 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.190
 occupy with the left hand or to 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.370
 to be able to occupy it with the right hand where 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.230
 better fits you and we're also going to 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.030
 find the applications as they 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.850
 I commented a while ago 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.240
 the apple watch will have its own 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.700
 application store and its own sdk 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.740
 the sdk is the program occupied by 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.590
 developers to be able to schedule 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:32.190
 applications whether for iphone for 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.250
 ipod for ipod touch for mac and now it's going 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.130
 to be for the good apple watch is going to 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.130
 have your own store and wait 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.160
 that it becomes one of the most 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.580
 large market we also find 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.280
 as point number 4 that the edition of 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:55.560
 gold in the purest style of a jewelry 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:58.980
 that we will have an 18 carat edition 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.920
 that's why the rest of the packaged 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.769
 devices has to be at the height 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.800
 of a more typical product of a jewelry 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.200
 than from an electronics store in this 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.569
 Watch version will come with a very box 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.209
 stylized that hides a connector 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.290
 lightning in the back and also 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.780
 inside 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.030
 we have the magnetic connector for the 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.640
 Battery recharge Dad 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:27.350
 in such a way that when placing the watch 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:31.140
 on it will be upright 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:34.500
 we will also find ping my iphone 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.840
 if we leave our iphone somewhere 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.910
 of the house and we are not able to 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.850
 find it that has happened to me a lot 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.100
 sometimes believe it then good simply in 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.880
 our clock will play the ping function 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:50.760
 my iphone and the clock will see where the 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.530
 clock the phone will start ringing 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.989
 you find it ok 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.310
 logically this has to be 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.800
 connected in an america in the same 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.300
 wifi network or in a connection because I do not know 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.600
 how they are to handle guess 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:06.660
 bluetooth and 3g nfc still do not know 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.480
 many specifications of this future 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.160
 to watch that because we are good that we 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.350
 may surprise but the safest thing is 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.510
 to connect via bluetooth ok and 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.950
 good and also for wifi and obviously already 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.169
 being at home you can connect it via 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.109
 wifi because you are going to have your own store 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:24.690
 that you have to have it 100% insured and 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.570
 well finally we will find a 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.070
 speaker and a microphone once 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.140
 things that I liked most in the 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.330
 presentation of the upper watch is that 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.660
 It has speaker and microphone of 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.090
 this way we can invoke like this we can 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.070
 receive calls we can answer 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.950
 calls from the clock without checking out 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:46.230
 our iphone can write messages 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.330
 with our voice and good we can write 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.150
 I believe that even notes of quest or 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.060
 when in the voice I already wait then 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.930
 not to be wrong I would have no limits 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.880
 just wait for new applications 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.620
 for the apple watch and see how much 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.390
 we can do with it that I think the 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.700
 better a future jailbreak with the apple 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.200
 but watch for that not to be seen 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.840
 then we will have to wait until the 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.370
 2015 to be able to have it to see if 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.350
 can do the jailbreak to see what 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.730
 So much can be done with this watch as well 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.140
 what a good friend listening and if he takes his 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.640
