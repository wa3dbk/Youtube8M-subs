00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.539 
a problem because when you have a
casement<00:01:37.530> window<00:01:37.799> even<00:01:37.920> if<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.220> keep<00:01:38.400> it

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
casement window even if you keep it

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.670 
casement window even if you keep it
cracked<00:01:38.850> open<00:01:39.060> just<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.479> little<00:01:39.509> bit<00:01:39.720> Todd<00:01:40.049> that

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
cracked open just a little bit Todd that

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.679 
cracked open just a little bit Todd that
rain<00:01:40.950> can<00:01:41.250> can<00:01:41.549> come<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:41.880> from<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.150> side<00:01:42.329> and

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
rain can can come in from the side and

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.480 
rain can can come in from the side and
then<00:01:42.990> hit<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.290> furniture<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.950> floor<00:01:44.220> I

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
then hit the furniture in the floor I

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.340 
then hit the furniture in the floor I
know<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.909> was<00:01:45.060> an<00:01:45.180> issue<00:01:45.329> yeah<00:01:45.750> also<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
know that was an issue yeah also the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.249 
know that was an issue yeah also the
Amana<00:01:46.590> sauna<00:01:46.890> right<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.850> isn't<00:01:48.240> it's<00:01:48.990> only<00:01:49.170> a

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
Amana sauna right this isn't it's only a

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.139 
Amana sauna right this isn't it's only a
10<00:01:49.560> year<00:01:49.770> old<00:01:49.799> window<00:01:50.280> but<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.579> doesn't<00:01:50.909> have

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
10 year old window but it doesn't have

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.149 
10 year old window but it doesn't have
city<00:01:51.479> art<00:01:51.780> glass<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.710> doesn't<00:01:53.009> block

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
city art glass in it so it doesn't block

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.760 
city art glass in it so it doesn't block
any<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.610> UV<00:01:53.970> rays<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:54.869> bleaches<00:01:55.380> out<00:01:55.530> their

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
any to UV rays so bleaches out their

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.800 
any to UV rays so bleaches out their
furniture<00:01:56.070> quickly<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:57.180> one<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.570> things

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
furniture quickly so one of the things

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.510 
furniture quickly so one of the things
that<00:01:57.990> they<00:01:58.110> wanted<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.500> do<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.770> shorten<00:01:59.219> that

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
that they wanted to do is shorten that

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.569 
that they wanted to do is shorten that
window<00:01:59.969> they<00:02:00.630> wanted<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.140> put<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.770> more<00:02:02.130> modern

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
window they wanted to put a more modern

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.609 
window they wanted to put a more modern
window<00:02:03.360> technology<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.229> would<00:02:04.380> block

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
window technology and that would block

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.440 
window technology and that would block
that<00:02:04.890> UV<00:02:05.280> rays<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.939> would<00:02:06.090> preserve

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
that UV rays so that would preserve

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.690 
that UV rays so that would preserve
their<00:02:06.719> expensive<00:02:07.290> furniture<00:02:07.619> in<00:02:08.069> also

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
their expensive furniture in also

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.380 
their expensive furniture in also
talking<00:02:08.910> about<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.360> window<00:02:09.599> technology

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
talking about the window technology

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.809 
talking about the window technology
Todd<00:02:10.539> with<00:02:11.080> tall<00:02:11.290> windows<00:02:11.710> like<00:02:12.010> this<00:02:12.040> one<00:02:12.700> of

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
Todd with tall windows like this one of

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.400 
Todd with tall windows like this one of
the<00:02:12.910> things<00:02:13.120> that<00:02:13.390> you<00:02:13.540> have<00:02:13.690> to<00:02:13.840> consider<00:02:14.170> is

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
the things that you have to consider is

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.530 
the things that you have to consider is
tempered<00:02:14.860> glass<00:02:15.090> because<00:02:16.090> when<00:02:16.270> you<00:02:16.390> have<00:02:16.510> a

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
tempered glass because when you have a

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.690 
tempered glass because when you have a
window<00:02:16.780> glass<00:02:17.470> that<00:02:17.800> gets<00:02:17.950> real<00:02:18.280> low<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.490> the

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
window glass that gets real low to the

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.160 
window glass that gets real low to the
floor<00:02:18.910> I<00:02:18.940> mean<00:02:19.150> it's<00:02:19.300> a<00:02:19.360> hazard<00:02:19.780> isn't<00:02:20.110> it

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
floor I mean it's a hazard isn't it

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.900 
floor I mean it's a hazard isn't it
right<00:02:20.410> you<00:02:20.860> know<00:02:20.980> if<00:02:21.220> anybody<00:02:21.459> Falls

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
right you know if anybody Falls

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.970 
right you know if anybody Falls
particularly<00:02:22.660> if<00:02:22.870> you<00:02:23.110> have<00:02:23.260> little<00:02:23.410> children

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
particularly if you have little children

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.590 
particularly if you have little children
in<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:24.160> house<00:02:24.310> and<00:02:24.580> they're<00:02:25.030> playing<00:02:25.360> around

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
in the house and they're playing around

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.630 
in the house and they're playing around
and<00:02:25.930> someone<00:02:26.440> would<00:02:26.590> fall<00:02:26.800> bumped<00:02:27.250> into<00:02:27.370> that

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
and someone would fall bumped into that

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.010 
and someone would fall bumped into that
glass<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:27.970> it<00:02:28.360> breaks

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
glass and it breaks

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.199 
glass and it breaks
I<00:02:29.050> mean<00:02:29.500> shards<00:02:30.010> can<00:02:30.190> fall<00:02:30.459> down<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:30.970> really

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
I mean shards can fall down and really

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.090 
I mean shards can fall down and really
injure<00:02:31.540> somebody<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:32.110> sometimes<00:02:32.500> maybe<00:02:32.770> even

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
injure somebody and sometimes maybe even

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.070 
injure somebody and sometimes maybe even
they<00:02:33.220> can<00:02:33.370> be<00:02:33.459> fatal<00:02:33.970> yeah<00:02:34.150> so<00:02:34.660> that's<00:02:34.780> why<00:02:35.020> the

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
they can be fatal yeah so that's why the

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.930 
they can be fatal yeah so that's why the
building<00:02:35.560> code<00:02:35.800> right<00:02:36.040> now<00:02:36.250> is<00:02:36.489> if<00:02:36.670> your

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
building code right now is if your

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.720 
building code right now is if your
windows<00:02:37.540> is<00:02:37.840> below<00:02:38.620> 18<00:02:39.160> inches<00:02:39.400> from<00:02:39.459> the

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
windows is below 18 inches from the

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.479 
windows is below 18 inches from the
floor<00:02:39.940> it<00:02:40.420> is<00:02:40.810> required<00:02:41.440> by<00:02:41.739> law<00:02:41.980> that<00:02:42.010> it<00:02:42.400> be

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
floor it is required by law that it be

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.640 
floor it is required by law that it be
tempered<00:02:42.880> glass<00:02:43.030> right<00:02:43.690> which<00:02:43.989> is<00:02:44.140> expensive

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
tempered glass right which is expensive

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.040 
tempered glass right which is expensive
it<00:02:44.830> is<00:02:44.860> it<00:02:45.190> really<00:02:45.489> is<00:02:45.610> so<00:02:45.790> one<00:02:46.209> of<00:02:46.300> the<00:02:46.390> options

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
it is it really is so one of the options

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.290 
it is it really is so one of the options
is<00:02:47.320> to<00:02:47.380> raise<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.280> window<00:02:48.580> up<00:02:48.700> so<00:02:48.850> you're

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
is to raise the window up so you're

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.080 
is to raise the window up so you're
above<00:02:49.780> that<00:02:50.050> 18<00:02:50.470> inch<00:02:50.650> threshold<00:02:51.220> you<00:02:51.820> don't

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
above that 18 inch threshold you don't

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.910 
above that 18 inch threshold you don't
have<00:02:52.269> to<00:02:52.390> put<00:02:52.570> a<00:02:52.600> tempered<00:02:52.989> glass<00:02:53.019> in<00:02:53.500> and<00:02:53.680> you

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
have to put a tempered glass in and you

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.380 
have to put a tempered glass in and you
can<00:02:54.100> use<00:02:54.280> those<00:02:54.459> savings<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:54.970> help<00:02:55.000> offset

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
can use those savings to help offset

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.920 
can use those savings to help offset
that<00:02:55.959> the<00:02:56.410> cost<00:02:56.650> of<00:02:57.300> altering<00:02:58.300> the<00:02:58.390> opening<00:02:58.810> to

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
that the cost of altering the opening to

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.509 
that the cost of altering the opening to
get<00:02:59.050> the<00:02:59.560> other<00:02:59.709> benefits<00:03:00.220> that<00:03:00.340> you're

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
get the other benefits that you're

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.520 
get the other benefits that you're
looking<00:03:00.850> for<00:03:01.060> absolutely<00:03:01.690> so<00:03:01.810> so<00:03:02.019> let's<00:03:02.290> talk

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
looking for absolutely so so let's talk

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.770 
looking for absolutely so so let's talk
a<00:03:02.560> little<00:03:02.709> bit<00:03:02.980> about<00:03:03.010> their<00:03:03.970> reasoning

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
a little bit about their reasoning

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.479 
a little bit about their reasoning
behind<00:03:04.989> choosing<00:03:05.470> to<00:03:05.920> put<00:03:06.040> double-hung

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
behind choosing to put double-hung

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.640 
behind choosing to put double-hung
windows<00:03:06.880> in<00:03:07.060> here<00:03:07.300> rather<00:03:07.780> than<00:03:08.110> having<00:03:08.350> two

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650
