for<00:02:18.010> about<00:02:18.040> 15<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.090> 20<00:02:19.360> minutes<00:02:19.630> so<00:02:19.780> let's<00:02:19.959> take

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
for about 15 to 20 minutes so let's take

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.410 
for about 15 to 20 minutes so let's take
a<00:02:20.170> look<00:02:20.470> here<00:02:20.620> and<00:02:20.740> see<00:02:20.830> what<00:02:21.130> it<00:02:21.250> looks<00:02:22.240> like

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
a look here and see what it looks like

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.270 
a look here and see what it looks like
now<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:25.000> looks<00:02:25.180> a<00:02:25.270> lot<00:02:25.420> better<00:02:25.690> now<00:02:26.040> nice<00:02:27.040> and

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
now it looks a lot better now nice and

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.990 
now it looks a lot better now nice and
black<00:02:27.459> again<00:02:28.410> later<00:02:29.410> on<00:02:29.650> when<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:30.400> pot<00:02:30.610> cools

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
black again later on when the pot cools

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.479 
black again later on when the pot cools
you<00:02:31.450> could<00:02:31.660> put<00:02:32.320> another<00:02:32.440> layer<00:02:32.890> of<00:02:32.950> the

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
you could put another layer of the

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.780 
you could put another layer of the
season<00:02:34.420> er<00:02:34.480> on<00:02:34.630> it<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:34.959> run<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:35.950> again<00:02:36.220> you<00:02:36.760> can

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
season er on it and run it again you can

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.729 
season er on it and run it again you can
keep<00:02:37.060> doing<00:02:37.360> this<00:02:37.510> until<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:38.020> pot<00:02:38.230> reaches

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
keep doing this until the pot reaches

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.150 
keep doing this until the pot reaches
the<00:02:39.010> color<00:02:39.190> you<00:02:39.370> like<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:41.500> next<00:02:41.739> step<00:02:41.890> is<00:02:42.040> to

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
the color you like the next step is to

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.479 
the color you like the next step is to
take<00:02:42.310> a<00:02:42.370> spray<00:02:42.850> oil<00:02:42.880> like<00:02:43.360> this<00:02:43.800> kind<00:02:44.800> of<00:02:44.890> hit

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
take a spray oil like this kind of hit

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.479 
take a spray oil like this kind of hit
it<00:02:45.610> a<00:02:45.700> little<00:02:45.820> bit<00:02:46.150> and<00:02:46.590> then<00:02:47.590> rub<00:02:48.160> it<00:02:48.190> in<00:02:48.370> with

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
it a little bit and then rub it in with

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.449 
it a little bit and then rub it in with
a<00:02:48.520> rag<00:02:48.820> or<00:02:49.060> something<00:02:49.420> along<00:02:49.630> those<00:02:49.690> lines<00:02:50.459> the

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
a rag or something along those lines the

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.280 
a rag or something along those lines the
way<00:02:51.610> to<00:02:51.670> keep<00:02:51.940> your<00:02:52.120> Dutch<00:02:52.330> oven<00:02:52.360> from<00:02:52.930> getting

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
way to keep your Dutch oven from getting

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.960 
way to keep your Dutch oven from getting
rusted<00:02:53.709> in<00:02:53.800> the<00:02:53.860> first<00:02:54.130> place<00:02:54.400> is<00:02:54.610> to<00:02:54.640> take

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
rusted in the first place is to take

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.660 
rusted in the first place is to take
care<00:02:55.330> of<00:02:55.450> it<00:02:55.570> one<00:02:56.410> way<00:02:56.560> to<00:02:56.620> do<00:02:56.860> that<00:02:57.040> is<00:02:57.280> remove

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
care of it one way to do that is remove

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.640 
care of it one way to do that is remove
all<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.030> ash<00:02:58.540> when<00:02:59.140> you're<00:02:59.260> done<00:02:59.410> cooking

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
all the ash when you're done cooking

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.620 
all the ash when you're done cooking

caustic agent called lye it will cause

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.780 
caustic agent called lye it will cause
pitting<00:03:07.209> in<00:03:07.360> here<00:03:07.600> and<00:03:07.690> it<00:03:07.750> will<00:03:07.840> start<00:03:08.410> to

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
pitting in here and it will start to

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.060 
pitting in here and it will start to
cause<00:03:09.790> all<00:03:09.970> sorts<00:03:10.000> of<00:03:10.330> rust<00:03:10.769> another<00:03:11.769> thing

store your oven like that what will
happen<00:03:19.750> is<00:03:20.200> that<00:03:20.230> this<00:03:20.470> will<00:03:20.680> crack<00:03:20.890> the<00:03:21.040> lid

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
happen is that this will crack the lid

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.590 
happen is that this will crack the lid
just<00:03:21.430> enough<00:03:21.700> that<00:03:21.850> their<00:03:22.030> air<00:03:22.299> will

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600

implement of any kind it will last you
forever<00:03:38.220> but<00:03:39.220> probably<00:03:39.640> the<00:03:39.790> best<00:03:40.090> way<00:03:40.299> to

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
forever but probably the best way to
