00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.069
 humectant due to all this hair 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.079
 will be fed and enriched by the 

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:17.549
 honey 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:20.670
 we will need a fret to put everything 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.380
 this if you buy yours in the super 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.950
 Check on the label to be as 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.950
 natural possible 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.440
 but I bought this one that is like 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:34.520
 most natural possible super rustic and I put 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:37.820
 one tablespoon 12 tablespoons three 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.910
 tablespoons and finally four 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:45.640
 tablespoons and now for the oil of 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:48.880
 olive and let's put a 2 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.930
 and three tablespoons later you're going to start 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.180
 to stir all this super well 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.340
 until you have a puree as well as 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.200
 mean weird sexy 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.229
 I try that your hair does not have spray 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.630
 nigel or anything like that and uses a 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.369
 T-shirt that is not going to miss removes the 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.160
 two of your hair because they can be a 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:12.470
 little annoying once my hair 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.470
 because I feel that it absorbs everything better 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.120
 divide your hair as best you can accommodate 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.580
 to apply all this I'm going to use a 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.190
 brush to paint the hair and what 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.680
 I put in all my points and from there I 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.870
 I followed the rest of the hair 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.340
 avoid the area of ​​growth seeks 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.840
 pay extra attention to points 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.750
 because it 's the part of the hair that 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.210
 he needs more love and leaves the leather 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.360
 scalp for more at a time because no 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.820
 we want it to get greasy 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.510
 If you still have plenty of this, submerge 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:46.120
 your tips and if you still have a bit left 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.720
 of product where that now if in the 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.720
 scalp 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.640
 after this let rest for 20 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.409
 minimum minutes and ready once 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.930
 out of your hair you should feel 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:59.930
