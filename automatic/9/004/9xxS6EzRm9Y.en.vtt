Fiona: I’m an artist and what I do is landscapes
and marinescapes. I’m working really hard

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:23.220
to be an artist along the shoalhaven coast line.
I have two dogs, Winnie and Angel – we know

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:32.369
each other in and out, it’s like having
an extension of yourself actually. In 2012

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.370
I had my own business here in Mollymook and
I got home and I just thought I was tired,

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:46.410
and the dogs though started to behave really
strangely. Angel was like Tarzan gripped to my

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.630
side and Winnie was just very vocal and they
were just honing into one area, which was

00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:03.460
my stomach, my abdomen. It was that prompt
of them acting over the top, went to the GP

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:10.870
and just had a normal checkup and they found
out I had ovarian cancer.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.050
The thing about ovarian cancer, it’s really hard to detect
and usually when you're diagnosed it’s too

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.490
late, you’re a stage four. There’s something
about dogs and their relationship with people

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.010
and I’m living proof that they smell cancer.
I don’t think I’d be sitting here, well

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.110
I wouldn’t be sitting here today telling
you this story, I’d be dead actually, I

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.970
would have died of ovarian cancer. Then I
had to go to hospital, I was very ill after

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:46.720
the operation, and I had nine months of chemotherapy,
and it’s accumulative so I got sicker and

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:54.740
sicker and sicker. I was very fortunate because
you can fester and stay in bed, rightly so

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.130
because you need a lot of rest but you can get
incredibly lethargic but the joy of having

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.520
two animals who just love you and they take
your mind off it, it was just a blessing,

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:20.420
it was just wonderful. So what we’d do everyday,
we’d go to the beach and play ball and they would

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:29.170
get me motivated and get me up and going.
They were my life, my lifeline and

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.810
my therapy and when you’re down, just that
big big happy face and those big brown eyes

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.700
it gets you through a lot, especially when you
think you’re going to die, especially when

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:56.319
you’re thinking is this it, am I going to
go.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:07.800
I’m here, absolutely, the best friends ever. The story is, and the conclusion is
they saved my life. There is no way I

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.730
would be here, they are just my shadow and
my sunshine
