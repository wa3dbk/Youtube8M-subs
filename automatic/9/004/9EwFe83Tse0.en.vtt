00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
off of the goalkeeper I believe is

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.530 
off of the goalkeeper I believe is
called<00:00:12.900> kun<00:00:13.500> or<00:00:13.889> khooneh<00:00:14.400> will<00:00:15.000> call<00:00:15.179> him<00:00:15.330> come

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
called kun or khooneh will call him come

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.720 
called kun or khooneh will call him come
for<00:00:15.750> now<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.109> just<00:00:16.590> check<00:00:17.190> his<00:00:17.340> stats<00:00:17.550> out

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
for now and just check his stats out

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.279 
for now and just check his stats out
they<00:00:17.880> have<00:00:18.029> pretty<00:00:18.210> damn<00:00:18.510> amazing<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:19.020> speed

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
they have pretty damn amazing the speed

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.679 
they have pretty damn amazing the speed
is<00:00:19.470> quite<00:00:19.710> low<00:00:20.010> but<00:00:20.240> the<00:00:21.240> speed<00:00:21.510> on

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
is quite low but the speed on

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.779 
is quite low but the speed on
goalkeepers<00:00:22.289> are<00:00:22.410> generally<00:00:23.070> quite<00:00:23.220> low<00:00:23.519> so

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
goalkeepers are generally quite low so

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.580 
goalkeepers are generally quite low so
you<00:00:23.850> can<00:00:24.210> account<00:00:24.510> out<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:24.930> plus<00:00:25.230> he's<00:00:25.470> the

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
you can account out that plus he's the

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.920 
you can account out that plus he's the
only<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.490> only<00:00:26.609> South<00:00:26.849> African<00:00:27.330> keeper<00:00:27.689> so

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
only is the only South African keeper so

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.380 
only is the only South African keeper so

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
to be gold and the only one which is

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.540 
to be gold and the only one which is
pretty<00:00:30.570> decent<00:00:31.019> so<00:00:31.170> no<00:00:31.410> price<00:00:31.769> fixes<00:00:32.160> can<00:00:32.369> get

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.760 
milonga for now and yet eazy-e is
actually<00:01:00.780> three<00:01:01.020> star<00:01:01.230> skill<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:01.620> that's

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
actually three star skill so that's

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.100 
actually three star skill so that's
quite<00:01:01.920> strange<00:01:02.879> for<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.239> three<00:01:03.570> star<00:01:03.780> skill

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
quite strange for a three star skill

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
was probably demoted from a silver last

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.270 
was probably demoted from a silver last
last<00:01:21.030> game<00:01:21.650> so<00:01:22.650> yeah<00:01:22.799> you'll<00:01:22.950> be<00:01:23.009> able<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.220> pick

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
last game so yeah you'll be able to pick

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.460 
last game so yeah you'll be able to pick
him<00:01:23.430> up<00:01:23.490> for<00:01:23.640> about<00:01:23.729> 200<00:01:24.210> coins<00:01:24.360> move<00:01:25.200> on<00:01:25.320> to

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
him up for about 200 coins move on to

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.920 
him up for about 200 coins move on to
the<00:01:25.530> next<00:01:25.560> centre-back<00:01:26.360> khumalo<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.540> blue<00:01:27.780> vest

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
the next centre-back khumalo a blue vest

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.780 
the next centre-back khumalo a blue vest
khumalo<00:01:28.380> now<00:01:28.920> there<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.189> actually<00:01:29.520> quite<00:01:29.670> a

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
khumalo now there is actually quite a

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.240 
khumalo now there is actually quite a
small<00:01:30.299> amount<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.720> him<00:01:30.900> on<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.259> on<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.710> market

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
small amount of him on the on the market

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.460 
small amount of him on the on the market
so<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:33.030> get<00:01:33.180> him<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.509> perfect<00:01:33.900> formation<00:01:34.200> was

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
so to get him in perfect formation was

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.390 
so to get him in perfect formation was
harder<00:01:35.009> than<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.280> expected<00:01:35.460> but<00:01:37.009> we<00:01:38.009> still<00:01:38.189> got

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
harder than I expected but we still got

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.950 
harder than I expected but we still got
him<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.670> similar<00:01:38.970> formation<00:01:39.479> which<00:01:39.689> gives

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
him in a similar formation which gives

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.840 
him in a similar formation which gives
solo<00:01:40.259> better<00:01:40.500> chemistry<00:01:40.710> only<00:01:41.369> lost

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
solo better chemistry only lost

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.560 
solo better chemistry only lost
chemistry<00:01:42.390> from<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.170> 451<00:01:44.329> and<00:01:45.329> you'll<00:01:45.509> be

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
chemistry from the 451 and you'll be

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.600 
chemistry from the 451 and you'll be
able<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.780> pick<00:01:45.869> him<00:01:46.020> up<00:01:46.079> for<00:01:46.229> about<00:01:46.380> 650<00:01:47.369> cones

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
right backs in up for South Africa so I

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.120
