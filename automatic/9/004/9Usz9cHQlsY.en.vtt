I've got on got in all of my shoes they
are<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.620> really<00:02:47.489> really<00:02:47.700> good<00:02:47.940> run<00:02:48.800> quite

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
are a really really good run quite

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.759 
are a really really good run quite
smooth<00:02:50.190> however<00:02:50.850> if<00:02:51.150> you<00:02:51.540> are<00:02:52.019> running<00:02:52.440> on

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
smooth however if you are running on

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.180 
smooth however if you are running on
hard<00:02:53.549> surfaces<00:02:53.819> like<00:02:54.390> concrete<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:55.650> don't

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
hard surfaces like concrete I don't

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.680 
hard surfaces like concrete I don't
think<00:02:56.459> they're<00:02:56.640> actually<00:02:56.760> designed<00:02:57.360> for

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
think they're actually designed for

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.710 
think they're actually designed for
running<00:02:57.959> on<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.200> road<00:02:58.730> because<00:02:59.730> the<00:03:00.390> soul<00:03:00.660> is

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
running on the road because the soul is

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.809 
running on the road because the soul is
are<00:03:01.140> quite<00:03:01.500> soft<00:03:01.860> and<00:03:02.130> it's<00:03:02.970> only<00:03:03.180> taken<00:03:03.799> about

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
are quite soft and it's only taken about

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.120 
are quite soft and it's only taken about
I'd<00:03:05.819> say<00:03:05.940> less<00:03:06.569> than<00:03:06.600> three<00:03:06.989> months<00:03:07.140> to<00:03:07.620> start

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
I'd say less than three months to start

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.120 
I'd say less than three months to start
wearing<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.670> that<00:03:08.850> point<00:03:09.630> there<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.110> I<00:03:10.890> don't

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
wearing to that point there and I don't

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.660 
wearing to that point there and I don't
run<00:03:11.489> in<00:03:11.640> them<00:03:11.760> all<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.030> time<00:03:12.239> so<00:03:13.430> saying<00:03:14.430> that

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
run in them all the time so saying that

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.890 
run in them all the time so saying that
they<00:03:15.450> they<00:03:16.440> wear<00:03:16.709> up<00:03:16.980> quite<00:03:17.430> fast<00:03:17.730> so<00:03:18.329> you<00:03:18.390> have

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
they they wear up quite fast so you have

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.640 
they they wear up quite fast so you have
to<00:03:19.049> be<00:03:19.079> cloning<00:03:19.470> quite<00:03:19.980> a<00:03:20.010> little<00:03:20.579> bit<00:03:20.760> careful

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
to be cloning quite a little bit careful

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.759

they actually printing you because I got
them<00:04:50.850> just<00:04:51.090> after<00:04:51.510> I<00:04:51.750> stopped<00:04:52.820> riding<00:04:53.820> around

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
them just after I stopped riding around

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.600 
them just after I stopped riding around
on<00:04:54.270> the<00:04:54.360> skateboard<00:04:54.630> lot<00:04:55.160> and<00:04:56.840> size<00:04:57.840> twelves

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
on the skateboard lot and size twelves

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.910 
on the skateboard lot and size twelves
which<00:04:59.610> funny<00:05:00.570> enough<00:05:00.660> for<00:05:01.230> from<00:05:02.190> the<00:05:03.830> what<00:05:04.830> is

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
which funny enough for from the what is

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.420 
which funny enough for from the what is
it<00:05:04.950> the<00:05:05.240> all<00:05:06.240> the<00:05:06.480> different<00:05:06.780> shoe<00:05:06.930> sizes

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
it the all the different shoe sizes

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.470 
it the all the different shoe sizes
start<00:05:08.430> from<00:05:08.670> about<00:05:09.030> size<00:05:09.750> 10<00:05:10.910> all<00:05:11.910> the<00:05:12.150> way<00:05:12.270> up

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
start from about size 10 all the way up

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.990 
start from about size 10 all the way up
to<00:05:12.690> size<00:05:12.900> 12<00:05:13.200> so<00:05:13.590> I<00:05:13.620> guess<00:05:13.860> it<00:05:14.040> depends<00:05:14.370> on<00:05:14.640> the

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
to size 12 so I guess it depends on the

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.370 
to size 12 so I guess it depends on the
brand<00:05:15.330> that's<00:05:17.360> makes<00:05:18.360> them<00:05:18.600> to<00:05:18.810> the<00:05:19.169> size

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
brand that's makes them to the size

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.230 
brand that's makes them to the size
which<00:05:20.100> are<00:05:20.370> gives<00:05:20.610> you<00:05:20.700> a<00:05:20.760> good<00:05:20.970> thing<00:05:21.210> that
