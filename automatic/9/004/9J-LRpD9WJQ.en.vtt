one<00:01:52.710> was<00:01:52.860> actually<00:01:53.009> maxi<00:01:53.610> muscle<00:01:54.350> which<00:01:55.350> I

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
one was actually maxi muscle which I

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.359 
one was actually maxi muscle which I
gotta<00:01:56.159> say<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:57.530> would<00:01:58.530> actually<00:01:58.680> prefer<00:01:59.040> this

one actually ever maxi muscle I mean
Maxie<00:02:01.469> muscles<00:02:01.770> probably<00:02:02.070> one<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.250> the

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
Maxie muscles probably one of the

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.520 
Maxie muscles probably one of the
bestest<00:02:02.729> well<00:02:03.540> known<00:02:03.840> brand<00:02:04.140> when<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.320> comes

bestest well known brand when it comes
to<00:02:04.680> protein<00:02:04.890> shakes<00:02:05.310> but<00:02:05.579> I'd<00:02:06.509> say<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:06.990> is

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
to protein shakes but I'd say this is

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.300 
to protein shakes but I'd say this is
the<00:02:07.229> actual<00:02:07.439> best<00:02:08.369> protein<00:02:09.920> product<00:02:10.920> to

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
the actual best protein product to

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.940 
the actual best protein product to
actually<00:02:11.610> does<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.940> job

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
actually does the job

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.200 
actually does the job
maximuscle<00:02:13.950> thinking<00:02:14.400> that's<00:02:14.610> just<00:02:14.820> a<00:02:14.940> brand

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
mean in terms of the recovery process

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.290 
mean in terms of the recovery process
definitely<00:02:26.190> helps<00:02:26.400> i<00:02:26.520> mean<00:02:26.670> if<00:02:26.790> i'm<00:02:26.910> working

drink this off to each workout i'm

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.900 
drink this off to each workout i'm
actually<00:02:32.459> recovered<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:34.260> actually<00:02:34.730> have<00:02:35.730> an

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
actually recovered to actually have an

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.310 
actually recovered to actually have an
effective<00:02:36.330> workout<00:02:36.780> as<00:02:39.050> being<00:02:40.050> recovered

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
effective workout as being recovered

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.510 
effective workout as being recovered
from<00:02:40.620> actually<00:02:40.950> taking<00:02:41.340> this<00:02:43.340> that's<00:02:44.340> the

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
from actually taking this that's the

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.310 
from actually taking this that's the
actual<00:02:45.590> 24<00:02:46.590> grams<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:47.130> protein<00:02:47.750> 5.5<00:02:48.750> grams<00:02:49.080> of

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
actual 24 grams of protein 5.5 grams of

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.070 
actual 24 grams of protein 5.5 grams of
a<00:02:49.640> CWS<00:02:51.290> 4<00:02:52.290> grams<00:02:52.530> of<00:02:52.739> glutamine<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:54.080> about

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
a CWS 4 grams of glutamine and about

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.990 
a CWS 4 grams of glutamine and about
twenty<00:02:55.440> nine<00:02:55.590> servings<00:02:56.100> but<00:02:56.459> i'd<00:02:56.580> say<00:02:56.820> you'd

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
twenty nine servings but i'd say you'd

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.550 
twenty nine servings but i'd say you'd
actually<00:02:57.150> can<00:02:57.510> get<00:02:57.660> a<00:02:57.690> lot<00:02:57.959> more<00:02:57.989> so<00:02:58.500> many

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
actually can get a lot more so many

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:07.160 
actually can get a lot more so many
sodas<00:02:59.300> but<00:03:03.680> yep<00:03:04.680> so<00:03:05.340> far<00:03:05.670> so<00:03:06.480> good<00:03:06.510> I'll

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
sodas but yep so far so good I'll

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.770 
sodas but yep so far so good I'll
probably<00:03:07.790> stick<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:08.820> this<00:03:09.030> protein<00:03:09.450> from<00:03:09.570> now

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
probably stick to this protein from now

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.740 
probably stick to this protein from now
on<00:03:10.310> I'm<00:03:11.310> actually<00:03:11.610> picked<00:03:11.940> up<00:03:12.150> once<00:03:12.360> again<00:03:12.630> on

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
on I'm actually picked up once again on

know actually I don't know if they

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.410 
know actually I don't know if they
actually<00:03:16.290> still<00:03:16.739> do<00:03:16.890> but<00:03:17.670> it's<00:03:17.850> one<00:03:18.000> cost<00:03:18.239> me

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
actually still do but it's one cost me

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.900 
actually still do but it's one cost me
