on<00:00:14.490> reset<00:00:14.759> so<00:00:15.320> what<00:00:16.320> I<00:00:16.350> see<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.619> lot<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:16.830> people

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
on reset so what I see a lot of people

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.670 
on reset so what I see a lot of people
like<00:00:17.220> naturally<00:00:17.640> inclined<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.150> do<00:00:18.300> is<00:00:18.680> they

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
like naturally inclined to do is they

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.240 
like naturally inclined to do is they
will<00:00:19.920> queue<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.029> then<00:00:21.150> auto<00:00:21.920> if<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:23.039> think

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
will queue and then auto if you think

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.290 
will queue and then auto if you think
about<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.550> you're<00:00:23.640> kind<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.820> wasting<00:00:24.180> your

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
about it you're kind of wasting your

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.970 
about it you're kind of wasting your
auto<00:00:24.420> attack<00:00:24.689> hold<00:00:24.930> out<00:00:25.050> your<00:00:25.170> auto<00:00:25.439> tech<00:00:25.680> also

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
auto attack hold out your auto tech also

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:26.570 
auto attack hold out your auto tech also
has<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.160> cool-down

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
has a cool-down

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.189 
has a cool-down
that's<00:00:27.269> how<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.449> should<00:00:27.539> think<00:00:27.599> about<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:28.050> and

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
that's how you should think about it and

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.510 
that's how you should think about it and
you're<00:00:28.410> kind<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.619> not<00:00:29.609> utilizing<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.420> full

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
you're kind of not utilizing the full

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.280 
you're kind of not utilizing the full
rotation<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.700> your<00:00:32.910> auto<00:00:33.030> cooldown<00:00:33.510> by<00:00:34.110> not

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
rotation of your auto cooldown by not

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.160 
rotation of your auto cooldown by not
adding<00:00:34.469> first<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.670> like<00:00:35.910> it's<00:00:36.719> ways<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.079> me

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
adding first so like it's ways to me

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.770 
adding first so like it's ways to me
there<00:00:37.320> should<00:00:37.350> just<00:00:37.559> do<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.100> like<00:00:39.090> right<00:00:39.600> as

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
there should just do this like right as

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.020 
there should just do this like right as
Yoda<00:00:39.930> comes<00:00:40.230> out<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.890> queue<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.399> then<00:00:41.670> right

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
Yoda comes out you queue and then right

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.729 
Yoda comes out you queue and then right
after<00:00:42.180> your<00:00:42.420> queue<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.780> done<00:00:43.020> casting<00:00:43.379> you

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
after your queue is done casting you

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.150 
after your queue is done casting you
have<00:00:43.860> another<00:00:44.100> auto<00:00:45.440> um<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:46.829> that's<00:00:46.980> probably

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
have another auto um so that's probably

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.560 
have another auto um so that's probably
the<00:00:47.340> biggest<00:00:47.520> like<00:00:47.730> Rickey<00:00:47.940> mistake<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.390> see

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
the biggest like Rickey mistake I see

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.569 
the biggest like Rickey mistake I see
the<00:00:48.690> oceans<00:00:49.110> do<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.649> they'll<00:00:49.980> just<00:00:50.010> walk<00:00:50.340> up<00:00:50.520> to

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
the oceans do is they'll just walk up to

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.529 
the oceans do is they'll just walk up to
someone<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:50.879> OQ<00:00:51.390> first<00:00:51.719> like<00:00:52.379> always<00:00:52.649> do<00:00:53.160> this

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
someone and OQ first like always do this

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:55.700 
someone and OQ first like always do this
that<00:00:54.539> makes<00:00:54.690> way<00:00:54.870> more<00:00:54.899> sense<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.440> does<00:00:55.559> way

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
that makes way more sense it does way

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.990 
that makes way more sense it does way
more<00:00:55.739> damage<00:00:56.039> um<00:00:58.219> you<00:00:59.219> like<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.609> can<00:00:59.760> barely

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
more damage um you like you can barely

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.610 
more damage um you like you can barely
even<00:01:00.270> see<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.660> auto<00:01:00.899> attack<00:01:01.199> because<00:01:01.469> it's

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
even see the auto attack because it's

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.349 
even see the auto attack because it's
covered<00:01:01.829> up<00:01:02.070> by<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.280> cue<00:01:02.520> animation<00:01:02.940> but

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
covered up by the cue animation but

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.329 
covered up by the cue animation but
you'll<00:01:03.930> eventually<00:01:03.989> get<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.830> kind<00:01:05.280> of

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
you'll eventually get the kind of

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.780 
you'll eventually get the kind of
timings<00:01:05.729> down<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.869> can<00:01:07.640> do<00:01:08.640> that

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
timings down so that you can do that

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.920 
timings down so that you can do that
really<00:01:08.939> smoothly<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:10.049> yeah<00:01:10.710> just<00:01:11.040> don't<00:01:11.220> be

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
really smoothly and yeah just don't be

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.859 
really smoothly and yeah just don't be
so<00:01:12.930> quick<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.470> use<00:01:13.740> your<00:01:13.890> abilities<00:01:14.280> w<00:01:14.869> it's

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
so quick to use your abilities w it's

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.060 
so quick to use your abilities w it's
really<00:01:16.110> shitty<00:01:16.320> for<00:01:16.530> light<00:01:16.650> it's<00:01:16.799> actually

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
really shitty for light it's actually

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.100 
really shitty for light it's actually
just<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.540> think<00:01:18.540> it's<00:01:18.689> probably<00:01:18.930> his<00:01:19.020> worst

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
just I think it's probably his worst

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:27.050 
just I think it's probably his worst
ability<00:01:19.590> but<00:01:20.960> god<00:01:22.610> I'm<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:23.790> sick<00:01:24.030> um<00:01:24.950> okay<00:01:26.060> you

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
ability but god I'm so sick um okay you

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.390 
ability but god I'm so sick um okay you
can<00:01:27.299> use<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.659> in<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.840> lot<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:28.049> ways<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.590> first<00:01:29.220> way

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
can use it in a lot of ways so first way

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.289 
can use it in a lot of ways so first way
when<00:01:31.340> somebody<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.400> kind<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.579> far<00:01:32.759> away<00:01:34.100> people

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
when somebody is kind of far away people

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.149 
when somebody is kind of far away people
don't<00:01:36.299> really<00:01:36.689> buffer<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.200> into<00:01:37.470> E<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.979> should

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
don't really buffer it into E you should

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.800 
don't really buffer it into E you should
always<00:01:38.280> buffer<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.790> W<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.420> what<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.689> means

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
always buffer you W and what that means

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.770 
always buffer you W and what that means
is<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.560> hit<00:01:40.740> W<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.939> millisecond<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.630> can

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
is you hit W and the millisecond you can

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.260 
is you hit W and the millisecond you can
stand<00:01:42.960> way<00:01:43.350> farther<00:01:43.680> away<00:01:43.770> like<00:01:44.280> uh<00:01:44.670> probably

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
stand way farther away like uh probably

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.359 
stand way farther away like uh probably
if<00:01:45.450> you're<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.659> bridge<00:01:46.140> away<00:01:46.530> it's<00:01:47.250> like

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
if you're in a bridge away it's like

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.010 
if you're in a bridge away it's like
this<00:01:47.549> um<00:01:48.979> you<00:01:49.979> hit<00:01:50.100> W<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.670> then<00:01:51.020> one

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
this um you hit W and then one

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.380 
this um you hit W and then one
millisecond<00:01:52.799> after<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.159> hit<00:01:53.280> W<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:54.030> hit<00:01:54.210> E

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
millisecond after you hit W you hit E

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.530 
millisecond after you hit W you hit E
and<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.899> comes<00:01:55.110> out<00:01:55.229> like<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:56.579> line

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
and it comes out like this so that line

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.959 
and it comes out like this so that line
and<00:01:57.990> while<00:01:58.890> you're<00:01:59.070> sliding<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.520> buffer<00:01:59.850> in

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
and while you're sliding you buffer in

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.959 
and while you're sliding you buffer in
the<00:02:00.210> W<00:02:00.509> animation<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.340> what<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.490> does<00:02:02.700> is

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
the W animation and what that does is

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.780 
the W animation and what that does is
like<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.619> don't<00:02:04.619> know<00:02:04.740> W<00:02:05.070> is<00:02:05.130> really

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
like I don't know W is really

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.889 
like I don't know W is really
slow<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.210> it's<00:02:06.329> really<00:02:06.509> hard<00:02:06.750> like

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
slow and it's really hard like

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.479 
slow and it's really hard like
incorporated<00:02:07.619> it's<00:02:07.770> like<00:02:07.950> any<00:02:08.129> kind<00:02:08.369> of

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
incorporated it's like any kind of

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.180 
incorporated it's like any kind of
damaging<00:02:09.030> rotations<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:10.080> like<00:02:10.229> if<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.770> don't

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
damaging rotations so like if you don't

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.910 
damaging rotations so like if you don't
do<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.959> buffering<00:02:12.959> WT<00:02:13.590> if

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
do the buffering WT if

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.410 
do the buffering WT if
it<00:02:14.010> comes<00:02:14.190> out<00:02:14.340> like<00:02:14.430> this<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:14.880> it's

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
it comes out like this and it's

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.210 
it comes out like this and it's
slow<00:02:15.630> it's<00:02:15.930> like<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.590> just<00:02:16.770> takes<00:02:16.980> way<00:02:17.190> too

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
slow it's like it just takes way too

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.860 
slow it's like it just takes way too
long<00:02:17.459> I<00:02:17.940> think

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
long I think

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.440 
long I think
so<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.560> so<00:02:20.489> could<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:20.730> tell<00:02:20.880> us<00:02:20.940> again<00:02:21.270> like

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
so you so could you tell us again like

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.339 
so you so could you tell us again like
how<00:02:21.599> you<00:02:21.660> do<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:23.030> you<00:02:24.030> catch<00:02:24.420> w<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.140> new

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
how you do that you catch w and the new

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.080 
how you do that you catch w and the new
testing<00:02:25.830> so<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:27.140> you<00:02:28.140> tap<00:02:28.380> W<00:02:28.770> and<00:02:29.040> then<00:02:29.760> right

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
testing so you you tap W and then right

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.449 
testing so you you tap W and then right
after<00:02:30.330> you<00:02:30.690> tap<00:02:30.900> W<00:02:31.319> tap<00:02:31.560> heat<00:02:31.860> because<00:02:32.340> you

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
after you tap W tap heat because you

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.250 
after you tap W tap heat because you
can't<00:02:32.700> cast<00:02:33.000> any<00:02:33.209> abilities<00:02:33.630> while<00:02:33.870> you're<00:02:34.080> E

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
can't cast any abilities while you're E

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.260 
can't cast any abilities while you're E
but<00:02:34.650> you<00:02:34.770> can<00:02:34.980> cast<00:02:35.190> abilities<00:02:35.670> before<00:02:35.880> you

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
but you can cast abilities before you

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.270 
but you can cast abilities before you
start<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:36.840> E<00:02:37.160> and<00:02:39.050> W<00:02:40.050> has<00:02:40.380> a<00:02:40.410> cast<00:02:40.739> it's<00:02:41.040> got<00:02:41.250> a

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
start you E and W has a cast it's got a

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.890 
start you E and W has a cast it's got a
widen<00:02:41.670> up<00:02:41.790> where<00:02:41.970> like<00:02:42.120> he's<00:02:42.300> just<00:02:42.450> pointing

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
widen up where like he's just pointing

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.680 
widen up where like he's just pointing
his<00:02:42.989> gun<00:02:43.080> for<00:02:43.500> like<00:02:43.620> a<00:02:43.830> second<00:02:44.430> mm-hmm<00:02:45.000> that

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
his gun for like a second mm-hmm that

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.190 
his gun for like a second mm-hmm that
makes<00:02:45.870> sense

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
makes sense

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.140 
makes sense
so<00:02:46.470> like<00:02:46.620> while<00:02:46.860> you're<00:02:47.069> widening<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:47.880> up<00:02:48.000> with

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
so like while you're widening it up with

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.100 
so like while you're widening it up with
your<00:02:48.269> gun<00:02:48.480> you<00:02:48.900> start<00:02:49.170> your<00:02:49.290> slide<00:02:50.900> you<00:02:51.900> can't

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
your gun you start your slide you can't

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.190 
your gun you start your slide you can't
catch<00:02:52.319> it<00:02:52.620> while<00:02:52.920> you're<00:02:53.280> in<00:02:53.489> your<00:02:53.580> II<00:02:54.239> so<00:02:55.170> you

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
catch it while you're in your II so you

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.420 
catch it while you're in your II so you
just<00:02:55.590> have<00:02:55.739> to<00:02:55.860> catch<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.130> right<00:02:56.280> keyboard

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
just have to catch the right keyboard

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.460 
just have to catch the right keyboard
and<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.120> comes<00:02:57.299> out<00:02:57.390> like<00:02:57.510> that<00:02:57.569> and<00:02:57.900> then<00:02:58.410> you

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
and it comes out like that and then you

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.509 
and it comes out like that and then you
can<00:02:58.620> start<00:02:58.799> out<00:02:58.920> immediately

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
can start out immediately

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.520 
can start out immediately
although<00:03:00.420> otherwise<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:01.049> come<00:03:01.200> out<00:03:01.350> of<00:03:01.440> you

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
although otherwise you come out of you

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.170 
although otherwise you come out of you
II<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:01.950> you're<00:03:02.069> still<00:03:02.310> locked<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:02.880> then<00:03:03.090> you

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
II and you're still locked and then you

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.509 
II and you're still locked and then you
press<00:03:03.360> W<00:03:03.709> right<00:03:04.709> after<00:03:04.860> you're<00:03:04.950> done<00:03:05.069> sliding

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
press W right after you're done sliding

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.340 
press W right after you're done sliding
and<00:03:05.670> you're<00:03:05.880> locked<00:03:06.150> in<00:03:06.360> your<00:03:06.510> W<00:03:06.900> animation

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
and you're locked in your W animation

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.720 
and you're locked in your W animation
and<00:03:07.500> you<00:03:07.530> can't<00:03:07.769> auto<00:03:07.920> attack<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:08.459> can't<00:03:08.640> even

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
and you can't auto attack you can't even

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.370 
and you can't auto attack you can't even
like<00:03:08.880> use<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.299> W<00:03:09.569> because<00:03:09.810> it's<00:03:09.930> so

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
like use the W because it's so

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.220 
like use the W because it's so
slow<00:03:10.530> mmm<00:03:13.250> anyways<00:03:14.250> W<00:03:14.880> just<00:03:15.060> is<00:03:15.330> you<00:03:15.930> know<00:03:16.049> it's

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
slow mmm anyways W just is you know it's

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.630 
slow mmm anyways W just is you know it's
a<00:03:16.319> star-shaped<00:03:16.769> thing<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.190> then<00:03:17.280> when<00:03:17.430> I<00:03:17.459> hit

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
a star-shaped thing and then when I hit

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.220 
a star-shaped thing and then when I hit
you<00:03:17.819> it<00:03:18.000> gives<00:03:18.120> you<00:03:18.239> movement<00:03:18.420> speed<00:03:18.810> that's

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
you it gives you movement speed that's

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.650 
you it gives you movement speed that's
pretty<00:03:19.500> much<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:20.040> appeal<00:03:20.400> of<00:03:20.430> W<00:03:20.880> and<00:03:21.090> I'll

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
pretty much the appeal of W and I'll

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.210 
pretty much the appeal of W and I'll
show<00:03:21.810> you<00:03:21.870> how<00:03:21.989> you<00:03:22.049> can<00:03:22.230> better<00:03:22.560> use<00:03:22.829> W<00:03:25.220> pretty

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
show you how you can better use W pretty

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.250 
show you how you can better use W pretty
soon<00:03:26.430> so<00:03:26.970> before<00:03:27.480> that<00:03:27.510> I'm<00:03:27.780> just<00:03:27.959> gonna<00:03:28.049> go

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
soon so before that I'm just gonna go

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.890 
soon so before that I'm just gonna go
over<00:03:28.380> it<00:03:28.530> is<00:03:28.650> great<00:03:29.100> cuz<00:03:29.400> II<00:03:29.579> you<00:03:30.480> can<00:03:30.630> like<00:03:30.750> hit

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
over it is great cuz II you can like hit

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.620 
over it is great cuz II you can like hit
me<00:03:30.989> with<00:03:31.109> W<00:03:31.519> and<00:03:32.519> yeah<00:03:32.700> I<00:03:32.730> just<00:03:32.850> just<00:03:33.329> removed

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
me with W and yeah I just just removed

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.789 
me with W and yeah I just just removed
slows<00:03:33.959> it<00:03:35.120> it's<00:03:36.120> pretty<00:03:36.480> useful<00:03:36.660> I<00:03:37.049> think<00:03:37.470> is<00:03:37.620> I

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
slows it it's pretty useful I think is I

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.380 
slows it it's pretty useful I think is I
think<00:03:37.980> Izzy<00:03:38.190> is<00:03:38.430> really<00:03:38.670> good<00:03:38.850> because<00:03:38.940> not

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
think Izzy is really good because not

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.670 
think Izzy is really good because not
because<00:03:39.510> like<00:03:39.660> doesn't<00:03:40.170> anything<00:03:40.350> special

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
because like doesn't anything special

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.289 
because like doesn't anything special
because<00:03:40.859> removes<00:03:41.340> slows<00:03:41.609> you<00:03:41.790> can<00:03:41.910> use<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.060> term

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
because removes slows you can use a term

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:43.759 
because removes slows you can use a term
of<00:03:42.420> wither<00:03:42.630> which<00:03:42.930> is<00:03:43.109> really<00:03:43.350> important<00:03:43.709> and

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
of wither which is really important and

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.750 
of wither which is really important and
you<00:03:43.859> can<00:03:43.980> use<00:03:44.070> it<00:03:44.190> really<00:03:44.459> exhaust<00:03:46.700> but<00:03:47.700> the

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
you can use it really exhaust but the

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.310 
you can use it really exhaust but the
most<00:03:47.910> important<00:03:48.299> thing<00:03:48.390> about<00:03:48.480> Izzy's<00:03:48.810> I<00:03:48.930> just

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
most important thing about Izzy's I just

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.250
