00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849

rather<00:00:12.630> conveniently<00:00:13.290> from<00:00:13.469> Frostfire<00:00:13.980> Ridge

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
rather conveniently from Frostfire Ridge

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.460 
rather conveniently from Frostfire Ridge
in<00:00:14.519> fact<00:00:14.759> I'm<00:00:15.000> starting<00:00:15.690> off<00:00:15.809> this<00:00:15.990> clip<00:00:16.289> at

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
in fact I'm starting off this clip at

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.320 
in fact I'm starting off this clip at
Frostfire<00:00:17.070> Ridge<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.550> then<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.029> Alliance

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
Frostfire Ridge and then the Alliance

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.170 
Frostfire Ridge and then the Alliance
will<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.840> believe<00:00:19.320> somehow<00:00:19.890> make<00:00:20.250> them<00:00:20.640> make

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
will I believe somehow make them make

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.509 
will I believe somehow make them make
their<00:00:21.330> way<00:00:21.600> over<00:00:21.779> there<00:00:22.050> through<00:00:22.920> shadow<00:00:23.310> moon

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
their way over there through shadow moon

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.839 
their way over there through shadow moon
anyway<00:00:24.150> so<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.539> zone<00:00:24.689> itself<00:00:25.170> is<00:00:25.849> really

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
anyway so the zone itself is really

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.490 
anyway so the zone itself is really
interesting<00:00:27.269> actually<00:00:27.539> it's<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.810> mix<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.289> the

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
interesting actually it's a mix of the

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.620 
interesting actually it's a mix of the
Durotar<00:00:29.010> theme<00:00:29.369> with<00:00:29.730> all<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.060> sort<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.300> steam

style<00:00:33.300> things<00:00:33.630> but<00:00:34.380> then<00:00:34.559> it's<00:00:34.739> also<00:00:34.890> got<00:00:35.160> this

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
style things but then it's also got this

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.910 
style things but then it's also got this
really<00:00:35.670> lush<00:00:36.090> jungle<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.050> which<00:00:37.710> honestly

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
really lush jungle in it which honestly

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.440 
really lush jungle in it which honestly
reminds<00:00:38.550> me<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.820> some<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.180> parts<00:00:39.329> of

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
reminds me of some of the parts of

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.389 
reminds me of some of the parts of
shoulders<00:00:39.750> are<00:00:39.899> basin<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.530> really<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.010> nice<00:00:41.219> to

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
shoulders are basin it really is nice to

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.580 
shoulders are basin it really is nice to
have<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.700> there<00:00:41.910> though<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.120> think<00:00:42.660> it's<00:00:42.870> it's

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
have that there though I think it's it's

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.110 
have that there though I think it's it's
very<00:00:43.770> important<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.370> zones<00:00:44.640> got<00:00:44.910> some

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
very important that this zones got some

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.930 
very important that this zones got some
variation<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:45.870> its<00:00:46.050> in<00:00:46.559> its<00:00:46.620> visual<00:00:46.890> style<00:00:47.370> now

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
variation in its in its visual style now

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.069 
variation in its in its visual style now
it's<00:00:48.090> for<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.300> area<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.629> I'm<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.870> at<00:00:48.989> the

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
it's for this area that I'm in at the

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.170 
it's for this area that I'm in at the
minute<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.590> think<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.129> just<00:00:50.280> looks<00:00:50.520> amazing

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
minute I think it just looks amazing

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.020 
minute I think it just looks amazing
really<00:00:51.750> now<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.230> they've<00:00:52.710> got<00:00:53.190> better<00:00:53.550> at

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
really now that they've got better at

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.610 
really now that they've got better at
texturing<00:00:54.629> things<00:00:54.870> in<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.079> convincing<00:00:55.590> manner

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
texturing things in a convincing manner

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.090 
texturing things in a convincing manner
this<00:00:56.460> whole<00:00:56.670> Canyon<00:00:57.000> look<00:00:57.559> does<00:00:58.559> maybe<00:00:58.920> look

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
this whole Canyon look does maybe look

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.349 
this whole Canyon look does maybe look
like<00:00:59.250> some<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.489> those<00:00:59.579> more<00:00:59.910> picturesque

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
like some of those more picturesque

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.180 
like some of those more picturesque
start<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.230> parts<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.590> Utah<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.949> you

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
start to and parts of Utah that you

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.039 
start to and parts of Utah that you
maybe<00:01:02.340> see<00:01:02.489> but<00:01:02.670> whatever<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:03.840> just

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
maybe see but whatever and this just

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.350 
maybe see but whatever and this just
look<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.530> far<00:01:05.220> more<00:01:05.430> convincing<00:01:05.640> than<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.240> ever

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
look is far more convincing than it ever

has<00:01:06.689> been<00:01:06.960> in<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.290> game<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:08.369> course

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
has been in the game and of course

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.609 
has been in the game and of course
that's<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.850> large<00:01:09.030> part<00:01:09.390> just<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.049> how<00:01:10.320> they<00:01:10.500> are

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
that's a large part just to how they are

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.830 
that's a large part just to how they are
better<00:01:10.950> at<00:01:11.189> texturing<00:01:11.610> things<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.450> actual

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
better at texturing things the actual

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.990 
better at texturing things the actual
textures<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.590> God's<00:01:13.830> kind<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.549> shading

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
textures of God's kind of shading

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.640 
textures of God's kind of shading
painted<00:01:15.659> onto<00:01:15.810> them<00:01:16.110> various<00:01:16.439> little<00:01:16.619> things

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
painted onto them various little things

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.320 
painted onto them various little things
like<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.130> which<00:01:17.490> overall<00:01:17.790> just<00:01:18.030> makes<00:01:18.210> it

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
like that which overall just makes it

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.300 
like that which overall just makes it
look<00:01:18.420> really<00:01:18.720> convincing<00:01:19.350> now<00:01:19.950> as<00:01:20.070> we<00:01:20.189> move

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
look really convincing now as we move

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.609 
look really convincing now as we move
over<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.729> hill<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.450> will<00:01:21.600> see<00:01:21.990> the

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
over this hill you will see the

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.620 
over this hill you will see the
Blackrock<00:01:23.280> foundry<00:01:23.340> or<00:01:24.000> at<00:01:24.150> least<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.390> major

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
Blackrock foundry or at least the major

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
Fortress of the black rocks this is the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.260 
Fortress of the black rocks this is the
location<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.720> believe<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:29.270> second-rate

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
location I believe of the second-rate

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.120 
location I believe of the second-rate
tier<00:01:30.600> well<00:01:31.110> I'm<00:01:31.259> not<00:01:31.409> right<00:01:31.590> here<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.829> second

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
tier well I'm not right here the second

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.069 
tier well I'm not right here the second
raid<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.640> first<00:01:32.880> rate<00:01:33.180> here<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.570> little<00:01:33.869> bit

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
raid of the first rate here a little bit

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.530 
raid of the first rate here a little bit
like<00:01:34.259> Howlin<00:01:34.650> Pandaria<00:01:35.250> we<00:01:35.490> had<00:01:35.640> MSV<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.450> then

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
like Howlin Pandaria we had MSV and then

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.600 
like Howlin Pandaria we had MSV and then
after<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.930> we<00:01:37.170> had<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.130> heart<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.400> fear

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
after that we had and the heart of fear

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.390 
after that we had and the heart of fear
and<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.180> teres<00:01:39.960> paternal<00:01:40.290> Springs<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.220> this

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
and the teres paternal Springs so this

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.340 
and the teres paternal Springs so this
is<00:01:41.520> going<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.759> be<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.909> harder<00:01:42.180> tier<00:01:42.390> the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
is going to be the harder tier the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.139 
is going to be the harder tier the
harder<00:01:43.560> sort<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.890> raid<00:01:44.310> within<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.790> tier<00:01:45.000> and

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
harder sort of raid within that tier and

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.270 
harder sort of raid within that tier and
it's<00:01:46.140> going<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.350> be<00:01:46.409> larger<00:01:46.740> than<00:01:46.860> highmaul

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
it's going to be larger than highmaul

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.249 
it's going to be larger than highmaul
which<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.670> one<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.970> ground<00:01:48.299> overall

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
which is the one in the ground overall

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.420 
which is the one in the ground overall
though<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.530> don't<00:01:49.890> know<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.009> great<00:01:50.250> deal<00:01:50.280> about

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
though I don't know a great deal about

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.999 
though I don't know a great deal about
it<00:01:50.820> just<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.509> final<00:01:51.869> boss<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.470> war<00:01:52.770> chief

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
it just that the final boss is war chief

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.190 
it just that the final boss is war chief
black<00:01:53.310> hand<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:54.149> was<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.659> course<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.899> leader

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
black hand and was of course the leader

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.840 
black hand and was of course the leader
of<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.439> black<00:01:55.590> rocks<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.460> should<00:01:56.700> be<00:01:56.729> a

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
of the black rocks so that should be a

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.630 
of the black rocks so that should be a
really<00:01:57.270> really<00:01:57.750> interesting<00:01:57.899> em<00:01:58.649> raid

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
really really interesting em raid

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.120 
really really interesting em raid
actually<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.600> place<00:02:00.810> itself<00:02:01.170> looks<00:02:01.680> awesome

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
actually the place itself looks awesome

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.060 
actually the place itself looks awesome
I'm<00:02:02.340> also<00:02:03.110> 99%<00:02:04.110> sure<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.320> this<00:02:04.590> is<00:02:04.770> where<00:02:04.920> the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
I'm also 99% sure that this is where the

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.940 
I'm also 99% sure that this is where the
iron<00:02:05.219> docks<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.420> dungeon<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.170> located

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
iron docks and dungeon is located

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.190 
iron docks and dungeon is located
obviously<00:02:08.550> because<00:02:08.910> there<00:02:09.390> are<00:02:09.599> dogs<00:02:09.899> and

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
obviously because there are dogs and

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.050 
obviously because there are dogs and
it's<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.709> iron<00:02:10.890> horde<00:02:11.250> so<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.550> would<00:02:11.760> make<00:02:12.000> a

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
it's the iron horde so it would make a

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.430 
it's the iron horde so it would make a
good<00:02:12.330> deal<00:02:12.569> of<00:02:12.780> sense

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
good deal of sense

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.010 
good deal of sense
now<00:02:14.040> this<00:02:14.370> next<00:02:14.670> shot<00:02:14.820> nah<00:02:15.270> this<00:02:15.630> is<00:02:15.750> actually

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
now this next shot nah this is actually

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.960 
now this next shot nah this is actually
where<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.200> failed<00:02:16.430> unfortunately<00:02:17.430> there<00:02:17.790> are

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
where it failed unfortunately there are

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.550 
where it failed unfortunately there are
just<00:02:18.300> stability<00:02:18.750> issues<00:02:18.990> at<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.200> minute<00:02:19.470> and

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
just stability issues at the minute and

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.320 
just stability issues at the minute and
this<00:02:19.710> is<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:19.950> best<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.340> could<00:02:20.400> do<00:02:20.670> with<00:02:20.820> about<00:02:21.030> 3

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
this is the best I could do with about 3

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.560 
this is the best I could do with about 3
hours<00:02:21.450> of<00:02:21.600> trying<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.170> get<00:02:22.380> in<00:02:22.560> using<00:02:22.800> Farsight

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
hours of trying to get in using Farsight

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.610 
hours of trying to get in using Farsight
anyway<00:02:24.570> so<00:02:24.630> this<00:02:24.900> time<00:02:25.080> we're<00:02:25.230> going<00:02:25.350> to<00:02:25.440> be

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
anyway so this time we're going to be

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.110 
anyway so this time we're going to be
taking<00:02:26.130> a<00:02:26.160> little<00:02:26.280> bit<00:02:26.460> of<00:02:26.550> a<00:02:26.610> different<00:02:26.940> path

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
taking a little bit of a different path

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.060 
taking a little bit of a different path
through<00:02:27.480> overall<00:02:28.170> though<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.380> Blackrock

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
through overall though the Blackrock

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.340 
through overall though the Blackrock
area<00:02:29.460> is<00:02:29.850> really<00:02:30.210> impressive<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:30.870> me<00:02:31.020> I<00:02:31.050> think

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
area is really impressive to me I think

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.900 
area is really impressive to me I think
it<00:02:31.410> looks<00:02:31.590> awesome<00:02:31.740> it<00:02:32.100> feels<00:02:32.130> iron<00:02:32.490> hornish

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
it looks awesome it feels iron hornish

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.060 
it looks awesome it feels iron hornish
and<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:34.020> think<00:02:34.230> what<00:02:34.350> really<00:02:34.500> interests<00:02:34.920> me

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
and I think what really interests me

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.800 
and I think what really interests me
though<00:02:35.280> is<00:02:35.430> once<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.120> black<00:02:36.300> rocks<00:02:36.600> are

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
though is once the black rocks are

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.960 
though is once the black rocks are
destroyed<00:02:37.200> that's<00:02:37.650> kind<00:02:37.980> of<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.340> main<00:02:38.550> punch

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
destroyed that's kind of the main punch

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.420 
destroyed that's kind of the main punch
of<00:02:39.240> the<00:02:39.360> iron<00:02:39.510> horde<00:02:39.840> gone<00:02:40.200> so<00:02:40.860> I<00:02:40.920> wonder<00:02:41.280> what

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
of the iron horde gone so I wonder what

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.710 
of the iron horde gone so I wonder what
they're<00:02:41.580> going<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.820> be<00:02:41.940> pulling<00:02:42.150> out<00:02:42.420> to

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
they're going to be pulling out to

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.080 
they're going to be pulling out to
surprise<00:02:43.080> us<00:02:43.470> with<00:02:43.680> in<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.040> subsequent<00:02:44.760> rate

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
surprise us with in the subsequent rate

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.650 
surprise us with in the subsequent rate
tiers<00:02:45.710> anyway<00:02:46.710> so<00:02:46.770> now<00:02:47.580> we<00:02:47.640> are<00:02:47.940> back<00:02:47.970> down<00:02:48.510> in

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
tiers anyway so now we are back down in

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.630 
tiers anyway so now we are back down in
the<00:02:48.750> kind<00:02:48.900> of<00:02:48.990> Canyon<00:02:49.380> II<00:02:49.500> area<00:02:49.950> but<00:02:50.250> there's<00:02:50.550> a

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
the kind of Canyon II area but there's a

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.670 
the kind of Canyon II area but there's a
little<00:02:50.970> bit<00:02:51.180> more<00:02:51.210> lush<00:02:51.870> greenness<00:02:52.500> you'll

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
little bit more lush greenness you'll

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.440 
little bit more lush greenness you'll
see<00:02:52.920> well<00:02:53.520> you'll<00:02:53.700> see<00:02:53.820> where<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:54.030> takes<00:02:54.090> us

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
see well you'll see where that takes us

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.300 
see well you'll see where that takes us
actually<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:54.900> really<00:02:55.320> does<00:02:55.710> end<00:02:55.920> up<00:02:56.040> looking

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
actually it really does end up looking

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.550 
actually it really does end up looking
beautiful<00:02:56.460> this<00:02:56.880> soon<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:58.260> know<00:02:58.350> I<00:02:58.380> was

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
beautiful this soon you know I was

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.830 
beautiful this soon you know I was
originally<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.430> little<00:03:00.060> bit<00:03:00.240> concerned<00:03:00.660> that

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
originally a little bit concerned that

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.350 
originally a little bit concerned that
this<00:03:00.960> would<00:03:01.200> just<00:03:01.230> be<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:02.130> kind<00:03:02.670> of<00:03:02.730> fancy<00:03:03.150> draw

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
this would just be a kind of fancy draw

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.010 
this would just be a kind of fancy draw
at<00:03:03.480> our<00:03:03.660> with<00:03:04.320> not<00:03:04.800> much<00:03:05.040> color<00:03:05.460> and<00:03:05.930> maybe<00:03:06.930> a

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
at our with not much color and maybe a

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.660 
at our with not much color and maybe a
lot<00:03:07.230> of<00:03:07.350> fog<00:03:07.620> because<00:03:08.010> some<00:03:08.160> of<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.280> original

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
lot of fog because some of the original

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.090 
lot of fog because some of the original
shots<00:03:08.910> of<00:03:09.060> this<00:03:09.210> zone<00:03:09.450> didn't<00:03:10.230> really<00:03:10.680> sell<00:03:10.920> me

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
shots of this zone didn't really sell me

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.980 
shots of this zone didn't really sell me
on<00:03:11.130> it<00:03:11.250> but<00:03:12.060> now<00:03:12.300> that<00:03:12.330> I've<00:03:12.540> actually<00:03:12.690> had<00:03:12.960> a

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
on it but now that I've actually had a

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.990 
on it but now that I've actually had a
bit<00:03:13.320> of<00:03:13.380> a<00:03:13.440> peek<00:03:13.650> through<00:03:13.680> I've<00:03:14.160> got<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.490> say<00:03:14.670> it

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
bit of a peek through I've got to say it

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.270 
bit of a peek through I've got to say it
looks<00:03:15.270> fantastic<00:03:15.980> especially<00:03:16.980> from<00:03:17.190> the

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
looks fantastic especially from the

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.880 
looks fantastic especially from the
ground<00:03:17.550> when<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:18.570> know<00:03:18.660> on<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.470> ground<00:03:19.680> you

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
ground when you know on the ground you

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.380 
ground when you know on the ground you
can<00:03:20.040> have<00:03:20.190> all<00:03:20.370> these<00:03:20.520> big<00:03:20.880> rocky

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
can have all these big rocky

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.000 
can have all these big rocky
outcroppings<00:03:22.020> and<00:03:22.170> things<00:03:22.320> be<00:03:22.500> towering

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
outcroppings and things be towering

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.530 
outcroppings and things be towering
above<00:03:23.250> you<00:03:23.610> the<00:03:23.730> same<00:03:23.910> goes<00:03:24.120> when<00:03:24.300> you're<00:03:24.480> in

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
above you the same goes when you're in

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.940 
above you the same goes when you're in
the<00:03:24.630> forest<00:03:24.990> you<00:03:25.440> know<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.620> trees<00:03:25.800> are

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
the forest you know the trees are

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.580 
the forest you know the trees are
towering<00:03:26.130> above<00:03:26.280> you<00:03:26.640> and<00:03:26.850> it<00:03:27.390> just<00:03:27.959> is<00:03:28.170> really

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
towering above you and it just is really

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.440 
towering above you and it just is really
convincing<00:03:29.100> it<00:03:29.250> works<00:03:29.459> out<00:03:29.670> really<00:03:29.850> well<00:03:30.030> this

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
convincing it works out really well this

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.120 
convincing it works out really well this
is<00:03:30.600> a<00:03:30.630> particularly<00:03:31.080> pretty<00:03:31.440> shot<00:03:31.770> as<00:03:31.980> well

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
is a particularly pretty shot as well

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.000 
is a particularly pretty shot as well
and<00:03:32.430> just<00:03:32.459> in<00:03:33.180> that<00:03:33.270> jungle<00:03:33.690> II<00:03:33.870> area<00:03:34.260> not<00:03:34.830> too

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
and just in that jungle II area not too

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.500 
and just in that jungle II area not too
sure<00:03:35.250> if<00:03:35.280> we're<00:03:35.490> gonna<00:03:35.610> have<00:03:35.760> any<00:03:35.880> show<00:03:36.209> us<00:03:36.330> our

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
sure if we're gonna have any show us our

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.870 
sure if we're gonna have any show us our
Basin<00:03:36.959> sort<00:03:37.560> of<00:03:37.620> reminiscent<00:03:37.950> style<00:03:38.400> things

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
Basin sort of reminiscent style things

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.730 
Basin sort of reminiscent style things
I'd<00:03:39.450> imagine<00:03:39.900> that<00:03:39.930> of<00:03:40.080> Helmut<00:03:40.380> nice<00:03:40.530> and

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
I'd imagine that of Helmut nice and

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.120 
I'd imagine that of Helmut nice and
merrier

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
merrier

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.370 
merrier
Nessun<00:03:41.490> wary<00:03:41.640> is<00:03:41.850> here<00:03:42.209> he'll<00:03:42.360> probably<00:03:42.690> be<00:03:43.350> in

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
Nessun wary is here he'll probably be in

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.440 
Nessun wary is here he'll probably be in
the<00:03:43.650> ground<00:03:43.860> still<00:03:44.730> though<00:03:44.910> I<00:03:44.940> could<00:03:45.239> imagine

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
the ground still though I could imagine

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.210 
the ground still though I could imagine
there<00:03:45.750> being<00:03:45.780> lots<00:03:46.110> of<00:03:46.320> really<00:03:46.560> cool<00:03:46.709> quest

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
there being lots of really cool quest

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.000 
there being lots of really cool quest
going<00:03:47.430> on<00:03:47.670> in<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:47.910> jungle<00:03:48.350> now<00:03:49.350> I<00:03:49.380> didn't<00:03:49.860> get

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
going on in the jungle now I didn't get

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.390 
going on in the jungle now I didn't get
to<00:03:50.160> see<00:03:50.340> what<00:03:50.520> that<00:03:50.640> big<00:03:50.940> orb<00:03:51.270> thing<00:03:51.570> is<00:03:51.870> um

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
to see what that big orb thing is um

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.590 
to see what that big orb thing is um
yeah<00:03:53.400> I<00:03:53.430> don't<00:03:54.000> think<00:03:54.209> it's<00:03:54.360> much<00:03:54.570> of

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
yeah I don't think it's much of

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.410 
yeah I don't think it's much of
significance<00:03:55.410> but<00:03:55.650> previously<00:03:56.580> some<00:03:56.850> Titan

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
significance but previously some Titan

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.260 
significance but previously some Titan
things<00:03:58.110> have<00:03:58.290> had<00:03:58.440> big<00:03:58.739> glowing<00:03:59.070> orbs<00:03:59.520> still

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
things have had big glowing orbs still

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.699 
things have had big glowing orbs still
from<00:04:00.570> even<00:04:00.870> from<00:04:01.020> this<00:04:01.110> distance<00:04:01.170> it's<00:04:01.560> hard

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
from even from this distance it's hard

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.220 
from even from this distance it's hard
to<00:04:01.800> discern<00:04:02.040> exactly<00:04:02.670> what<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:02.940> thing<00:04:03.120> is

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
to discern exactly what the thing is

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.930 
to discern exactly what the thing is
anyway<00:04:04.230> so<00:04:04.290> I<00:04:04.920> think<00:04:05.070> in<00:04:05.459> this<00:04:05.550> clip<00:04:05.790> I<00:04:05.910> just

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
anyway so I think in this clip I just

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.420 
anyway so I think in this clip I just
continue<00:04:06.660> going<00:04:07.260> on<00:04:07.500> around<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.890> right<00:04:08.190> hand

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
continue going on around the right hand

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.650 
continue going on around the right hand
side<00:04:08.610> of<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:08.850> zone<00:04:08.970> or<00:04:09.120> maybe<00:04:09.330> that's<00:04:09.540> the

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
side of the zone or maybe that's the

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.449 
side of the zone or maybe that's the
next<00:04:09.810> clip<00:04:10.110> I'm<00:04:10.380> pretty<00:04:10.830> sure<00:04:10.980> ya<00:04:11.250> actually

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
next clip I'm pretty sure ya actually

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.780 
next clip I'm pretty sure ya actually
know<00:04:11.730> it<00:04:12.000> I<00:04:12.390> think<00:04:13.170> it<00:04:13.290> broke<00:04:13.530> yeah<00:04:14.250> so<00:04:14.520> this<00:04:14.640> is

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
know it I think it broke yeah so this is

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:15.770 
know it I think it broke yeah so this is
actually<00:04:15.030> where<00:04:15.090> we<00:04:15.150> started<00:04:15.480> off<00:04:15.570> in<00:04:15.630> the

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
actually where we started off in the

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.420 
actually where we started off in the
first<00:04:16.020> clip<00:04:16.230> you<00:04:16.380> could<00:04:16.500> see<00:04:16.650> that<00:04:16.799> auger<00:04:17.190> face

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
first clip you could see that auger face

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.590 
first clip you could see that auger face
over<00:04:17.790> there<00:04:17.910> to<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.209> left

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
over there to the left

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.570 
over there to the left
no<00:04:18.930> ger<00:04:19.230> like<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:19.620> giant<00:04:19.980> growling<00:04:20.250> creature

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
no ger like the giant growling creature

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.360 
no ger like the giant growling creature
so<00:04:21.359> yeah<00:04:22.049> let's<00:04:22.260> just<00:04:22.410> take<00:04:22.560> a<00:04:22.590> different<00:04:22.800> stop

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
so yeah let's just take a different stop

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.430 
so yeah let's just take a different stop
at<00:04:23.550> this<00:04:23.640> zone<00:04:23.880> and<00:04:24.090> yeah<00:04:24.750> unfortunately<00:04:24.900> the

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
at this zone and yeah unfortunately the

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.170 
at this zone and yeah unfortunately the
stability<00:04:26.070> issues<00:04:26.310> just<00:04:26.460> meant<00:04:26.700> there<00:04:26.820> was

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
stability issues just meant there was

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.279 
stability issues just meant there was
they're<00:04:27.300> hard<00:04:27.449> to<00:04:27.509> capture<00:04:27.720> footage<00:04:28.050> from

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
they're hard to capture footage from

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:30.469 
they're hard to capture footage from
this<00:04:28.470> place<00:04:28.710> a<00:04:28.949> captain<00:04:29.669> just<00:04:29.820> cutting<00:04:30.360> out

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
this place a captain just cutting out

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:33.290 
this place a captain just cutting out
every<00:04:31.050> sort<00:04:31.800> of<00:04:31.889> minute<00:04:32.250> or<00:04:32.370> two<00:04:32.490> which<00:04:32.729> did

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
every sort of minute or two which did

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.080 
every sort of minute or two which did
make<00:04:33.330> things<00:04:33.720> rather<00:04:33.960> weird<00:04:34.440> now<00:04:35.250> this<00:04:35.789> was

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
make things rather weird now this was

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.480 
make things rather weird now this was
actually<00:04:36.270> captured<00:04:36.720> about<00:04:37.169> 1:00<00:04:37.410> p.m.<00:04:37.650> GMT

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
actually captured about 1:00 p.m. GMT

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.770 
actually captured about 1:00 p.m. GMT
which<00:04:38.789> when<00:04:38.970> you<00:04:39.030> translate<00:04:39.449> that<00:04:39.479> into

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
which when you translate that into

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.499 
which when you translate that into
American<00:04:40.320> time<00:04:40.530> means<00:04:41.160> that<00:04:41.310> the<00:04:41.550> zone<00:04:41.729> is<00:04:42.030> not

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
American time means that the zone is not

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.650 
American time means that the zone is not
really<00:04:42.870> fully<00:04:43.080> lit<00:04:43.350> currently<00:04:44.330> it's<00:04:45.330> a<00:04:45.419> little

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
really fully lit currently it's a little

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.090 
really fully lit currently it's a little
bit<00:04:45.750> unfortunate<00:04:45.990> of<00:04:46.259> course<00:04:46.320> this<00:04:46.560> was<00:04:46.740> on<00:04:46.889> an

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
bit unfortunate of course this was on an

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.570 
bit unfortunate of course this was on an
American<00:04:48.090> server<00:04:48.470> yeah<00:04:49.470> I<00:04:49.500> guess<00:04:50.280> it<00:04:50.490> would

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
American server yeah I guess it would

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.070 
American server yeah I guess it would
look<00:04:50.699> a<00:04:50.820> little<00:04:50.970> bit<00:04:51.180> more<00:04:51.330> vibrant<00:04:51.570> and<00:04:51.930> stuff

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
look a little bit more vibrant and stuff

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.290 
look a little bit more vibrant and stuff
like<00:04:52.199> that<00:04:52.440> during<00:04:53.009> the<00:04:53.250> daytime<00:04:53.580> the<00:04:54.150> one

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
like that during the daytime the one

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.550 
like that during the daytime the one
thing<00:04:54.449> that<00:04:54.570> did<00:04:54.690> impress<00:04:54.960> me<00:04:55.169> is<00:04:55.350> the

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
thing that did impress me is the

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.670 
thing that did impress me is the
vibrancy<00:04:56.070> I<00:04:56.250> was<00:04:56.940> a<00:04:56.970> little<00:04:57.570> bit<00:04:57.750> just<00:04:58.320> kind<00:04:58.530> of

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
vibrancy I was a little bit just kind of

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.439 
vibrancy I was a little bit just kind of
annoyed<00:04:59.280> at<00:04:59.370> Pandaria<00:04:59.849> for<00:05:00.030> not<00:05:00.180> being

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:00.449 
annoyed at Pandaria for not being

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:02.779 
annoyed at Pandaria for not being
particularly<00:05:00.900> vibrant<00:05:01.530> even<00:05:01.860> when<00:05:02.250> like<00:05:02.610> say

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789 
particularly vibrant even when like say

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.490 
particularly vibrant even when like say
that<00:05:03.030> when<00:05:03.240> I<00:05:03.270> was<00:05:03.449> and<00:05:03.780> not<00:05:03.930> destroyed<00:05:04.320> the

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
that when I was and not destroyed the

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.999 
that when I was and not destroyed the
veil<00:05:04.710> was<00:05:05.599> visually<00:05:06.599> kind<00:05:06.870> of<00:05:07.050> washed<00:05:07.259> out<00:05:07.500> it

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:08.009 
veil was visually kind of washed out it

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:09.770 
veil was visually kind of washed out it
was<00:05:08.190> not<00:05:08.370> vibrant<00:05:08.910> in<00:05:09.000> terms<00:05:09.180> of<00:05:09.330> its<00:05:09.449> colors

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
was not vibrant in terms of its colors

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.990 
was not vibrant in terms of its colors
and<00:05:10.680> the<00:05:10.770> same<00:05:10.889> as<00:05:11.130> really<00:05:11.580> starting<00:05:11.880> from

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
and the same as really starting from

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.969 
and the same as really starting from
many<00:05:12.150> parts<00:05:12.360> of<00:05:12.539> Pandaria<00:05:13.020> but<00:05:13.530> I<00:05:13.740> think

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
many parts of Pandaria but I think

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:15.080 
many parts of Pandaria but I think
certainly<00:05:14.340> in<00:05:14.490> this<00:05:14.639> zone<00:05:14.849> there's

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
certainly in this zone there's

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.490 
certainly in this zone there's
definitely<00:05:15.449> a<00:05:15.479> decent<00:05:15.780> bit<00:05:15.840> of<00:05:15.990> vibrancy

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
definitely a decent bit of vibrancy

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.770 
definitely a decent bit of vibrancy
