00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:12.609
 when you have a belgian famine in the German showroom not 

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:15.769
 often to a series of different questions from each other 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.669
 a so that mini cars these points like offer painting options 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:21.070
 hot 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.570
 99% atomic aiea 1% of the pnb gpmm roots 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.509
 for force is to recognize that pichot day for a quality of 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:30.350
 manufacturing 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.820
 high level and especially currencies 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.890
 christine very very high quality 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.770
 I have for example 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.610
 helsinki 6 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.360
 she to mount a friction damper 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.250
 especially that it was cut for the starting lists if it fixed 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.250
 next 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.240
 make sure that 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.170
 very very high quality and we recognize well mastered 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.069
 as soon as a thing 

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:55.079
 a bit like tania me i do not hurt mockups every family enough 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.420
 the little ones are very very good 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.600
 for 100 th so here I'll introduce the assembly had only 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.620
 options to tony tyler and some tips since atomic level 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.140
 to weave a little more light 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.320
 force is to recognize 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.280
 like the pros of z so the weight of the fallen at the spa quite 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.360
 adequate 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.320
 other issues so far not put it in entertain are in the process of 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.550
 to make all progress 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.320
 knowing that when you're not in a cameron club 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.540
 we had a lot of trouble seeing the good news 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.640
 percent who decides to take advantage also of the steering committee 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.270
 so here we go to europe on a few hints about configuring it 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.430
 she likes 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.760
 therefore without 2 millimeters 5 e 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.380
 so due easter 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.630
 the stock 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.630
 so that is composed of a dead a friction damper 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.060
 with the regula rotor age of work yesterday 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.790
 when we think that these countries are much later 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.920
 modified to betray 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.380
 hamdan scared the mayor of 150 solar firefighters 180 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.130
 the whole 6 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.690
 of friction so two trays of friction the springs of the small tube 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.729
 the post 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.629
 and the good engine first for editing is like that the files up 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.629
 not down his part would not be 

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:22.809
 first of all the friction damper 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:25.809
 so you have the support to the eu 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:28.609
 put the patella inside the holder at the EU 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:29.490
 then 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.479
 the clip is the part the plastic washer 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:35.519
 and it is advisable to stick it and I for the moment I test without coding 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:37.639
 then where it is necessary 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.499
 the truth the vigilant is the small screen yes if 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:42.549
 you will see on the instructions 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.389
 take off these are ten years 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:47.319
 it will allow to adjust the rear axle 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.089
 in this distance 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:51.939
 So this wash washer and metal on plastic 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:55.139
 so this part harp the most delicate well 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:58.779
 present it in the net so as to panama and crooked 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:00.599
 and it's not with this puck 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.729
 by turning it in a direction in khorasan dodon translate 

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:07.029
 when we get the adjustment of the position of the rear axle 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:10.179
 there are a few clicks on the product is at 104 1 on my website 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.049
 then once we've got the puck on the track the sticks here that 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.109
 serves for 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:16.979
 the lma 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:19.199
 if we know it's a little bit smaller 

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.629
 we present the screw here yes 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.510
 the spring will sense 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.779
 these are realities on that side are not on that side 

00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:29.029
 and there you have to be extremely vigilant 

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:32.150
 for hiv so perfectly in lax 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:34.489
 % the opinion 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:35.819
 and support 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.869
 how a patella 

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:40.869
 we have the possibility 

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:50.869
 all about the specific polder and the hand 

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:54.449
 first thing to get tea while it's a little squirrel 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:55.889
 hot or other 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:00.529
 take the vices of the pack there is a collar like this whatever it is 

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:01.499
 very well 

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:04.599
 so yes to the screw head and a washer 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.639
 so it makes it possible to have the greatest support for tea less strength 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:10.489
 then 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.339
 the engine must mount the lines in August 

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:15.900
 the piece which if they were dismounted 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.509
 so the two troops 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:19.449
 who will maintain 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:20.739
 engine 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.069
 are slightly shifted 

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:24.730
 you have two small screws the ones of gray color 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.360
 was very explicit 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.559
 and conical 

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:31.099
 you finish your atomic engine what is a motor with a hot can 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:32.490
 not be mounted on it 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.059
 if your engine held by his two grandsons 

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:38.059
 without much under what just what 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:40.440
 then 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.059
 you position your engine and rejuvenate 

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:44.650
 she unscrews correct 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.070
 which are quite long compared to others knowing that a very small 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.999
 slap to serve after 

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:52.279
 again set this engine this way 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:55.279
 and after when you show your differential and pinion 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.529
 you have been gorges here 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:00.279
 which by unscrewing 

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:01.870
 to translate 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.470
 the engine is therefore to adjust between them to differentiate the pinions 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.009
 so playing on his vices 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:11.419
 series strides 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:13.539
 you play on the engine translation 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:15.559
 so the gap between lax 

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:18.559
 motor and differential lecce to adjust your antrum 

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:26.990
 we know where it becomes funny 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.039
 here is the tube for weber shock absorber 52 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:33.669
 still learn this way with mans poles here 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.360
 we take spring I took a year 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.930
 a dukic way 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.580
 tf1 is at 1 157 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.610
 opposition 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.870
 a friction plate that can therefore flat part 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.469
 to the top 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:50.539
 I feel that you will see is a small notch for that the 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:52.990
 for the spring to pass 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.469
 then that way there when you rode the mayor of 150 

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:58.430
 you said it would come so 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.759
 plus six friends here 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:04.309
 similarly the plateau 

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:06.240
 part 10 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.289
 p 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:10.610
 then 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.089
 Above 

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:16.029
 so that goes way beyond that 

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:17.520
 Above 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.469
 our fate 

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:21.980
 this little room 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.350
 with a sphere where comes from the allaire shock absorber 180 

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:30.529
 so raging inside 

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:37.089
 is suitable salamin google bp 

00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:39.939
 the shoulder is here 

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:42.150
 the two trays of the smooth face 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.360
 on the set and their 250 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.099
 and here the list with the sphere on that side so the springs are wedged 

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:50.199
 the biat 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:51.069
 in appearance and amortized
