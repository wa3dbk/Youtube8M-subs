stadium<00:01:46.749> we've<00:01:47.289> gained<00:01:48.219> I<00:01:48.429> guess<00:01:48.639> about

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
stadium we've gained I guess about

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:50.760 
stadium we've gained I guess about
two-thirds<00:01:49.389> of<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.899> pledges<00:01:50.109> that<00:01:50.380> we<00:01:50.590> need

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
two-thirds of the pledges that we need

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.379 
two-thirds of the pledges that we need
to<00:01:50.799> build<00:01:50.979> the<00:01:51.159> stadium<00:01:51.369> we've<00:01:51.850> collected

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:52.389 
to build the stadium we've collected

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:55.499 
to build the stadium we've collected
about<00:01:52.479> about<00:01:53.020> half<00:01:53.499> of<00:01:53.649> that<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:55.270> it<00:01:55.479> looks

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
about about half of that so it looks

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.099 
about about half of that so it looks
like<00:01:55.810> it's<00:01:56.020> going<00:01:56.170> to<00:01:56.200> happen<00:01:56.350> I<00:01:56.649> got<00:01:56.889> all<00:01:57.159> this
