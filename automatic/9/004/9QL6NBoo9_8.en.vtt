valve at the bottom is going to be about
fire<00:03:05.140> so<00:03:05.379> I<00:03:05.440> wolford<00:03:06.329> anyway<00:03:07.329> it<00:03:07.450> was<00:03:07.569> going<00:03:07.690> to

tell you the secret of how to tap this

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.580 
tell you the secret of how to tap this
stuff<00:03:09.640> because<00:03:09.970> it's<00:03:10.109> bloody<00:03:11.109> hard<00:03:11.349> to<00:03:11.530> tent

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
stuff because it's bloody hard to tent

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.839 
stuff because it's bloody hard to tent
comes<00:03:14.590> out<00:03:14.739> really<00:03:15.040> nicely<00:03:15.250> once<00:03:15.519> you've<00:03:15.700> got

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
comes out really nicely once you've got

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.409 
comes out really nicely once you've got
it<00:03:15.880> done<00:03:16.620> shit<00:03:17.620> that's<00:03:17.859> hard<00:03:18.069> to<00:03:18.190> do<00:03:18.419> the

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:19.419 
it done shit that's hard to do the

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:22.080 
it done shit that's hard to do the
problem<00:03:19.810> is<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:19.959> pipe<00:03:20.459> you<00:03:21.459> can't<00:03:21.700> hold<00:03:21.880> on<00:03:22.030> to

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
problem is the pipe you can't hold on to

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.460 
problem is the pipe you can't hold on to
it<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:23.650> take<00:03:23.859> enough<00:03:24.160> talk<00:03:24.459> from<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:26.049> tap<00:03:26.290> when

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
it to take enough talk from the tap when

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.949 
it to take enough talk from the tap when
you<00:03:26.590> screw<00:03:26.799> the<00:03:26.889> tap<00:03:27.069> on<00:03:27.510> so<00:03:28.510> when<00:03:28.660> you<00:03:28.720> try<00:03:28.900> and

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
you screw the tap on so when you try and

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.839 
you screw the tap on so when you try and
cut<00:03:29.200> threads<00:03:29.680> it<00:03:29.859> puts<00:03:30.040> a<00:03:30.130> lot<00:03:30.160> of<00:03:30.280> talk<00:03:30.579> on<00:03:30.760> to

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
cut threads it puts a lot of talk on to

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:32.640 
cut threads it puts a lot of talk on to
the<00:03:30.940> pipe<00:03:31.120> and<00:03:31.389> there's<00:03:31.540> just<00:03:31.690> no<00:03:32.019> way<00:03:32.260> to<00:03:32.290> hang

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
the pipe and there's just no way to hang

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.039 
the pipe and there's just no way to hang
on<00:03:32.829> to<00:03:32.980> it<00:03:33.069> that<00:03:33.220> tight<00:03:33.569> so<00:03:34.569> what<00:03:34.750> I<00:03:34.780> end<00:03:34.989> up

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
on to it that tight so what I end up

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.970 
on to it that tight so what I end up
doing<00:03:35.109> is<00:03:36.810> I<00:03:37.810> can<00:03:37.959> start<00:03:38.230> a<00:03:38.380> little<00:03:38.560> tiny<00:03:38.859> bit

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
doing is I can start a little tiny bit

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.180 
doing is I can start a little tiny bit
so<00:03:39.340> there's<00:03:39.549> a<00:03:39.669> little<00:03:39.819> tiny<00:03:40.660> bit<00:03:40.840> a<00:03:41.139> little<00:03:41.799> do

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
so there's a little tiny bit a little do

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.659 
so there's a little tiny bit a little do
teapot<00:03:42.489> that<00:03:42.639> I<00:03:42.760> haven't<00:03:42.940> cleaned<00:03:43.630> up<00:03:43.720> yet

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
teapot that I haven't cleaned up yet

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:48.710 
teapot that I haven't cleaned up yet
come<00:03:45.669> on<00:03:45.849> focus<00:03:46.209> on<00:03:46.359> the<00:03:46.510> air<00:03:46.859> come<00:03:47.859> on<00:03:47.980> camera

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
come on focus on the air come on camera

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.150 
come on focus on the air come on camera
so<00:03:49.720> I<00:03:49.750> started<00:03:50.139> a<00:03:50.200> little<00:03:50.349> tighter<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:50.919> tap

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
so I started a little tighter the tap

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:59.610 
so I started a little tighter the tap
and<00:03:51.340> then<00:03:52.329> i<00:03:53.549> screw<00:03:56.010> this<00:03:57.010> on<00:03:58.200> so<00:03:59.200> i<00:03:59.230> screw<00:03:59.500> the

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
and then i screw this on so i screw the

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.190 
and then i screw this on so i screw the
trike<00:03:59.859> over<00:04:00.220> in<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.400> end<00:04:00.579> and<00:04:00.849> i<00:04:01.269> have<00:04:01.540> a<00:04:01.810> 90

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
trike over in the end and i have a 90

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.750 
trike over in the end and i have a 90
degree<00:04:02.290> Bend<00:04:02.709> on<00:04:02.859> it<00:04:02.980> and<00:04:03.160> it's<00:04:03.280> all<00:04:03.430> clamp<00:04:03.669> to

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
degree Bend on it and it's all clamp to

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.150 
degree Bend on it and it's all clamp to
giver<00:04:03.940> and<00:04:04.150> if<00:04:04.840> anybody's<00:04:05.290> used<00:04:05.620> rope<00:04:05.889> overs

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
giver and if anybody's used rope overs

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.460 
giver and if anybody's used rope overs
before<00:04:06.250> these<00:04:06.879> clamps<00:04:07.180> up<00:04:07.359> super<00:04:07.720> strong<00:04:07.959> okay

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
before these clamps up super strong okay

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.780 
before these clamps up super strong okay
once<00:04:08.949> you've<00:04:09.129> clamped<00:04:09.400> it<00:04:09.489> to<00:04:09.549> give<00:04:09.669> her<00:04:09.730> a

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
once you've clamped it to give her a

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.170 
once you've clamped it to give her a
little<00:04:09.910> bit<00:04:10.060> you<00:04:10.209> cannot<00:04:10.599> twist<00:04:10.870> a<00:04:11.139> try<00:04:11.620> clover

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
little bit you cannot twist a try clover

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.979 
little bit you cannot twist a try clover
but<00:04:13.180> I<00:04:13.209> screw<00:04:13.540> that<00:04:13.569> on<00:04:13.750> the<00:04:13.959> end<00:04:14.109> of<00:04:14.139> my<00:04:14.199> pipe

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
but I screw that on the end of my pipe

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.789 
but I screw that on the end of my pipe
right

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
right

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:29.939 
right
so<00:04:18.250> when<00:04:18.940> headed<00:04:19.299> for<00:04:19.509> the<00:04:19.569> camera<00:04:19.870> my<00:04:20.019> head<00:04:28.949> no

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949 
so when headed for the camera my head no

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.460 
so when headed for the camera my head no
I<00:04:30.370> screw<00:04:31.330> that<00:04:31.360> on<00:04:31.539> the<00:04:31.780> end<00:04:31.930> of<00:04:32.020> my<00:04:32.080> pipe<00:04:32.289> with

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
I screw that on the end of my pipe with

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.279 
I screw that on the end of my pipe with
a<00:04:32.500> little<00:04:32.710> bit<00:04:32.830> of<00:04:33.629> tip<00:04:34.629> that<00:04:34.810> I<00:04:34.870> have<00:04:35.080> the

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:35.289 
a little bit of tip that I have the

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:36.300 
a little bit of tip that I have the
little<00:04:35.440> bit<00:04:35.590> of<00:04:35.650> thread<00:04:35.830> that<00:04:35.919> I've<00:04:36.039> got<00:04:36.190> on

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
little bit of thread that I've got on

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.640 
little bit of thread that I've got on
there<00:04:36.490> and<00:04:36.639> then<00:04:37.479> I<00:04:37.780> tap<00:04:38.199> the<00:04:38.319> other<00:04:38.470> end

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
there and then I tap the other end

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.890 
there and then I tap the other end
because<00:04:39.099> I<00:04:39.220> can<00:04:39.400> use<00:04:39.580> this<00:04:39.879> end<00:04:40.210> there's<00:04:40.750> a

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
because I can use this end there's a

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.010 
because I can use this end there's a
lever<00:04:41.110> and<00:04:41.470> I<00:04:41.590> can<00:04:41.770> hold<00:04:42.039> and<00:04:42.340> reach<00:04:42.639> in<00:04:43.020> pull

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
lever and I can hold and reach in pull

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.320 
lever and I can hold and reach in pull
against<00:04:44.319> the<00:04:44.470> talk<00:04:45.539> so<00:04:46.539> that's<00:04:47.229> how<00:04:47.440> I<00:04:47.470> tap

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
against the talk so that's how I tap

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:56.189 
against the talk so that's how I tap
another<00:04:49.330> thing<00:04:49.599> have<00:04:49.990> i<00:04:50.080> use<00:04:53.340> is<00:04:54.340> this<00:04:55.020> it's<00:04:56.020> a

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 
another thing have i use is this it's a

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:58.589 
another thing have i use is this it's a
rubber<00:04:56.379> pipe<00:04:56.680> grip<00:04:56.919> so<00:04:57.909> of<00:04:58.120> course<00:04:58.150> you<00:04:58.479> don't

00:04:58.589 --> 00:04:58.599 
rubber pipe grip so of course you don't

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:02.670 
rubber pipe grip so of course you don't
want<00:04:58.840> to<00:04:58.900> scratch<00:04:59.370> your<00:05:00.370> pipe<00:05:00.840> so<00:05:01.840> this<00:05:02.440> goes

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
want to scratch your pipe so this goes

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:09.360 
want to scratch your pipe so this goes
on<00:05:02.830> let's<00:05:03.550> just<00:05:03.639> go<00:05:03.879> again<00:05:07.440> this<00:05:08.440> goes<00:05:08.650> on<00:05:08.860> put
