00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
comments okay then looking at the wheels

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.139 
comments okay then looking at the wheels
and<00:01:52.229> trucks<00:01:52.380> wheels<00:01:52.799> roll<00:01:53.100> well<00:01:53.340> yes<00:01:53.790> and

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
and trucks wheels roll well yes and

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
apparently they've got bearings in them

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.050 
apparently they've got bearings in them
these<00:01:56.909> are<00:01:57.119> blue<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:58.759> see<00:01:59.759> that<00:01:59.939> they're

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
these are blue and see that they're

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.880 
these are blue and see that they're
selling<00:02:00.450> several<00:02:00.780> colors<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.350> wheels<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:01.829> you

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
selling several colors of wheels so you

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.740 
selling several colors of wheels so you
can<00:02:02.070> customize<00:02:02.610> or<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.090> can<00:02:03.210> buy<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.390> parts

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
can customize or you can buy the parts

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.980 
can customize or you can buy the parts
separately<00:02:04.049> make<00:02:04.560> your<00:02:04.680> own<00:02:04.770> custom<00:02:05.219> deck<00:02:05.990> and

separately make your own custom deck and

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.160 
separately make your own custom deck and
then<00:02:07.229> here's<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.190> trucks<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.989> these<00:02:09.989> are

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
then here's the trucks and these are

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.449 
then here's the trucks and these are
painted<00:02:10.470> black<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:10.979> know<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.310> there's

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
painted black and I know that there's

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.260 
painted black and I know that there's
some<00:02:11.580> other<00:02:11.700> colors<00:02:12.090> available

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
some other colors available

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.940 
some other colors available
see<00:02:13.390> that<00:02:13.510> there<00:02:13.630> are<00:02:13.660> some<00:02:13.950> compression

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
see that there are some compression

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.980 
see that there are some compression
rings<00:02:15.370> inserted<00:02:16.210> looks<00:02:16.510> like<00:02:16.630> there's<00:02:16.810> two

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
rings inserted looks like there's two

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.680 
rings inserted looks like there's two
each<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.590> each<00:02:17.890> of<00:02:18.070> the<00:02:18.160> trucks<00:02:18.460> and<00:02:19.300> I

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
each and each of the trucks and I

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.540 
each and each of the trucks and I
believe<00:02:19.930> that's<00:02:20.020> going<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.320> help<00:02:20.440> a<00:02:20.920> little

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
believe that's going to help a little

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.540 
believe that's going to help a little
bit<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:23.050> then<00:02:23.230> there<00:02:23.380> is<00:02:23.410> a<00:02:23.530> tuning<00:02:24.370> tool

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
bit and and then there is a tuning tool

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.300 
bit and and then there is a tuning tool
included<00:02:25.120> looks<00:02:26.050> pretty<00:02:26.350> much<00:02:26.500> like<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.950> tool

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
included looks pretty much like the tool

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.780 
included looks pretty much like the tool
that<00:02:27.640> tech<00:02:28.510> tech<00:02:28.690> people<00:02:28.990> put<00:02:29.170> out<00:02:29.350> and<00:02:29.790> I'm

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
that tech tech people put out and I'm

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.600 
that tech tech people put out and I'm
not<00:02:31.000> going<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.180> try<00:02:31.330> to<00:02:31.420> adjust<00:02:32.230> these<00:02:32.710> trucks

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
not going to try to adjust these trucks

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.330 
not going to try to adjust these trucks
I'm<00:02:33.790> not<00:02:33.940> that<00:02:34.090> smart<00:02:34.270> of<00:02:34.630> course<00:02:34.870> but<00:02:35.500> i'll

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
I'm not that smart of course but i'll

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.810 
I'm not that smart of course but i'll
let<00:02:37.330> you<00:02:37.480> have<00:02:37.510> a<00:02:37.630> good<00:02:37.810> look<00:02:37.930> at<00:02:38.140> them<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.820> see

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
let you have a good look at them and see

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.470 
let you have a good look at them and see
what<00:02:39.940> you<00:02:40.090> think<00:02:40.120> about<00:02:40.360> that<00:02:40.690> and<00:02:42.210> we'll<00:02:43.210> do<00:02:43.450> a

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
what you think about that and we'll do a

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.330 
what you think about that and we'll do a
little<00:02:43.660> bit<00:02:43.960> of<00:02:43.990> testing<00:02:44.200> on<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.740> wheels<00:02:44.980> here

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
little bit of testing on the wheels here

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.240 
little bit of testing on the wheels here
and<00:02:45.550> see<00:02:45.970> how<00:02:46.120> well<00:02:46.330> the<00:02:46.510> reels<00:02:46.780> role<00:02:47.200> in<00:02:48.100> a

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
and see how well the reels role in a

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.250 
and see how well the reels role in a
minute<00:02:48.550> i<00:02:48.730> do<00:02:49.060> have<00:02:49.390> a<00:02:49.450> little<00:02:49.570> bit<00:02:49.720> i<00:02:49.840> could

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
minute i do have a little bit i could

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.690 
minute i do have a little bit i could
feel<00:02:50.410> a<00:02:50.470> little<00:02:50.590> bit<00:02:50.710> of<00:02:50.860> play<00:02:51.040> in<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.310> inner

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
feel a little bit of play in the inner

please me and of course it's stick in
the<00:03:25.900> back<00:03:26.110> and<00:03:26.350> it's<00:03:27.010> cut<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.490> shape<00:03:27.760> to<00:03:28.180> fit

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
the back and it's cut the shape to fit

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.570 
the back and it's cut the shape to fit
right<00:03:28.570> on<00:03:28.600> the<00:03:28.810> board<00:03:29.050> if<00:03:29.680> he<00:03:29.980> needed<00:03:30.280> to<00:03:30.430> you

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
right on the board if he needed to you

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.770 
right on the board if he needed to you
might<00:03:30.760> could<00:03:30.880> trim<00:03:31.120> off<00:03:31.270> a<00:03:31.300> little<00:03:31.480> bit<00:03:31.600> of<00:03:31.690> the

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
might could trim off a little bit of the

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.030 
might could trim off a little bit of the
edges<00:03:32.080> but<00:03:32.110> it<00:03:32.440> looks<00:03:32.590> like<00:03:32.650> it's<00:03:32.860> cut

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
edges but it looks like it's cut

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.520 
edges but it looks like it's cut
perfectly<00:03:33.459> to<00:03:33.790> fit<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.120> board<00:03:34.390> I<00:03:34.660> can<00:03:35.440> just

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
perfectly to fit the board I can just

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.990 
perfectly to fit the board I can just
put<00:03:35.709> that<00:03:35.740> right<00:03:35.980> on<00:03:36.130> there<00:03:36.280> but<00:03:36.760> I'd<00:03:36.820> like<00:03:36.940> to

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
put that right on there but I'd like to

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.730 
put that right on there but I'd like to
look<00:03:37.180> at<00:03:37.330> the<00:03:37.450> logo<00:03:37.630> to<00:03:37.990> see<00:03:38.290> now<00:03:38.709> let's

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 
look at the logo to see now let's

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.400 
look at the logo to see now let's
compare<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:39.820> star<00:03:40.090> fingerboard<00:03:40.690> to<00:03:40.990> what<00:03:41.380> a

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
compare the star fingerboard to what a

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.440 
compare the star fingerboard to what a
tic<00:03:41.650> tacs<00:03:41.860> wood<00:03:42.070> boards<00:03:42.490> this<00:03:42.670> wooden<00:03:43.209> board

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
tic tacs wood boards this wooden board

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.710 
tic tacs wood boards this wooden board
was<00:03:43.660> released<00:03:43.990> about<00:03:44.440> last<00:03:45.250> Christmas<00:03:45.790> and<00:03:46.030> I

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
was released about last Christmas and I

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.420 
was released about last Christmas and I
still<00:03:46.990> got<00:03:47.140> it<00:03:47.230> in<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.410> lab<00:03:47.740> here<00:03:48.040> I<00:03:48.070> haven't

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
still got it in the lab here I haven't

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.090 
still got it in the lab here I haven't
really<00:03:48.520> analyzed<00:03:49.030> it<00:03:49.240> totally<00:03:49.900> let's<00:03:50.770> look<00:03:50.950> at

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
really analyzed it totally let's look at

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.910 
really analyzed it totally let's look at
the<00:03:51.220> length<00:03:51.490> star<00:03:52.390> fingerboarding<00:03:53.050> the<00:03:53.650> decks

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
the length star fingerboarding the decks

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.460 
the length star fingerboarding the decks
length<00:03:54.220> is<00:03:54.459> a<00:03:54.940> just<00:03:55.930> over<00:03:56.110> one<00:03:56.230> hundred<00:03:56.290> and

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
length is a just over one hundred and

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.640 
length is a just over one hundred and
five<00:03:56.680> millimeters<00:03:57.190> long<00:03:57.400> and<00:03:58.080> the<00:03:59.080> tech<00:03:59.320> decks

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
five millimeters long and the tech decks

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.240 
five millimeters long and the tech decks
is<00:04:00.450> just<00:04:01.450> about<00:04:01.720> a<00:04:01.959> hundred<00:04:02.230> little<00:04:02.890> over<00:04:03.070> 100

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
is just about a hundred little over 100

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.430 
is just about a hundred little over 100
millimeters<00:04:03.910> long<00:04:04.120> so<00:04:04.390> they<00:04:04.690> star

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
millimeters long so they star

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.610 
millimeters long so they star
fingerboard<00:04:05.980> one<00:04:06.220> is<00:04:06.459> longer<00:04:06.970> and<00:04:07.620> clearly

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
fingerboard one is longer and clearly

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.190 
fingerboard one is longer and clearly
it's<00:04:08.860> wider<00:04:09.130> as<00:04:09.430> well<00:04:09.640> oh<00:04:09.880> let's<00:04:10.810> have<00:04:10.959> a<00:04:11.020> look

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
it's wider as well oh let's have a look

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.240 
it's wider as well oh let's have a look
at<00:04:11.290> this<00:04:11.470> here<00:04:11.770> and<00:04:12.300> see<00:04:13.300> the<00:04:13.450> width<00:04:13.630> is<00:04:14.250> 35.4

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
at this here and see the width is 35.4

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.870 
at this here and see the width is 35.4
and<00:04:15.580> on<00:04:16.299> the<00:04:16.390> tech<00:04:16.600> deck<00:04:16.870> the<00:04:17.859> wood<00:04:18.070> deck<00:04:18.310> the

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
and on the tech deck the wood deck the

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.920 
and on the tech deck the wood deck the
width<00:04:19.359> is<00:04:19.570> 30.5<00:04:20.470> so<00:04:21.190> it's<00:04:21.340> both<00:04:21.720> longer<00:04:22.720> and

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
width is 30.5 so it's both longer and

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
width is 30.5 so it's both longer and
wider<00:04:23.620> than<00:04:23.950> the<00:04:24.130> tech<00:04:24.310> deck<00:04:24.810> board<00:04:25.810> as<00:04:25.960> well

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
wider than the tech deck board as well

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.190 
wider than the tech deck board as well
looking<00:04:27.280> at<00:04:27.370> the<00:04:27.460> wheels<00:04:27.810> we're<00:04:28.810> not<00:04:28.990> going<00:04:29.020> to

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
looking at the wheels we're not going to

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.230 
looking at the wheels we're not going to
be<00:04:29.260> able<00:04:29.290> to<00:04:29.470> evaluate<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:30.040> wheels<00:04:30.250> very<00:04:31.060> well

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
be able to evaluate the wheels very well

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.060 
be able to evaluate the wheels very well
this<00:04:31.420> way<00:04:31.600> but<00:04:31.780> we<00:04:31.900> may<00:04:32.080> try<00:04:32.350> a<00:04:32.380> rolling<00:04:32.800> test

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
this way but we may try a rolling test

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.090 
this way but we may try a rolling test
in<00:04:33.220> a<00:04:33.280> minute<00:04:33.490> here<00:04:33.670> but<00:04:34.300> these<00:04:35.260> tech<00:04:35.920> tech

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
in a minute here but these tech tech

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.590 
in a minute here but these tech tech
wheels<00:04:36.310> were<00:04:36.520> pretty<00:04:36.760> wobbly<00:04:37.000> they<00:04:37.330> were<00:04:37.390> all

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
wheels were pretty wobbly they were all

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.210 
wheels were pretty wobbly they were all
easy<00:04:37.870> but<00:04:38.230> they're<00:04:38.350> also<00:04:38.500> kind<00:04:38.770> of<00:04:38.860> wobbly

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
easy but they're also kind of wobbly

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.090 
easy but they're also kind of wobbly
there<00:04:39.430> and<00:04:39.640> they're<00:04:40.000> famous<00:04:40.180> for<00:04:40.360> that<00:04:40.630> right

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
there and they're famous for that right

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.500 
there and they're famous for that right
the<00:04:42.100> the<00:04:42.520> trucks<00:04:42.850> look<00:04:43.060> about<00:04:43.300> the<00:04:43.480> same

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
the the trucks look about the same

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.890 
the the trucks look about the same
although<00:04:44.410> I<00:04:44.440> noticed<00:04:45.210> the<00:04:46.210> star<00:04:46.450> fingerboard

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
although I noticed the star fingerboard

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.110 
although I noticed the star fingerboard
trucks<00:04:47.170> are<00:04:47.440> wider<00:04:47.860> let's<00:04:48.190> measure<00:04:48.460> the<00:04:48.880> width

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
trucks are wider let's measure the width

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.540 
trucks are wider let's measure the width
wheel<00:04:50.110> the<00:04:50.290> wheel<00:04:50.320> to<00:04:50.920> the<00:04:50.950> outside<00:04:51.400> of<00:04:51.490> the

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
wheel the wheel to the outside of the

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.360 
wheel the wheel to the outside of the
wheels<00:04:51.760> and<00:04:52.560> here<00:04:53.560> we<00:04:53.770> see<00:04:54.420> 33.8<00:04:55.420> 8<00:04:55.600> and<00:04:56.250> on<00:04:57.250> the

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
wheels and here we see 33.8 8 and on the

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.640 
wheels and here we see 33.8 8 and on the
tech<00:04:57.550> deck<00:04:58.410> it's<00:04:59.880> 31.4<00:05:00.880> 3z<00:05:01.540> so<00:05:02.110> you're<00:05:02.380> right

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
tech deck it's 31.4 3z so you're right

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.270 
tech deck it's 31.4 3z so you're right
these<00:05:03.520> are<00:05:03.730> wider<00:05:04.210> trucks<00:05:04.690> on<00:05:05.170> the<00:05:05.280> star

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
these are wider trucks on the star

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.420 
these are wider trucks on the star
fingerboard<00:05:07.200> so<00:05:08.200> that's<00:05:08.350> interesting<00:05:08.620> and<00:05:09.040> of

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
fingerboard so that's interesting and of

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.880 
fingerboard so that's interesting and of
course<00:05:09.460> also<00:05:09.900> they're<00:05:10.900> using<00:05:11.230> glossy<00:05:11.650> paint

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
course also they're using glossy paint

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.070 
course also they're using glossy paint
on<00:05:12.100> a<00:05:12.160> tech<00:05:12.520> deck<00:05:12.730> products<00:05:13.120> along<00:05:13.780> with<00:05:13.990> the

showed that the star fingerboarding a

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.160 
showed that the star fingerboarding a
deck<00:06:03.410> does<00:06:03.650> run<00:06:03.950> faster<00:06:04.640> than<00:06:04.820> the<00:06:05.360> wood<00:06:05.840> tech
