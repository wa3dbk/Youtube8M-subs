00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 Peter Kloppel is a pilot of one 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.380
 the four helicopters of the 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.000
 Ministry of the Interior 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.010
 that's the special thing about this 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.639
 The special thing about this aircraft 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.889
 Aircraft equipment is loud 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.570
 a daylight camera one 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.060
 thermal imager a searchlight 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.090
 and a downlink antenna on the board and 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.619
 With that we can have a huge spectrum in 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.350
 to cover our world as an area 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.840
 Our searchlight can be made from one 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.539
 height about 300 meters above ground 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.700
 soccer field agent is illuminate 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.399
 swiveling is coupled with the camera 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.829
 since that direction in which I am with 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.930
 the camera synonymous automatically 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.410
 while for seeking action it's headlights 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.290
 optimal 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.090
 The ball includes two cameras one 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.250
 daylight you can also thermal imaging camera 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.960
 she is 360 degrees swiveling that she 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.690
 can be in all directions 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.460
 look thermal camera goes up 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.469
 accuracy of two tenths of a degree 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.590
 These are so-called night vision googles 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.750
 for the federal army got the 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.460
 are mounted on the helmet and at 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.060
 darkness fell down 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:10.700
 It then appears a thorough picture 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.480
 and every light source is in the environment 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.120
 visible with it 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.520
 our offshore has an additional one 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.830
 weather on board for our eight missions 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.410
 could now as it is weather now 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.570
 at the moment, this is big 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.890
 support if you because the area 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.140
 she can scan one 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.100
 Lurking cell is ours 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.770
 helicopter ec135 parties a supreme 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.760
 departure weight from 2009 10 km like 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.490
 especially difficult 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.930
 Thanks to contents, 700 liters are filled up 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.910
 this range of about three hours 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:48.860
 We can do that with half of Austria 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:51.020
 Cover by enough of the counterweight 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.399
 through which you have additional facilities 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.280
 about three kilos more like a normal one 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.649
 newcomer in this class 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:01.700
 knot speed until about 140 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:05.110
 that means 260 km h and speed 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.110
 height 30
