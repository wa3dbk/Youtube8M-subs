00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello everyone so we end up today with a mania 49 that yes 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.000
 any new youtube video 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.799
 if I'm going to do my first real time 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:14.839
 so that I teach you me installed the all-mini tennis mode surpasses it 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:16.039
 points 7 points 2 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:17.490
 and modes 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.160
 the polls that lets fly like like year after 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.609
 luke 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.609
 chimier for this beautiful superman 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:30.539
 sayah can however 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.430
 but 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.920
 the shutter more for the highest 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.920
 it took at least eighteen touchdowns as we know 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.940
 m 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.680
 after what otherwise normal but also a poetic touch 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.740
 in simplicity 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.010
 it flows 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.010
 so we also dropped the tour mode of m 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.230
 an art that is very very handy 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.230
 woerth 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.060
 but already beaten to make the same fears 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.439
 but that you try to be there to install everything the towers is initialized 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.350
 sinister johnny 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.430
 here is a simple man 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.550
 a fall, sport has to help 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.550
 and m winrar besides his titles 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.090
 it is very important 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.280
 So what is he doing here? 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.360
 executed 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.390
 after you typed 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.310
 so percentage 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.310
 to dp pies to a percentage 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.970
 for his calm 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.970
 you thought about graphite 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.189
 and you are going to open 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:10.579
 the manitou file 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:12.589
 with his 10 

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:15.229
 here 

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:18.789
 let's go but he dared to delete the file but what a shame 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:21.519
 which is useless 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.859
 and you will take any mini tennis 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:27.289
 so you see there sumner 

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:29.619
 we remain skeptical 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:31.299
 it copies all the files 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.269
 three classes 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.779
 and harvesting 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:38.129
 we formed them places in a three-player sentence 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.969
 or him 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:42.659
 here 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.659
 so for that cypher closed angle 

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:48.119
 so now 

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.930
 Why 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.539
 the way of life man 

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:54.599
 men here is a man in class with his music 

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:59.389
 normally there was I am ready but she is source 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.389
 stone trudeau philosophy expressed his rage 

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:06.809
 it is that all classes you are going to copy them 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.489
 finally displaced in other players 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.549
 that's it 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.339
 they are all 

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:19.479
 but here is copy 

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:22.479
 now what are you going to do 

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:25.509
 So then 

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:27.239
 you will take 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.939
 6 water and make previous our screens every 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:33.969
 physical development in all of this 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:37.119
 since everything filled you copied this time 

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:40.139
 in a hole and so no but did not surprise graphite 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.199
 that's how it will pay 

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:46.099
 nokia is nothing you took as well as this example we are both 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:48.499
 feet in here like sisyphus 

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:51.449
 so when they are all copy you go to your daughter 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:54.249
 read some cinty until you get there 

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:57.539
 shhh afl all-fashion bankrupt 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:01.489
 so I already did everything well under 10 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.109
 we will study it 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.479
 all soussou soussou up down 

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:08.119
 which is useless 

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:10.949
 access to these activities that it's hard for me to measure and 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:12.609
 change of touch 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:16.469
 it's all pretty tight activated activate the mode to fly 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.939
 this one is for them go again you want 

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:23.770
 this December 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.020
 so that's when you pass them to run the mx3 motocross 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:30.789
 break the speed of composing colors and darling here 

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:35.059
 that's the name you and who appear 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.669
 these are instructions 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.669
 today street 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.029
 you can close 

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:51.029
 moreover he was an end and since he was hurt 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.909
 now we know damman kraft 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:55.129
 che 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:58.129
 1 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:00.830
 with its big black assets 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.830
 7th this problem 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.639
 so here's a shirt place quickly 

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:11.309
 wallace what I find 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.310
 to achieve the goals and foot the bunka mode and you neither at ishares is 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.439

 here are now completed but superman these symbols 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:21.449
 I believe 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:24.449
 you also have to know that when you stop flying 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.860
 more letting go coc or rather tuc also suffered losing no damage 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:32.300
 not very practical want to jump 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.289
 down 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:36.210
 ap the career mode 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.389
 we are very fast 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:41.580
 here is the type and the least problem do not hesitate to register on 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.629
