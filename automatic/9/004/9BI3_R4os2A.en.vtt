00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 guest do well or back up creatively 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.000
 been doing it for a long time 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.560
 This exciting ereaders are underway 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.330
 actually synonymous ripped boring 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.340
 therefore, we have not broken wire 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.570
 very often about only one thing 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.769
 we have an exception that there we stand this 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.560
 kobo glo 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.600
 hd this is already an ereader that you on this 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.650
 moment and why this 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.850
 are three reasons 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.380
 and if you think in you here so I have 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.939
 nothing with it then look at this 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.470
 picture or 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.470
 to me that is also possible 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.910
 point 1 that is the screen to the name 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.200
 glow had a little blow then 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.850
 it is an hd screen 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.790
 but well then you will wonder that 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.590
 ever been a grayscale like this then 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.390
 I have the ready would you well that falls 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.700
 in any case, because the letters look 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.440
 her hair hair if you say 3 times then 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.190
 is it more feminine razor 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.239
 from 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.770
 especially if you compare it with the 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.420
 ordinary glow the predecessor of it 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.170
 device then it is a world of 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.210
 difference 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.890
 and definitely worth it according to derksen 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.020
 the handle is now as brown as 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.629
 a nigger 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.609
 that can not be otherwise because when one 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.350
 not being played is the majority 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.030
 of the time on his balcony or on it 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.619
 too caught terrace 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.240
 reason number 2 the built-in lighting 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.470
 and the software that are actually two 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.299
 rain once but it doesn't matter 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.070
 you didn't take the first one with you 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.659
 lighting that works great with many 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.860
 ereaders well known 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.450
 handy in the dark if you are still 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.280
 just in bed what wants to read the software 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.750
 also very cool if I especially like it 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.689
 the pocket support 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.640
 I read internet story and save it 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.869
 read four more reader, I explain that well 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.100
 I enjoy 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.659
 market until we are really new to him and 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.820
 point number three is the price of this 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.900
 you the he costs 130 euros then 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.520
 do you think that's pretty good 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.280
 a lot of money but that is not too bad 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.439
 for an e-reader with such a beautiful HD screen 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.520
 but the kindle voyage for comparison 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.040
 actually compete in 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.590
 for example america is a euro or 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.549
 50 more expensive, so far that is true 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.009
 for your money 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.360
 you know what was crazy it looked black 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.040
 the people in the graveyard I thought 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.829
 initially that it is the weather 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.320
 lay no whiteness 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.000
 to be the open day to start the rain 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.770
 in this thing can not stand water 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.540
 unlike the h2o so I sprint 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.250
 quickly inside has a flaw 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.080
 no entry for a sd card well if 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.379
 that the only flaw is must all 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.400
 participate 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.400
 I think it's great I'll make it 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.560
 hey
