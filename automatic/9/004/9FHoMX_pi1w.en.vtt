00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.850
 hello continue processing in 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.899
 printed circuit boards that is here actually 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.910
 ready circuit board 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.130
 she's circumcised he's here that's great 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.679
 the hole is made under the screwdriver to 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.000
 it was possible to adjust the screw and turn 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.250
 beds here is the middle answer 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.350
 screw attachment 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.109
 Well, actually we drill here small 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.779
 holes to solder parts 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:30.900
 that's actually the most convenient to drill 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.149
 Here is such a Komi drill made from 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.670
 ordinary motor can just buy 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.420
 ready engraver but these souls are engravers 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.430
 sing 220 turns on all the time with this 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.280
 switch in general then acceleration in 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.570
 in the end promise any order 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.440
 the low voltage affairs general have 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.809
 business is more pleasant for everyone we pay 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:01:13.590
 19 holes need to drill this 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:01:16.049
 small drill every board before 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.720
 how to finalize on the machine 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.799
 must be pre-cut 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.080
 scissors for metal 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.750
 but to less time as they say 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.909
 spent on polishing that is literally 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.909
 so roughly we cut off the excess 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.899
 so here they need to drill diameter 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:11.730
 4 millimeter drill hole 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:17.519
 mounts still here here for 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:20.790
 to do in the future in the place where 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:23.970
 we will pass a screwdriver to twist one 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:29.480
 of screws removed just like her 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:33.180
 4 mm scrapping by countersink extends 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.510
 Nut this one can make a hole 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.739
 more 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:43.250
 push actually collected the first board 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:45.120
 the location of the elements here is all 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.549
 unsightly looks because on 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.340
 start rosin fee to it 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:55.379
 become clean you need to rinse either in 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:57.299
 alcohol or solvent to solder need 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:59.370
 only rosin you acid 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.620
 it cannot be applied otherwise 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.600
 the circuit between the tracks here is very 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.290
 I recommend here is such a tool 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.700
 get it in order to 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.810
 tetrahedral scan it for 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:16.459
 if you like the water well, that can be 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:19.170
 do for example his conclusions are thicker than 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.790
 larger diameter than you hole to 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.000
 drill so here's this thing 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:29.040
 you can fit the hole exactly under 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 Nochik size 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.000
 thank you for your attention
