00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:16.429
 Gallen 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.849
 Gallen 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:23.849
 I 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:32.810
 I the Entourage users for the new BMW m3 gt 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.810
 not before the official launch 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.480
 The fans did not start Munich anymore 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.410
 important is the a 9 there is in the city over the situation here as not 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.600
 reached 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.670
 on beautiful winding country roads, the users have the opportunity 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.460
 ten years in Paris to put through its paces 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.810
 No 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.030
 dor 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.340
 well 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.700
 The lunch break they use to test their test reports 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.759
 furthermore, you are ready to submit 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.129
 a juso name of the gallery of the booming 07 i was invited to the new m3 too 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.129
 test 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:22.239
 despite a 8 90 I have the moderate Cen 30 m 3 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:26.119
 barely 5 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:27.809
 again a 3 

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:30.229
 because currently in pentagonal moment 

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:33.779
 info 10 the new m3 is compared to my m5 

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:36.289
 almost comparable in terms of performance 

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:38.999
 he has almost the same acceleration values 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:41.999
 next to high speed range is yes absolutely 

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:45.509
 Percent equal to the m5 by the that the low weight 

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:49.709
 is crucial for the acceleration 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.879
 The suspension is a fantastic he is on the road where you have long gone 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.909
 right there he goes and saw the new v8 engine 

00:02:57.479 --> 00:03:00.369
 indescribably 

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:03.369
 Bebens goes through the mark and leg 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.930
 Ramesh could go to Schuhbeck inside of BI in Yemen today 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.930
 have been testing the m3 framework on this user test 

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:18.729
 Did he do something? 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:23.129
 the fire was in three sentences 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.809
 These provided Stuff further transferred which direction that is it will be 

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:29.860
 Surprised that the car Tunisia 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.910
 uncompromising proven form history has been firmly driven out of the wool 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.819
 we partly meet there 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.189
 the new Asus much more comfortable 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:42.689
 Cars are just that directness that LASIK the Fields brains and does 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:44.169
 great fun in the 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:46.349
 that's enough 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.329
 good hospitality is however it is in 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.059
 she leads now in the 3rd 

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:55.849
 In the standards or be very successful Dante get a new threesome Eulgem 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.309
 a bit skeptical of the design 

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:02.930
 To Hopp Dennis 46 Freezing must be so stylistic icon as it is said today 

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:06.639
 also we go from the threesome made feint very successful so the 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:07.799
 SEC 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.219
 find it very interesting 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:11.280
 soldo wanted to Merkel's fist 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.680
 overall there are subtleties such as the mirror and the interior from 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.519
 Toro Rosso, that must be around 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.490
 usually Owen allowed him Â«in the 89 years old 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.809
 Apartments will be 

00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:31.030
 who saw thereby the optics 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.680
 I was very impressed by the pictures I first got at the new Hamburg Senate 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.289
 I was very convinced that the vehicle came 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:41.039
 but rather something about perhaps so elegantly private not the necessary 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:43.009
 Aggressiveness from the optics 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:45.569
 but I have to say Michel had the vehicles on 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:48.909
 It was the first time I saw it live 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:52.050
 if not as better taught 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.499
 Hansmann's first races overseas fell to the modern day so far 

00:04:56.499 --> 00:05:00.049
 because I joined the adventure when we did and I believe in doing so 

00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:03.049
 want to stay 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:25.400
 This certainly will not be the last one of your own responsibility 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.480
