00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:10.110
 I want to tell you about inexpensive legs 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:16.529
 somewhere for $ 20 but even cheaper 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:21.680
 somewhere around 18 18 dollars 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:25.619
 a knife called a squirrel from the company Knight 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:29.880
 you know about 750 rubles a day 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:34.340
 not exactly for sure we get this 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:37.590
 I do not like to kind of the same with these covers 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.040
 prefer clips but see what 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.329
 cool case comes 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.300
 possibility of horizontal vertical 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.539
 Suspension beautiful button 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:53.010
 he holds a form not just some 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.180
 inside soft lo improve very 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.989
 cool case 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:03.590
 just like that if someone loves with covers 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.590
 then he is very good here we go to the knife 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:11.360
 Here is such a knife protein from the company 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.360
 knight 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:24.380
 well let's start 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.380
 Colin screens in our center 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.650
 we align on 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.619
 on the blade on the other hand there is 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:43.020
 so he drank and at the moment when 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.930
 the knife opens he just feels that 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.700
 hop he got up 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.700
 I do not know why this can be done in order 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.360
 to feel at the moment of closing that 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:02:00.570
 need to remove our fingers opens up 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:02.940
 soft enough lock softly too 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.890
 enough to open shrinks without any 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.070
 discomfort 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:17.280
 there is a slight vertical gap 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:17.640
 absolutely minimal mouth on knives more 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.280
 min 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.060
 famous companies such as tank from 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:35.150
 gifts I saw the same suite you even 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:36.299
 more steel on it 65 by 13 here we have 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.090
 enough 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:42.570
 not very pretty but very comfortable 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:46.799
 opening for opening such a notch on 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:49.340
 butt as normal is completely not 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:53.489
 nagging finger so quite good 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.670
 rises here maybe first was the average 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.590
 I sharpened him a lot 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.160
 peretochil here from Lansk as you see 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.640
 small traces remain on the polish 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:10.350
 See how polished it is. 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.299
 just a mirror is very cool everything is all 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.040
 fittings 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:16.769
 polished also very nice 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:21.799
 inside there were too polished 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:25.910
 a little dirt cleaned up his moment 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:29.940
 Here is such a cool legs of the handle of beech 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:33.780
 so strong enough soaked 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.760
 oil in general, then he and so well well I 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.519
 I would not say that maybe he is saturated 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.840
 already 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:42.200
 because the oil was not so absorbed 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:45.440
 instantly we have plexus deep 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:49.849
 landing very good faith in measure 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:52.030
 hard keep good keeps it on 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:55.160
 pocket 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.720
 where the knife is made I unfortunately do not 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:02.290
 I know maybe in China 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:05.720
 Either in Russia you need to see more 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:13.250
 site maker here is such a knife 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:20.870
 let's compare with a very good rat 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:24.430
 budget option can no claims in 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.430
 complete with case with case 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:36.240
 so the protein knife is made by the company see 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:40.289
 which is a subsidiary of 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:43.380
 viking norway more precisely norway trade 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:46.780
 at least it is written 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:50.800
 certificates for 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:53.830
 non liven by one opinion they 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:57.960
 made in china in another opinion they are 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.960
 are made somewhere under Nizhny Novgorod 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:06.490
 the certificate says it can do 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:10.020
 Russian company viking norway 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:15.910
 troit if someone knows more 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:23.139
 write in the comments let them too 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:26.910
 I hate to take want plasticine 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:26.910
 a piece of iron so I almost hit 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.200
 quitting fails
