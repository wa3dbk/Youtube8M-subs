00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.939
 good facundo with what picture 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.260
 they found just arrived at the place 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:14.570
 good to get to the good place in my 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.340
 good place I was a driver 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.230
 when we get to the place we find 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:24.230
 something very shocking toward the 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:28.610
 sinister what we did is a triage the 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:32.570
 tc is evaluated by the state system 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.640
 of the victims and access the wing as 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.730
 who says the worst one is 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.310
 to be able to rescue her and be transferred 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.380
 to the hospital behind doctors 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.810
 well I upset them a little bit everything 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.880
 the work is not like that is just as we arrived 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.500
 place is good it was not raining but 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.500
 same as seeing the panorama 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.050
 the tasks were divided we started 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.300
 do the rescue of the little boy of 6 years 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.809
 for us very impressive to the 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.300
 find her other victims are more than 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.710
 all for being one of the first times 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.390
 that we arrive when arriving at the place 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:12.100
 we found a habit of that magnitude 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.619
 a very dark area follows a very shadow 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.390
 dark and we use what is enlightenment 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.759
 artificial what is the ammunition of the 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.800
 trucks and good what we could 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.170
 illuminate when arriving at the place of lighting 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.540
 with the trucks and the flashlights that 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.850
 we had in facundo some of the 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.020
 people who died at the time 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.509
 although you arrived still 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.630
 they found alive they could do something 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:38.520
 some resuscitation exercise help them 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.619
 well we just got to the place 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.469
 We went as I told you tenth the triage 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.810
 and the only thing we saw was that it 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:47.159
 they found the milestone alive 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.950
 directly we went directly to 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.200
 try to like who says break the 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.229
 vehicle to be able to take out the creature 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.360
 that was the one that mattered most to us and good 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.899
 what can we can show the rescue 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.400
 without any other problem anymore 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:07.670
 that the sinister and good 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.690
 we take out the roof and we can bring it to the 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.600
 victim 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.490
 with the doctors at the hospital how 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.300
 does to get strength in that 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.190
 moment 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.680
 in such a terrible situation, the 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.230
 I've been here for 14 years now 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.110
 the barracks 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.909
 it takes itself out of the instinct of the 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.040
 adrenaline once it is because no 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:31.580
 we go to the service we fall a little 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.909
 like at this moment but we could 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.840
 work and we were able to do the work that 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:37.840
 there are things like you start
