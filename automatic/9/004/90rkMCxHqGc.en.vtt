00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
hand you hold it as you're playing the a

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.259 
hand you hold it as you're playing the a
and<00:02:13.250> then<00:02:13.370> you<00:02:13.459> let<00:02:13.670> it<00:02:13.700> go<00:02:13.790> when<00:02:14.030> you're<00:02:14.120> done

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
and then you let it go when you're done

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.120 
and then you let it go when you're done
and<00:02:14.300> then<00:02:14.510> when<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:15.019> start<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.709> pattern

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
and then when you start the pattern

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.630 
and then when you start the pattern
again<00:02:16.430> then<00:02:16.610> you<00:02:16.640> play<00:02:17.090> it<00:02:17.180> again<00:02:17.830> so<00:02:18.830> an<00:02:19.160> axe

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
again then you play it again so an axe

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.309 
again then you play it again so an axe
so<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.209> actual<00:02:20.330> speed<00:02:20.690> of<00:02:20.810> it<00:02:20.930> would<00:02:21.080> be<00:02:21.200> like

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
so the actual speed of it would be like

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:37.870 
so the actual speed of it would be like
this<00:02:35.410> so<00:02:36.410> that<00:02:36.560> is<00:02:36.709> basically<00:02:36.739> it<00:02:37.310> with<00:02:37.670> the

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
this so that is basically it with the
