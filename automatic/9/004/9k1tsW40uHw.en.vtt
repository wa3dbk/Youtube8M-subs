press<00:00:21.740> this<00:00:21.980> vehicle<00:00:22.789> is<00:00:22.880> gonna<00:00:23.169> slide<00:00:24.169> back

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
press this vehicle is gonna slide back

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.720 
press this vehicle is gonna slide back
over<00:00:24.410> the<00:00:24.830> main<00:00:24.980> wheels<00:00:26.949> let<00:00:27.949> me<00:00:28.009> tip<00:00:28.220> back<00:00:28.519> and

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
over the main wheels let me tip back and

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.880 
over the main wheels let me tip back and
now<00:00:28.789> we're<00:00:29.000> now<00:00:29.390> we're<00:00:29.449> balanced<00:00:30.050> it's<00:00:30.349> Ciroc

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
now we're now we're balanced it's Ciroc

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.259 
now we're now we're balanced it's Ciroc
they're<00:00:31.130> balanced<00:00:31.519> on<00:00:31.640> just<00:00:31.910> two<00:00:32.239> wheels

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:32.269 
they're balanced on just two wheels

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:35.350 
they're balanced on just two wheels
that's<00:00:32.809> right<00:00:33.050> yep<00:00:33.440> and<00:00:33.680> if<00:00:33.920> I<00:00:34.120> this<00:00:35.120> whole

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
that's right yep and if I this whole

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.930 
that's right yep and if I this whole
screen<00:00:35.720> will<00:00:36.320> turn<00:00:36.559> four<00:00:37.040> steering<00:00:37.430> so<00:00:37.699> right

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
screen will turn four steering so right

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.650 
screen will turn four steering so right
now<00:00:38.089> we're<00:00:38.330> spinning<00:00:38.989> in<00:00:39.290> place<00:00:40.239> so<00:00:41.239> zero

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
now we're spinning in place so zero

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.750 
now we're spinning in place so zero
meter<00:00:42.129> zero<00:00:43.129> foot<00:00:43.340> turning<00:00:43.579> radius<00:00:45.760> forward

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
meter zero foot turning radius forward

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.319 
meter zero foot turning radius forward
tilt<00:00:47.750> the<00:00:47.840> handgrips

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
tilt the handgrips

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.420 
tilt the handgrips
you<00:00:50.329> don't<00:00:50.559> and<00:00:51.559> if<00:00:51.680> I<00:00:51.739> bring<00:00:51.920> it<00:00:52.039> back<00:00:52.070> to<00:00:52.340> the

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
you don't and if I bring it back to the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.799 
you don't and if I bring it back to the
neutral<00:00:52.730> position<00:00:52.760> we'll<00:00:53.270> start<00:00:53.600> slowing

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
neutral position we'll start slowing

00:00:53.809 --> 00:01:02.529 
neutral position we'll start slowing
down<00:01:00.910> so<00:01:01.910> it's<00:01:02.030> all<00:01:02.120> controlled<00:01:02.449> by<00:01:02.480> the

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
down so it's all controlled by the

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.689 
down so it's all controlled by the
positioning<00:01:03.170> of<00:01:03.320> your<00:01:03.379> kind<00:01:04.220> of<00:01:04.280> dashboard

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
positioning of your kind of dashboard

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.139 
positioning of your kind of dashboard
there<00:01:04.850> yeah<00:01:05.380> and<00:01:06.380> then<00:01:06.890> what<00:01:07.280> is<00:01:07.399> the<00:01:07.640> with

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:08.149 
there yeah and then what is the with

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:10.359 
there yeah and then what is the with
your<00:01:08.270> thumb<00:01:08.509> control<00:01:08.720> that's<00:01:09.289> what<00:01:09.470> I<00:01:09.500> think

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
your thumb control that's what I think

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:11.950 
your thumb control that's what I think
yeah<00:01:10.670> so<00:01:10.820> this<00:01:10.940> this<00:01:11.179> controls<00:01:11.539> the<00:01:11.630> speed

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
yeah so this this controls the speed

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.740 
yeah so this this controls the speed
okay<00:01:12.500> so<00:01:13.250> tilting<00:01:13.580> it<00:01:13.700> forward<00:01:13.729> speeds<00:01:14.360> us<00:01:14.570> up

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
okay so tilting it forward speeds us up

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.570 
okay so tilting it forward speeds us up
and<00:01:15.049> pulling<00:01:15.320> it<00:01:15.470> back<00:01:15.500> sells<00:01:15.890> us<00:01:16.009> down<00:01:16.189> if<00:01:16.490> I

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
and pulling it back sells us down if I

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.550 
and pulling it back sells us down if I
pull<00:01:16.759> back<00:01:16.790> and<00:01:16.909> hold<00:01:17.210> like<00:01:17.390> this<00:01:17.600> it<00:01:17.810> stops

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
pull back and hold like this it stops

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.330 
pull back and hold like this it stops
fairly<00:01:19.009> quickly<00:01:20.770> and<00:01:21.770> what's<00:01:22.070> the<00:01:22.130> top<00:01:22.310> speed

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
fairly quickly and what's the top speed

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.149 
fairly quickly and what's the top speed
it<00:01:22.670> is<00:01:22.960> this<00:01:23.960> is<00:01:24.140> designed<00:01:24.470> for<00:01:24.530> about<00:01:24.740> 25

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
it is this is designed for about 25

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.130 
it is this is designed for about 25
miles<00:01:25.579> per<00:01:25.700> hour<00:01:25.850> over<00:01:25.990> 40<00:01:26.990> km/h<00:01:28.840> you<00:01:29.840> know<00:01:29.960> and

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
miles per hour over 40 km/h you know and

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.260 
miles per hour over 40 km/h you know and
when<00:01:30.560> you're<00:01:30.650> stuck<00:01:30.860> in<00:01:30.979> traffic<00:01:31.150> that<00:01:32.150> was

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
when you're stuck in traffic that was

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.940 
when you're stuck in traffic that was
like<00:01:32.630> really<00:01:33.320> fast

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
like really fast

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.030 
like really fast
yeah<00:01:34.180> but<00:01:35.180> yeah<00:01:35.780> so<00:01:35.990> you<00:01:36.290> know<00:01:36.350> in<00:01:36.500> that<00:01:36.860> kind

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
yeah but yeah so you know in that kind

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.510 
yeah but yeah so you know in that kind
of<00:01:37.189> density<00:01:38.149> environment<00:01:38.869> that's<00:01:39.520> because

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
of density environment that's because

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.639 
of density environment that's because
there's<00:01:40.880> a<00:01:40.939> reasonable<00:01:41.869> speed<00:01:41.990> especially<00:01:42.350> if

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
there's a reasonable speed especially if

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.380 
there's a reasonable speed especially if
everybody<00:01:42.950> starts<00:01:43.670> coordinating<00:01:44.210> it<00:01:44.270> can

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
everybody starts coordinating it can

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.060 
everybody starts coordinating it can
flow<00:01:44.570> more<00:01:44.780> smoothly<00:01:45.140> then

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.270 

that'll<00:01:48.820> be<00:01:49.000> a<00:01:49.350> good<00:01:50.350> way<00:01:50.530> to<00:01:50.590> get<00:01:50.740> around<00:01:51.720> this

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
that'll be a good way to get around this

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:06.160 
that'll be a good way to get around this
push<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.310> button<00:01:54.610> again<00:01:54.640> to<00:01:54.820> land

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.830 

awesome<00:02:07.170> thank<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.440> very<00:02:07.650> much
