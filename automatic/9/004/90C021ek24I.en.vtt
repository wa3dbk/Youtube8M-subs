make sure it they eat quite wet when you

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.830 
make sure it they eat quite wet when you
pour<00:05:05.740> it<00:05:05.830> on<00:05:06.009> so<00:05:06.280> you<00:05:06.340> can<00:05:06.729> maneuver<00:05:07.360> it<00:05:07.509> around

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
pour it on so you can maneuver it around

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.170

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.860 

I'll<00:05:42.710> wait<00:05:42.920> for<00:05:43.130> that<00:05:43.160> to<00:05:43.430> completely<00:05:44.090> dry<00:05:44.540> and

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
I'll wait for that to completely dry and

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.840 
I'll wait for that to completely dry and
then<00:05:45.050> we'll<00:05:45.170> file<00:05:45.470> it<00:05:45.580> so<00:05:46.580> now<00:05:46.730> it's

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
then we'll file it so now it's

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.170

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
completely dry you can hear it you must

00:05:50.180 --> 00:06:11.719 
completely dry you can hear it you must
make<00:05:50.420> sure<00:05:50.630> it's<00:05:50.780> dry<00:05:50.930> before<00:05:51.350> you<00:05:51.470> file

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:11.729 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:19.280 

you

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.930 

and<00:06:20.290> then<00:06:20.410> all<00:06:20.560> you<00:06:20.680> do<00:06:20.890> is<00:06:21.220> just<00:06:21.430> go<00:06:21.520> a<00:06:21.640> black

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940 
and then all you do is just go a black

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.820 
and then all you do is just go a black
striper<00:06:22.330> and<00:06:22.750> if<00:06:22.840> you<00:06:22.960> see<00:06:23.140> any<00:06:23.320> mistake

00:06:39.019 --> 00:06:39.029 

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:40.939 

that's<00:06:39.839> a<00:06:39.959> dry<00:06:40.199> and<00:06:40.439> then<00:06:40.589> I'm<00:06:40.709> going<00:06:40.889> to

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:40.949
