00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.750
 welcome to a program like this 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.089
 works 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.639
 glasses are not the only correction tool 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.190
 View but also a fashion accessory is not important 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.330
 what frames do you like more 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.969
 plastic or metal 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.070
 their diversity is so great both in color and 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.750
 in shape and in size that you must 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.750
 can pick something for yourself 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.660
 metal frames are all kinds 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.939
 Forms as simple and extravagant 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.070
 it all starts with computerized 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.260
 systems called 3 axial 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.719
 winding machine where several rollers 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.390
 pull metal wire with big 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.489
 coils then with mathematical precision 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.920
 machines bends wire giving it 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.440
 rim shape and leaving unfixed 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.450
 the end inside the rim is a groove where 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.450
 spectacle lenses will be inserted 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.160
 further ends are fixed with 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.530
 small detail called liner 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.170
 To install the liners it is clamped in 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.480
 vice and on top fix the frame further 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.659
 cause a remedy called 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.270
 liquefy il then bring the welding 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.070
 wire and by electricity 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.490
 heat metal wire 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.490
 rimmed liner until they 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.490
 fused 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.600
 then do the same thing with the detail 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.420
 called the hinge which holds together 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.450
 temples itself rim and again with the help 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.329
 current update hinge and liner this 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.829
 a process similar to soldering by light solder 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.829
 called hard solder 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:44.120
 and now it is the turn of the saddle small 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:49.010
 the press bends a piece of metal giving 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:51.140
 he is arc shaped then maker 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.430
 lays out about the right saddle in a row on 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.650
 assembly machine 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:59.330
 this procedure guarantees the perfect 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:00.950
 evenness of the product and again they 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.000
 soldered to each other using 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.000
 hard solder 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.930
 then comes the turn of the details 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.930
 above bridge saddle 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.590
 machine cuts metal wire 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.280
 into pieces of the desired length make the recess 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.850
 at the ends so that the brain sits tightly on top 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.850
 rims 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.000
 then bend it to give the desired shape 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.040
 now it is set in its place 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.500
 to remove dust and dirt which can 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.590
 interfere with the welding process and causes 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.970
 a little cleaning solution then a bridge 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.970
 soldered to the right 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.349
 next is the turn of the little hooks 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.720
 called nose stops on them 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:13.170
 pads are placed that weaken 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.840
 friction stop and nose manufacturer 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.410
 soldered them to the right with all that 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.610
 same 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.610
 hard solder 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.720
 then it comes to the details which 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.920
 fasten on one side to rule the other 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:39.140
 dress in their ear they are also called bows 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.150
 or for nicknames as well as turns for 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.459
 ears so that the glasses are firmly on his head 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.530
 after on the inside 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.739
 imprinted size right and and make 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.900
 a hinge is soldered to each hostage 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:54.880
 secure to the right and to the other end 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.880
 plastic tip is worn 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:08.019
 for now let us lay the temples aside and 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.019
 insert the lens into the groove inside the rim 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:20.260
 cog provides tight reliable 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:23.670
 mounts further temples rim 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.670
 fasten with each other 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.150
 most eyewear model glasses 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.980
 have a curved outer end or 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.830
 the tip is these plastic parts 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.430
 bend at 45 degrees with 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:49.000
 special unit called 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.000
 mechanical fist 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.350
 These comfortable and fashionable glasses in 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.520
 metal frame required 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.520
 will attract attention
