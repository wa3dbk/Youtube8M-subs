00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.220 

so<00:00:01.800> as<00:00:02.610> you<00:00:02.850> can<00:00:03.030> see<00:00:03.090> there<00:00:03.600> is<00:00:03.720> a<00:00:04.580> vertical

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:06.230 
so as you can see there is a vertical

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.169 
so as you can see there is a vertical
line<00:00:07.230> down<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.950> middle<00:00:07.980> of<00:00:08.840> the<00:00:09.840> screen<00:00:10.080> and

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:11.179 
line down the middle of the screen and

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.680 
line down the middle of the screen and
also<00:00:12.179> if<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:13.340> gently<00:00:14.340> touch<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.880> screen<00:00:15.450> like

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
also if you gently touch the screen like

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.500 
also if you gently touch the screen like
this<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:16.410> will<00:00:16.770> go<00:00:17.010> creaking<00:00:17.609> from<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.119> hinges

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
this it will go creaking from the hinges

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:37.170 
this it will go creaking from the hinges
again

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.750 

despite<00:00:38.180> this<00:00:38.420> being<00:00:38.720> fixed<00:00:39.560> I<00:00:39.860> think<00:00:40.160> now<00:00:40.400> for

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
despite this being fixed I think now for

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.420 
despite this being fixed I think now for
the<00:00:40.850> third<00:00:41.090> time<00:00:43.390> also<00:00:44.390> as<00:00:44.720> you<00:00:44.960> can<00:00:44.990> tell<00:00:45.770> this

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
the third time also as you can tell this

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.110 
the third time also as you can tell this
is<00:00:46.640> not<00:00:46.670> just<00:00:47.210> software<00:00:47.780> related<00:00:48.140> because<00:00:49.120> if

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
is not just software related because if

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.870 
is not just software related because if
I<00:00:50.270> would<00:00:50.450> restart<00:00:50.930> the<00:00:51.110> computer<00:00:54.580> they<00:00:55.580> see

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
I would restart the computer they see

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.290 
I would restart the computer they see
the<00:00:55.940> line<00:00:56.270> is<00:00:56.950> there<00:00:57.950> even<00:00:58.400> when<00:00:58.550> window<00:00:59.000> shuts

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
the line is there even when window shuts

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.680 
the line is there even when window shuts
down<00:00:59.570> and<00:01:01.690> as<00:01:02.690> you<00:01:02.750> can<00:01:03.280> soon<00:01:04.280> see<00:01:04.510> even<00:01:05.510> with

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
down and as you can soon see even with

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:12.090 
down and as you can soon see even with
reboots<00:01:07.390> so<00:01:08.390> this<00:01:08.570> is<00:01:08.979> clearly<00:01:09.979> not<00:01:10.190> a

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
reboots so this is clearly not a

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.850 
reboots so this is clearly not a
software<00:01:13.100> or<00:01:13.840> driver<00:01:14.840> issue<00:01:15.110> it<00:01:15.350> seems<00:01:15.590> to<00:01:15.770> be

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
software or driver issue it seems to be

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.120 
software or driver issue it seems to be
the<00:01:15.979> screen<00:01:16.250> itself<00:01:18.670> there<00:01:19.670> you<00:01:19.760> see<00:01:19.910> the<00:01:20.030> line
