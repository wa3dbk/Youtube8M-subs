point<00:00:19.770> you<00:00:20.189> may<00:00:20.520> have<00:00:20.730> seen<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:20.970> scrim<00:00:21.390> with

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
point you may have seen a scrim with

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.990 
point you may have seen a scrim with
enable<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.160> that<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.340> basically<00:00:23.730> because

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
enable and that is basically because

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.910 
enable and that is basically because
we're<00:00:24.600> gonna<00:00:24.779> be<00:00:25.019> using<00:00:25.380> him<00:00:25.529> instead<00:00:25.859> of

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
we're gonna be using him instead of

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.310 
we're gonna be using him instead of
karma<00:00:26.369> for<00:00:26.580> ESWC<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.689> gfinity

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
karma for ESWC and gfinity

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.820 
karma for ESWC and gfinity
and<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:29.039> reasoning<00:00:29.490> behind<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.449> that

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
and the reasoning behind that is is that

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.130 
and the reasoning behind that is is that
Damon<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:32.009> think<00:00:32.850> he's<00:00:32.940> from<00:00:33.090> Ontario<00:00:33.870> or

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
Damon I think he's from Ontario or

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.510 
Damon I think he's from Ontario or
something<00:00:34.500> like<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:35.010> know<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.309> land

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
something like that you know the land

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.500 
something like that you know the land
the<00:00:35.940> land<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.480> Canadians<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.559> land<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:38.040> a

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
the land of the Canadians the land of a

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:45.139

guys<00:00:48.270> can<00:00:48.510> take<00:00:48.660> me<00:00:48.870> if<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.469> see<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> scrim<00:00:50.100> in

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
guys can take me if you see a scrim in

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.889 
guys can take me if you see a scrim in
with<00:00:50.340> enabled<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.180> reason<00:00:51.449> why<00:00:51.570> and

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
with enabled that is the reason why and

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.229 
with enabled that is the reason why and
basically<00:00:52.289> after<00:00:52.620> these<00:00:53.550> two<00:00:53.760> events<00:00:53.910> are

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
basically after these two events are

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.389 
basically after these two events are
done<00:00:54.719> then<00:00:55.199> we're<00:00:55.410> just<00:00:55.440> everything's<00:00:56.190> back

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
done then we're just everything's back

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.250 
done then we're just everything's back
to<00:00:56.430> normal<00:00:56.579> or<00:00:57.000> playing<00:00:57.180> game<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:57.600> full<00:00:57.750> time<00:00:57.989> I

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
to normal or playing game in full time I

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.770 
to normal or playing game in full time I
think<00:00:58.590> at<00:00:58.859> ESWC<00:00:59.160> we're<00:00:59.850> playing<00:01:00.059> against<00:01:00.329> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
think at ESWC we're playing against the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.200 
think at ESWC we're playing against the
two<00:01:00.960> American<00:01:01.379> teams<00:01:01.620> are<00:01:01.859> denial<00:01:02.340> in<00:01:02.550> TR<00:01:02.910> and

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
two American teams are denial in TR and

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.820 
two American teams are denial in TR and
then<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.899> rest<00:01:04.080> are<00:01:04.170> gonna<00:01:04.290> be<00:01:04.439> European

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830
