00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.330 

the<00:00:03.149> other<00:00:03.300> place<00:00:03.690> that<00:00:04.050> we<00:00:04.649> really<00:00:05.069> really

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:05.340 
the other place that we really really

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.810 
the other place that we really really
like<00:00:05.550> a<00:00:05.580> lot<00:00:05.910> of<00:00:05.970> out<00:00:07.040> we<00:00:08.040> like<00:00:08.160> to<00:00:08.340> run<00:00:08.460> a<00:00:08.519> lot

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
like a lot of out we like to run a lot

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.390 
like a lot of out we like to run a lot
out<00:00:09.090> of<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.389> gun<00:00:11.750> is<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.990> mid<00:00:13.170> line<00:00:13.350> and<00:00:13.710> you

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
out of the gun is the mid line and you

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.730 
out of the gun is the mid line and you
would<00:00:14.519> think<00:00:14.790> that<00:00:15.120> you<00:00:15.840> really<00:00:16.080> couldn't<00:00:16.470> run

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
would think that you really couldn't run

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.890 
would think that you really couldn't run
the<00:00:16.890> mid<00:00:17.130> line<00:00:17.400> out<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.330> gun<00:00:18.630> but<00:00:18.839> you

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
the mid line out of the gun but you

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.669 
the mid line out of the gun but you
absolutely<00:00:19.619> can<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:21.029> just<00:00:21.390> depends<00:00:22.019> on<00:00:22.199> where

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:22.679 
absolutely can it just depends on where

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:24.560 
absolutely can it just depends on where
the<00:00:22.829> defense's<00:00:23.429> align<00:00:23.730> no<00:00:23.909> we<00:00:24.060> do<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.239> lot<00:00:24.539> of

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
the defense's align no we do a lot of

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.550 
the defense's align no we do a lot of
things<00:00:24.929> with<00:00:25.589> our<00:00:25.769> quarterback<00:00:27.140> we<00:00:28.140> do<00:00:28.259> a<00:00:28.289> lot

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
things with our quarterback we do a lot

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.809 
things with our quarterback we do a lot
of<00:00:28.589> things<00:00:28.829> with<00:00:28.949> our<00:00:29.009> quarterback<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.609> put

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:29.819 
of things with our quarterback that put

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:31.489 
of things with our quarterback that put
the<00:00:29.909> onus<00:00:30.060> on<00:00:30.390> him<00:00:30.599> we're<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.810> big<00:00:31.019> believer<00:00:31.289> in

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:31.499 
the onus on him we're a big believer in

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:33.560 
the onus on him we're a big believer in
that<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:32.279> we'll<00:00:32.489> give<00:00:32.669> our<00:00:32.820> quarterback<00:00:33.060> be

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
that so we'll give our quarterback be

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.319 
that so we'll give our quarterback be
literally<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.380> option<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.219> call<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.059> entire

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
literally the option to call the entire

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.439 
literally the option to call the entire
offense<00:00:36.899> he<00:00:37.680> has<00:00:37.859> the<00:00:38.039> option<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.730> literally

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:39.449 
offense he has the option to literally

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:41.779 
offense he has the option to literally
audible<00:00:40.019> from<00:00:40.170> one<00:00:40.350> play<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.679> next<00:00:40.859> based<00:00:41.609> on

00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:41.789 
audible from one play the next based on

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:43.279 
audible from one play the next based on
a<00:00:41.850> line<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.269> will<00:00:42.420> pair<00:00:42.690> up<00:00:42.719> our<00:00:43.019> plays

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:43.289 
a line that will pair up our plays

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:46.040 
a line that will pair up our plays
sometimes<00:00:44.000> literally<00:00:45.000> just<00:00:45.239> say<00:00:45.390> option<00:00:45.929> on

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
sometimes literally just say option on

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.529 
sometimes literally just say option on
me<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.410> then<00:00:46.500> he<00:00:46.530> chooses<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.820> plague<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.359> be

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
me and then he chooses the plague to be

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.590 
me and then he chooses the plague to be
to<00:00:49.140> be<00:00:49.289> run<00:00:49.559> based<00:00:49.920> on<00:00:50.100> what<00:00:50.309> he<00:00:50.460> sees<00:00:50.730> we

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
to be run based on what he sees we

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.599 
to be run based on what he sees we
really<00:00:51.989> like<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.350> when<00:00:52.440> teams<00:00:52.739> stem<00:00:53.129> because

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:53.609 
really like it when teams stem because

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:55.040 
really like it when teams stem because
that<00:00:53.879> puts<00:00:54.120> them<00:00:54.269> out<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.539> position

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
that puts them out of position

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.500 
that puts them out of position
I<00:00:55.199> mean<00:00:55.710> sometimes<00:00:56.219> we<00:00:56.399> can<00:00:56.579> force<00:00:56.910> teams<00:00:57.269> to

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
I mean sometimes we can force teams to

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.349 
I mean sometimes we can force teams to
stem<00:00:57.809> based<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:59.070> where<00:00:59.399> they're<00:00:59.579> at<00:00:59.670> I<00:01:00.089> really

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
stem based on where they're at I really

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.139 
stem based on where they're at I really
like<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.719> too<00:01:01.550> he<00:01:02.550> does<00:01:02.789> get<00:01:02.999> to<00:01:03.120> be

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
like that too he does get to be

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.790 
like that too he does get to be
predictable<00:01:03.659> occasionally<00:01:05.750> so<00:01:06.750> we<00:01:07.320> will<00:01:07.590> run

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
predictable occasionally so we will run

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.470 
predictable occasionally so we will run
the<00:01:08.010> midline<00:01:08.370> midline<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:08.940> a<00:01:09.000> great<00:01:09.300> way<00:01:09.450> to

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 
the midline midline is a great way to

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.500 
the midline midline is a great way to
attack<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.080> center<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.500> defense<00:01:11.510> same

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
attack the center of a defense same

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.640 
attack the center of a defense same
thing<00:01:12.870> he<00:01:13.830> takes<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.250> slide<00:01:14.550> step<00:01:14.880> but<00:01:15.090> now<00:01:15.650> he's

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
thing he takes a slide step but now he's

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.930 
thing he takes a slide step but now he's
aiming<00:01:17.010> for<00:01:17.880> they<00:01:18.000> get<00:01:18.270> for<00:01:18.510> the<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:19.260> cheek<00:01:19.620> of

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
aiming for they get for the the cheek of

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.910 
aiming for they get for the the cheek of
the<00:01:20.940> center<00:01:21.330> whichever<00:01:21.780> player<00:01:22.380> running<00:01:22.800> in

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
the center whichever player running in

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.830 
the center whichever player running in
this<00:01:23.100> case<00:01:25.760> we're<00:01:26.760> calling<00:01:27.120> it<00:01:27.240> either<00:01:27.360> 10<00:01:27.690> or

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
this case we're calling it either 10 or

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.920 
this case we're calling it either 10 or
11<00:01:28.260> 10<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.190> course<00:01:29.460> being<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.360> right<00:01:30.390> and

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
11 10 of course being to the right and

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.370 
11 10 of course being to the right and
then<00:01:31.380> 11<00:01:31.680> being<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.550> the<00:01:32.670> left<00:01:32.910> the<00:01:33.900> step<00:01:34.200> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
then 11 being to the left the step the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.620 
then 11 being to the left the step the
footwork<00:01:34.800> doesn't<00:01:35.250> really<00:01:35.400> change<00:01:35.630> except

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
footwork doesn't really change except

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.150 
footwork doesn't really change except
for<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.870> me<00:01:37.050> point<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.710> quarterback

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
for the a me point and the quarterback

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.480 
for the a me point and the quarterback
has<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.700> be<00:01:38.940> cognizant<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.630> fact<00:01:39.690> that<00:01:40.490> he

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
has to be cognizant of the fact that he

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.660 
has to be cognizant of the fact that he
cannot<00:01:41.910> have<00:01:42.270> his<00:01:42.570> feet<00:01:42.960> on<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.460> midline<00:01:44.460> like

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
cannot have his feet on the midline like

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.060 
cannot have his feet on the midline like
12<00:01:44.940> and<00:01:45.090> 13<00:01:45.510> but<00:01:45.660> rather<00:01:45.870> the<00:01:46.140> ball<00:01:46.410> has<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.770> be

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
12 and 13 but rather the ball has to be

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.220 
12 and 13 but rather the ball has to be
on<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.370> midline<00:01:47.760> which<00:01:48.390> means<00:01:48.660> that<00:01:48.870> he<00:01:49.050> has

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:49.230 
on the midline which means that he has

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.940 
on the midline which means that he has
to<00:01:49.410> step<00:01:49.740> here<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.970> order<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.360> get<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.750> mash<00:01:51.960> so

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
to step here in order to get the mash so

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.130 
to step here in order to get the mash so
literally<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:53.880> instance<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.570> ball<00:01:54.810> is

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
literally in this instance the ball is

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.720 
literally in this instance the ball is
on<00:01:55.260> the<00:01:55.320> midline<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.770> rule<00:01:56.130> still<00:01:56.370> holds

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
on the midline the rule still holds

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.580 
on the midline the rule still holds
where<00:01:57.150> he's<00:01:57.270> going<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.420> attack<00:01:57.810> but<00:01:58.410> he's

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
where he's going to attack but he's

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.520 
where he's going to attack but he's
going<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.860> attack<00:01:59.190> off<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.760> midline<00:02:00.380> so<00:02:01.380> that

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
going to attack off the midline so that

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.650 
going to attack off the midline so that
he<00:02:01.650> can<00:02:01.800> put<00:02:02.010> the<00:02:02.040> ball<00:02:02.160> on<00:02:02.580> the<00:02:03.000> midline<00:02:03.420> and

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
he can put the ball on the midline and

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.500 
he can put the ball on the midline and
if<00:02:04.410> he<00:02:04.590> if<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.190> worked<00:02:05.880> those<00:02:06.090> steps<00:02:06.330> that

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
if he if you worked those steps that

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.859 
if he if you worked those steps that
just<00:02:06.690> takes<00:02:06.900> a<00:02:07.170> ton<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.710> repetitions<00:02:08.869> it's

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
just takes a ton of repetitions it's

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.480 
just takes a ton of repetitions it's
really<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.200> nice<00:02:10.440> play<00:02:10.710> the<00:02:10.920> other<00:02:11.039> thing<00:02:11.370> that

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
really a nice play the other thing that

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.280 
really a nice play the other thing that
we<00:02:11.610> added<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:12.570> made<00:02:12.810> things<00:02:12.990> a<00:02:13.170> little

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
we added that made things a little

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.270 
we added that made things a little
easier<00:02:13.500> for<00:02:13.740> us

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
easier for us

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.300 
easier for us
and<00:02:14.459> made<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.840> better<00:02:15.840> in<00:02:16.080> terms<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:16.380> mesh<00:02:16.650> was

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
and made it better in terms of mesh was

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.920 
and made it better in terms of mesh was
that<00:02:17.430> he<00:02:17.490> takes<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.850> slide<00:02:18.150> step<00:02:18.480> once<00:02:18.750> he

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
that he takes a slide step once he

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.620 
that he takes a slide step once he
meshes<00:02:19.380> so<00:02:20.040> in<00:02:20.459> essence<00:02:21.030> what<00:02:21.150> he's<00:02:21.300> doing<00:02:21.540> is

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
meshes so in essence what he's doing is

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.449 
meshes so in essence what he's doing is
he's<00:02:21.780> attacking<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.380> ball<00:02:22.530> with<00:02:22.770> his<00:02:22.800> back<00:02:23.160> or

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
he's attacking the ball with his back or

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.540 
he's attacking the ball with his back or
his<00:02:23.760> offside<00:02:24.390> foot<00:02:24.720> so<00:02:25.140> for<00:02:25.380> running<00:02:25.680> 10<00:02:25.950> he

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
his offside foot so for running 10 he

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.970 
his offside foot so for running 10 he
attacks<00:02:26.970> with<00:02:27.090> his<00:02:27.240> left<00:02:27.569> foot<00:02:27.840> he<00:02:28.140> attacks

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
attacks with his left foot he attacks

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.540 
attacks with his left foot he attacks
the<00:02:29.190> ball<00:02:29.480> meshes<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:30.690> then<00:02:31.110> slides<00:02:31.680> as<00:02:32.160> he's

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
the ball meshes and then slides as he's

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.390 
the ball meshes and then slides as he's
reading<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.090> three<00:02:33.480> technique<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:35.190> that's

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
reading the three technique and that's

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.030 
reading the three technique and that's
where<00:02:35.640> optioning<00:02:36.120> on<00:02:36.239> this<00:02:36.450> play<00:02:36.890> should<00:02:37.890> the

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
where optioning on this play should the

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.949 
where optioning on this play should the
three<00:02:38.069> technique<00:02:38.760> come<00:02:39.000> down<00:02:39.209> obviously<00:02:39.540> he

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
three technique come down obviously he

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.150 
three technique come down obviously he
pulls<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:43.260> then<00:02:43.380> we<00:02:43.500> go<00:02:43.650> right<00:02:43.920> up<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.130> chute

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
pulls and then we go right up the chute

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.570 
pulls and then we go right up the chute
right<00:02:44.670> there<00:02:44.940> okay<00:02:45.680> play<00:02:46.680> set<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.130> blocking

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
right there okay play set the blocking

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.830 
right there okay play set the blocking
is<00:02:47.670> actually<00:02:47.970> pretty<00:02:48.120> simple<00:02:48.420> we're<00:02:48.660> going<00:02:48.690> to

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
is actually pretty simple we're going to

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.170 
is actually pretty simple we're going to
combo<00:02:49.260> here<00:02:49.500> backside<00:02:50.130> here<00:02:50.459> in<00:02:50.970> this

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
combo here backside here in this

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.060 
combo here backside here in this
instance<00:02:51.720> we're<00:02:51.870> going<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:52.050> anchor<00:02:52.470> down<00:02:52.680> if

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
instance we're going to anchor down if

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.400 
instance we're going to anchor down if
we<00:02:53.519> don't<00:02:53.880> then<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.360> five<00:02:54.570> technique<00:02:55.140> here

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
we don't then the five technique here

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.650 
we don't then the five technique here
can<00:02:55.590> blow<00:02:55.739> up<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.070> play<00:02:56.310> we're<00:02:57.269> gonna<00:02:57.390> send

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
can blow up the play we're gonna send

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.850 
can blow up the play we're gonna send
him<00:02:57.900> in<00:02:58.019> motion<00:02:59.660> the<00:03:00.660> play<00:03:00.870> side<00:03:01.200> guard<00:03:01.230> is

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
him in motion the play side guard is

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.080 
him in motion the play side guard is
gonna<00:03:01.980> step<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:03.690> get<00:03:03.840> vertical<00:03:04.230> right<00:03:04.620> here

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
gonna step and get vertical right here

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.570 
gonna step and get vertical right here
we're<00:03:06.090> gonna<00:03:06.180> turn<00:03:06.510> out<00:03:06.780> right<00:03:07.650> here<00:03:08.130> now

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
we're gonna turn out right here now

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.520 
we're gonna turn out right here now
depending<00:03:09.060> on<00:03:09.150> what<00:03:09.330> he<00:03:09.600> does<00:03:09.840> we<00:03:10.380> have<00:03:10.470> a

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
depending on what he does we have a

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.430 
depending on what he does we have a
couple<00:03:10.800> different<00:03:11.040> calls<00:03:11.569> if<00:03:12.569> he<00:03:12.930> feathers

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
couple different calls if he feathers

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.110 
couple different calls if he feathers
with<00:03:13.620> him<00:03:13.860> obviously<00:03:14.160> we<00:03:14.580> leave<00:03:14.790> things<00:03:15.000> the

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
with him obviously we leave things the

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.420 
with him obviously we leave things the
way<00:03:15.150> they<00:03:15.269> are<00:03:15.600> but<00:03:16.170> if<00:03:16.290> we<00:03:16.470> see<00:03:16.709> that<00:03:16.920> he<00:03:17.130> likes

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
way they are but if we see that he likes

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.509 
way they are but if we see that he likes
to<00:03:17.670> uh<00:03:17.720> he<00:03:18.720> likes<00:03:18.959> to<00:03:19.079> try<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.350> fill<00:03:19.680> that<00:03:19.709> B<00:03:20.250> gap

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
to uh he likes to try to fill that B gap

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.000 
to uh he likes to try to fill that B gap
we<00:03:20.760> called<00:03:21.000> him<00:03:21.120> a<00:03:21.180> fallen<00:03:21.720> player<00:03:22.049> then<00:03:22.860> we'll

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
we called him a fallen player then we'll

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.560 
we called him a fallen player then we'll
have<00:03:23.160> a<00:03:23.190> different<00:03:23.459> call<00:03:23.820> where<00:03:23.970> we<00:03:24.060> sent<00:03:24.360> him

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
have a different call where we sent him

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.090 
have a different call where we sent him
through<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.019> B<00:03:25.200> gap<00:03:25.410> leading<00:03:25.950> the

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
through the B gap leading the

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.400 
through the B gap leading the
quarterback<00:03:26.610> and<00:03:27.329> then<00:03:27.570> taken<00:03:28.019> him<00:03:28.170> right

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
quarterback and then taken him right

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.770 
quarterback and then taken him right
there<00:03:28.650> so<00:03:29.459> that<00:03:29.489> way<00:03:29.760> we<00:03:29.940> have<00:03:30.120> from<00:03:30.299> accounted

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
there so that way we have from accounted

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.810 
there so that way we have from accounted
for<00:03:30.810> so<00:03:31.620> it<00:03:31.739> sort<00:03:31.980> of<00:03:32.040> depends<00:03:32.430> on<00:03:32.549> what<00:03:32.610> the

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
for so it sort of depends on what the

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.670 
for so it sort of depends on what the
defense<00:03:33.239> is<00:03:33.329> doing<00:03:33.390> and<00:03:33.720> out<00:03:33.870> of<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.110> add<00:03:34.320> John

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
defense is doing and out of the add John

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.930 
defense is doing and out of the add John
a<00:03:34.709> perimeter<00:03:35.420> then<00:03:36.420> we<00:03:36.570> have<00:03:36.750> this<00:03:37.760> unless<00:03:38.760> of

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
a perimeter then we have this unless of

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.130 
a perimeter then we have this unless of
course<00:03:38.970> we're<00:03:39.360> in<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.480> boundary<00:03:39.810> which<00:03:39.930> case

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
course we're in the boundary which case

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.289 
course we're in the boundary which case
we'll<00:03:40.290> switch<00:03:40.560> block<00:03:40.829> etc<00:03:41.459> so<00:03:41.850> that's<00:03:42.060> the

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
we'll switch block etc so that's the

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.599 
we'll switch block etc so that's the
midline<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:43.530> midline<00:03:43.920> we<00:03:44.070> also<00:03:44.220> run<00:03:44.519> the

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
midline the midline we also run the

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:48.560 
midline the midline we also run the
midline<00:03:44.940> triple<00:03:45.560> or<00:03:46.560> we'll<00:03:46.739> leave<00:03:46.980> him<00:03:47.570> and

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
midline triple or we'll leave him and

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.449 
midline triple or we'll leave him and
then<00:03:48.750> he<00:03:48.930> becomes<00:03:49.200> number<00:03:49.590> two<00:03:49.799> in<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.040> option

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
then he becomes number two in the option

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.550
