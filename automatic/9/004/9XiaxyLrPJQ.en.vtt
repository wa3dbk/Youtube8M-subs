of the pot try to grab the orchid from
the<00:00:42.540> base<00:00:42.719> as<00:00:42.899> much<00:00:43.050> as<00:00:43.260> possible<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:43.950> a

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
the base as much as possible it is a

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.150 
the base as much as possible it is a
tiny<00:00:44.399> orchid<00:00:44.940> but<00:00:45.870> do<00:00:46.110> not<00:00:46.260> grab<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.710> from<00:00:46.860> one

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
tiny orchid but do not grab it from one

tiny orchid but do not grab it from one
leaf<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.670> pull<00:00:48.180> up<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.629> there<00:00:49.440> we<00:00:49.620> go<00:00:50.030> as<00:00:51.030> you

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
leaf and pull up and there we go as you

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.090 
leaf and pull up and there we go as you
can<00:00:51.180> see<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.539> root<00:00:51.690> system<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.230> quite<00:00:52.590> nice<00:00:52.829> on

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
can see the root system is quite nice on

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.340 
can see the root system is quite nice on
this<00:00:53.280> orchid<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.449> roots<00:00:54.660> are<00:00:54.899> pretty

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
this orchid and the roots are pretty

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.439 
this orchid and the roots are pretty
much<00:00:55.530> similar<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.120> Phalaenopsis<00:00:57.120> orchid

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449

orchid most of my orchids did not cope

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.170 
orchid most of my orchids did not cope
very<00:01:11.520> well<00:01:11.850> with<00:01:13.070> coconut<00:01:14.070> husk<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:15.000> one

very well with coconut husk and this one

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.969 
very well with coconut husk and this one
is<00:01:15.330> part<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.960> coconut<00:01:16.320> husk<00:01:16.619> media

that<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.310> don't<00:01:17.580> like<00:01:17.729> alrighty<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.049> will

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
that I don't like alrighty so I will

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.080 
that I don't like alrighty so I will
remove<00:01:19.560> as<00:01:19.770> much<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.220> old<00:01:20.430> media<00:01:20.610> from<00:01:20.970> the

remove as much of the old media from the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.060 
remove as much of the old media from the
root<00:01:21.240> system<00:01:21.600> as<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:21.869> possibly<00:01:22.290> can<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.830> will

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
root system as I possibly can and I will

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.100 
root system as I possibly can and I will
be<00:01:23.280> right<00:01:23.490> back<00:01:23.729> now<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.150> tip<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.570> remove<00:01:24.900> the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
be right back now a tip to remove the

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.649 
be right back now a tip to remove the
old<00:01:25.259> media<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.950> actually<00:01:26.180> wet<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.450> root

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
old media is to actually wet the root

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.630 
old media is to actually wet the root
system<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.320> will<00:01:28.560> make<00:01:28.829> them<00:01:29.040> slightly<00:01:29.460> more

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
system it will make them slightly more

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.030 
system it will make them slightly more
flexible<00:01:30.210> but<00:01:30.630> moreover<00:01:30.840> they<00:01:31.350> will<00:01:31.560> swell

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
flexible but moreover they will swell

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.039 
flexible but moreover they will swell
and<00:01:32.340> actually<00:01:32.670> detaching<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.450> old<00:01:33.720> bark

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
and actually detaching the old bark

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.170 
and actually detaching the old bark
chips<00:01:34.110> will<00:01:34.710> be<00:01:34.860> faster<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:35.280> that's<00:01:35.880> what<00:01:36.090> I'm

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
chips will be faster so that's what I'm

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.580 
chips will be faster so that's what I'm
gonna<00:01:36.360> do<00:01:36.570> right<00:01:36.750> now<00:01:36.780> I'm<00:01:36.990> gonna<00:01:37.140> go<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.350> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
gonna do right now I'm gonna go to the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.800 
gonna do right now I'm gonna go to the
sink<00:01:37.829> well<00:01:38.250> water<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.700> root<00:01:38.880> system<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.420> try

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
sink well water the root system and try

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.350 
sink well water the root system and try
to<00:01:39.869> remove<00:01:40.320> as<00:01:40.530> many<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:41.100> these<00:01:41.310> chips<00:01:42.180> that

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
to remove as many of these chips that

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.510 
to remove as many of these chips that
are<00:01:42.509> attached<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.530> roots<00:01:43.740> as<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.100> possibly

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
are attached to the roots as I possibly

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.030 
are attached to the roots as I possibly
can<00:01:44.820> okay<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.780> removed<00:01:46.290> as<00:01:46.500> much<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.950> old

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
can okay so I removed as much of the old

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.429 
can okay so I removed as much of the old
media<00:01:47.280> as<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.640> possibly<00:01:48.030> could<00:01:48.360> if<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:49.140> still

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
media as I possibly could if you still

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.859 
media as I possibly could if you still
have<00:01:49.740> just<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.369> few<00:01:50.399> pieces<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:51.090> are<00:01:51.420> very

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
have just a few pieces that are very

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.289 
have just a few pieces that are very
strongly<00:01:52.259> attached<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.549> big<00:01:53.759> portion<00:01:54.090> of

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
strongly attached to a big portion of

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.420 
strongly attached to a big portion of
the<00:01:54.720> root<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.079> it's<00:01:55.200> really<00:01:55.409> hard<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.770> detach

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
the root and it's really hard to detach

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.639 
the root and it's really hard to detach
them<00:01:56.759> they're<00:01:57.149> pretty<00:01:57.540> much<00:01:57.719> okay<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:58.500> make

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
them they're pretty much okay just make

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.410 
them they're pretty much okay just make
sure<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:58.890> don't<00:01:59.100> leave<00:01:59.340> too<00:01:59.820> many<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.240> these

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
sure you don't leave too many of these

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.410 
sure you don't leave too many of these
pieces<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:01.140> think<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.740> have<00:02:01.920> three<00:02:02.189> pieces<00:02:02.460> that

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
pieces I think I have three pieces that

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.450 
pieces I think I have three pieces that
will<00:02:03.600> be<00:02:03.630> okay<00:02:04.350> now<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.799> next<00:02:04.920> thing<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.399> will

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
will be okay now the next thing I will

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.160 
will be okay now the next thing I will
do<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.000> actually<00:02:06.299> cut<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.659> flower<00:02:06.840> spike

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
do is to actually cut the flower spike

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.510 
do is to actually cut the flower spike
of<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.439> orchid<00:02:07.799> because<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.250> will<00:02:08.340> now

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
of the orchid because it will now

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.270 
of the orchid because it will now
rebloom<00:02:08.879> again<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.360> also<00:02:09.929> cut<00:02:10.379> away<00:02:10.619> any<00:02:10.860> dead

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
rebloom again and also cut away any dead

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.930 
rebloom again and also cut away any dead
roots

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
roots

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.180 
roots
I<00:02:12.000> will<00:02:12.360> use<00:02:12.600> a<00:02:12.630> sterilized<00:02:13.290> scissors<00:02:13.830> you<00:02:14.070> can

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
I will use a sterilized scissors you can

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.520 
I will use a sterilized scissors you can
sterilize<00:02:14.490> scissors<00:02:15.060> by<00:02:15.270> using<00:02:15.540> alcohol<00:02:16.230> or<00:02:16.470> a

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
sterilize scissors by using alcohol or a

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.610 
sterilize scissors by using alcohol or a
bleach<00:02:17.010> based<00:02:17.550> solution<00:02:18.300> so<00:02:18.900> what<00:02:19.140> I<00:02:19.170> will<00:02:19.290> do

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
bleach based solution so what I will do

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.450 
bleach based solution so what I will do
is<00:02:19.890> cut<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.460> flower<00:02:20.670> spike<00:02:21.650> here<00:02:22.650> without

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
is cut the flower spike here without

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.690 
is cut the flower spike here without
cutting<00:02:24.030> any<00:02:24.360> leaves<00:02:24.980> it'll<00:02:25.980> come<00:02:26.340> right<00:02:26.370> off

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
cutting any leaves it'll come right off

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.570 
cutting any leaves it'll come right off
and<00:02:27.120> now<00:02:27.660> I'm<00:02:27.810> gonna<00:02:28.050> look<00:02:28.320> for<00:02:29.010> dead<00:02:29.280> roots

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
and now I'm gonna look for dead roots

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.610 
and now I'm gonna look for dead roots
now<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.240> live<00:02:30.540> roots<00:02:30.840> are<00:02:31.020> pretty<00:02:31.290> easy<00:02:31.500> to

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
now the live roots are pretty easy to

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.950 
now the live roots are pretty easy to
spot<00:02:31.770> they<00:02:32.340> should<00:02:32.550> be<00:02:32.730> green<00:02:33.120> when<00:02:33.450> wet<00:02:33.720> and

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
spot they should be green when wet and

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.320 
spot they should be green when wet and
actually<00:02:34.770> wetting<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.340> orchid<00:02:35.790> is<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.000> good

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
actually wetting the orchid is a good

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.910 
actually wetting the orchid is a good
idea<00:02:36.480> because<00:02:36.990> you<00:02:37.110> can<00:02:37.140> actually<00:02:37.380> see<00:02:37.740> the

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
idea because you can actually see the

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.670 
idea because you can actually see the
dead<00:02:38.070> roots<00:02:38.310> but<00:02:39.000> if<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.180> see<00:02:39.390> any<00:02:39.690> roots<00:02:40.380> that

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
dead roots but if you see any roots that

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.120 
dead roots but if you see any roots that
are<00:02:40.760> blackened<00:02:41.760> like<00:02:42.540> I<00:02:42.720> have<00:02:43.110> here<00:02:43.500> there<00:02:43.950> you

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
are blackened like I have here there you

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.900 
are blackened like I have here there you
go<00:02:44.340> these<00:02:44.880> are<00:02:45.060> definitely<00:02:45.450> dead<00:02:45.990> roots<00:02:46.320> I'm

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
go these are definitely dead roots I'm

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.090 
go these are definitely dead roots I'm
safe<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:48.090> cut<00:02:48.270> these<00:02:48.450> away<00:02:48.750> so<00:02:49.050> I<00:02:49.560> will<00:02:49.740> go<00:02:49.920> as

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
safe to cut these away so I will go as

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.500 
safe to cut these away so I will go as
close<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.490> the<00:02:50.580> base<00:02:50.700> of<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.030> orchid<00:02:51.390> and

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
close to the base of the orchid and

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.120 
close to the base of the orchid and
actually<00:02:51.870> cut<00:02:52.080> away<00:02:52.290> all<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.590> dead<00:02:52.950> roots

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
actually cut away all the dead roots

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.270 
actually cut away all the dead roots
make<00:02:53.430> sure<00:02:53.610> you<00:02:53.760> don't<00:02:53.970> cut<00:02:54.270> any<00:02:54.510> live<00:02:54.810> roots

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
make sure you don't cut any live roots

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.560 
make sure you don't cut any live roots
sometimes<00:02:56.280> you<00:02:56.520> will<00:02:56.640> find<00:02:56.910> roots<00:02:57.180> that<00:02:57.420> are

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
sometimes you will find roots that are

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.350 
sometimes you will find roots that are
pretty<00:02:58.110> dark<00:02:58.590> in<00:02:58.770> some<00:02:59.100> segments<00:02:59.700> but<00:02:59.910> pretty

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
pretty dark in some segments but pretty

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.840 
pretty dark in some segments but pretty
green<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:00.960> nice<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.410> other<00:03:01.620> segments<00:03:02.250> don't

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
green and nice and other segments don't

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.210 
green and nice and other segments don't
cut<00:03:03.120> these<00:03:03.330> roots<00:03:03.720> this<00:03:04.260> is<00:03:04.440> just<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.740> vellum<00:03:05.130> on

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
cut these roots this is just a vellum on

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.890 
cut these roots this is just a vellum on
going<00:03:05.640> a<00:03:05.790> little<00:03:06.060> bit<00:03:06.210> bad<00:03:06.450> but<00:03:06.780> it<00:03:06.870> doesn't

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
going a little bit bad but it doesn't

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.170 
going a little bit bad but it doesn't
mean<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.440> roots<00:03:07.680> is<00:03:07.830> dead<00:03:08.130> in<00:03:08.310> that<00:03:08.490> area<00:03:08.940> it's

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
mean the roots is dead in that area it's

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.410 
mean the roots is dead in that area it's
still<00:03:09.510> live<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.590> functional<00:03:11.400> now<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.060> next

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
still live and functional now the next

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.090 
still live and functional now the next
thing<00:03:12.570> I<00:03:12.690> like<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.900> do<00:03:13.140> is<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.440> sterilize<00:03:13.710> the

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
thing I like to do is to sterilize the

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.100 
thing I like to do is to sterilize the
root<00:03:14.310> system<00:03:14.790> I<00:03:14.970> like<00:03:15.450> to<00:03:15.570> use<00:03:15.690> hydrogen

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
root system I like to use hydrogen

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.979 
root system I like to use hydrogen
peroxide<00:03:16.290> 3%<00:03:17.100> this<00:03:17.880> is<00:03:18.060> especially<00:03:18.390> good<00:03:18.600> if

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
peroxide 3% this is especially good if

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.410 
peroxide 3% this is especially good if
your<00:03:19.200> orchid<00:03:19.620> is<00:03:19.770> new<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.250> you<00:03:20.850> don't<00:03:21.060> know<00:03:21.239> if

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
your orchid is new and you don't know if

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.570 
your orchid is new and you don't know if
it<00:03:21.540> had<00:03:21.690> any<00:03:21.900> snails<00:03:22.410> or<00:03:22.770> all<00:03:23.130> sorts<00:03:23.489> of

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
it had any snails or all sorts of

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.820 
it had any snails or all sorts of
infestation<00:03:23.880> in<00:03:24.360> the<00:03:24.510> old<00:03:24.630> media<00:03:24.900> I<00:03:25.260> know<00:03:25.380> mine

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
infestation in the old media I know mine

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.520 
infestation in the old media I know mine
does<00:03:26.340> not<00:03:26.610> but<00:03:27.209> I<00:03:27.239> do<00:03:27.330> like<00:03:27.690> to<00:03:27.870> sterilize<00:03:28.320> it

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
does not but I do like to sterilize it

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.550 
does not but I do like to sterilize it
every<00:03:28.890> time<00:03:29.100> just<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.550> remove<00:03:29.820> any<00:03:30.030> sorts<00:03:30.360> of

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
every time just to remove any sorts of

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.670 
every time just to remove any sorts of
small<00:03:31.560> rot<00:03:32.040> beginnings<00:03:32.580> and<00:03:32.820> so<00:03:33.090> on<00:03:33.330> so<00:03:33.989> i<00:03:34.320> will

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
small rot beginnings and so on so i will

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.040 
small rot beginnings and so on so i will
use<00:03:34.830> hydrogen<00:03:35.280> peroxide<00:03:35.430> 3%<00:03:35.940> from<00:03:36.600> spray

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
use hydrogen peroxide 3% from spray

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.229 
use hydrogen peroxide 3% from spray
bottles<00:03:37.470> and<00:03:37.680> actually<00:03:38.070> go<00:03:38.280> about<00:03:38.550> spring<00:03:39.000> the

entire root system with the hydrogen

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.210 
entire root system with the hydrogen
peroxide<00:03:42.410> since<00:03:43.410> I<00:03:43.530> just<00:03:43.590> cut<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:44.040> flower

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
peroxide since I just cut the flower

peroxide since I just cut the flower
spike<00:03:44.610> I<00:03:44.850> will<00:03:44.970> spray<00:03:45.180> a<00:03:45.209> little<00:03:45.390> bit<00:03:45.570> on<00:03:45.720> the

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.360 
spike I will spray a little bit on the
flower<00:03:46.019> spike<00:03:46.290> as<00:03:46.470> well<00:03:46.620> because<00:03:47.100> it<00:03:47.280> will

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
flower spike as well because it will

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.490 
flower spike as well because it will
sterilize<00:03:47.610> the<00:03:48.030> wound<00:03:48.269> now<00:03:48.989> at<00:03:49.110> this<00:03:49.260> point

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
sterilize the wound now at this point

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.990 
sterilize the wound now at this point
the<00:03:49.709> orchid<00:03:50.010> will<00:03:50.160> start<00:03:50.459> to<00:03:50.580> fit<00:03:50.790> a<00:03:50.820> little

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
the orchid will start to fit a little

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.940 
the orchid will start to fit a little
bit<00:03:51.209> don't<00:03:51.510> worry<00:03:51.630> this<00:03:51.959> is<00:03:52.170> very<00:03:52.380> normal<00:03:52.590> this

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
bit don't worry this is very normal this

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.160 
bit don't worry this is very normal this
is<00:03:53.160> just<00:03:53.459> the<00:03:53.610> hydrogen<00:03:53.760> peroxide<00:03:54.170> reacting

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170

I've chosen a slightly bigger pot than

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.620 
I've chosen a slightly bigger pot than
the<00:04:07.860> one<00:04:08.040> it<00:04:08.220> was<00:04:08.340> originally<00:04:08.850> potted<00:04:09.269> in<00:04:09.390> and

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
the one it was originally potted in and

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.229 
the one it was originally potted in and
as<00:04:10.530> you<00:04:10.650> can<00:04:10.800> see<00:04:11.040> all<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.400> root<00:04:11.580> system<00:04:12.000> fits

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
as you can see all the root system fits

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.750 
as you can see all the root system fits
inside<00:04:12.690> but<00:04:13.140> it's<00:04:13.290> a<00:04:13.380> bit<00:04:13.590> tight<00:04:14.070> which<00:04:14.550> is

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
inside but it's a bit tight which is

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.570 
inside but it's a bit tight which is
good<00:04:15.030> I<00:04:15.239> still<00:04:15.720> have<00:04:15.930> some<00:04:16.140> space<00:04:16.290> to<00:04:16.739> place<00:04:17.340> in

good I still have some space to place in
some<00:04:17.820> media<00:04:18.180> so<00:04:18.570> this<00:04:18.750> is<00:04:18.870> why<00:04:18.989> you<00:04:19.049> should<00:04:19.320> be

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
some media so this is why you should be

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.349 
some media so this is why you should be

something with Siderius in general they

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.560 
something with Siderius in general they
are<00:04:30.080> pretty<00:04:30.410> prone<00:04:30.830> to<00:04:31.160> stem<00:04:31.639> rot<00:04:31.940> and<00:04:32.270> as<00:04:32.450> you

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
are pretty prone to stem rot and as you

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.050 
are pretty prone to stem rot and as you
can<00:04:32.720> see<00:04:32.780> I<00:04:33.290> have<00:04:33.680> some<00:04:33.860> darkness<00:04:34.340> going<00:04:34.910> on

can see I have some darkness going on
here<00:04:35.360> this<00:04:35.930> is<00:04:36.139> a<00:04:36.350> little<00:04:36.680> bit<00:04:36.830> of<00:04:36.950> the<00:04:37.100> stem

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
here this is a little bit of the stem

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.250 
here this is a little bit of the stem

not reach the point in which the orchid

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.060 
not reach the point in which the orchid

put it quite on top with the first set

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
of roots and I will show you what I mean

of roots and I will show you what I mean
for<00:04:52.940> this<00:04:53.120> reason<00:04:53.600> I<00:04:53.780> believe<00:04:54.169> that<00:04:54.560> potting

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
for this reason I believe that potting

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.250 
for this reason I believe that potting
the<00:04:55.070> circuit<00:04:55.490> in<00:04:55.639> sphagnum<00:04:56.150> Moss<00:04:56.540> is<00:04:56.810> really

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
the circuit in sphagnum Moss is really

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.500 
the circuit in sphagnum Moss is really
not<00:04:57.380> a<00:04:57.440> good<00:04:57.620> idea<00:04:57.740> if<00:04:58.250> you<00:04:58.460> grow<00:04:58.910> your<00:04:59.090> orchids

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
not a good idea if you grow your orchids

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.960 
not a good idea if you grow your orchids
inside<00:04:59.870> a<00:04:59.900> home<00:05:00.229> to<00:05:01.070> grow<00:05:01.250> the<00:05:01.430> circuit<00:05:01.790> in

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
inside a home to grow the circuit in

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.360 
inside a home to grow the circuit in
Spagna<00:05:02.510> Moss<00:05:02.690> like<00:05:03.020> some<00:05:03.410> growers<00:05:03.710> you<00:05:04.100> do

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
Spagna Moss like some growers you do

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.219 
Spagna Moss like some growers you do
need<00:05:04.580> a<00:05:04.610> lot<00:05:04.820> of<00:05:04.880> ventilation<00:05:05.300> so<00:05:05.840> if<00:05:06.020> you<00:05:06.110> have

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:08.469 
need a lot of ventilation so if you have
a<00:05:06.260> greenhouse<00:05:06.830> or<00:05:07.070> a<00:05:07.400> room<00:05:07.760> that<00:05:07.970> you<00:05:08.060> can<00:05:08.240> keep

a greenhouse or a room that you can keep
some<00:05:08.750> fans<00:05:09.110> in<00:05:09.610> constantly<00:05:10.610> moving<00:05:10.880> the<00:05:11.150> air

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
some fans in constantly moving the air

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.960 
some fans in constantly moving the air
that<00:05:11.840> can<00:05:12.290> work<00:05:12.590> but<00:05:12.650> if<00:05:13.010> you<00:05:13.130> just<00:05:13.490> have<00:05:13.760> it<00:05:13.880> in

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
that can work but if you just have it in

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.480 
that can work but if you just have it in
your<00:05:14.150> home<00:05:14.389> it<00:05:14.720> might<00:05:15.169> not<00:05:15.380> be<00:05:15.590> sufficiently

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
your home it might not be sufficiently

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
ventilated so I do not suggest using

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.310 
ventilated so I do not suggest using
sphagnum<00:05:19.729> Moss<00:05:20.060> which<00:05:20.450> retains<00:05:20.930> a<00:05:21.050> lot<00:05:21.200> of

moisture at the root system if you like

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.600 
moisture at the root system if you like
it<00:05:23.570> is<00:05:23.660> healthy<00:05:24.050> just<00:05:24.410> use<00:05:24.710> bark<00:05:25.040> chips<00:05:25.130> it's

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
it is healthy just use bark chips it's

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.580 
it is healthy just use bark chips it's
the<00:05:26.060> safest<00:05:26.419> media<00:05:26.810> if<00:05:26.990> you're<00:05:27.139> growing<00:05:27.350> the

the safest media if you're growing the

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.560 
the safest media if you're growing the

issued<00:06:37.960> this<00:06:38.050> little<00:06:38.319> warning<00:06:38.499> I<00:06:38.860> had<00:06:39.249> three

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
issued this little warning I had three

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.909 
issued this little warning I had three
scenarios<00:06:39.849> one<00:06:40.539> of<00:06:40.659> which<00:06:40.809> died<00:06:41.080> they<00:06:41.649> all

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:41.919 
scenarios one of which died they all

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:46.139 
scenarios one of which died they all
presented<00:06:42.699> this<00:06:43.360> sort<00:06:44.139> of<00:06:44.520> soft<00:06:45.520> spot<00:06:45.849> let's

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:46.149 
presented this sort of soft spot let's

00:06:46.149 --> 00:06:48.059 
presented this sort of soft spot let's
call<00:06:46.360> it<00:06:46.479> like<00:06:46.629> that<00:06:46.659> so<00:06:47.349> it's<00:06:47.589> better<00:06:47.830> to

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:48.069 
call it like that so it's better to

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:50.339 
call it like that so it's better to
actually<00:06:48.159> pot<00:06:48.639> the<00:06:48.819> orchid<00:06:49.149> a<00:06:49.240> bit<00:06:49.629> on<00:06:49.839> top<00:06:50.139> of

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:50.349 
actually pot the orchid a bit on top of

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:51.809 
actually pot the orchid a bit on top of
the<00:06:50.439> media<00:06:50.619> than<00:06:50.860> to<00:06:50.949> actually<00:06:51.279> bury<00:06:51.520> it<00:06:51.669> too

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:51.819 
the media than to actually bury it too

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:55.109 
the media than to actually bury it too
much<00:06:51.999> and<00:06:52.300> risk<00:06:52.749> losing<00:06:53.139> the<00:06:53.679> orchid<00:06:54.219> okay<00:06:55.059> so

00:06:55.109 --> 00:06:55.119 
much and risk losing the orchid okay so

00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:56.939

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:02.349 
circuit every time the media is dry

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:03.989 
circuit every time the media is dry
pretty<00:07:02.649> much<00:07:02.889> like<00:07:03.069> a<00:07:03.099> phone<00:07:03.339> ops<00:07:03.580> a<00:07:03.669> circuit
