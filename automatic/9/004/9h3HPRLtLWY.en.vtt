00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.069 
you know that I think they go into the
Premier<00:01:39.810> Division<00:01:40.220> what<00:01:41.220> season<00:01:41.549> by<00:01:42.079> being

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
Premier Division what season by being

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.520 
Premier Division what season by being
determined<00:01:43.439> could<00:01:44.369> work<00:01:44.579> ethic<00:01:45.380> what<00:01:46.380> the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.399 
determined could work ethic what the
salts<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:47.070> kept<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.060> good<00:01:48.210> units<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.200> think

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
salts of kept a good units and I think

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.319 
salts of kept a good units and I think
we<00:01:49.470> saw<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.860> gentan<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.369> difficult<00:01:51.240> to

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
we saw that I gentan a difficult to
