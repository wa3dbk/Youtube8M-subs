00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 because paying large amounts of 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.529
 money to specialized people and with a lot of 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.360
 experience forget about it all the 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.250
 products are made for man 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.280
 common and can be repaired by man 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.400
 common in the do it yourself section 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.400
 same 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.790
 online browser I warned if it is not 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.850
 Technically considered as a virus 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.380
 but it has many features 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.570
 malicious is going to kidnap us the 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.420
 browser and will spy on preferences 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.670
 of the user when downloading and using the 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.710
 online program browser advertising 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.110
 we can agree to give the 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.600
 consent to show all those 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.910
 third - party ads and give access to 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.220
 third parties to collect and use our 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.059
 personal information such as history 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.340
 on-line 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.550
 email even other 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:54.940
 private data how can we become infected 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.710
 with online browser I warned without the way 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.530
 most usual in which we can finish 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.809
 installing online browser advertising is 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.000
 by downloading free software in 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.000
 internet where it comes as a software 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.520
 optional to install there are different sites 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.620
 web like softonic that also promote 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.930
 this type of programs in your downloads 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.970
 so yes we have downloaded some 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.640
 program of these websites or others 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.760
 similar we can finish installing 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.720
 online browser advertising we must be 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.940
 attentive to the installation of this one 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.880
 kind of software because if we do not check 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.950
 the steps of the installation process 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.040
 we can finish installing this software 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.770
 potentially unwanted in the menu 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.600
 extensions configurations we notice that 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.110
 there is an extension that can not be 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.580
 remove 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.470
 even if you disable it and the 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.750
 Let's eliminate them reappear when 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.850
 we open the browser again this is 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.409
 the extension of online browser I warned 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.450
 without same that we are going to eliminate 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.520
 the most that helps us chrome that 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.079
 disable it but follow air and you have to 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.499
 disable every time we open the 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.499
 explorer 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.050
 to eliminate this extension let's go 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:13.640
 to local hard disk users and enter 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.640
 to the user who is an administrator 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.720
 we will go to organize folder options and 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.640
 on the tab see let's click on 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.750
 show all files and folders 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.820
 hidden and then click on accept 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.250
 we can see that a new one appeared 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.910
 folder we will enter that folder then 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.620
 in Google 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.300
 then in the chrome folder that if 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.640
 we enter a data default and 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.530
 extensions there we will enter folder by 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.530
 folder until you find a file 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.790
 called manifest itself that we will open 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.680
 dragging it to the notebook and here 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.810
 shows us the name of the extension 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.820
 that contains that folder we will continue 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.680
 looking in the following folders 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.630
 until you find a file that 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.550
 open it tell us you know how good is the 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.209
 extension that we can not eliminate from 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.100
 chrome 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.170
 once we locate the extension that 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.600
 we want to delete we will simply erase 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.140
 this folder and chrome will no longer load this 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.140
 extension 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.599
 now if you remember in these two folders 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.430
 is where the name siave appeared 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.860
 on which is to the extent that we 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.659
 is giving problems we are going to eliminate them 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.870
 and to verify if the 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:41.870
 problem 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.090
 as we see the extension is still 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.980
 appearing in this case let's repeat 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.310
 the procedure but in the folder 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.310
 chrome 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.580
 do not believe 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.080
 to me 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.390
 Y 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.490
 3 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.300
 here is the name of the 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.100
 extension that we want to remove then 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.210
 we will also delete the folder that 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.210
 contains this file 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.270
 We corroborate and delete the folder 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.190
 after that we verify in the 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.760
 browser that the extension has been 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.760
 removed 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.360
 i 

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:02.510
 now if we can verify that the 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.310
 extension has been completely uninstalled 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.200
 of our system and simply 

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.990
 erasing the folders that contained 

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.970
 said extension this has been all for the 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.710
 moment if you liked it or not the video is 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.930
 good to know and publish any 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:18.130
