00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.410
 such 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:36.310
 well here we have the motherboard 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:38.740

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:48.379
 benefits I have taken for soccer 1155 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.000
 and have tried to catch me a motherboard 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.519
 that I can help myself that I can last 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.739
 several several years good several 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:57.260

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.670
 maximum match and good let's go 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.969
 taking this out 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.989
 and that more than more has train supports 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.989
 Up to 32 GB of ram 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.390
 and right now I can not think of any 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.010
 most feature you have 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.010

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.000
 and all the means 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.020
 ok let's take it out here 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.780
 like this I can 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.990
 so, here you have it 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.070
 It's very cool and I really like the 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.340
 it's really very good and it's worth 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.340
 the sorrow 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.700
 Well, we have already put the motherboard 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:59.530
 now we have to put the processor 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.900
 and good and the fan is already 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:07.080
 well here we have the heatsink of the 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:09.490
 cpu is a cooler master 412 that and good 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.260
 this what will keep cool in 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:15.250
 theory the processor to see if you can see 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.970
 the specifications is seen once it 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.900
 approached 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.090
 no I do not think it looks 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:26.010
 and good and here we have the processor is 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:28.129
 15 with that in 1.155 and is 153 thousand 570 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.129
 k 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.630
 and well I'm not going to take it out of the box and 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.630
 let's put it 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.170
 Well, the processor is already mounted 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.800
 and also the heatsink does not have to follow 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.030
 a rather cumbersome process imagines 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.370
 because everything was in English but not 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.270
 had no problem and we are going now to 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.210
 put ram memory 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:55.300
 here we have ram memory is a 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:58.000
 g.skill sniper 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:05.110
 It's very cool I like it a lot 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:08.470
 design is from ddr3 goes to 1866 consumes 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:12.430
 It has a voltage of 1.5 volts and good 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:15.549
 and I do not know what else to say let's put it 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.109
 and well, it's already set, I do not know if the 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.959
 You are going to be able to see well I do not think 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:24.099
 you will see it well if you see it here you see 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.810

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.879
 you just had to fit them and go 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.329
 and well we have here the source of 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:35.500
 food is an air thing that is that 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:37.239
 700 2013 and good the gaming edition already 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.099
 see this I'm very struck 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.989
 are the colors you can change the 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.670
 colors of fans 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.010
 connections to the title explain what the 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.739
 fans and good a little more is a 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.159
 power supply and nothing and here the 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:53.109
 we have already installed well although I'm going to 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:54.669
 connect all the cables and everything 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.849
 but good and a little missing 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:56.849
 bit 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.280
 and good here comes the moment more 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:07.830
 important of all the graphics card 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:10.980

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.930
 I'm going to take out so that I see it is better 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.930
 if I can with one hand 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:47.659
