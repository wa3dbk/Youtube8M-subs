little slow so you guys can learn it if

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.720 
little slow so you guys can learn it if
you<00:00:11.639> want<00:00:11.849> starts<00:00:12.570> in<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.780> fifth<00:00:12.960> fret<00:00:13.259> on

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
you want starts in the fifth fret on

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.160 
you want starts in the fifth fret on
fifth<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:14.940> fourth<00:00:15.210> fret<00:00:15.480> on<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.750> fifth

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
fifth and fourth fret on the fifth

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.880 
fifth and fourth fret on the fifth
string<00:00:16.410> on<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.850> string<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:19.289> uses<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.770> e

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
string on the a string and it uses the e

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.550 
string on the a string and it uses the e
open<00:00:20.609> e<00:00:20.820> pedal<00:00:21.180> note<00:00:24.109> so<00:00:25.109> that's<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.350> first

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
open e pedal note so that's the first

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.500 
open e pedal note so that's the first
part

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:28.510 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.240 

and<00:00:29.110> then<00:00:29.260> it<00:00:29.350> goes<00:00:29.410> up<00:00:29.590> to<00:00:29.710> the<00:00:29.830> sixth<00:00:30.160> string

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
and then it goes up to the sixth string

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.050 
and then it goes up to the sixth string
and<00:00:30.460> it<00:00:30.550> basically<00:00:30.670> does<00:00:31.090> an<00:00:31.540> Ag<00:00:32.470> open<00:00:33.250> e<00:00:33.460> so

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.060 
and it basically does an Ag open e so

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.660 
and it basically does an Ag open e so
it's

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.400 

putting<00:00:38.059> march<00:00:38.510> together<00:00:38.750> it<00:00:39.140> sounds<00:00:39.289> like

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
putting march together it sounds like

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.220 
putting march together it sounds like
this

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.479 

pretty<00:00:44.230> simple<00:00:44.380> and<00:00:44.680> then<00:00:45.220> the<00:00:45.460> only

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
pretty simple and then the only

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.040 
pretty simple and then the only
difference<00:00:46.000> with<00:00:46.150> the<00:00:46.239> second<00:00:46.600> part<00:00:46.810> is<00:00:47.020> that

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
difference with the second part is that

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.080 
difference with the second part is that
instead<00:00:47.829> of<00:00:47.920> going<00:00:48.340> on<00:00:49.650> AG<00:00:50.650> open<00:00:51.070> e<00:00:51.190> he<00:00:51.820> just

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
instead of going on AG open e he just

00:00:52.090 --> 00:01:10.540 
instead of going on AG open e he just
goes<00:00:52.470> G<00:00:53.470> a<00:00:53.739> G<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:57.340> if<00:00:57.400> I<00:00:57.489> play<00:00:57.700> it<00:00:57.820> all<00:00:57.910> together

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.070 

and<00:01:11.360> then<00:01:11.600> on<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:13.090> second<00:01:14.090> part<00:01:14.300> is<00:01:14.780> this

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
and then on the second part is this

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:24.310 
and then on the second part is this
little

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:31.840 

play<00:01:24.920> that<00:01:24.950> normal<00:01:25.490> speed<00:01:25.670> will<00:01:25.820> be

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.920 

pretty<00:01:32.850> cool<00:01:33.000> ref<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.300> it's<00:01:33.420> pretty<00:01:33.570> simple<00:01:33.780> if

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
pretty cool ref so it's pretty simple if

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:42.600 
pretty cool ref so it's pretty simple if
you<00:01:33.960> break<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.410> down

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.190 

and<00:01:43.000> then<00:01:43.270> it<00:01:43.360> goes<00:01:43.480> back<00:01:43.510> to<00:01:43.720> the<00:01:43.960> opening

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
and then it goes back to the opening

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.490 
and then it goes back to the opening
round

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.230 

and<00:01:51.040> then<00:01:51.280> the<00:01:51.400> chorus<00:01:51.760> he<00:01:51.910> does<00:01:52.090> these

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
and then the chorus he does these

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.140 
and then the chorus he does these
partial<00:01:52.780> chords<00:01:53.140> he<00:01:54.070> uses<00:01:54.280> them<00:01:54.370> in<00:01:54.490> 17<00:01:54.940> to

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
partial chords he uses them in 17 to

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.060 
partial chords he uses them in 17 to
like<00:01:55.810> this<00:01:55.990> partial<00:01:56.410> chord<00:01:56.650> which<00:01:56.800> I<00:01:56.890> didn't

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
like this partial chord which I didn't

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.530 
like this partial chord which I didn't
know<00:01:57.160> what<00:01:57.310> it<00:01:57.400> was<00:01:57.520> last<00:01:57.700> time<00:01:57.880> is<00:01:58.060> basically

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
know what it was last time is basically

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.640 
know what it was last time is basically
a<00:01:58.570> G<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.700> i'll<00:02:01.000> show<00:02:01.180> you<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.479> the<00:02:01.960> chorus<00:02:02.410> part

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
a G so i'll show you the the chorus part

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:10.400 
a G so i'll show you the the chorus part
slow

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.310 

so<00:02:11.040> it's<00:02:11.190> all<00:02:11.280> using<00:02:11.580> these<00:02:11.700> like<00:02:11.910> little

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
so it's all using these like little

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:19.250 
so it's all using these like little
partial<00:02:13.320> chords<00:02:17.570> but<00:02:18.570> all<00:02:18.810> together<00:02:19.140> it

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
partial chords but all together it

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:30.110 
partial chords but all together it
sounds<00:02:19.380> awesome

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.880 

it's<00:02:30.840> interesting<00:02:30.959> because<00:02:31.290> in<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.560> middle

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
it's interesting because in the middle

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.190 
it's interesting because in the middle
you<00:02:31.920> hear<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.340> open<00:02:32.700> G<00:02:35.780> so<00:02:36.780> that's<00:02:36.959> kind<00:02:37.140> of

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
you hear the open G so that's kind of

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.240 
you hear the open G so that's kind of
going<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:37.560> throughout<00:02:37.739> the<00:02:37.890> riff<00:02:38.040> so<00:02:38.190> I

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
going it throughout the riff so I

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.630 
going it throughout the riff so I
actually<00:02:38.430> never<00:02:38.790> stop<00:02:40.069> picking<00:02:41.069> I<00:02:41.250> just<00:02:41.489> keep

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
actually never stop picking I just keep

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.930 
actually never stop picking I just keep
going

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.899 

you

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:54.909 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:58.270 

that's<00:02:55.909> it<00:02:56.120> I<00:02:56.150> hope<00:02:56.650> hope<00:02:57.650> for<00:02:57.859> anyone<00:02:58.129> who's

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
that's it I hope hope for anyone who's

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.940 
that's it I hope hope for anyone who's
trying<00:02:58.489> to<00:02:58.549> learn<00:02:58.670> that<00:02:58.819> riff<00:02:59.709> that<00:03:00.709> made

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
trying to learn that riff that made

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.430 
trying to learn that riff that made
sense<00:03:01.219> and<00:03:02.530> I'll<00:03:03.530> see<00:03:03.709> you<00:03:03.799> guys<00:03:03.859> next<00:03:03.980> time
