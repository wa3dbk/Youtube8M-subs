elements in the page type now let's

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.220 
elements in the page type now let's
choose<00:01:21.020> the<00:01:21.200> table<00:01:21.620> and<00:01:22.000> insert<00:01:23.000> a<00:01:23.180> new<00:01:23.390> row<00:01:23.420> we

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.230 
choose the table and insert a new row we

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.780 
choose the table and insert a new row we
can<00:01:24.440> do<00:01:24.590> this<00:01:24.740> by<00:01:24.950> just<00:01:25.130> changing<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.490> number

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
can do this by just changing the number

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.920 
can do this by just changing the number
of<00:01:25.880> rows<00:01:26.120> 22<00:01:27.040> but<00:01:28.040> i<00:01:28.310> do<00:01:28.520> not<00:01:28.940> want<00:01:29.330> two<00:01:29.510> columns

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
of rows 22 but i do not want two columns

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.000 
of rows 22 but i do not want two columns
on<00:01:30.200> this<00:01:30.770> specific<00:01:31.010> row<00:01:31.780> so<00:01:32.780> let<00:01:33.680> me<00:01:33.800> select

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
on this specific row so let me select

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.380 
on this specific row so let me select
this<00:01:34.250> row<00:01:34.960> right<00:01:35.960> click<00:01:36.410> table<00:01:37.070> and<00:01:37.670> merge

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
this row right click table and merge

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.020 
this row right click table and merge
cells<00:01:39.430> now<00:01:40.430> this<00:01:40.640> makes<00:01:41.860> what<00:01:42.860> this<00:01:43.280> combines

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
cells now this makes what this combines

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.970 
cells now this makes what this combines
the<00:01:44.210> two<00:01:44.240> columns<00:01:44.750> in<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.020> second<00:01:45.440> row<00:01:45.590> into

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
the two columns in the second row into

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.030 
the two columns in the second row into
one<00:01:46.240> this<00:01:47.240> merge<00:01:47.480> cells<00:01:47.750> is<00:01:48.020> a<00:01:48.080> very<00:01:48.409> good<00:01:48.590> very

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
one this merge cells is a very good very

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.300 
one this merge cells is a very good very
useful<00:01:49.670> tool<00:01:49.970> for<00:01:50.290> laying<00:01:51.290> out<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.920> design<00:01:52.280> of

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
useful tool for laying out the design of

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.570 
useful tool for laying out the design of
the<00:01:52.610> web<00:01:52.760> page<00:01:53.590> now<00:01:54.590> let's<00:01:54.800> have<00:01:54.979> a<00:01:55.010> better

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
the web page now let's have a better

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.060 
the web page now let's have a better
example<00:01:55.760> let's<00:01:56.540> insert<00:01:56.930> another<00:01:57.229> table<00:01:57.740> into

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
example let's insert another table into

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.420 
example let's insert another table into
this<00:01:58.250> row<00:01:59.060> of<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.479> table<00:01:59.630> I<00:02:00.140> did<00:02:00.680> have<00:02:00.860> 10<00:02:01.190> rows

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
this row of the table I did have 10 rows

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.550 
this row of the table I did have 10 rows
and<00:02:01.700> 10<00:02:02.030> columns<00:02:02.979> and<00:02:04.420> let's<00:02:05.420> resize<00:02:05.930> it<00:02:06.200> so<00:02:06.229> it

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
and 10 columns and let's resize it so it

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.110 
and 10 columns and let's resize it so it
looks<00:02:06.830> better<00:02:08.349> yes<00:02:09.349> much<00:02:09.679> better<00:02:09.709> and<00:02:10.220> this

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
looks better yes much better and this

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.690 
looks better yes much better and this
reduce<00:02:11.569> the<00:02:11.780> cell<00:02:11.959> padding<00:02:12.200> to<00:02:12.500> 0<00:02:12.799> what<00:02:13.280> a<00:02:13.310> cell

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
reduce the cell padding to 0 what a cell

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.430 
reduce the cell padding to 0 what a cell
padding<00:02:13.940> cell<00:02:14.330> padding<00:02:14.540> is<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:14.840> distance

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
padding cell padding is a distance

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.980 
padding cell padding is a distance
between<00:02:16.750> two<00:02:17.750> cells<00:02:18.080> on<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.900> table

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
between two cells on the table

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.190 
between two cells on the table
so<00:02:22.170> this<00:02:23.000> small<00:02:24.000> distance<00:02:24.480> between<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.990> rows

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
so this small distance between the rows

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.940 
so this small distance between the rows
between<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.830> cells<00:02:26.100> is<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.460> cell<00:02:26.640> burning

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
between the cells is the cell burning

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.860 
between the cells is the cell burning
now<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:29.070> looks<00:02:29.190> much<00:02:29.400> shorter<00:02:29.820> because<00:02:30.360> there

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
now it looks much shorter because there

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.430 
now it looks much shorter because there
is<00:02:30.960> no<00:02:31.170> self<00:02:31.380> burning<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:32.630> let's<00:02:33.630> resize<00:02:34.200> it

is no self burning and let's resize it
further<00:02:36.200> yes<00:02:37.200> no<00:02:37.410> it's<00:02:37.560> more<00:02:37.710> squarish<00:02:38.070> in

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
further yes no it's more squarish in

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.570 
further yes no it's more squarish in

face so but let's let's do some drawing
on<00:03:37.250> a<00:03:37.280> table<00:03:37.670> let's<00:03:38.360> fill<00:03:39.020> this<00:03:39.380> merge<00:03:40.250> cell

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
on a table let's fill this merge cell

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.380 
on a table let's fill this merge cell
with<00:03:42.110> a<00:03:42.319> certain<00:03:42.650> color<00:03:42.880> like<00:03:43.880> this<00:03:44.090> make<00:03:44.269> the

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
with a certain color like this make the

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.589 
with a certain color like this make the
background<00:03:44.599> say<00:03:45.230> yellow<00:03:46.150> so<00:03:47.150> how<00:03:47.269> do<00:03:47.330> we<00:03:47.480> do

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
background say yellow so how do we do

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.050 
background say yellow so how do we do
that<00:03:47.680> firstly<00:03:48.680> insert<00:03:49.069> a<00:03:49.250> div<00:03:49.519> into<00:03:49.940> the

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
that firstly insert a div into the

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.479 
that firstly insert a div into the
stable<00:03:50.950> like<00:03:51.950> this<00:03:53.170> insert<00:03:54.170> div<00:03:54.470> tag<00:03:54.769> a<00:03:54.980> div<00:03:55.280> is

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
stable like this insert div tag a div is

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.370 
stable like this insert div tag a div is
basically<00:03:55.970> a<00:03:56.000> container<00:03:56.480> element<00:03:56.720> which

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
basically a container element which

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.380 
basically a container element which
holds<00:03:57.739> other<00:03:57.860> elements<00:03:58.430> on<00:03:58.549> a<00:03:58.610> HTML<00:03:59.030> page

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
holds other elements on a HTML page

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.870 
holds other elements on a HTML page
let's<00:04:00.260> call<00:04:00.530> a<00:04:00.590> class<00:04:00.980> let's<00:04:01.340> call<00:04:01.519> the<00:04:01.640> class

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
let's call a class let's call the class

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.559 
let's call a class let's call the class
myclass<00:04:02.420> a<00:04:03.280> class<00:04:04.280> is<00:04:04.489> basically<00:04:04.970> a<00:04:05.000> grouping

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
myclass a class is basically a grouping

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.789 
myclass a class is basically a grouping
of<00:04:05.750> different<00:04:06.440> elements<00:04:06.920> on<00:04:07.069> the<00:04:07.930> webpage<00:04:08.930> so

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
of different elements on the webpage so

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.009 
of different elements on the webpage so
this<00:04:09.980> div<00:04:10.790> tag<00:04:11.030> would<00:04:11.180> be<00:04:11.330> grouped<00:04:11.599> under<00:04:11.750> my

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
this div tag would be grouped under my

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.559 
this div tag would be grouped under my
class<00:04:12.290> now<00:04:12.920> new<00:04:13.130> CSS<00:04:13.459> style<00:04:13.849> basically<00:04:14.330> means
