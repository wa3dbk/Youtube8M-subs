basically<00:01:38.170> it<00:01:38.530> goes<00:01:38.649> all<00:01:38.829> the<00:01:38.859> way<00:01:39.039> back<00:01:39.070> down

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
basically it goes all the way back down

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.010 
basically it goes all the way back down
and<00:01:39.609> I<00:01:39.670> raise<00:01:39.909> the<00:01:40.270> roof<00:01:40.390> a<00:01:40.509> little<00:01:40.689> bit<00:01:40.780> so<00:01:40.960> it

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
and I raise the roof a little bit so it

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.999 
and I raise the roof a little bit so it
I<00:01:41.109> don't<00:01:41.289> bang<00:01:41.409> your<00:01:41.439> head<00:01:41.649> when<00:01:41.799> you<00:01:41.859> fall

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
I don't bang your head when you fall

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.310 
I don't bang your head when you fall

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
down it's about three hi all the way and

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.429 
down it's about three hi all the way and
I've<00:01:45.189> now<00:01:45.369> got<00:01:45.579> a<00:01:45.609> direct<00:01:45.969> I<00:01:46.350> should<00:01:47.350> probably

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
I've now got a direct I should probably

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.349 
I've now got a direct I should probably
put<00:01:47.680> a<00:01:47.710> door<00:01:48.009> in<00:01:48.039> but<00:01:48.789> for<00:01:48.909> the<00:01:48.969> moment<00:01:49.090> whether

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:49.359 
put a door in but for the moment whether

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:50.849 
put a door in but for the moment whether
it's<00:01:49.479> just<00:01:49.719> direct<00:01:50.079> passage<00:01:50.530> all<00:01:50.679> the<00:01:50.799> way

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:50.859 
it's just direct passage all the way

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:52.889 
it's just direct passage all the way
down<00:01:51.070> to<00:01:51.399> the<00:01:51.429> basically<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:52.509> bottom<00:01:52.780> of<00:01:52.840> the

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
down to the basically the bottom of the

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:54.359 
down to the basically the bottom of the
map<00:01:53.079> this<00:01:53.350> is<00:01:53.500> this<00:01:53.649> is<00:01:53.799> pretty<00:01:54.009> much<00:01:54.100> as<00:01:54.250> low

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
map this is this is pretty much as low

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.580 
map this is this is pretty much as low
as<00:01:54.490> you<00:01:54.640> can<00:01:54.759> go<00:01:54.880> so<00:01:55.299> um<00:01:55.539> is<00:01:56.109> we<00:01:56.320> found<00:01:56.380> the

as you can go so um is we found the

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.029 
as you can go so um is we found the
diamond<00:01:56.890> the<00:01:56.979> first<00:01:57.159> time<00:01:57.369> around<00:01:57.700> here<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:59.560> I

diamond the first time around here and I

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:01.770 
diamond the first time around here and I
should<00:02:00.340> yeah<00:02:00.969> I<00:02:01.119> got<00:02:01.329> in<00:02:01.450> through<00:02:01.630> there

else<00:02:08.200> which<00:02:08.619> i<00:02:08.800> think<00:02:09.070> which<00:02:09.190> I've<00:02:09.369> dumped<00:02:09.610> in

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
else which i think which I've dumped in

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.550 
else which i think which I've dumped in
the<00:02:10.360> meantime<00:02:10.539> I<00:02:10.780> think<00:02:11.020> it<00:02:11.200> I<00:02:11.290> think<00:02:11.320> it's

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
the meantime I think it I think it's

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.619 
the meantime I think it I think it's
reasonably<00:02:12.040> cool<00:02:12.310> I<00:02:12.520> think<00:02:12.820> it's<00:02:12.940> a<00:02:13.180> bit<00:02:13.480> a<00:02:13.599> bit

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
reasonably cool I think it's a bit a bit

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.380 
reasonably cool I think it's a bit a bit
of<00:02:13.840> overkill<00:02:14.409> but<00:02:14.830> you<00:02:14.950> know<00:02:15.069> it's<00:02:16.000> all<00:02:16.150> nice

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
of overkill but you know it's all nice

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.040 
of overkill but you know it's all nice
I<00:02:17.620> wear<00:02:18.620> my<00:02:18.770> next<00:02:19.040> video<00:02:19.280> will<00:02:19.430> probably<00:02:20.050> after

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.940 
this one will probably be the response
to<00:02:23.270> the<00:02:23.360> QA<00:02:23.569> because<00:02:24.200> some<00:02:24.440> of<00:02:24.500> you<00:02:24.620> replied

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
million cactuses just like little space

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.729 
million cactuses just like little space
to<00:03:17.390> away<00:03:17.900> from<00:03:18.110> each<00:03:18.200> other<00:03:18.350> so<00:03:18.530> you<00:03:18.620> walk

to away from each other so you walk
between<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:19.070> bugging<00:03:19.370> engine<00:03:19.940> whoops<00:03:20.300> unless

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
between the bugging engine whoops unless

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.500 
between the bugging engine whoops unless
you're<00:03:21.050> me<00:03:21.170> who<00:03:21.350> gets<00:03:21.500> injured<00:03:21.709> anyway<00:03:22.010> Oh

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
that's only for the building character I

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.680 
that's only for the building character I
don't<00:03:34.400> play<00:03:34.579> in<00:03:34.730> peaceful<00:03:35.060> it's<00:03:35.269> just<00:03:35.420> because

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
it's it's basically an infinite source

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.060 
it's it's basically an infinite source
of<00:03:43.280> cactuses<00:03:43.640> if<00:03:43.850> I<00:03:44.209> ever<00:03:44.329> need<00:03:44.570> them<00:03:44.799> so<00:03:45.799> I'm
