 the athletes who are young who are 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.149
 athletes who know fashion and that's why 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.210
 He chose to be our sponsor 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:00.850
 and on the other hand good was achieved too 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.750
 which course to the olympic river games 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.260

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.650
 weather 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.870

 special design that also has the 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:21.200
 national team the opening to receive 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.320
 this type of contribution of a brand with 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.390
 great career I think that 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.850
 he deserves it the Mexican national team 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.900
 it's worth walking in an inauguration 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.630
 with uniforms as elegant as 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.400
 two I say I see it and it's very comfortable what 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.680
 I see and I say good because I look good not 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.290
 then it is something that one like 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.210
 Athlete created does not also affect him 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.670
 well that in some way enhances the 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.460
 presence of the country not then are 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.240
 many aspects that in combination then 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.410
 we are helping the athlete 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.050
 mentally I do not think it helps him 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.960
 say ah well I look good this I am 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.570
 ready to represent mexico and 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.479
 walk through the opening area 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.310
 the more brands and sponsors and 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.200
 go see 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.060
 to brands is also and by sport to 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.530
 Sometimes people turn around and put more 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.640
 Interested in sports that I think is something 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.640
 what is so important for our country
