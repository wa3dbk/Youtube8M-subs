00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
see the au logo over here and you can

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.139 
see the au logo over here and you can
also<00:02:06.899> see<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.950> antennas<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.820> are<00:02:08.940> going

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
also see the antennas that are going

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.390 
also see the antennas that are going
around<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.780> device<00:02:10.200> this<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.220> power

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
around the device this is the power

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.490 
around the device this is the power
button<00:02:11.430> right<00:02:11.850> there<00:02:11.880> at<00:02:12.570> the<00:02:12.780> bottom<00:02:12.900> there

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
button right there at the bottom there

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.600 
button right there at the bottom there
is<00:02:13.770> your<00:02:14.540> micro<00:02:15.540> USB<00:02:15.900> 2.0<00:02:16.470> port<00:02:16.500> port<00:02:17.160> behind

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
is your micro USB 2.0 port port behind

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.270 
is your micro USB 2.0 port port behind
this<00:02:17.790> alarm<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:18.900> devices<00:02:19.530> probably<00:02:19.769> also<00:02:20.130> a

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
this alarm and devices probably also a

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.949 
this alarm and devices probably also a
mic<00:02:20.549> that<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.790> can<00:02:21.120> see<00:02:21.390> right<00:02:21.540> now<00:02:21.690> because

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
mic that I can see right now because

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.690 
mic that I can see right now because
there's<00:02:22.140> so<00:02:22.290> much<00:02:22.410> going<00:02:22.470> on<00:02:22.799> optically<00:02:23.280> on

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
there's so much going on optically on

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.990 
there's so much going on optically on
this<00:02:24.090> device<00:02:24.390> and

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
this device and

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.610 
this device and
that's<00:02:26.150> pretty<00:02:26.330> much<00:02:26.450> it<00:02:26.780> going<00:02:27.170> over<00:02:27.380> to<00:02:27.530> the

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
that's pretty much it going over to the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.130 
that's pretty much it going over to the
left<00:02:27.740> we<00:02:28.010> get<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.670> volume<00:02:29.330> rocker<00:02:29.780> and

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
left we get the volume rocker and

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.020 
left we get the volume rocker and
another<00:02:30.590> antenna<00:02:31.040> I<00:02:31.130> would<00:02:31.370> guess<00:02:31.550> or<00:02:31.850> it's

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
another antenna I would guess or it's

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.430 
another antenna I would guess or it's
just<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.390> metal<00:02:32.660> frame<00:02:32.870> it's<00:02:33.080> kind<00:02:33.230> of<00:02:33.260> hard

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
just the metal frame it's kind of hard

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.530 
just the metal frame it's kind of hard
to<00:02:33.500> tell<00:02:33.740> for<00:02:34.010> me<00:02:34.130> and<00:02:34.670> we<00:02:35.120> have<00:02:35.300> the

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
to tell for me and we have the

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.090 
to tell for me and we have the
three-and-a-half<00:02:35.840> millimeter<00:02:36.440> and<00:02:36.800> set

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
three-and-a-half millimeter and set

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.140 
three-and-a-half millimeter and set
check<00:02:37.280> right<00:02:37.760> there

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
check right there

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.900 
check right there
there<00:02:38.390> is<00:02:38.660> a<00:02:38.930> 2.1<00:02:39.560> megapixel<00:02:39.860> camera<00:02:40.670> on<00:02:40.820> the

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
there is a 2.1 megapixel camera on the

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.780 
there is a 2.1 megapixel camera on the
front<00:02:41.600> and<00:02:41.960> yeah<00:02:42.650> that's<00:02:42.980> kind<00:02:43.340> of<00:02:43.430> pretty

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
front and yeah that's kind of pretty

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.990 
front and yeah that's kind of pretty
much<00:02:43.910> it<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:45.050> screen<00:02:45.800> has<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.070> resolution<00:02:46.280> of

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
much it the screen has a resolution of

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.320 
much it the screen has a resolution of
720p<00:02:47.570> and<00:02:48.140> it<00:02:48.830> does<00:02:49.040> have<00:02:49.250> good<00:02:49.580> contrast<00:02:49.940> and

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
720p and it does have good contrast and

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.670 
720p and it does have good contrast and
it<00:02:50.480> looks<00:02:50.630> very<00:02:50.810> nice<00:02:51.050> actually

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
it looks very nice actually

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.590 
it looks very nice actually
colors<00:02:52.190> are<00:02:52.280> looking<00:02:52.790> good<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:53.450> the

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
colors are looking good and the

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.000 
colors are looking good and the
brightness<00:02:53.780> is<00:02:53.990> also<00:02:54.320> very<00:02:54.500> decent<00:02:54.830> since

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
brightness is also very decent since

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.610 
brightness is also very decent since
we're<00:02:55.220> in<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.490> super<00:02:56.270> super<00:02:56.600> brightly<00:02:56.990> lit

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
we're in a super super brightly lit

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.320 
we're in a super super brightly lit
environment<00:02:57.890> right<00:02:58.640> here<00:02:58.880> it's<00:02:59.030> running

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
environment right here it's running

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.010 
environment right here it's running
again<00:02:59.600> Firefox<00:03:00.560> OS<00:03:01.100> and<00:03:01.790> screen<00:03:02.360> size<00:03:02.570> not<00:03:02.900> to

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
again Firefox OS and screen size not to

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.940 
again Firefox OS and screen size not to
forget<00:03:03.290> is<00:03:03.590> at<00:03:04.570> 4.7<00:03:05.570> inches<00:03:06.080> in<00:03:06.290> this<00:03:06.440> case<00:03:06.650> I

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
forget is at 4.7 inches in this case I

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.650 
forget is at 4.7 inches in this case I
don't<00:03:07.100> know<00:03:07.310> what<00:03:07.430> it<00:03:07.520> costs<00:03:07.910> because<00:03:08.270> it's

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
don't know what it costs because it's

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.449 
don't know what it costs because it's
only<00:03:08.810> sold<00:03:09.140> in<00:03:09.350> Japan<00:03:09.709> my<00:03:09.950> guess<00:03:10.220> would<00:03:10.400> be

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
only sold in Japan my guess would be

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.220 
only sold in Japan my guess would be
that<00:03:10.730> they're<00:03:10.880> selling<00:03:11.150> it<00:03:11.360> on<00:03:11.510> contract<00:03:12.050> only

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
that they're selling it on contract only

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.470 
that they're selling it on contract only
but<00:03:13.130> that's<00:03:13.459> a<00:03:13.580> very<00:03:13.880> interesting<00:03:14.150> design

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
but that's a very interesting design

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.110 
but that's a very interesting design
that<00:03:14.900> I<00:03:14.930> would<00:03:15.050> like<00:03:15.230> to<00:03:15.590> see<00:03:15.770> kind<00:03:16.430> of<00:03:16.520> these

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
that I would like to see kind of these

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.000 
that I would like to see kind of these
kind<00:03:17.390> of<00:03:17.480> devices<00:03:17.930> coming<00:03:18.200> into<00:03:18.440> Europe<00:03:18.739> at

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
kind of devices coming into Europe at

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.770 
kind of devices coming into Europe at
some<00:03:19.250> point<00:03:19.540> what's<00:03:20.540> also<00:03:20.690> pretty

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
some point what's also pretty

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.930 
some point what's also pretty
interesting<00:03:21.320> is<00:03:21.470> that<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:21.860> back<00:03:22.040> is<00:03:22.430> not

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
interesting is that the back is not

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.600 
interesting is that the back is not
completely<00:03:23.570> smooth<00:03:23.870> so<00:03:24.500> they<00:03:24.680> try<00:03:25.220> to<00:03:25.250> prevent

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
completely smooth so they try to prevent

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.330 
completely smooth so they try to prevent
stretching<00:03:26.270> for<00:03:26.450> example<00:03:26.900> by<00:03:27.290> doing<00:03:27.770> some

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
stretching for example by doing some

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.479 
stretching for example by doing some
it's<00:03:29.000> like<00:03:29.150> a<00:03:29.180> bumpy<00:03:29.600> pattern<00:03:30.500> on<00:03:30.739> here<00:03:31.010> that

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
it's like a bumpy pattern on here that

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.340 
it's like a bumpy pattern on here that
keeps<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:31.850> device<00:03:31.970> from<00:03:32.480> getting<00:03:32.989> scratched

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
keeps the device from getting scratched

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.259 
keeps the device from getting scratched
because<00:03:33.530> you<00:03:33.769> don't<00:03:33.950> want<00:03:34.130> that<00:03:34.370> see-through

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
because you don't want that see-through

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.080 
because you don't want that see-through
design<00:03:36.260> to<00:03:36.620> actually<00:03:36.980> be<00:03:37.160> stretched<00:03:37.640> over

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
design to actually be stretched over

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.360 
design to actually be stretched over
time<00:03:38.630> so<00:03:39.320> this<00:03:39.410> has<00:03:39.560> just<00:03:39.590> been<00:03:39.860> a<00:03:39.890> quick<00:03:40.190> look

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
time so this has just been a quick look

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.900 
time so this has just been a quick look
a<00:03:40.580> very<00:03:40.910> quick<00:03:41.090> look<00:03:41.239> at<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:42.110> LG<00:03:42.830> L<00:03:43.070> 25<00:03:43.610> also

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
a very quick look at the LG L 25 also

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.750 
a very quick look at the LG L 25 also
known<00:03:44.180> as<00:03:44.420> FX<00:03:44.840> Sierra<00:03:45.170> and<00:03:45.470> if<00:03:46.340> you

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
known as FX Sierra and if you

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.820 
known as FX Sierra and if you
at<00:03:46.849> five<00:03:47.480> Russell<00:03:47.870> s<00:03:47.989> it<00:03:48.200> seems<00:03:48.470> there<00:03:48.739> you

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
at five Russell s it seems there you

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.429 
at five Russell s it seems there you
still<00:03:49.069> have<00:03:49.310> some<00:03:49.580> minor<00:03:50.090> performance<00:03:51.079> issues
