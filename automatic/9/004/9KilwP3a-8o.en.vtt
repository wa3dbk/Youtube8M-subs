00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.679
 Yes, it is a Chinese brush 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.679
 eh 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.290
 I had not been able to introduce this before 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.019
 Air card introduction 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.289
 What will that I part 2 value ordering 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.440
 It is another card during this time by by I would like to introduce 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.630
 Yes 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.630
 So also line series is a good name this time 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.800
 Yes yes 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.800
 Four days 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:47.110
 Ha 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.110
 Now Kurihara does not have the best action 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:11.909
 By the way, this time the variable is great, but this time we introduce this card and it is totally disabled card in this case 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:16.950
 It is another card 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:19.850
 Do not put the same card The same number or the previous card is still a sweet card here 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.850
 It is different from 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.790
 Although there is mass sacrifice early summer, 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.790
 Well thank you for that 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.750
 I'm going to Ishii player, but that's just a reasonable rate but a human being is a reasonable card 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.600
 Put out a little bit elaborate 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:41.360
 I can not shake my neck vertically 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.960
 Ah, I had a clear mix of products just before, but the following three players 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.960
 It does not flow 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.650
 I love you 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.570
 I it 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.340
 2 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.220
 Not 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.220
 It's a bit mixed and it's too much thanks for the star 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.180
 Let's wake up 15% to control 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.630
 Oh 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.880
 We had 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.150
 plans 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.320
 eh 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:11.030
 Was that good? 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:15.140
 Popular 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.920
 Do you not aim at the head of city Toi ? 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.920
 I think 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.950
 I have a hard time, it is totally one shot 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.600
 Hmm 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.600
 Hmm 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.600
 Hmm 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:51.980
 It is a rare card introduction that exists 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:55.330
 Yes right now especially the government's six-done auto book 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.330
 Old that you rat scale 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.660
 To the fact that 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.390
 I'm Maya I want but I think the production of case water server, respectively 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:11.330
 8 I think it is better that there was very high card 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:14.650
 The trader is naturally what went to rate 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:20.739
 I was thinking of telling you from before 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:24.789
 Of me attached to the Lotte sake Yes bonus is glad very Yes, but bonus You know that 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:29.080
 Whether or not that will put in is that I'm glad I'm glad it was a player of Lotte 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:34.639
 Every book in the tray is the main part of the trade 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:36.000
 It is called for a day to come to politics well in Ropping 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:41.070
 Not 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.240
 That scene is somehow a rate anyway and the same card or later 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:46.500
 It does not mean that it is fresh 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.360
 If you are a layer card, I would like to introduce you 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.719
 Yes 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.719
 I think that I did not make the video from now on Thank you for watching
