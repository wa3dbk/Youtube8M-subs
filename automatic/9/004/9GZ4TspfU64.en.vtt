00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.559 

I<00:00:04.460> think<00:00:05.460> we<00:00:05.549> responded<00:00:05.819> well<00:00:06.120> when<00:00:06.390> we<00:00:06.480> were

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
I think we responded well when we were

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.200 
I think we responded well when we were
one<00:00:06.810> down<00:00:07.049> to<00:00:07.319> one<00:00:07.560> down<00:00:07.830> but<00:00:08.160> overall<00:00:08.460> I<00:00:09.090> think

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
one down to one down but overall I think

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.330 
one down to one down but overall I think
everyone<00:00:09.690> is<00:00:09.870> very<00:00:10.139> disappointed<00:00:10.980> that<00:00:11.130> we

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
everyone is very disappointed that we

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.879 
everyone is very disappointed that we
didn't<00:00:12.000> defend<00:00:12.540> better<00:00:12.870> against<00:00:13.349> at<00:00:13.590> place

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
didn't defend better against at place

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.510 
didn't defend better against at place
that<00:00:14.309> we<00:00:14.660> didn't<00:00:15.660> control<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.289> game<00:00:16.520> dictate

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
that we didn't control the game dictate

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.420 
that we didn't control the game dictate
the<00:00:17.760> game<00:00:17.940> in<00:00:18.210> our<00:00:18.330> attacking<00:00:18.810> game<00:00:19.260> I<00:00:19.890> think

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
the game in our attacking game I think

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.950 
the game in our attacking game I think
everyone<00:00:20.850> also<00:00:21.180> has<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.480> feeling<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:21.930> it

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
everyone also has the feeling that it

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.400 
everyone also has the feeling that it
was<00:00:22.170> too<00:00:22.529> pretty<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:23.760> slop<00:00:24.090> in<00:00:24.300> over<00:00:25.050> 90

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
was too pretty to slop in over 90

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.650 
was too pretty to slop in over 90
minutes<00:00:25.710> it's<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.460> we<00:00:26.580> can<00:00:26.730> we<00:00:27.449> still

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
minutes it's so that we can we still

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.689 
minutes it's so that we can we still
have<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.810> spirit<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.260> fight<00:00:28.410> back<00:00:28.590> but<00:00:28.670> but<00:00:29.670> I

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
have a spirit to fight back but but I

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.700 
have a spirit to fight back but but I
think<00:00:29.970> today<00:00:30.090> wasn't<00:00:30.480> everything<00:00:31.320> went<00:00:31.650> a

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
really asking for much and we saw this

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.470 
really asking for much and we saw this
game<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.809> mean<00:00:52.020> we<00:00:52.140> still<00:00:52.350> had<00:00:52.500> half<00:00:53.219> chances

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
game I mean we still had half chances

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.220 
game I mean we still had half chances
towards<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.539> end<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.750> game<00:00:54.809> but<00:00:55.170> I

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
towards the end of the game but I

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.840 
towards the end of the game but I
weren't<00:00:55.530> able<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.860> capitalize<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.550> but<00:00:56.670> we

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
weren't able to capitalize in it but we

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.340 
weren't able to capitalize in it but we
put<00:00:57.090> us<00:00:57.180> off<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.570> very<00:00:57.840> difficult<00:00:58.109> situation

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
put us off in a very difficult situation

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.760 
put us off in a very difficult situation
with<00:00:59.010> with<00:00:59.760> them<00:00:59.910> scoring<00:01:00.629> three<00:01:01.230> pretty<00:01:01.530> I

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
with with them scoring three pretty I

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.119 
with with them scoring three pretty I
mean<00:01:02.190> given<00:01:02.520> first<00:01:02.699> one<00:01:02.879> was<00:01:03.830> still<00:01:04.830> we<00:01:04.949> could

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
mean given first one was still we could

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.200 
mean given first one was still we could
have<00:01:05.220> challenged<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.729> little<00:01:05.970> bit<00:01:06.030> more

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
have challenged that a little bit more

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.760 
have challenged that a little bit more
it<00:01:06.360> was<00:01:06.479> basically<00:01:06.689> walked<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:07.229> game<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.590> free

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
it was basically walked in game of free

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.429 
it was basically walked in game of free
shot<00:01:08.010> near<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.280> tour's<00:01:08.640> was<00:01:09.180> given<00:01:09.540> goals<00:01:09.750> so

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
shot near the tour's was given goals so

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.929 
shot near the tour's was given goals so
we<00:01:10.560> got<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> really<00:01:10.920> narrow<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.400> near<00:01:11.790> those

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
we got a really narrow that near those

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.910 
we got a really narrow that near those
opportunities<00:01:12.420> down<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.840> have<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.080> protect

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
was a little bit similar everybody was a

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.960 
was a little bit similar everybody was a
little<00:01:21.689> bit<00:01:21.900> ball<00:01:22.080> watching<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.790> the<00:01:23.790> guys

little bit ball watching and the guys
was<00:01:24.150> totally<00:01:24.479> free<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:24.689> we<00:01:25.170> have<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.470> analyze

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
was totally free so we have to analyze

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.649 
was totally free so we have to analyze
that<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.009> make<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.369> right<00:01:26.850> next<00:01:27.000> time<00:01:27.180> we<00:01:27.540> were

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
that and make it right next time we were

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.120 
that and make it right next time we were
too<00:01:27.869> late<00:01:27.900> we<00:01:28.350> were<00:01:28.470> too<00:01:28.650> late<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:29.040> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
too late we were too late in the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.310 
too late we were too late in the
pressing<00:01:29.520> game<00:01:29.729> 23<00:01:30.540> seconds<00:01:30.990> all<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.170> time

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
pressing game 23 seconds all the time

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.240 
pressing game 23 seconds all the time
when<00:01:31.799> we<00:01:32.630> stepped<00:01:33.630> up<00:01:34.020> break<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.650> lines<00:01:34.890> to

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
when we stepped up break the lines to

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.859 
when we stepped up break the lines to
get<00:01:35.369> them<00:01:35.520> on<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.700> pressure<00:01:35.909> we<00:01:36.360> gave<00:01:36.689> them

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
get them on the pressure we gave them

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.230 
get them on the pressure we gave them
too<00:01:37.110> much<00:01:37.290> time<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.650> space<00:01:38.070> there's<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.939> good

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
too much time and space there's a good

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.020 
too much time and space there's a good
passing<00:01:39.930> team<00:01:40.040> they're<00:01:41.040> confident<00:01:41.729> in<00:01:41.939> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
passing team they're confident in the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.319 
passing team they're confident in the
passing<00:01:42.479> game<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:43.140> it's<00:01:43.259> like<00:01:43.909> we<00:01:44.909> didn't<00:01:45.149> work

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
passing game so it's like we didn't work
