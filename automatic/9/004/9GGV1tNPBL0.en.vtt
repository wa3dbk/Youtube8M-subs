coolest guy ever so let's open it up
it's<00:00:36.870> uh<00:00:37.050> M<00:00:37.739> AMD<00:00:38.520> phenom<00:00:39.000> ii<00:00:39.840> x4<00:00:41.510> 810<00:00:43.070> very<00:00:44.070> nice

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
it's uh M AMD phenom ii x4 810 very nice

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.260 
it's uh M AMD phenom ii x4 810 very nice
CPU<00:00:44.940> much<00:00:45.510> better<00:00:46.200> than<00:00:46.440> my<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.250> Athlon<00:00:47.879> 2

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
CPU much better than my and the Athlon 2

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.130 
CPU much better than my and the Athlon 2
x2<00:00:49.789> so<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:50.879> can<00:00:51.000> see<00:00:51.270> it's<00:00:51.690> right<00:00:51.930> there<00:00:54.140> they

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
have a little window for that CPU right

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:05.929 
have a little window for that CPU right
there<00:01:01.160> now<00:01:02.160> let's<00:01:02.399> get<00:01:02.640> my<00:01:02.850> knife<00:01:03.830> okay<00:01:04.939> here's

there now let's get my knife okay here's

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.740 
there now let's get my knife okay here's
a<00:01:06.060> CPU<00:01:06.510> remember<00:01:07.290> not<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.590> cut<00:01:07.770> too<00:01:07.799> deep<00:01:08.659> or<00:01:09.659> it

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
a CPU remember not to cut too deep or it

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.690 
a CPU remember not to cut too deep or it
can<00:01:09.900> package<00:01:10.170> down<00:01:11.119> CPU<00:01:12.119> or<00:01:12.150> product<00:01:12.750> inside

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
can package down CPU or product inside

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.730 
can package down CPU or product inside
just<00:01:14.700> like<00:01:14.850> going<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.630> eat<00:01:15.780> game<00:01:16.080> man<00:01:16.380> keep

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:58.490 

it<00:02:54.099> looks<00:02:54.280> almost<00:02:54.730> exactly<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.629> same<00:02:55.659> as<00:02:56.080> my

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.530 

my<00:02:59.500> AMD<00:03:00.750> Athlon<00:03:01.750> 2x2<00:03:02.530> processor<00:03:03.459> it's<00:03:04.209> really

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
my AMD Athlon 2x2 processor it's really

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:17.039 
my AMD Athlon 2x2 processor it's really
small<00:03:04.780> but<00:03:05.319> it'll<00:03:05.709> still<00:03:06.190> did<00:03:06.459> a<00:03:06.489> job<00:03:13.920> I<00:03:16.049> think

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
small but it'll still did a job I think

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.059 
small but it'll still did a job I think
it<00:03:17.200> comes<00:03:17.440> with<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:19.470> thermal<00:03:20.470> grease<00:03:20.680> already

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
it comes with the thermal grease already

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.930 
it comes with the thermal grease already
on<00:03:21.250> it

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:36.300 

but<00:03:24.940> I<00:03:24.970> will<00:03:25.450> use<00:03:25.660> mine<00:03:25.930> anyways<00:03:35.250> let's<00:03:36.250> just

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
but I will use mine anyways let's just

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:48.660 
but I will use mine anyways let's just
put<00:03:36.640> it<00:03:36.730> here<00:03:36.760> inside<00:03:38.790> here's<00:03:39.790> my<00:03:39.970> actual<00:03:40.180> CPU

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670
