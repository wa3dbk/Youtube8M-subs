therefore to continue selling these

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.560 
therefore to continue selling these

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
uncomfortable if they stop to think

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.609 
uncomfortable if they stop to think
about<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.880> because<00:01:45.659> it's<00:01:45.840> life<00:01:46.049> imprisonment

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619
