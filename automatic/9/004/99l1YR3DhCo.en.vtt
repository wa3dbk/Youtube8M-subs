one of the things that you see a lot on
IBM<00:01:09.860> was<00:01:10.010> one<00:01:10.160> of<00:01:10.250> these<00:01:10.340> little<00:01:10.670> paper

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
device so basically this little pad

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.390 
device so basically this little pad
would<00:01:24.110> think<00:01:24.350> of<00:01:24.500> it<00:01:24.650> was<00:01:25.010> the<00:01:25.160> inspiration

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
would think of it was the inspiration

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.289 
would think of it was the inspiration
for<00:01:26.000> the<00:01:26.450> think<00:01:26.660> bad<00:01:26.810> name

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.749 

first<00:01:29.780> of<00:01:29.930> all<00:01:30.079> we<00:01:31.039> were<00:01:31.159> on<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:31.310> first<00:01:31.460> device

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
first of all we were on the first device

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.669 
first of all we were on the first device
to<00:01:31.789> choose<00:01:32.119> a<00:01:32.149> magnesium<00:01:32.630> case<00:01:33.049> material

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
to choose a magnesium case material

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:35.349 
to choose a magnesium case material
this<00:01:33.979> was<00:01:34.159> very<00:01:34.189> lightweight<00:01:34.609> but<00:01:34.820> yet<00:01:35.119> very

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:35.359 
this was very lightweight but yet very

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:37.600 
this was very lightweight but yet very
strong<00:01:35.780> it<00:01:36.289> allow<00:01:36.469> us<00:01:36.649> to<00:01:36.799> introduce<00:01:37.009> an

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
strong it allow us to introduce an

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.730 
strong it allow us to introduce an
integrated<00:01:38.149> heatsink<00:01:38.689> so<00:01:39.020> we<00:01:39.110> didn't<00:01:39.560> have<00:01:39.590> to

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
integrated heatsink so we didn't have to

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.709 
integrated heatsink so we didn't have to
have<00:01:39.860> a<00:01:39.890> moving<00:01:40.280> part<00:01:40.520> of<00:01:40.610> a<00:01:40.670> fan<00:01:40.939> in<00:01:41.149> here<00:01:41.270> it

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:41.719 
have a moving part of a fan in here it

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:42.999 
have a moving part of a fan in here it
took<00:01:41.869> out<00:01:42.049> of<00:01:42.229> the<00:01:42.289> heat

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
took out of the heat

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:44.889 
took out of the heat
again<00:01:43.610> to<00:01:43.759> be<00:01:43.789> durable<00:01:44.240> and<00:01:44.509> get<00:01:44.600> rid<00:01:44.750> of<00:01:44.810> the

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
again to be durable and get rid of the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:46.779 
again to be durable and get rid of the
moving<00:01:45.350> parts<00:01:45.380> of<00:01:45.710> the<00:01:45.770> hard<00:01:45.920> drive<00:01:46.159> we<00:01:46.700> were

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
moving parts of the hard drive we were

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.100 
moving parts of the hard drive we were
on<00:01:46.909> the<00:01:46.969> first<00:01:47.090> device<00:01:47.420> that<00:01:47.450> actually<00:01:47.869> used<00:01:48.020> a

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
on the first device that actually used a

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.109 
on the first device that actually used a
solid<00:01:48.319> safe<00:01:48.679> flash<00:01:48.950> for<00:01:49.520> hard<00:01:49.729> drive<00:01:49.939> which

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
solid safe flash for hard drive which

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.860 
solid safe flash for hard drive which
was<00:01:50.270> very<00:01:50.899> unique<00:01:51.289> in<00:01:51.560> its<00:01:51.709> in<00:01:51.860> that<00:01:52.009> time

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.720 

but<00:01:55.320> we<00:01:55.410> actually<00:01:55.500> did<00:01:55.860> learn<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.130> lot<00:01:56.250> from

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
but we actually did learn a lot from

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.150 
but we actually did learn a lot from
this<00:01:56.970> experience<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.720> first<00:01:58.230> of<00:01:58.380> all<00:01:58.560> we

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
this experience and first of all we

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.890 
this experience and first of all we
learned<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.670> you<00:02:00.180> know<00:02:00.300> for<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.600> general

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
learned that you know for a general

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.600 
learned that you know for a general
computing<00:02:01.530> device<00:02:01.770> people<00:02:02.160> won't<00:02:02.340> accept

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
computing device people won't accept

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.550 
computing device people won't accept
compromise<00:02:03.000> for<00:02:03.450> any<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.660> the<00:02:03.720> functions<00:02:04.530> that

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
compromise for any of the functions that

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.530 
compromise for any of the functions that
are<00:02:04.650> performed<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.820> not<00:02:05.970> only<00:02:06.120> has<00:02:06.300> to<00:02:06.390> be<00:02:06.510> a

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
are performed so it not only has to be a

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.750 
are performed so it not only has to be a
great<00:02:06.780> slate<00:02:07.170> device<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.920> also<00:02:08.190> has<00:02:08.460> to<00:02:08.610> be<00:02:08.670> a

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:08.760 
great slate device it also has to be a

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.240 
great slate device it also has to be a
great<00:02:09.030> keyboard<00:02:09.900> device<00:02:10.050> if<00:02:10.979> they're<00:02:11.130> going

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
great keyboard device if they're going

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.790 
great keyboard device if they're going
to<00:02:11.310> use<00:02:11.460> it<00:02:11.610> in<00:02:11.700> multiple<00:02:11.820> environments<00:02:12.800> we

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
to use it in multiple environments we

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.350 
to use it in multiple environments we
use<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.010> lot<00:02:14.250> of<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.430> learning<00:02:14.610> as<00:02:14.880> we<00:02:15.030> develop

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
use a lot of that learning as we develop

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.440 
use a lot of that learning as we develop
some<00:02:15.570> of<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.750> next-generation<00:02:17.450> convertible

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
some of the next-generation convertible

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.400 
some of the next-generation convertible
devices<00:02:18.870> right

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410

notebook but also a great tablet now as

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.390 
notebook but also a great tablet now as
we<00:02:23.940> develop<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.540> new<00:02:24.690> you<00:02:25.320> want<00:02:25.470> hybrid<00:02:25.920> the

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
we develop the new you want hybrid the

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.550 
we develop the new you want hybrid the
idea<00:02:26.790> band<00:02:27.090> of<00:02:27.660> what<00:02:27.870> you're<00:02:28.020> seeing<00:02:28.200> is<00:02:28.410> that

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
idea band of what you're seeing is that

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.190 
idea band of what you're seeing is that
that<00:02:28.740> can<00:02:28.980> be<00:02:29.070> a<00:02:29.100> great<00:02:29.610> tablet<00:02:30.480> slate<00:02:30.930> device

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
that can be a great tablet slate device

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.800 
that can be a great tablet slate device
by<00:02:31.440> removing<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.490> display<00:02:32.970> but<00:02:33.240> also<00:02:33.330> when

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
by removing the display but also when

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.190 
by removing the display but also when
you<00:02:33.840> make<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.260> display<00:02:34.500> back<00:02:34.770> it's<00:02:35.550> a<00:02:35.700> great

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
you make the display back it's a great

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.090 
you make the display back it's a great
notebook<00:02:37.200> device<00:02:37.440> so<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.710> does<00:02:37.860> both

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
notebook device so it does both

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.250 
notebook device so it does both
functions<00:02:38.640> without<00:02:39.090> compromise<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:39.900> that's

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
functions without compromise and that's

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.610 
functions without compromise and that's
really<00:02:40.590> what<00:02:41.040> people<00:02:41.070> are<00:02:41.370> looking<00:02:41.430> for
