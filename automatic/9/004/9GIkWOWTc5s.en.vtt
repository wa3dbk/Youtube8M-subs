00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.069
 following the chord version 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.749
 I was in agreement 

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:12.439
 in the piano and music in general 

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:15.389
 to an overlay of at least 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.179
 sounds 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:20.179
 as in this case 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.949
 Now, how should these three sounds be superimposed? 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.290
 of a basic sound pradines love fundamental of the corde I want to make you 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.060
 which name cam to him for example chord action said from the 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.250
 note madrid that this the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.230
 was born I'm going to build another two 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.010
 secondary sounds that will be coordinated by living distances 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.830
 blind we already know by 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:48.969
 the intervals 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.440
 what is a third itself are three distance notes two 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.440
 before the full i peru 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.150
 the sounding went 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.150
 in notes 2 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.810
 murad vocera form in a hurry 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.050
 today it will be called chord seeing greater 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.530
 today they will be called perfect chord since it is formed by two thirds 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.440
 Closing more in your stand and cough is between 2 and the sun for a fair fifth 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.530
 he calls us just walter be natural harmonic because this is act 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.850
 acora nature although we really have to say that with tuning 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.070
 tempered with the type of tuning that is currently used its intention is 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.410
 exact 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.330
 like ricky the physical law 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.430
 but it's a fifth time and for us 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.430
 and it is called fifth just the distance all 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.140
 events in the notes will donate bynum 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.310
 a quick way with the big finger 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.009
 uu the fundamental note that I on the bass when I say on the bass I do not mean 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.300
 that is going to touch a serious one but that is going to be 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.299
 the note that being more to the left more notes more serious 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.620
 of arts of the corde takes my same mode 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.250
 I remembered more 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.110
 the Japanese apart the first great genre of genre music 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.240
 1 the so-called higher mode 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.299
 is the bright chord the native in 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.270
 we will not let you know what the marches 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.439
 be in me 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:20.189
 in repairs 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:21.749
 a number one 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:23.949
 today for example 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:27.629
 in music today will be box more affirmative music in this adventure of 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.409
 peru performances 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:32.029
 there is nothing variant of this chord 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:36.939
 which is that the note that occupied the pp the middle note 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:40.009
 the third degree of circle 

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:43.540
 muñoz ledo so I put the face of October that would be all 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.759
 nothing in the min 

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:49.009
 peru is a resentful a semitone then with which flat 

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:52.170
 transformed another chord that has 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.350
 another third let's notice that the major court 

00:02:56.929 --> 00:03:01.599
 a third large one third of the domi muhumed tones we have said 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:04.250
 although the bottom 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.059
 villarroya 3rd plus girl a third minor with a tone 

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:10.919
 and a semitone on the top 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:14.309
 a lower chord level 

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:17.709
 do not hit reverse I'll have the third most girl 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.819
 a tone and a half is dorrego nobody knows or demo the half tone 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:23.679
 the 

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:27.699
 part of the bass in the lower part of the crib and the upper part of the coruña 

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:33.399
 I'll have the third 'big' the third major and have two tones of flat E with 

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:35.959
 fa because the sound me gets in 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.019
 it is a tone and then fa sun 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.559
 by minors more 

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:42.369
 melancholic more off 

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:44.329
 a shadow that cordes 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.449
 percent in May a 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:49.379
 the work of richard strauss german composer 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.379
 well zarathustra spoke 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:53.390
 percent starts with this one 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.479
 with this one is famous 

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:59.799
 Burnt motive that easily pass from the major corde to minor 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.989
 one and there we have 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.949
 pragmatically shepherd lamb 

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:09.049
 It should also be clarified 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.859
 of the chords can not even reverse recircula corde can have 

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:17.019
 efe fundamental in its seat sun 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.559
 but you can also expect two other formulas or forms 

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:21.870
 my second still 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.650
 holcim going on 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.979
 mara zone of the acute and beginning with the note migno 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:31.490
 where he does not lose his fundamentals of the cooperative remains to be invested in 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.990
 the first investment 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.340
 and finally 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.680
 soto hamilton 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.430
 already in the second possible inversion the accordion of the king now passes to rybak and 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.389
 the community 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:43.009
 designed as sun 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:45.949
 1 ibarra according to investment then 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:48.949
 fundamental position of the loin ball 

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:53.120
 a first and inversion of the accordion 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.770
 according to the version of the slide, this occurs in the largest and in the smallest
