00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.370
 motor sports in Antioquia like 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.650
 motorsport motorcycling 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.180
 karts among others need a 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.090
 worthy scenario in which they can 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.279
 train and compete the athletes a 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.290
 cause that takes more than 10 years and that 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.680
 now he takes up a commission from the board of 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.680
 medellin 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.650
 the ica was given to the municipalities of the valley 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.070
 of boring and the antioquia department 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.050
 this lot to make a public park 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.750
 it's 97 hectares that the Medellín River 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.880
 part in two is located in the 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.700
 beautiful city of eight minutes 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.470
 Medellin so far have been intervened 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.180
 part of these lands with the 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.800
 remodeling of your water park 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.080
 thorn that will handle on loan the 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.020
 Municipality of Medellin and the area of 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.760
 stadiums of that northern municipality but 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.250
 the maximum promoter of the park for 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.710
 motor sports where hernán cuartas 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.380
 says that there is still space that in 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.329
 these 40 hectares that remain to the side 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.760
 east of the river next to the road to 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.490
 machado is all given to start 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.509
 to the much desired 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.509
 the lake is long 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.500
 It is a high lake for batista but not for 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.610
 smoke 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.950
 to unused lots on the side 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.460
 right of the Medellin river in the area 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.400
 oriental a lot of 40 hectares where 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.750
 is where we are presenting 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.910
 practically the whole project the 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.760
 project would be involving more or 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.350
 minus 27 28 sports disciplines that 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.930
 they go from motoring the 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.140
 motorcycling and karts as sports 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.030
 of motor that are the only ones or of the 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.920
 unique that in Medellin do not have 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.380
 spaces do not even have space 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.890
 we would also have a lake because 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.200
 we would be taking advantage of a few wells 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.470
 that were left from some quarries when 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:02.009
 they searched the excavation there and 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:04.920
 mineral exploitation for needs 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.450
 of the municipality medellín and of then 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.330
 use that lake in activities 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.700
 boats for boating for 10 and 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.489
 for all these activities including the 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.640
 triathlon could have a very important place 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.080
 special the owners of the lot in 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.300
 final are the municipality of Medellin 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.310
 and the antioquia department their 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.019
 representatives have shown all the 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.709
 goodwill to move forward the 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.110
 initiative 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.750
 this commission of the council of Medellin 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.970
 She hopes to become the godmother of 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.150
 new motor park 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.130
 we do not want it to happen as in 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.870
 certain dependencies and in certain 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.030
 governments 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.640
 that time pass we have very good 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.799
 intention good will we have very 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:52.260
 good relationship between all but not 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:55.490
 we have realities conclusions if not what 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.860
 we can do surely 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.380
 we will tell the city we could not take 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.600
 building by self-construction if it's 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.460
 that if it is the case that the lake 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.530
 accurate for water sports and 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.600
 to bathe according to studies that 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.520
 promoters hired are waters 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.410
 filtered from the Medellin river that remained 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.540
 in these pits after a 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.940
 exploitation of the quarry there 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.160
 he did for many years what 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.470
 warn is that the lake can not continue 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.650
 without suffering and security that there have been 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.610
 drowned for a few years 250 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.800
 people because we who have ex 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.510
 enap that we have athletes so 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.610
 advanced 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.819
 in motorcycling as martín cárdenas 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.739
 tomas stefano door david gaviria table 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:43.430
 Santiago Hernandez and Yonny Hernández 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:46.970
 is now 60% would be a green 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.860
 25% wet area 15% one zone 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.110
 height for the tracks and development 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.299
 of urbanism now what is missing is that 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.129
 there is accompaniment and will 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.129
 policy to get it out 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.740
 the city has come with certain 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.130
 permissiveness 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.780
 although it does controls there is permissiveness and 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.030
 that's why you see the spikes in 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.060
 different streets that's why it's observed in 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.160
 the motorcycle competitions in the palms 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.350
 and in other places 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.380
 that's why in neighborhood colombia in robledo 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:23.020
 etcetera etcetera this happens and that 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.150
 adrenaline that the boys have in 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.470
 what other scenario could be left of a 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.600
 better way 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.970
 what the park brings to the city today 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.010
 tulip ospina on the grounds to 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.710
 which we refer absolutely 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:40.910
 nothing there we could have a scenario of 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:43.910
 world cut orbital reference from the 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.160
 The city of Medellín in Colombia does not 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.920
 would have the scenario with which we have 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.450
 dreamed from hernán 4a to us 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.450
 for a long time 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:57.860
 the adrenaline project is to say the 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.870
 promotion of extreme sports that 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.029
 it is also in the development plan of 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.830
 Medellin a home for life seems 

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:06.439
 the opportune moment to achieve the 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.449
 objective say that the private partners 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:10.279
 of this project have about five thousand 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:13.389
 million pesos to start as 

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:13.389
 initial bet 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.730
 On December 7 we hope to be 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:25.010
 inaugurating the new hospital council of 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:28.190
 Medellin has an investment close to 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.930
 45 billion pesos and serve 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.020
 the child population in Medellin 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:35.450
 metropolitan area other municipalities and of 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:39.620
 other departments I leave the following 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:41.810
 reflection said the hospital worked 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:45.410
 the consumer cooperative that stopped 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:48.710
 pay rent is for 450 million at 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:53.240
 municipality of Medellín when it operated in 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:55.250
 4 in 600 square meters and only 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.430
 pay a lease of 35 thousand pesos 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:01.070
 monthly the estimated amount of what is not 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.000
 paid reaches about 450 million 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.470
 pesos 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.170
 it is good that the cooperative has 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:10.100
 expanded and now I'm doing works 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:12.260
 in the metropolitan area for more than 16 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.640
 billion pesos but I think that 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.890
 have to give an answer to the 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.660
 municipality and the child population 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.810
 from the capital of the department of 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.810
 antioquia
