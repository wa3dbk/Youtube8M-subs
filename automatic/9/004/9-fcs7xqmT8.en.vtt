00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 how about friends of jay mania how are 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.740
 today we are going to teach you 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.960
 install xbox framework on your 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.429
 samsung device with lollipop let's go 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.429
 with the logo and we start with the video 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.120
 let's start with this tutorial as 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.800
 we can see we have installed exposed in 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.390
 a version here we have the processes 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.150
 that are installed in a version of 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.640
 samsung lollipop as seen here in the 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.890
 notification panel and we exist to 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.680
 the adjustments and we 're going to general we 're going to 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.140
 find that we are in a 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.930
 version of android 5.0 and it works until 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.820
 5 points 0.2 I should clarify that no 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.100
 the round samsungs that are from 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.230
 5.1 although I think that to date there is no 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.640
 no device but in most 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.400
 devices that have been tested in this 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.710
 case shown in a s 4 in a 3 and in 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.030
 a 5 on all three devices has 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.160
 worked well 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.410
 this system then we need 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.970
 this is why we need to 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.010
 perform this process are these two 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.480
 files that we see here one like 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.900
 we see extermination 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.820
 and the other one is an apk what we're going to 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.930
 do with these two files is flyer the 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.970
 cip that we see here exposes of sdk 21 that 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.159
 is a sim modified by the 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.080
 developer art the 97 so it's that 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.820
 all credits go for him 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.050
 If you want to donate or something 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.910
 TomÃ¡s we are going to leave the link in the 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.520
 description of your original post in x 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.560
 developers and once we have chosen 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.620
 we are going to install this apk so that 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.510
 we go with the procedure and we return what 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.240
 what we are going to need is going to be 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:37.600
 our note or our s4 in our 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.640
 samsung device in recovery mode the 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.230
 indispensable requirements for this 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.420
 procedure be usuario 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.530
 root have a recovery modified as 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.690
 what we see here in this case I 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.610
 I use files touch can be double or 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.540
 rp too or if you get some version 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.670
 of that w 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.580
 the same is compatible then you need 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.650
 are recovered modified to be root and the most 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.750
 important of all is that you run to run 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.729
 stereo of quesada this means that 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.290
 it does not work with the official firmwares 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.479
 from samsung because they come with no 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.220
 decks and others and yet still 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.140
 there is no support for this type of 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.030
 firmware is this means that this 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.850
 process only supports rose 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.830
 modified or stock roms but that are 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.390
 gave sada how can you know this what 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.130
 you can check in the post where you have 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.590
 downloaded the rom there must come 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.870
 indicated if stages of each for the 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.069
 note for example we have several several 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.900
 factual versions 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.840
 the modified versions the customs 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.999
 that weigh around 1.2 gigabyte 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.799
 already come from the exact ones then a 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:34.480
 Once I know that I have fulfilled these three 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.950
 requirements what we are going to do is 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.170
 player the sip who had mentioned them 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.780
 at the beginning of the video and we're going to go to 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.250
 install if we are going to look for it in the sd 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.659
 card that is where I have it if I 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.549
 you have in another side because you already have it 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:49.900
 what to look for you and we will find here 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:51.730
 that we have the exposed is this to rm yes 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.700
 love we are as we see it starts to 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.579
 weaken exposing and we see that here we 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.120
 amount in this part it is important to check 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:03.219
 what it says install with freedom 2 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.680
 this is very important to get the foundations 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:08.349
 case that when installing he 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.709
 the system to expose on the phone you 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:13.390
 give some error we are going to use this 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.980
 name we will be able to solve it like this is 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.599
 that pointed saved it and if you have 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.060
 problems leave us in the comments and 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.280
 let's have the solution so once 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.700
 that is already installed we go back and go 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.830
 to make a reboot system 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.629
 this reboot system is going to take a good 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.819
 because what the flyer does this 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:31.290
 yep it's delete dalvik and cache so 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.640
 both all the applications that 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.190
 we installed are to start 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.599
 update like this is that we're going to wait for 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.420
 that only charge to see that it is 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:41.750
 turning around and we come back in a moment 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.790
 when the cell phone has started 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.890
 After a while we will see that the 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.900
 cellular already started and now we're going to 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.810
 direct to install the application that 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.569
 I told them we have to download 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.620
 this is the you find in the me the 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:59.170
 download on the same route as the cip 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.150
 sd card and we go to the bottom until the 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.370
 bottom is this down here expocity 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.500
 installer let's click and we 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.060
 We will give and install as if you install 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.590
 install as a normal application to me 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.299
 I get this screen because I have it 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.860
 installed in any way I the 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.560
 I can reinstall as if it were 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.889
 a kind of update but since 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.019
 it was installed we are going to open it 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.689
 these are the same steps and let's see 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.300
 that here in framework forgiveness in 

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:26.189
 framework here are already 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.400
 installed the two processes that's what 

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:31.349
 only that you have to do now 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.330
 the rest would be nothing more than going to download and 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:35.580
 check compatible modules that 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.919
 can you install your system to samsung 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.080
 in this case I only use it 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.360
 to install what would be amplified and 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.129
 fix lollywood memory lic 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.169
 those two clicks work to correct 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:47.370
 one the unnecessary battery spending that 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.039
 have your device when it has 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.599
 off and the other to reduce spending 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:53.189
 of memory that the roms generate in 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:55.409
 lollipop so you do not get saturated 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:56.939
 cell if you want to know more about the 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:58.289
 tweet up here I'll leave you here 

00:04:56.939 --> 00:05:00.389
 a label over here is going to start 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.310
 come out on a video that we already made 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:04.560
 A few months ago about these for 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.360
 the battery life and good friends 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.699
 well this would be everything I hope there 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.430
 been clear in the procedure that 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:13.860
 I explained I have to emphasize very clearly 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.199
 this this yeah I'll let them here 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.460
 it is a special one for rom samsung if 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.499
 you want is going to be this one serves in another 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.759
 system you're going to shine and it's not going to 

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:23.670
 work only serves to 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:27.210
 samsung device 4 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:29.520
 3 s 5 very likely not 4 too and 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.380
 in that 6 also but it would be a matter 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.910
 to prove it in these first three 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.060
 that mentions in which it has already been 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:38.370
 tested and it works and all those being 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.960
 the lt version models we have never 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.550
 tested in a processor version 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.620
 exynos so if you want to try it and 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.690
 give us bushy here below would be very 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.220
 good for us so that would be 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.210
 all friends take care of each other we see each other 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.210
 next goodbye 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:57.059
 and me 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.980
 it was very hot 

00:05:57.059 --> 00:06:03.080
 in the 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:03.080
 whom I want to eat
