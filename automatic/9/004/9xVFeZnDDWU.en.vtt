00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.990
 Today we are going to talk about the sand of the 

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:07.660
 chinchillas the importance that it has 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.549
 the bathroom in the life of chinchillas 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.589
 many of you have them and not 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:14.379
 you know how important it is that 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:17.019
 can bathe is a very intimate moment 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:20.230
 that we have managed to record on the set as well 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:22.029
 that comes header and you go to see a video 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.630
 in detail of the bathroom of the chinchilla 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:24.630
 we go 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.280
 and many of you have chinchillas 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:33.160
 and you really do not know the importance that 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.650
 has the bathroom in them every chinchilla 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.050
 you have to have your sandbox and where you can 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.120
 take those baths because it's vital and the 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.940
 love how you are going to see in our video 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.820
 the chinchillas have a very 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.510
 dense is the densest of all in each 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.360
 one of the follicles are born 80 hairs and in 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.239
 every square inch of your skin 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.550
 thousands of hairs sprout 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.840
 they need a care and the first 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.550
 question that arises is why the 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.070
 chinchillas have so much good hair 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.350
 they live in high places in the Andes' in 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.050
 areas where especially in winter is 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.490
 quite cold and that hair protects them 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.290
 but it also not only protects them 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.650
 against the cold but it protects them 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.090
 there are many people against their predators 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.250
 that you want to eat chinchillas 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.930
 when I tell myself people, well, they have 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.300
 many predators many animals 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.820
 They try to hunt as their food 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:28.119
 such a way that when these predators 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.520
 they arrive and catch them instead of catching 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.360
 the body of the chinchilla catch the 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.790
 hair 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.560
 in his hand in his claws with his hair and 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.410
 the chinchilla can run and 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.900
 get away that's very good and it's a great 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.840
 advantage for them but against 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.580
 you need a hair with a lot of care 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.950
 women usually have long hair and 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.260
 normally you have to take care of more 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.690
 hair that men like me that we 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.450
 We are going bald, so it's worth 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.450
 chinchillas need to bathe but not 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.340
 with water the chinchillas never need 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.310
 a sand many times you ask us 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.710
 It can be beach sand , it can not be 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.979
 in the beach sand because they even more 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:12.250
 you are going to mess up they need very fine sand 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.930
 so thin that your coat can penetrate 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.250
 so tight and take out the moisture or 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.390
 any dirt that can be left 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:25.209
 trapped in his skin all the remains 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.400
 of fat and also that hernia that is 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.520
 mineral if it smells to be of volcanic origin 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.380
 also those that they use the bathroom in 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.709
 nature occurs in places 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.810
 quiet in intimacy the same as 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.140
 the people when we go to bathe 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.880
 we also do it in intimate places 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.140
 because these animals at that time 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.730
 they are completely unprotected they are 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.250
 concentrating all your energy and all your 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.709
 acts in cleaning his hair forgetting 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.959
 of whether or not there are predators around 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.239
 therefore it is important to leave them 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.709
 calm and do not expect it to happen 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.019
 any way they are always going to 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.709
 try doing hiding a bit of 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.709
 your threats
