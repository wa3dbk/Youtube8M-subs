mind of I'll have the caulking in it

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.310 
mind of I'll have the caulking in it
when<00:02:31.190> I<00:02:31.220> actually<00:02:31.430> do<00:02:31.910> it<00:02:32.090> here<00:02:32.990> in<00:02:33.080> a<00:02:33.170> minute

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
when I actually do it here in a minute

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.480 
when I actually do it here in a minute
and<00:02:35.200> it<00:02:36.200> will<00:02:36.290> finish<00:02:36.500> looking<00:02:37.160> something

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
and it will finish looking something

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.120 
and it will finish looking something
like<00:02:37.880> that
