we're at now then you go to general then

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.259 
we're at now then you go to general then
you<00:00:24.960> go<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.109> cellular<00:00:25.800> right<00:00:26.609> here<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:26.910> says<00:00:27.060> on

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
you go to cellular right here it says on

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.150 
you go to cellular right here it says on
we're<00:00:27.960> gonna<00:00:28.080> go<00:00:28.260> in<00:00:28.410> there<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.800> where<00:00:29.070> it

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
we're gonna go in there and where it

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.420 
we're gonna go in there and where it
says<00:00:29.310> cellular<00:00:29.789> data<00:00:31.130> that's<00:00:32.130> we're<00:00:32.369> gonna

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
says cellular data that's we're gonna

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.280 
says cellular data that's we're gonna
turn<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:32.790> off<00:00:32.940> not<00:00:33.210> enable<00:00:33.600> 3G<00:00:33.840> or<00:00:34.079> data

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
turn it off not enable 3G or data

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.290 
turn it off not enable 3G or data
roaming<00:00:34.530> ready<00:00:34.829> go<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.040> cellular<00:00:35.520> data<00:00:35.700> tell

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
roaming ready go to cellular data tell

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.709 
roaming ready go to cellular data tell
it<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.600> off<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.140> see<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.469> II<00:00:37.680> went<00:00:37.860> away

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
it to off and you see that II went away

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.450 
it to off and you see that II went away
so<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:39.870> means<00:00:40.079> our<00:00:40.260> cellular<00:00:40.559> data<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.219> off

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
so that means our cellular data is off

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.729 
so that means our cellular data is off
completely<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.899> nice<00:00:43.110> trick<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.590> know

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
completely this is a nice trick to know

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.020 
completely this is a nice trick to know
for<00:00:43.980> when<00:00:44.100> you're<00:00:44.250> roaming<00:00:44.640> if<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.879> don't

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
for when you're roaming if you don't

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.799 
for when you're roaming if you don't
want<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.329> rack<00:00:45.480> up<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.719> big<00:00:45.899> data<00:00:46.140> bill<00:00:46.910> so<00:00:47.910> while

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
want to rack up a big data bill so while

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.240 
want to rack up a big data bill so while
your<00:00:48.960> data<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.379> off<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.710> may<00:00:49.829> want<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.070> turn

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
your data is off you may want to turn

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.060 
your data is off you may want to turn
your<00:00:50.430> Wi-Fi<00:00:50.610> on<00:00:51.170> that's<00:00:52.170> how<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.379> do<00:00:52.590> that

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
your Wi-Fi on that's how you do that

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.220 
your Wi-Fi on that's how you do that
just<00:00:53.460> go<00:00:53.610> back<00:00:53.789> into<00:00:54.000> settings<00:00:54.210> turn<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.079> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
just go back into settings turn on the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.200 
just go back into settings turn on the
Wi-Fi<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.800> then<00:00:55.920> all<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.699> these<00:00:57.000> networks

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
Wi-Fi and then all of these networks

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.420 
Wi-Fi and then all of these networks
your<00:00:57.539> show<00:00:57.690> will<00:00:57.960> show<00:00:57.989> up<00:00:58.320> if<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.190> remembers

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
your show will show up if it remembers

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.700 
your show will show up if it remembers
one<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.270> will<00:01:00.449> go<00:01:00.989> ahead<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.199> connect<00:01:01.530> and

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
one it will go ahead and connect and

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.789 
one it will go ahead and connect and
you'll<00:01:01.829> see<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.100> little<00:01:02.280> icon<00:01:02.489> on<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.969> top

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
you'll see that little icon on the top

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:07.420 
you'll see that little icon on the top
so<00:01:04.799> now<00:01:04.830> you're<00:01:05.070> connected<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.549> Wi-Fi<00:01:05.850> and

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
so now you're connected to Wi-Fi and

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.240 
so now you're connected to Wi-Fi and
Wi-Fi<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.670> usually<00:01:09.240> pretty<00:01:09.479> fast<00:01:09.869> if<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:11.220> are

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
Wi-Fi is usually pretty fast if you are

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.719 
Wi-Fi is usually pretty fast if you are
on<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.119> website<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.960> you're<00:01:13.530> but<00:01:13.680> your<00:01:14.070> image

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
on a website and you're but your image

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.109 
on a website and you're but your image
will<00:01:14.909> load<00:01:15.060> probably<00:01:15.390> about<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.689> fast<00:01:17.119> you

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
will load probably about this fast you

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.940 
will load probably about this fast you
can<00:01:18.390> go<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.689> any<00:01:18.869> website<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.409> could<00:01:19.560> go<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.740> on

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
can go to any website you could go to on

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.660 
can go to any website you could go to on
your<00:01:20.070> computer<00:01:20.130> usually<00:01:22.220> here<00:01:23.220> we're<00:01:23.369> just<00:01:23.400> on

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
your computer usually here we're just on

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.920 
your computer usually here we're just on
our<00:01:23.790> CTC<00:01:24.270> website<00:01:25.939> so<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.360> kind<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.689> shows

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
our CTC website so this kind of shows

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.620 
our CTC website so this kind of shows
about<00:01:28.560> how<00:01:28.740> fast<00:01:28.979> Wi-Fi<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.360> can<00:01:30.479> see

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
about how fast Wi-Fi is and you can see

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.819 
about how fast Wi-Fi is and you can see
that<00:01:30.750> you're<00:01:30.930> on<00:01:30.960> Wi-Fi<00:01:31.200> because<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.740> that

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
that you're on Wi-Fi because of that

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.859 
that you're on Wi-Fi because of that
little<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.310> come<00:01:32.579> on<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.790> top<00:01:32.939> now<00:01:33.540> if<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.689> want

little I come on the top now if you want
to<00:01:33.960> turn<00:01:34.079> Wi-Fi<00:01:34.290> off<00:01:35.180> just<00:01:36.180> like<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:36.450> see<00:01:37.079> that

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
to turn Wi-Fi off just like so see that

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.179 
to turn Wi-Fi off just like so see that
icons<00:01:37.799> gone<00:01:38.930> so<00:01:39.930> now<00:01:40.110> our<00:01:40.140> Wi-Fi<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.100> our

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
icons gone so now our Wi-Fi and our

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.810 
icons gone so now our Wi-Fi and our
cellular<00:01:41.430> data<00:01:41.759> are<00:01:42.060> both<00:01:42.360> turned<00:01:42.659> off<00:01:43.610> we<00:01:44.610> can

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
cellular data are both turned off we can

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.670 
cellular data are both turned off we can
go<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.470> and<00:01:46.470> we<00:01:46.590> can<00:01:46.740> turn<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.040> back<00:01:47.189> on<00:01:47.430> just<00:01:48.680> by

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
go in and we can turn it back on just by

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.399 
go in and we can turn it back on just by
toggling<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.250> switch<00:01:50.490> sometimes<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:51.060> sticks

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
toggling the switch sometimes of sticks

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.280 
toggling the switch sometimes of sticks
toggling<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.560> switch<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:53.369> on<00:01:54.079> now<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.110> say

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
toggling that switch to on now I say

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.530 
toggling that switch to on now I say
that<00:01:55.439> he<00:01:55.619> has<00:01:55.829> reappeared<00:01:56.040> e<00:01:56.700> stands<00:01:57.149> for<00:01:57.240> edge

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
that he has reappeared e stands for edge

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.530 
that he has reappeared e stands for edge
which<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.530> name<00:01:58.680> for<00:01:58.890> 2g<00:01:59.250> data<00:01:59.540> while

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
which is the name for 2g data while

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
want to reset that's right before you

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.560 
want to reset that's right before you
leave<00:02:26.120> town<00:02:26.560> so<00:02:27.560> press<00:02:27.860> reset<00:02:28.250> statistics<00:02:29.030> and

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
leave town so press reset statistics and

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.980 
leave town so press reset statistics and
that<00:02:29.900> will<00:02:30.110> allow<00:02:30.320> you<00:02:30.380> to<00:02:31.330> monitor<00:02:32.330> only<00:02:32.540> the

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.100 
data you're using while you're traveling
or<00:02:34.640> roaming<00:02:35.060> data<00:02:35.270> because<00:02:35.750> that's<00:02:35.930> usually

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
or roaming data because that's usually

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.680 
or roaming data because that's usually
the<00:02:36.410> stuff<00:02:36.590> that<00:02:36.830> costs<00:02:37.040> more<00:02:37.340> so<00:02:37.610> now<00:02:38.390> we<00:02:38.450> have

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
the stuff that costs more so now we have

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.740 
the stuff that costs more so now we have
our<00:02:39.130> statistics<00:02:40.130> reset<00:02:40.640> and<00:02:41.090> we're<00:02:41.600> just

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
our statistics reset and we're just

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.030 
our statistics reset and we're just
going<00:02:41.900> to<00:02:41.960> browse<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.260> internet<00:02:42.860> a<00:02:42.890> little

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
our CPC website and on here we're going

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.310 
our CPC website and on here we're going
to<00:02:52.250> just<00:02:52.430> load<00:02:53.180> an<00:02:53.330> image<00:02:53.420> and<00:02:53.900> you'll<00:02:54.050> see

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
to just load an image and you'll see

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.880 
to just load an image and you'll see
that<00:02:54.620> 2g<00:02:55.220> data<00:02:55.490> is<00:02:55.820> actually<00:02:56.890> significantly

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
that 2g data is actually significantly

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.520 
that 2g data is actually significantly
slower<00:02:58.250> than<00:02:58.640> a<00:02:58.940> normal<00:02:59.240> Wi-Fi<00:02:59.630> signal<00:03:00.320> and

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
slower than a normal Wi-Fi signal and

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.960 
slower than a normal Wi-Fi signal and
for<00:03:01.010> that<00:03:01.100> reason<00:03:01.160> you're<00:03:01.610> probably<00:03:01.790> gonna

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
for that reason you're probably gonna

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.060 
for that reason you're probably gonna
want<00:03:02.210> to<00:03:02.300> be<00:03:02.450> using<00:03:02.750> Wi-Fi<00:03:03.140> networks<00:03:03.710> as<00:03:03.860> much

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
want to be using Wi-Fi networks as much

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.560 
want to be using Wi-Fi networks as much
as<00:03:04.220> possible<00:03:04.370> when<00:03:04.790> you're<00:03:04.880> roaming<00:03:05.240> anyway

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
as possible when you're roaming anyway

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.840 
as possible when you're roaming anyway
and<00:03:05.870> that's<00:03:06.410> good<00:03:06.710> because<00:03:07.070> roaming<00:03:07.670> data

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
and that's good because roaming data

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.780 
and that's good because roaming data
does<00:03:08.690> cost<00:03:08.960> more<00:03:09.200> if<00:03:09.620> you<00:03:09.830> go<00:03:10.010> over<00:03:10.430> you're

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
does cost more if you go over you're

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.230 
does cost more if you go over you're
allowed<00:03:11.210> usage<00:03:11.720> I<00:03:12.190> recommend<00:03:13.190> that<00:03:13.400> you<00:03:13.460> find

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
allowed usage I recommend that you find

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.610 
allowed usage I recommend that you find
out<00:03:14.360> what<00:03:14.510> you're<00:03:14.690> allowed<00:03:14.900> usage<00:03:15.350> that<00:03:15.560> is

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
out what you're allowed usage that is

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.430 
out what you're allowed usage that is
covered<00:03:16.130> on<00:03:16.310> your<00:03:16.400> data<00:03:16.940> plan<00:03:17.120> is<00:03:17.570> before<00:03:18.290> you

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
covered on your data plan is before you

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.470 
covered on your data plan is before you
leave<00:03:18.650> town<00:03:18.920> so<00:03:19.310> that<00:03:19.460> you<00:03:19.550> know<00:03:19.730> how<00:03:19.940> much<00:03:19.970> to

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
leave town so that you know how much to

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.910 
leave town so that you know how much to
look<00:03:20.660> for<00:03:20.900> when<00:03:21.110> you're<00:03:21.260> monitoring<00:03:21.800> your

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
look for when you're monitoring your

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.090 
look for when you're monitoring your
data<00:03:22.570> now<00:03:23.570> by<00:03:23.780> resetting<00:03:24.200> those<00:03:24.470> statistics

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
data now by resetting those statistics

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.010 
data now by resetting those statistics
that<00:03:25.790> brought<00:03:26.030> us<00:03:26.150> back<00:03:26.180> to<00:03:26.510> zero<00:03:26.810> and<00:03:27.700> so<00:03:28.700> now

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
that brought us back to zero and so now

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.720 
that brought us back to zero and so now
we<00:03:30.020> can<00:03:30.230> go<00:03:30.350> in<00:03:30.560> and<00:03:30.740> see<00:03:30.920> how<00:03:31.070> much<00:03:31.280> we've<00:03:31.520> used

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
we can go in and see how much we've used

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.840 
we can go in and see how much we've used
so<00:03:31.940> far<00:03:31.970> so<00:03:32.750> we<00:03:32.870> can<00:03:33.080> know<00:03:33.310> how<00:03:34.310> much<00:03:34.370> we<00:03:34.670> can

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
so far so we can know how much we can

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.190 
so far so we can know how much we can
use<00:03:35.150> still<00:03:36.160> again<00:03:37.160> we<00:03:37.340> go<00:03:37.520> into<00:03:37.820> settings<00:03:38.750> and

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
use still again we go into settings and

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.860 
use still again we go into settings and
then<00:03:40.040> we<00:03:40.190> go<00:03:40.340> to<00:03:40.370> usage<00:03:40.850> and<00:03:41.150> here<00:03:41.330> we<00:03:41.450> see<00:03:41.690> what

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
then we go to usage and here we see what

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.800 
then we go to usage and here we see what
we<00:03:41.990> will<00:03:42.410> be<00:03:42.500> used<00:03:43.270> you<00:03:44.270> add<00:03:44.450> those<00:03:44.630> two

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
we will be used you add those two

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.590 
we will be used you add those two
together<00:03:44.930> and<00:03:45.350> that's<00:03:46.250> just<00:03:46.490> in<00:03:46.580> KB<00:03:47.030> you<00:03:47.360> were

so you're gonna have to do some

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.790 
so you're gonna have to do some
conversions<00:03:50.960> and<00:03:51.170> you<00:03:51.230> can<00:03:51.380> look<00:03:51.500> that<00:03:51.650> up

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
conversions and you can look that up

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.220 
conversions and you can look that up

we're not gonna expect to see either a
3G<00:05:05.660> or<00:05:05.900> an<00:05:06.020> e<00:05:06.169> so<00:05:07.070> let's<00:05:07.190> go<00:05:07.310> back<00:05:07.340> in<00:05:07.669> there<00:05:07.880> and

3G or an e so let's go back in there and

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.850 
3G or an e so let's go back in there and
turn<00:05:08.750> 3G<00:05:09.169> off<00:05:09.350> and<00:05:09.770> turn<00:05:10.039> data<00:05:10.340> on<00:05:10.580> and<00:05:11.860> then

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
turn 3G off and turn data on and then

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.040 
turn 3G off and turn data on and then
again<00:05:13.130> our<00:05:13.430> bars<00:05:13.669> will<00:05:13.910> go<00:05:14.030> away<00:05:14.150> and<00:05:14.539> then

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
again our bars will go away and then

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.969 
again our bars will go away and then
they'll<00:05:15.229> suddenly<00:05:15.440> repopulate<00:05:16.100> and<00:05:16.580> as<00:05:17.570> they

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
they'll suddenly repopulate and as they

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:20.050 
they'll suddenly repopulate and as they
repopulate<00:05:18.979> you'll<00:05:19.310> see<00:05:19.400> you<00:05:19.490> get<00:05:19.639> more<00:05:19.789> bars

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
repopulate you'll see you get more bars

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.730 
repopulate you'll see you get more bars
and<00:05:20.330> then<00:05:20.419> you'll<00:05:20.539> get<00:05:20.660> that<00:05:20.720> evac<00:05:21.229> which

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
and then you'll get that evac which

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.219 
and then you'll get that evac which
again<00:05:21.979> stands<00:05:22.460> for<00:05:22.729> edge<00:05:22.910> which<00:05:23.419> is<00:05:23.600> 2g<00:05:24.020> data

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
again stands for edge which is 2g data
