American<00:01:34.760> taxpayer<00:01:35.240> that<00:01:35.690> hasn't<00:01:35.900> helped<00:01:36.260> the

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
American taxpayer that hasn't helped the

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.230 
American taxpayer that hasn't helped the
country<00:01:36.770> plus<00:01:37.190> I<00:01:37.370> still<00:01:37.640> think<00:01:37.880> a<00:01:37.970> lot<00:01:38.120> of<00:01:38.150> the

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
country plus I still think a lot of the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.240 
country plus I still think a lot of the
book<00:01:38.630> assets<00:01:39.200> on<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:39.410> books<00:01:39.650> of<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:39.800> banks<00:01:40.130> or

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
book assets on the books of the banks or

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.740 
book assets on the books of the banks or
phony<00:01:40.490> I<00:01:40.640> don't<00:01:40.850> think<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.150> accounting<00:01:41.630> is

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
phony I don't think the accounting is

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.630 
phony I don't think the accounting is
real<00:01:41.960> based<00:01:42.650> on<00:01:42.800> the<00:01:42.920> new<00:01:43.040> accounting<00:01:43.460> laws

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
real based on the new accounting laws

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.840 
real based on the new accounting laws
and<00:01:43.880> I<00:01:44.240> think<00:01:44.450> real<00:01:44.660> estate<00:01:44.900> prices<00:01:45.140> are<00:01:45.500> still

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
and I think real estate prices are still

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.100 
and I think real estate prices are still
artificially<00:01:46.850> inflated<00:01:47.450> based<00:01:47.660> on<00:01:47.870> lacks

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
artificially inflated based on lacks

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.780 
artificially inflated based on lacks
lending<00:01:48.500> standards<00:01:48.590> and<00:01:49.070> low<00:01:49.190> interest<00:01:49.550> rates

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
lending standards and low interest rates

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.399 
lending standards and low interest rates
and<00:01:49.940> government<00:01:50.390> support<00:01:50.780> so<00:01:51.260> I<00:01:51.290> think

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
and government support so I think

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.649 
and government support so I think
there's<00:01:51.740> still<00:01:51.950> a<00:01:52.010> lot<00:01:52.159> of<00:01:52.190> problems<00:01:52.760> on<00:01:52.940> the

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
there's still a lot of problems on the

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.000 
there's still a lot of problems on the
books<00:01:53.870> of<00:01:53.960> these<00:01:54.110> banks<00:01:54.470> I<00:01:54.560> think<00:01:54.770> when<00:01:54.920> they

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
books of these banks I think when they

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.830 
books of these banks I think when they
fail<00:01:55.280> again<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:56.120> next<00:01:56.270> time<00:01:56.420> there's<00:01:56.750> a

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
fail again the next time there's a

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.600 
fail again the next time there's a
bailout<00:01:57.050> it's<00:01:57.800> going<00:01:57.980> to<00:01:58.010> have<00:01:58.130> to<00:01:58.190> be<00:01:58.370> bigger

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
bailout it's going to have to be bigger

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.890 
bailout it's going to have to be bigger
than<00:01:58.760> the<00:01:58.880> last<00:01:58.909> one<00:01:59.300> Peter<00:01:59.570> but<00:01:59.750> does<00:01:59.840> that

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
than the last one Peter but does that

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.510 
than the last one Peter but does that
necessarily<00:01:59.990> mean<00:02:00.590> if<00:02:00.830> you<00:02:00.950> believe<00:02:01.250> that<00:02:01.280> the

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
necessarily mean if you believe that the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.980 
necessarily mean if you believe that the
banks<00:02:01.820> are<00:02:01.940> cooking<00:02:02.390> their<00:02:02.480> books<00:02:02.690> or<00:02:02.870> they

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
banks are cooking their books or they

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.360 
banks are cooking their books or they
have<00:02:03.080> phony<00:02:03.260> numbers<00:02:03.470> or<00:02:03.770> whatnot<00:02:03.980> I<00:02:04.159> mean

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
have phony numbers or whatnot I mean

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
have phony numbers or whatnot I mean
that<00:02:04.490> doesn't<00:02:04.520> necessarily<00:02:04.790> mean<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.180> socks

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
that doesn't necessarily mean the socks

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.600 
that doesn't necessarily mean the socks
are<00:02:05.450> going<00:02:05.540> to<00:02:05.659> go<00:02:05.720> down<00:02:05.870> or<00:02:06.080> are<00:02:06.500> you<00:02:06.800> in<00:02:07.430> the

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
are going to go down or are you in the

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.160 
are going to go down or are you in the
camp<00:02:07.850> that<00:02:08.000> you<00:02:08.209> feel<00:02:08.360> so<00:02:08.539> passionately<00:02:09.019> about

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
camp that you feel so passionately about

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.660 
camp that you feel so passionately about
this<00:02:09.530> that<00:02:09.739> you<00:02:09.830> do<00:02:09.979> see<00:02:10.159> the<00:02:10.250> bank's<00:02:10.519> going

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
this that you do see the bank's going

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.100 
this that you do see the bank's going
down<00:02:10.849> and<00:02:11.030> so<00:02:11.090> therefore<00:02:11.300> they<00:02:11.540> are<00:02:11.569> short<00:02:12.019> in

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
down and so therefore they are short in

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.990 
down and so therefore they are short in
your<00:02:12.260> book<00:02:12.470> well<00:02:13.159> they<00:02:13.280> look<00:02:13.550> I<00:02:13.760> don't<00:02:13.819> know

like you're positioning yourself for the

like you're positioning yourself for the

inflation trade on the other side of it

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.360 
inflation trade on the other side of it
though<00:02:30.290> you're<00:02:30.439> talking<00:02:30.709> about<00:02:30.829> an<00:02:30.950> economy

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
that does not look like it can grow that

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.559 
that does not look like it can grow that
sounds<00:02:33.859> to<00:02:33.980> me<00:02:34.129> like<00:02:34.159> deflation<00:02:34.730> what's<00:02:35.359> the

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
sounds to me like deflation what's the

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.149 
sounds to me like deflation what's the
deflation<00:02:35.959> trade<00:02:36.409> that<00:02:36.590> we<00:02:36.680> should<00:02:36.859> put<00:02:37.010> on

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:37.159 
deflation trade that we should put on

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:39.429 
deflation trade that we should put on
well<00:02:37.760> if<00:02:37.969> you<00:02:38.450> want<00:02:38.659> to<00:02:38.750> look<00:02:38.930> at<00:02:39.079> it<00:02:39.200> from<00:02:39.319> a

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:39.439 
well if you want to look at it from a

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:41.050 
well if you want to look at it from a
perspective<00:02:39.469> of<00:02:40.040> deflation<00:02:40.430> you<00:02:40.760> have<00:02:40.909> to

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
perspective of deflation you have to

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.910 
perspective of deflation you have to
understand<00:02:41.510> what<00:02:41.959> things<00:02:42.260> are<00:02:42.439> deflating

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
understand what things are deflating

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.979 
understand what things are deflating
against<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:43.549> it<00:02:43.639> will<00:02:43.760> be<00:02:43.879> gold<00:02:44.239> you're<00:02:44.780> not

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
against and it will be gold you're not

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.330 
against and it will be gold you're not
going<00:02:45.170> to<00:02:45.260> see<00:02:45.439> prices<00:02:45.769> falling

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.819 
you no longer term stock prices will
probably<00:02:53.569> rise<00:02:53.780> in<00:02:54.079> terms<00:02:54.319> of<00:02:54.439> dollars

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
probably rise in terms of dollars

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:57.610 
probably rise in terms of dollars
because<00:02:55.040> US<00:02:55.760> stocks<00:02:56.060> will<00:02:56.750> lose<00:02:56.959> value<00:02:57.439> at<00:02:57.590> a

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
because US stocks will lose value at a

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.800 
because US stocks will lose value at a
slower<00:02:57.919> rate<00:02:58.040> than<00:02:58.250> will<00:02:58.549> our<00:02:58.700> currency<00:02:59.060> what

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
slower rate than will our currency what

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.449 
slower rate than will our currency what
you<00:02:59.930> want<00:03:00.139> to<00:03:00.230> do<00:03:00.349> is<00:03:00.500> protect<00:03:00.919> yourself<00:03:01.340> from

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
you want to do is protect yourself from

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.300 
you want to do is protect yourself from
the<00:03:01.790> debasement<00:03:02.120> of<00:03:02.329> the<00:03:02.510> u.s.<00:03:02.840> dollar<00:03:02.870> if<00:03:03.409> you

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
the debasement of the u.s. dollar if you

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.099 
the debasement of the u.s. dollar if you
want<00:03:04.519> to<00:03:04.639> hedge<00:03:04.969> against<00:03:05.389> inflation<00:03:05.480> you<00:03:05.900> have

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.109 
want to hedge against inflation you have

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:07.750 
want to hedge against inflation you have
to<00:03:06.260> own<00:03:06.379> gold<00:03:06.680> because<00:03:07.099> that's<00:03:07.310> where<00:03:07.519> price

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
to own gold because that's where price

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.729 
to own gold because that's where price
will<00:03:07.790> be<00:03:08.090> deflating<00:03:08.750> but<00:03:09.260> from<00:03:09.650> the

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
will be deflating but from the

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.589 
will be deflating but from the
perspective<00:03:09.919> of<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.400> US<00:03:10.699> dollar<00:03:10.969> it's<00:03:11.299> pure

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
perspective of the US dollar it's pure

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:12.939 
perspective of the US dollar it's pure
inflation<00:03:12.139> you're<00:03:12.290> going<00:03:12.409> to<00:03:12.469> see<00:03:12.620> prices

inflation you're going to see prices
rising<00:03:13.370> I<00:03:13.730> think<00:03:14.150> prices<00:03:14.419> for<00:03:14.750> foreign<00:03:15.109> stocks

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.050 
rising I think prices for foreign stocks
and<00:03:15.709> will<00:03:16.069> will<00:03:16.189> certainly<00:03:16.519> rise<00:03:16.760> a<00:03:16.790> lot

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
and will will certainly rise a lot

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.970
