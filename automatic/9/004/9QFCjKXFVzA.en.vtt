00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 first of all my name is ivan and ben and this one 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.610
 website carolina ru 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:13.160
 in this video I will tell about my product 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:17.250
 this is the flossy odense color map 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.980
 so who does not know this directory in 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.490
 which are all represented are all 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.080
 colors 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:30.119
 the most popular moulin one he so 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:33.750
 First back 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.930
 but was fast in a variety of languages 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.460
 it is written even in Russian exclusive 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.590
 dense numbering system 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:47.370
 abuts from 1898 new buildings 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.559
 dense 2013 year color data 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.270
 which here have a long catalog 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:58.020
 relevant to this day so this is from 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:07.100
 yourself is this folding 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:12.299
 such a cardboard snake means 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:15.180
 first open go go cotton 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:19.740
 whether not the most popular pancakes will be all 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:23.900
 this is article 117, it means cotton 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:29.100
 look like this for grease or hank 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:32.189
 It means it has 8 meters of thread smoothly 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.030
 difficult out of another 6 strings i.e. six 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:39.780
 threads adding all this article 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.500
 447 colors they are all divided into columns by 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.700
 shades 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.630
 by color, I will say there the color is the number 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:52.740
 There is in principle if you create schemes 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:55.640
 or don't know what you do 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.250
 but I buy for myself to create schemes 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.079
 see color see number 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.620
 looking for a number or go buy it in 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:07.100
 score 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:09.950
 so mean 447 colors 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:14.590
 main ends in black 310 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.590
 15 column further 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.959
 presented and even rarer but the most 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:26.690
 used species 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:31.550
 floss this kind of floss I'm this too 117 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:36.709
 number nose letter m melange same cotton 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:40.220
 also the length of the thread but here the color changes 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:44.060
 from main to more 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:47.450
 light interesting effects are obtained 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:52.160
 if you embroider it already on the forums will see 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:56.120
 how does a woman embroider further i mean it 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:03:00.430
 the melange of 20 points points goes on 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:05.120
 series 317 w i.e. article 3 17 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.920
 it is called light effects often on 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.790
 they are almost always mistakenly called 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.190
 metallic here then there is a separate 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:17.090
 article is 315 it is called 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:22.820
 metallic and this is only the white effect that is 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:26.239
 the effects of color and light are also broken 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:28.630
 On series means composition this one hundred percent 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:33.560
 and look through and that is plastics 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:37.870
 if there is no cotton, too, on the series here 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:42.019
 like bronze nacre gemstones 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:45.730
 metal is also bright colors that's how these 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:49.360
 markers also have such strings 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:52.930
 so they are worth it alright already 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:57.090
 I'll tell you this in a separate video 940 number 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:04:01.230
 served that thread glows in the dark 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:04.690
 so actually began to already describe 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:10.230
 articles finish already means too 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:14.950
 metallic 315 article two colors 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:22.360
 23 2 4 columns cotton called color 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:25.150
 rish he looks like this so there are colors 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.570
 vary from similar there from red to 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.030
 yellow from green to purple and so 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.580
 further effects are also obtained on embroidery 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.919
 so interesting show immediately 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:40.539
 this is melange i mean color one 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:42.449
 only its brightness changes so here it is 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:48.400
 us 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:52.349
 light effect 317 wb article is such 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:55.450
 packing so metallic 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:05:01.590
 Here is such a see, but already grabber 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:05.680
 another but also the composition of the plastic is not metal 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:08.979
 notice further in this directory 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.139
 very convenient means to find you 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:14.500
 need some color for example 822 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:17.740
 this is worth the number of the column immediately draw 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:24.190
 all to her 822 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:27.970
 we are looking for here it is beige 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.039
 video page by page means you will find species 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.180
 on moto 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:33.639
 here is just a structure 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:40.000
 thread without color just like 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:40.630
 Well, the thickness and the kind of strings are usually I 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.510
 pass. 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:46.120
 that is, this kind 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:49.500
 live sex for an example this package is here 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:55.180
 full plastic plastic is wrapped that's 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:06:02.680
 its effect is the packaging is the same 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:04.990
 tire vray goes further here already visible 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.960
 and here in thickness, that is, such 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.820
 shoes are for cm and for sure 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:13.450
 applied but theoretically you can 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:15.430
 order that is article 115 and 116 here 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:19.390
 they are presented here all the same colors 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:22.870
 just the thickness of the thread and with no moto 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:27.540
 well, and the last mod view is changing 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:31.180
 He showed Tolik further goes 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.630
 French English is so much more 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.970
 languages 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:38.080
 look at how much here including 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:39.370
 Russian is described briefly each 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:43.030
 the article that is the main 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:44.920
 article 117 you are the time or hope and 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.600
 consists of six easily separable threads 

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.780
 allowing you to use one or 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:52.750
