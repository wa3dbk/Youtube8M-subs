00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello everyone new nail art tutorial 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.180
 very easy to make and this time I 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.980
 are Swiss from also to apply the 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.410
 studs that was so much not 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.480
 I used in a light like her 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.519
 realized first apply the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.850
 pupa reinforcing base on all 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.150
 nails then why with number 10 on 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.130
 fussy instead two-pass thumb and two 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.350
 pass also of the weak number 24 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.359
 yellow effect deborah milano now always 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.000
 on white nails I'm going to apply 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.619
 also this pearly enamel is a 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.670
 beautiful for the ato is not one of those 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.800
 pearlescent old classic effect in short 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.809
 but this has no number because 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.170
 an old kit comes from an old one 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.020
 pupa now I take from my wheel 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.420
 of trans studs there is a bit of everything 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.020
 with the wheel I created it with delle 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.210
 things that I had unpacked from and take them 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.109
 porchetta just use todt like al 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.329
 usually as like glue and better with the 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.949
 daughter to apply the borghetti nor 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.280
 small silver that I think are 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.290
 very well on this basic color and le 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.540
 I apply right in the middle of an aspect 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.909
 so that the pearly enamel is 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.040
 dry I completely take the enamel 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.140
 that we have applied before and why with it 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.590
 also the people 09 that slightly more 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.939
 clear piece of parchment paper 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.920
 brush and I keep the 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.939
 enamel lever jar that I will need to 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.880
 clean the brush now I start from 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.070
 from the lightest color then from 09 e 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.159
 as you can see starting from the cuticle round 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.650
 simply smear the brush towards 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.229
 the end of the universe the free margin 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.360
 so they never have to be must not be 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.460
 I do a precise thing on both 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.850
 he and white in the ass discovering the 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.200
 number 10 the darkest color and I go to 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.240
 do the exact same thing 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.740
 so it was believed this contrast will give 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.570
 that slightly lighter color 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.130
 the darker one covers well of course 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.320
 also the cuticle ride because you don't 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.130
 It must glimpse the white that's the 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.079
 final results 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.369
 all that remains is to apply touch to 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:04.990
 all nails 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.880
 I'm using colors here exalts me 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.679
 I really hope that this nail art 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.489
