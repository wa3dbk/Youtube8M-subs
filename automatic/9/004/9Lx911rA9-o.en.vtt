00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.599
 star trek let's explain what the devil 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.670
 made us and why are you already a fan without knowing 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.790
 of shock to start the opening day 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.000
 preserved the honor of the memory of the 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.529
 classic series he created a business that 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.960
 sought in the roots of the classic series 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.119
 a character in the case the spock to create 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.699
 a parallel universe with that there the 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.519
 parallel universe face looks great you 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.900
 can develop all the stories 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.430
 desertion new stories are mine 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.550
 stories left the stories of the 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.410
 past are there preserved perfect 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.940
 frozen in that time line and here 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.649
 now I have a playground space 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.420
 for new stories is a beautiful 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.190
 clever because he can use 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.260
 Ancient characters Ancient stories 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.629
 but as it is a parallel narrative line 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.950
 and you do not have to respect what happened 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.199
 but he can use the same characters 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.969
 can subvert tell the story of the 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.590
 It's true that he can go to 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.300
 old stories of his way this is the 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.789
 grace is all the cooler than the 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.530
 geneva explains that the original series 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.000
 it was very cool very cool of a 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.030
 lots of cool stuff but no 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.729
 cardboard money was ugly now he 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.799
 injected money has money is a movie 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.570
 most interesting action of all is that 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.930
 You do not have to watch the series. 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.270
 classic is deep space nine is next 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.920
 generation is not a 2009 film does not 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.330
 having existed to have fun 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.979
 watching beyond the darkness but it is a 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.390
 Our face must be loved by the studio. 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.000
 seriously that the guy was able to make a 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.479
 business so you respect everything 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.450
 respect everyone and still create 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.860
 an opportunity to open the public should 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.240
 to be very dear now it is good that 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.530
 people are going to tell you why you already 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.420
 Are you a fan of star trek? 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.920
 but did not know or should at least 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.750
 like this 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.369
 you 're actually laughing at jokes about 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.530
 lot of tv series that makes the difference 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.360
 in star trek is already understood by example 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.939
 watching futurama in the future one has a 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.549
 captain there that I sing and then print 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.649
 mixture has an animal's head appears 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.420
 in the future a simple one also spoke 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.159
 family guy and also spoke and if you 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.439
 like me you have anyone get 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:06.390
 moral obligation to enjoy 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.310
 understand star trek knows with the problem 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.590
 I watch the sport of the movie and I can not 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.390
 not thinking about the hall floor already chelsea 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.960
 yesterday in barreiro that's what makes it 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.390
 because 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.180
 business is so powerful that he enters 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.190
 in you and does not come out more powerful and heldon 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.670

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:27.210
 entrono Marcelo rech Anhaia saying 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.570

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.360
 greatest gift he ever received in life

 not what he has anymore is reference 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.020
 tactic has wilton to say that it is 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.880
 look like me and if you already know 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.110

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.240
 i tom george takei take burton is 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.890
 true the date the date is clear he without 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.650
 to make a greater reference to the 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.810
 This new generation is interesting and 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.970
 after they did they closed 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.940
 now a merchandising agreement here 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.800
 they have the clothes of bentiu and of 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.740
 Star trek is being 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.750
 sold while oni and for me is 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.020
 This must have been after they did 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.270
 that entire episode of installing a 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.250
 talking kling dress and fucking them 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.160
 play chess three-dimensional own 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:21.030
 sheldon game is that chess with steven 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.280
 hawking is the mixture of all there is 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.080
 directed to star trek is everywhere 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.230
 even if you are not Brazilian watch 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.640
 nothing much day-to-day technology 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.620
 influenced by star trek himself 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.300
 chan concept that little nothing 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.310
 who leaves the biggest ship is not going to spend 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.250
 less is fuel and such 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.840
 it is not confused with the beginning of the 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.520
 American space program and with 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.260
 tv series release 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.520
 It had been a while since he had spoken the name 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.500
 boring huh 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.750
 but who popularized on the mission that 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.490
 when the nasa started wearing hats 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.860
 people already knew that it was because 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:56.040
 watch check was turned on 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:04:00.060
 is because man theoretically and stepped on the 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.620
 moon and 69 and there was already all this 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.470
 it made a lot more sense 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.180
 for people to understand what was going 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.400
 to space and not only this but the 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.540
 first space shuttle is called the 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.850
 enterprise the store only set troicki nasa 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.880
 they did they opened contest for 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.500
 choose the name of the ship and won it 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.299
 enterprise bruised way it wants 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.330
 when you start a science fiction 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.560
 If that's true, guys, see who it is. 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.460
 What do you want me to see? 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.590
 days you want to use the technologies and they op 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.380
 suddenly has the interface is not pretty 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:38.370
 and enterprise is not the space shuttle that in 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:40.919
 English is boring is not not pretty but the 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.900
 hit not only technology space area 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.130
 but technology of the day to day the cell phone 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.230
 was influenced by a stage in the 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.380
 truth communicator and held a flip 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.970

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.620
 the communicator with one of the 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.540
 direct influences martin cooper one of the 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.060
 guys who invented one of the first 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.130
 cellular models at a time that only this 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.840
 kind of communication so you can 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.120
 talking to someone else was the distance 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.770

 first he worked without the 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:29.250
 cars of the season or star trek style 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.120
