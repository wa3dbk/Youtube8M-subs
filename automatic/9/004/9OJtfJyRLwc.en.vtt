past<00:01:34.209> the<00:01:34.390> BM<00:01:34.720> and<00:01:35.110> maybe<00:01:35.410> Patrick<00:01:35.950> as<00:01:36.069> well<00:01:36.569> so

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
past the BM and maybe Patrick as well so

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:39.449

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
then when Wade spun coming through Josh

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.669

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
thought it was that close because that's

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.230 
thought it was that close because that's
where<00:02:55.090> it's<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.140> really<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.740> fast

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
where it's the really the fast

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.880 
where it's the really the fast
left-hander<00:02:58.240> and<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:59.200> tires<00:02:59.440> haven't<00:02:59.739> had<00:02:59.860> a

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
left-hander and the tires haven't had a

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.350 
left-hander and the tires haven't had a
chance<00:03:00.130> to<00:03:00.280> get<00:03:00.370> warm<00:03:00.640> by<00:03:00.820> the<00:03:00.850> time<00:03:01.090> you<00:03:01.239> get

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
chance to get warm by the time you get

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.910 
chance to get warm by the time you get
there<00:03:01.600> so<00:03:01.810> I<00:03:01.840> thought<00:03:02.080> should<00:03:02.290> I<00:03:02.380> go<00:03:02.530> through

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410 
was way off to the left so that

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.080 
was way off to the left so that
something's<00:06:03.010> come<00:06:03.250> undone<00:06:03.580> in<00:06:03.760> one<00:06:03.910> of<00:06:04.000> the
