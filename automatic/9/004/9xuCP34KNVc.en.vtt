so<00:00:05.040> if<00:00:05.160> you<00:00:05.220> remember<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.580> analyst<00:00:05.940> episode<00:00:06.420> I

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
so if you remember the analyst episode I

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.450 
so if you remember the analyst episode I
destroyed<00:00:07.319> that<00:00:07.350> dude<00:00:07.680> and<00:00:07.950> I<00:00:08.220> didn't<00:00:08.370> get

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
destroyed that dude and I didn't get

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.560 
destroyed that dude and I didn't get
stuff<00:00:08.760> so<00:00:08.970> people<00:00:09.210> were<00:00:09.269> saying<00:00:09.450> it<00:00:09.540> was

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
stuff so people were saying it was

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.720 
stuff so people were saying it was
probably<00:00:10.080> in<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.440> wall<00:00:10.620> which<00:00:11.400> I<00:00:11.519> did<00:00:11.550> check

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
probably in the wall which I did check

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.700 
probably in the wall which I did check
if<00:00:12.179> you<00:00:12.570> remember<00:00:12.900> in<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.080> video<00:00:13.230> i<00:00:13.290> did<00:00:13.410> do<00:00:13.679> a

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
if you remember in the video i did do a

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.250 
if you remember in the video i did do a
look<00:00:13.980> around<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.809> Sprott<00:00:15.809> it<00:00:15.929> was<00:00:16.020> probably

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
look around and Sprott it was probably

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.290 
look around and Sprott it was probably
like<00:00:16.410> somewhere<00:00:16.800> weird<00:00:17.699> but<00:00:17.850> i<00:00:17.880> couldn't<00:00:18.180> get

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
like somewhere weird but i couldn't get

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.330 
like somewhere weird but i couldn't get
it<00:00:18.449> anyway<00:00:18.750> so<00:00:18.900> I'm<00:00:19.529> guessing<00:00:19.710> he<00:00:19.949> died<00:00:20.130> in<00:00:20.279> the

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
it anyway so I'm guessing he died in the

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.800 
it anyway so I'm guessing he died in the
wall<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:20.730> I've<00:00:20.820> come<00:00:20.970> on<00:00:21.119> here<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.600> just

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
wall so I've come on here and I just

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.290 
wall so I've come on here and I just
realized<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.350> logged<00:00:22.560> out<00:00:22.680> on<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.890> maze

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
realized that I logged out on the maze

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.460 
realized that I logged out on the maze
so<00:00:24.300> I've<00:00:24.359> been<00:00:24.449> trying<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.779> find<00:00:24.990> my<00:00:25.289> way<00:00:25.320> out

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
so I've been trying to find my way out

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.460 
so I've been trying to find my way out
or<00:00:25.920> anything<00:00:26.689> which<00:00:27.689> actually<00:00:27.900> proves<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.439> be

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
or anything which actually proves to be

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.349 
or anything which actually proves to be
a<00:00:28.560> bit<00:00:28.710> difficult<00:00:28.890> when<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.910> don't<00:00:29.939> know<00:00:30.330> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
a bit difficult when you don't know the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.990 
a bit difficult when you don't know the
weight<00:00:30.750> anyway<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.700> other<00:00:32.880> guy

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
weight anyway and so and the other guy

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.760 
weight anyway and so and the other guy
didn't<00:00:33.210> either<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:34.140> I'm<00:00:34.200> kind<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.440> stuck<00:00:34.620> in

log<00:01:26.159> right<00:01:26.369> now<00:01:26.490> which<00:01:26.700> would<00:01:26.850> be<00:01:26.939> pretty

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
log right now which would be pretty

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.840

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.039 
cheap so i'm not going to do that
because<00:01:29.850> i<00:01:30.060> know<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.420> i<00:01:30.570> wouldn't<00:01:30.780> like<00:01:30.869> that

like<00:03:51.930> three<00:03:52.169> got<00:03:52.349> apples<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:52.859> pickaxe<00:03:53.189> isn't

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
like three got apples the pickaxe isn't

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.099 
like three got apples the pickaxe isn't
the<00:03:53.609> best<00:03:53.759> in<00:03:53.909> the<00:03:53.939> world<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.780> armor<00:03:55.079> is

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
the best in the world the armor is

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:58.580 
the best in the world the armor is
basically<00:03:55.620> all<00:03:55.739> smashed<00:03:56.009> off<00:03:56.219> and<00:03:57.590> I'm

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
trying not to backtrack even though I

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.600 
trying not to backtrack even though I
probably<00:04:44.330> have<00:04:44.570> done<00:04:44.750> that<00:04:44.840> tons<00:04:45.080> of<00:04:45.200> times

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610

let's see this is going to set me off

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.670 
let's see this is going to set me off
again<00:04:48.650> I'm<00:04:49.010> going<00:04:49.100> to<00:04:49.160> get<00:04:49.280> so<00:04:49.430> confused<00:04:50.650> so<00:04:51.650> I

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.880 
around here someone else is coming
through<00:05:05.840> the<00:05:05.930> maze<00:05:06.080> now<00:05:06.260> I<00:05:06.350> can<00:05:06.500> see<00:05:06.680> which

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
through the maze now I can see which

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.650 
through the maze now I can see which
would<00:05:07.040> probably<00:05:07.250> mean<00:05:07.970> I<00:05:08.000> will<00:05:08.270> die<00:05:08.450> this<00:05:08.480> time

because I have told my right now seven

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.420 
because I have told my right now seven
to<00:06:34.280> do<00:06:34.400> this<00:06:34.550> and

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
to do this and

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.970 
to do this and
I<00:06:36.630> would<00:06:37.630> suck<00:06:37.840> if<00:06:37.990> I<00:06:38.080> dies<00:06:38.260> in<00:06:38.410> there<00:06:38.560> so<00:06:38.950> I'm

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:38.980 
I would suck if I dies in there so I'm

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.350 
I would suck if I dies in there so I'm
pretty<00:06:39.220> sure<00:06:39.340> you<00:06:39.520> can<00:06:39.640> sell<00:06:39.820> the<00:06:39.910> animals<00:06:40.210> for

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 
pretty sure you can sell the animals for

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.470 
pretty sure you can sell the animals for
500<00:06:40.930> in<00:06:41.020> the<00:06:41.290> diamonds<00:06:41.680> for<00:06:41.770> 250<00:06:42.370> each<00:06:42.520> so<00:06:42.550> i'll

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:43.480 
500 in the diamonds for 250 each so i'll

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.520 
500 in the diamonds for 250 each so i'll
probably<00:06:43.630> leave<00:06:43.780> that<00:06:43.960> till<00:06:44.110> next<00:06:44.380> time<00:06:44.470> I'm

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.530 
probably leave that till next time I'm

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.800 
probably leave that till next time I'm
in<00:06:44.740> and<00:06:44.980> I<00:06:45.130> did<00:06:45.310> get<00:06:45.460> some<00:06:45.760> okay<00:06:45.970> loot<00:06:46.360> as<00:06:46.570> you

can see here either okay so that's

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.400 
can see here either okay so that's
probably<00:06:49.270> why<00:06:49.510> it<00:06:49.570> work<00:06:49.780> well<00:06:50.260> it's

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:50.410 
probably why it work well it's

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.060 
definitely well one of the reasons why
one<00:06:52.120> and<00:06:52.390> also<00:06:52.840> he<00:06:53.260> was<00:06:53.380> lagging<00:06:53.740> out<00:06:53.830> really

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:54.070 
one and also he was lagging out really

00:06:54.070 --> 00:07:02.360
