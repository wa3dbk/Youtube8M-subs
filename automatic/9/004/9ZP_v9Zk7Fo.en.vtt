00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
of needs is not taught very well so it's

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.070 
of needs is not taught very well so it's
a<00:02:53.070> matter<00:02:53.250> of<00:02:53.370> experience<00:02:53.880> there's<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:54.810> lot<00:02:55.050> you

a matter of experience there's a lot you

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.160 
a matter of experience there's a lot you
learns<00:02:55.500> from<00:02:56.340> other<00:02:56.670> teachers<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.630> know<00:02:57.780> and

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
learns from other teachers you know and

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.650 
learns from other teachers you know and
you<00:02:58.680> look<00:02:58.709> through<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.459> school<00:02:59.730> who<00:03:00.120> are<00:03:00.510> the

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
you look through the school who are the

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.630 
you look through the school who are the
teachers<00:03:00.990> that<00:03:01.020> deal<00:03:01.560> very<00:03:01.920> well<00:03:02.100> with<00:03:02.280> these

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
teachers that deal very well with these

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.940

children<00:03:02.910> and<00:03:03.209> you<00:03:03.959> can<00:03:04.170> get<00:03:04.410> some<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:04.800> their

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
children and you can get some of their

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.550 
children and you can get some of their
strategies<00:03:05.520> a<00:03:06.170> lot<00:03:07.170> of<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.410> is<00:03:07.530> just

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
strategies a lot of it is just

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.880 
strategies a lot of it is just
experience<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.880> I<00:03:09.150> think<00:03:09.530> since<00:03:10.530> there<00:03:10.740> are

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
experience and I think since there are

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.910 
experience and I think since there are
so<00:03:11.130> many<00:03:11.220> different<00:03:11.640> kinds<00:03:11.910> of<00:03:12.180> disabilities
