turn down the purpose calculator so this

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.290 
turn down the purpose calculator so this

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
then our calculator cursory calendar I

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.590 
then our calculator cursory calendar I
can<00:03:27.860> manage<00:03:28.190> the<00:03:28.400> month<00:03:28.580> by<00:03:28.790> swiping<00:03:29.030> like<00:03:29.360> and

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
can manage the month by swiping like and

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.420 
can manage the month by swiping like and
then<00:03:29.750> I<00:03:29.870> could<00:03:30.110> pull<00:03:30.530> down<00:03:30.770> I<00:03:30.800> can<00:03:31.040> get<00:03:31.220> all

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
then I could pull down I can get all

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.900 
then I could pull down I can get all

let's<00:03:34.910> get<00:03:35.060> better<00:03:35.420> than<00:03:35.690> the<00:03:35.870> clock<00:03:36.080> I<00:03:36.530> think

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
let's get better than the clock I think

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.760 
let's get better than the clock I think
we<00:03:37.760> sealed<00:03:38.000> it<00:03:38.120> so<00:03:38.330> I<00:03:38.420> can<00:03:38.600> open<00:03:39.380> the<00:03:39.440> stopwatch

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
we sealed it so I can open the stopwatch

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:46.240 
we sealed it so I can open the stopwatch
from<00:03:40.220> here<00:03:43.900> and<00:03:44.900> then<00:03:45.080> I<00:03:45.170> can<00:03:45.410> also<00:03:45.560> open<00:03:45.800> the

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
from here and then I can also open the

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.790 
from here and then I can also open the
new<00:03:46.400> timer<00:03:46.670> used<00:03:47.390> at<00:03:47.630> the<00:03:47.780> time<00:03:47.960> a<00:03:48.020> new<00:03:48.470> alarm

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
new timer used at the time a new alarm

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.790 
new timer used at the time a new alarm
clock<00:03:48.920> I<00:03:49.250> can<00:03:49.460> add<00:03:50.050> so<00:03:51.050> that's<00:03:51.230> a<00:03:51.350> bit<00:03:51.470> alone

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
clock I can add so that's a bit alone

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.340 
clock I can add so that's a bit alone
and<00:03:52.660> then<00:03:53.660> email<00:03:54.080> application<00:03:55.960> now<00:03:56.960> account

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
and then email application now account

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:07.170 
and then email application now account
so<00:03:57.530> I<00:03:57.560> need<00:03:57.830> to<00:03:57.950> add<00:03:58.130> account<00:04:03.820> and<00:04:04.820> then<00:04:05.060> finds

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
so I need to add account and then finds

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:14.400 
so I need to add account and then finds
it's<00:04:08.180> not<00:04:08.360> running<00:04:08.540> on<00:04:08.720> a<00:04:10.210> problem<00:04:11.210> then<00:04:11.510> media
