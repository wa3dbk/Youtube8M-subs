00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
other ships in the area but I'm not

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.210 
other ships in the area but I'm not
going<00:00:32.180> to<00:00:32.210> dwell<00:00:32.330> on<00:00:32.449> that<00:00:32.710> but<00:00:33.710> anyway<00:00:33.949> this

going to dwell on that but anyway this

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.470 
going to dwell on that but anyway this
is<00:00:34.280> the<00:00:34.400> what<00:00:34.850> I've<00:00:34.940> been<00:00:35.000> working<00:00:35.300> over<00:00:35.420> the

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
is the what I've been working over the

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.049 
is the what I've been working over the
past<00:00:35.540> Qatar<00:00:35.900> days<00:00:36.140> it's<00:00:36.949> been<00:00:37.489> requested<00:00:37.790> by

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
past Qatar days it's been requested by

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.450 
past Qatar days it's been requested by
quite<00:00:38.390> a<00:00:38.420> few<00:00:38.480> people<00:00:38.989> over<00:00:39.199> the<00:00:39.379> past<00:00:39.410> I<00:00:40.100> don't

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
quite a few people over the past I don't

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.710 
quite a few people over the past I don't
know<00:00:40.610> how<00:00:40.820> many<00:00:40.879> years<00:00:41.180> I've<00:00:41.300> been<00:00:41.390> doing<00:00:41.630> this

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
know how many years I've been doing this

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.850 
know how many years I've been doing this
and<00:00:42.140> and<00:00:43.149> yes<00:00:44.200> come<00:00:45.200> out<00:00:45.320> quite<00:00:45.530> well<00:00:45.680> I<00:00:45.710> think

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
and and yes come out quite well I think

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.490 
and and yes come out quite well I think
it's<00:00:46.100> not<00:00:46.190> strictly<00:00:46.660> one-to-one<00:00:47.660> scale<00:00:47.870> as<00:00:48.320> in

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
it's not strictly one-to-one scale as in

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.080 
it's not strictly one-to-one scale as in
from<00:00:48.739> length<00:00:48.950> to<00:00:49.160> it<00:00:49.250> you<00:00:49.430> know<00:00:49.579> length<00:00:49.820> weight

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
from length to it you know length weight

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.549 
from length to it you know length weight
and<00:00:50.270> all<00:00:50.360> that<00:00:50.480> thing<00:00:50.690> because<00:00:51.230> even<00:00:51.469> though

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
and all that thing because even though

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:52.600 
and all that thing because even though
if<00:00:51.649> you<00:00:51.710> build<00:00:51.890> a<00:00:51.980> ship<00:00:52.040> which<00:00:52.370> is<00:00:52.489> the

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
if you build a ship which is the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.310 
if you build a ship which is the
smallest<00:00:52.880> carpathian<00:00:53.660> wonder<00:00:53.899> once<00:00:54.050> again

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
smallest carpathian wonder once again

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.799 
smallest carpathian wonder once again
it's<00:00:54.590> going<00:00:54.739> to<00:00:54.800> be<00:00:55.059> you<00:00:56.059> know<00:00:56.180> a<00:00:56.210> bit<00:00:56.450> squished

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
it's going to be you know a bit squished

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.299 
it's going to be you know a bit squished
they're<00:00:57.410> not<00:00:57.559> around<00:00:57.739> a<00:00:57.770> lot<00:00:57.890> of<00:00:57.980> room<00:00:58.129> inside

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
they're not around a lot of room inside

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.209 
they're not around a lot of room inside
so<00:00:58.879> I've<00:00:59.420> extended<00:00:59.960> it<00:01:00.260> width<00:01:00.680> in<00:01:00.829> lengthwise

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
so I've extended it width in lengthwise

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.700 
so I've extended it width in lengthwise
and<00:01:01.600> probably<00:01:02.600> height<00:01:02.750> wise<00:01:03.020> as<00:01:03.260> well<00:01:03.440> just<00:01:03.590> to

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
and probably height wise as well just to

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.300 
and probably height wise as well just to
make<00:01:03.890> it<00:01:04.539> sort<00:01:05.539> of<00:01:05.660> in<00:01:06.050> line<00:01:06.350> with<00:01:06.649> my<00:01:06.830> Titanic

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
make it sort of in line with my Titanic

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.440 
make it sort of in line with my Titanic
tutorial<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:08.000> they're<00:01:08.090> not<00:01:08.210> quite<00:01:08.420> as

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
tutorial and they're not quite as

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.080 
tutorial and they're not quite as
exaggerated<00:01:09.350> as<00:01:09.560> that<00:01:09.800> you<00:01:10.550> know<00:01:10.700> that<00:01:10.880> thing

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
exaggerated as that you know that thing

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.420 
exaggerated as that you know that thing
was<00:01:11.300> pretty<00:01:11.720> big<00:01:12.020> and<00:01:12.320> I<00:01:12.950> just<00:01:13.100> really<00:01:13.250> quickly

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
was pretty big and I just really quickly

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.650 
was pretty big and I just really quickly
measure<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:13.880> ship<00:01:14.060> ground<00:01:14.270> and<00:01:14.509> then

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
measure the ship ground and then

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.300 
measure the ship ground and then
measured<00:01:14.929> it<00:01:15.050> yet<00:01:15.319> so<00:01:15.530> I'm<00:01:15.619> just<00:01:15.709> going<00:01:15.860> to<00:01:16.130> go

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
measured it yet so I'm just going to go

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.419 
measured it yet so I'm just going to go
from<00:01:16.580> the<00:01:17.860> deck<00:01:18.860> height<00:01:19.190> of<00:01:19.399> the<00:01:19.490> bow<00:01:21.429> measure

00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:22.429 
from the deck height of the bow measure

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:27.370 
from the deck height of the bow measure
and<00:01:23.090> then<00:01:23.660> to<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:23.869> stern<00:01:25.720> I'll<00:01:26.720> send<00:01:27.110> a<00:01:27.170> block

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
and then to the stern I'll send a block

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.330 
and then to the stern I'll send a block
where<00:01:28.840> 288<00:01:29.840> blocks<00:01:30.140> long<00:01:30.349> as<00:01:30.500> I<00:01:30.619> know<00:01:30.679> so<00:01:31.310> I

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
where 288 blocks long as I know so I

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.859 
where 288 blocks long as I know so I
requested<00:01:31.849> the<00:01:32.000> ship<00:01:32.149> to<00:01:32.270> be<00:01:32.390> a<00:01:32.420> hundred<00:01:32.630> and

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
requested the ship to be a hundred and

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:34.749 
requested the ship to be a hundred and
one<00:01:33.770> hundred<00:01:33.800> and<00:01:34.009> three<00:01:34.220> hundred<00:01:34.310> fifty

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
one hundred and three hundred fifty

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:36.969 
one hundred and three hundred fifty
blocks<00:01:34.970> long<00:01:35.240> but<00:01:35.959> I've<00:01:36.110> near<00:01:36.500> enough<00:01:36.679> doubled

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
blocks long but I've near enough doubled

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.910 
blocks long but I've near enough doubled
that<00:01:37.690> because<00:01:38.690> like<00:01:39.050> I<00:01:39.170> said<00:01:39.229> there's<00:01:39.740> too

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
that because like I said there's too

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.199 
that because like I said there's too
many<00:01:40.069> restrictions<00:01:40.340> are<00:01:40.789> we<00:01:40.849> going<00:01:41.000> to<00:01:41.090> build

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:41.209 
many restrictions are we going to build

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:43.480 
many restrictions are we going to build
something<00:01:41.420> one<00:01:41.630> to<00:01:41.750> one<00:01:41.869> scale<00:01:42.310> but<00:01:43.310> I've<00:01:43.369> had

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
something one to one scale but I've had

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.740 
something one to one scale but I've had
this<00:01:43.610> read<00:01:43.849> before<00:01:44.149> so<00:01:44.360> I'm<00:01:44.420> not<00:01:44.509> going<00:01:44.660> to

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
this read before so I'm not going to

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.690 
this read before so I'm not going to
carry<00:01:44.959> on<00:01:45.110> so<00:01:45.590> just<00:01:45.860> look<00:01:46.069> quick<00:01:46.280> look<00:01:46.580> over

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
carry on so just look quick look over

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.730 
carry on so just look quick look over
the<00:01:47.030> ship's<00:01:47.270> I<00:01:47.509> would<00:01:47.630> go<00:01:47.750> over<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:48.380> fo'c'sle

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
the ship's I would go over the fo'c'sle

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.350 
the ship's I would go over the fo'c'sle
here<00:01:49.360> with<00:01:50.360> cargo<00:01:50.690> hatches<00:01:50.899> for<00:01:51.770> what<00:01:51.890> mast
