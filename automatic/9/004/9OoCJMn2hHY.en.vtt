hi Christine I was asked to demonstrate

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.249 
hi Christine I was asked to demonstrate
how<00:00:03.780> to<00:00:03.810> cut<00:00:04.319> bandanas<00:00:05.190> and<00:00:05.720> because<00:00:06.720> I<00:00:06.810> have<00:00:07.049> I

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
how to cut bandanas and because I have I

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.620 
how to cut bandanas and because I have I
did<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.560> diagram<00:00:08.040> but<00:00:08.269> they<00:00:09.269> couldn't<00:00:09.540> figure

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
did a diagram but they couldn't figure

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.990 
did a diagram but they couldn't figure
it<00:00:09.780> out<00:00:09.870> you<00:00:10.860> want<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.070> start<00:00:11.280> out<00:00:11.370> with<00:00:11.429> fabric

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
it out you want to start out with fabric

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.120 
it out you want to start out with fabric
that's<00:00:13.519> preferably<00:00:14.519> 45<00:00:15.509> inches<00:00:15.960> wide<00:00:16.170> so

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
that's preferably 45 inches wide so

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.340 
that's preferably 45 inches wide so
that's<00:00:17.340> from<00:00:17.520> selvage<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.270> selvage<00:00:18.510> this<00:00:19.170> is<00:00:19.320> a

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
that's from selvage to selvage this is a

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.130 
that's from selvage to selvage this is a
salvage<00:00:20.270> that's<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.359> salvage<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.840> these<00:00:21.960> are

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
salvage that's a salvage and these are

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.400 
salvage that's a salvage and these are
the<00:00:22.260> cut<00:00:22.500> ends<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.060> if<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.150> get<00:00:24.410> fabric

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
the cut ends and if you get fabric

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.210 
the cut ends and if you get fabric
that's<00:00:25.680> 44<00:00:26.099> or<00:00:26.250> 45<00:00:26.519> inches<00:00:27.199> wide<00:00:28.199> then<00:00:29.039> you

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
that's 44 or 45 inches wide then you

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.120 
that's 44 or 45 inches wide then you
want<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.490> ask<00:00:29.699> for<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.449> yard<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.080> seven<00:00:31.769> inches

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
want to ask for a yard and seven inches

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.090 
want to ask for a yard and seven inches
that<00:00:32.850> will<00:00:33.120> give<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.510> exact<00:00:34.100> dimensions

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
that will give you the exact dimensions

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.400 
that will give you the exact dimensions
that<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.370> need<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.790> cut<00:00:36.270> bandanas<00:00:37.140> without

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
that you need to cut bandanas without

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.389 
that you need to cut bandanas without
any<00:00:37.649> leftover<00:00:38.219> first<00:00:39.059> thing<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.390> do<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:40.399> fold

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
any leftover first thing you do is fold

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.420 
any leftover first thing you do is fold
it<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.670> half<00:00:42.320> this<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.649> folded<00:00:44.010> end<00:00:44.160> and

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
it in half this is the folded end and

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.729 
it in half this is the folded end and
then<00:00:45.180> this<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.719> called<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.320> salvaged

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
then this is this called the salvaged

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.860 
then this is this called the salvaged
end<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.789> end<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.510> fabric

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
end and this is the end that the fabric

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.580 
end and this is the end that the fabric
store<00:00:49.020> employees<00:00:49.410> kind<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.770> um<00:00:51.469> easiest<00:00:52.469> thing

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
store employees kind of um easiest thing

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.020 
store employees kind of um easiest thing
to<00:00:52.620> do<00:00:52.890> I'm<00:00:53.250> just<00:00:53.309> going<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.699> do<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.820> this

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
to do I'm just going to do it this

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.170 
to do I'm just going to do it this
simplest<00:00:54.420> way<00:00:55.190> use<00:00:56.190> your<00:00:56.340> pinking<00:00:56.699> shears<00:00:56.730> and

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
simplest way use your pinking shears and

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.380 
simplest way use your pinking shears and
cut<00:00:57.210> your<00:00:57.899> fold<00:00:59.359> down<00:01:00.359> through<00:01:00.660> there<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:02.390> cut

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
cut your fold down through there and cut

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.730 
cut your fold down through there and cut
your<00:01:03.539> folds<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:07.170> lengthwise<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.830> fabric

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
your folds the lengthwise of the fabric

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.490 
your folds the lengthwise of the fabric
I<00:01:10.740> never<00:01:11.130> I'm<00:01:11.280> too<00:01:11.490> exact<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.479> can<00:01:12.659> be<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> lot

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
I never I'm too exact you can be a lot

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.230 
I never I'm too exact you can be a lot
more<00:01:13.680> precise<00:01:14.010> about<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:15.170> so<00:01:16.170> cut<00:01:16.500> again<00:01:17.240> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
more precise about this so cut again the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.789 
more precise about this so cut again the
bottom<00:01:20.720> okay<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:21.780> now<00:01:22.020> we<00:01:22.080> have<00:01:22.320> four<00:01:22.590> layers

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
bottom okay so now we have four layers

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.070 
bottom okay so now we have four layers
and<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.939> we've<00:01:24.180> got<00:01:24.360> four<00:01:24.600> squares<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.020> are

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
and and we've got four squares that are

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.770 
and and we've got four squares that are
that<00:01:25.290> size<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:26.310> want<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.580> fold<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:28.700> from<00:01:29.780> one

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
that size you want to fold it from one

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.069 
that size you want to fold it from one
corner<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.950> other<00:01:32.070> corner<00:01:32.930> so<00:01:33.930> you're

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
corner to the other corner so you're

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.390 
corner to the other corner so you're
matching<00:01:34.290> up<00:01:34.590> from<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.860> corner<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.310> you're

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
matching up from the corner and you're

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.569 
matching up from the corner and you're
matching<00:01:35.549> your<00:01:35.850> cut<00:01:36.150> edges<00:01:37.130> that<00:01:38.130> gives<00:01:38.369> you

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
matching your cut edges that gives you

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.499 
matching your cut edges that gives you
the<00:01:38.880> triangle<00:01:39.360> shape<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.850> then<00:01:41.850> all<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.329> have

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
the triangle shape and then all you have

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.950 
the triangle shape and then all you have
to<00:01:42.540> do<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.460> go<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.520> where<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.149> white<00:01:45.390> line<00:01:45.720> is

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
to do is go to where the white line is

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.100 
to do is go to where the white line is
on<00:01:46.110> your<00:01:46.229> fabric<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.600> follow<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.869> white

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
on your fabric and you follow that white

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.200 
on your fabric and you follow that white
line<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.829> cut<00:01:50.040> through<00:01:50.189> all<00:01:50.460> your<00:01:51.770> layers

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
line and you cut through all your layers

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.810 
line and you cut through all your layers
and<00:01:54.799> depending<00:01:55.799> on<00:01:55.890> how<00:01:56.070> strong<00:01:56.130> your<00:01:56.490> pinking

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
and depending on how strong your pinking

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.810 
and depending on how strong your pinking
shears<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.329> are<00:01:58.100> you<00:01:59.100> might<00:01:59.310> have<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.640> cut

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
shears it are you might have to cut

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.399 
shears it are you might have to cut
these<00:01:59.939> individually<00:02:00.570> but<00:02:00.840> mine<00:02:01.020> are<00:02:01.049> pretty

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
these individually but mine are pretty

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.580 
these individually but mine are pretty
sharp<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:01.979> pretty<00:02:02.750> strong<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.229> can<00:02:04.409> cut

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
sharp and pretty strong so I can cut

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.590 
sharp and pretty strong so I can cut
through<00:02:04.770> all<00:02:04.979> that's<00:02:05.729> eight<00:02:05.939> layers<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.390> just

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
through all that's eight layers I just

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.990 
through all that's eight layers I just
cut<00:02:06.750> there

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
cut there

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.020 
cut there
so<00:02:07.510> that's<00:02:07.810> garbage<00:02:08.940> now<00:02:09.940> we<00:02:10.030> have<00:02:10.440> four<00:02:12.030> sides

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
so that's garbage now we have four sides

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.730 
so that's garbage now we have four sides
that<00:02:13.300> are<00:02:13.480> all<00:02:13.720> been<00:02:14.020> covered<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:17.230> now<00:02:17.560> we're

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
that are all been covered and now we're

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.380 
that are all been covered and now we're
going<00:02:17.830> to<00:02:17.890> cut<00:02:18.130> through<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.550> folded<00:02:19.000> edge

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
going to cut through the folded edge

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.840 
going to cut through the folded edge
so<00:02:19.600> basically<00:02:19.960> we're<00:02:20.260> cutting<00:02:20.620> from<00:02:21.430> now<00:02:21.640> on

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
so basically we're cutting from now on

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.400 
so basically we're cutting from now on
we're<00:02:22.150> just<00:02:22.330> going<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.510> fold<00:02:22.750> and<00:02:23.080> cut<00:02:23.230> the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
we're just going to fold and cut the

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:30.450 
we're just going to fold and cut the
folded<00:02:23.740> edge<00:02:29.220> okay

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
folded edge okay

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.910 
folded edge okay
then<00:02:31.390> I'm<00:02:31.750> going<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:31.990> take<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.380> top<00:02:32.590> four

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
then I'm going to take the top four

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.940 
then I'm going to take the top four
because<00:02:33.250> I<00:02:33.280> can't<00:02:33.640> go<00:02:33.850> through<00:02:34.500> all<00:02:35.500> of<00:02:35.560> them

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
because I can't go through all of them

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:36.480 
because I can't go through all of them
at<00:02:36.040> once

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
at once

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.420 
at once
and<00:02:36.700> take<00:02:36.820> the<00:02:36.940> top<00:02:37.150> floor<00:02:37.450> it<00:02:37.510> again<00:02:38.430> so

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
and take the top floor it again so

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.380 
and take the top floor it again so
that's<00:02:39.550> a<00:02:39.760> triangle

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
that's a triangle

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
that's a triangle
I'm<00:02:40.450> folding<00:02:41.140> from<00:02:41.320> corner<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:41.650> corner<00:02:42.030> and

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
I'm folding from corner to corner and

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.340 
I'm folding from corner to corner and
that<00:02:44.410> creates<00:02:44.709> another<00:02:44.770> triangle<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:46.350> then

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
that creates another triangle and then

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:53.130 
that creates another triangle and then
I'm<00:02:47.470> going<00:02:47.620> to<00:02:47.680> cut<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:47.980> folded<00:02:48.310> edge<00:02:52.140> now

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
I'm going to cut the folded edge now

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.070 
I'm going to cut the folded edge now
depending<00:02:53.740> on<00:02:53.860> what<00:02:54.070> you<00:02:54.250> like<00:02:54.690> this<00:02:55.690> can<00:02:55.959> be

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
depending on what you like this can be

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.560 
depending on what you like this can be
your<00:02:56.230> finished<00:02:56.440> bandana<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:59.310> I<00:03:00.310> actually<00:03:00.970> cut

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
your finished bandana and I actually cut

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.650 
your finished bandana and I actually cut
it<00:03:01.660> one<00:03:01.840> more<00:03:01.990> time<00:03:02.340> because<00:03:03.340> then<00:03:03.790> you<00:03:04.060> get<00:03:04.330> a

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
it one more time because then you get a

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.520 
it one more time because then you get a
big<00:03:05.380> and<00:03:05.640> a<00:03:06.640> small<00:03:06.670> bend<00:03:07.150> in<00:03:07.330> so<00:03:07.660> I<00:03:07.900> take<00:03:08.410> it

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
big and a small bend in so I take it

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.699 
big and a small bend in so I take it
again<00:03:08.770> fold<00:03:09.070> from<00:03:09.280> corner<00:03:09.580> to<00:03:09.610> corner<00:03:10.650> this<00:03:11.650> is

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
again fold from corner to corner this is

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.470 
again fold from corner to corner this is
where<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:12.100> fold<00:03:12.340> is<00:03:12.580> these<00:03:13.030> are<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.269> cut

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
where the fold is these are the cut

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.380 
where the fold is these are the cut
edges<00:03:13.660> I<00:03:14.130> get<00:03:15.130> triangle<00:03:15.670> good<00:03:15.820> but<00:03:16.000> I'm<00:03:16.090> not

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
edges I get triangle good but I'm not

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.990 
edges I get triangle good but I'm not
cutting<00:03:16.840> this<00:03:17.050> line<00:03:17.350> I'm<00:03:17.650> going<00:03:18.459> to<00:03:18.610> on<00:03:18.820> the

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
cutting this line I'm going to on the

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.199 
cutting this line I'm going to on the
folded<00:03:19.480> edge<00:03:19.720> so<00:03:19.989> this<00:03:20.140> is<00:03:20.320> the<00:03:20.410> folded<00:03:20.709> edge

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
folded edge so this is the folded edge

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:27.240 
folded edge so this is the folded edge
I'm<00:03:22.209> going<00:03:22.269> to<00:03:22.780> fold<00:03:22.959> in<00:03:23.140> half<00:03:25.800> so<00:03:26.800> there's<00:03:27.160> a

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
I'm going to fold in half so there's a

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.340 
I'm going to fold in half so there's a
folded<00:03:27.550> edge<00:03:27.700> these<00:03:28.360> are<00:03:28.510> cut<00:03:28.720> edges<00:03:29.050> this<00:03:29.230> is

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
folded edge these are cut edges this is

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.100 
folded edge these are cut edges this is
where<00:03:29.500> people<00:03:29.680> get<00:03:30.040> confused<00:03:30.640> by<00:03:31.540> folding<00:03:31.959> it

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
where people get confused by folding it

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.220 
where people get confused by folding it
from<00:03:32.380> that<00:03:32.680> edge<00:03:32.920> to<00:03:33.220> that<00:03:33.250> edge<00:03:33.840> then<00:03:34.840> I<00:03:35.019> cut

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
from that edge to that edge then I cut

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:41.690 
from that edge to that edge then I cut
this<00:03:35.500> folded<00:03:36.040> line<00:03:38.430> when<00:03:39.430> I'm<00:03:39.700> finished<00:03:40.269> I

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
this folded line when I'm finished I

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.050 
this folded line when I'm finished I
then<00:03:42.700> have<00:03:43.120> a<00:03:43.510> band<00:03:44.410> down<00:03:44.680> of<00:03:44.890> this<00:03:45.040> size<00:03:45.250> which

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
then have a band down of this size which

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.900 
then have a band down of this size which
goes<00:03:46.299> on<00:03:46.480> all<00:03:46.690> but<00:03:47.290> this<00:03:47.440> biggest<00:03:48.430> dogs<00:03:48.670> and
