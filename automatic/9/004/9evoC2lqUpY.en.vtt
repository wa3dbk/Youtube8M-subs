00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 and how about friends we are in a new 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.370
 information video about minecraft in 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.600
 console 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.670
 the day of I bring you new information 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.150
 all this information that I am going to 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.730
 say then that information is not 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.740
 not confirmed by four jacks of yours 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.500
 they are just things that I think 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.349
 they're going to be happening it 's tempus to investigate 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.500
 a little about the departure date of the 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:27.509
 1.8 update in pc minecraft was 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.560
 exactly a year ago on 2 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:34.830
 September as you see today we are at 31 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.320
 August if I'm not mistaken in the truth 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.390
 I know but I have come to think that 4j 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.089
 studies are going to take out the update on 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.879
 same day they took the 1.8 minecraft 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:47.460
 PC that will do just maybe 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.170
 this year on September 2 that they take out 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.969
 the tv 29 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.739
 Well, as it was already being commented that 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.839
 that update is going to be equivalent to 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.660
 the 1.8 or at least I had commented 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.180
 as well 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.140
 let's hope it's true, I'm 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.730
 waiting for you to take an extraction 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.070
 equivalent to 1.8 since it has 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.590
 too many things included besides that 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.479
 they have several goes long enough without 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.780
 get a good update have 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.660
 almost a year if I 'm not wrong not a year 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.729
 I think it's half a year or less but 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:20.030
 for me it is enough since in the other 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:23.030
 consoles still good consoles in the other 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.070
 editions like minecraft and minecraft pc 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.560
 Well, they have already made many updates and 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.020
 well I do not see changes here in console and 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.960
 Well, let's hope it's like that 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.920
 I do not think that I think they are 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.080
 they are working on the update 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.990
 because I had seen a video out there 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.789
 a friend who mentioned that he was 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.910
 I 'm selling a vacation I do not know what else 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:46.369
 I think I do not know that's not the way I think 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.310
 yes they got the LEDs of the woods 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.170
 oak and the dark oak house and the 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.729
 cassia was simply because 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.500
 had the biomes ready or are they already 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.420
 working on it I do not think it's in 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.900
 take a vacation and they said leave 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.330
 well the woods or something like that 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.770
 then the safest thing is that four 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.680
 your votes we have a surprise 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.920
 let's hope that on September 2 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.910
 take out in the update your 29 or 30 no 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.320
 I think this bug fix 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.680
 because I really have seen errors 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.900
 so far from minecraft console I was 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.000
 here winning the edition of xbox one and 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.740
 I'm here on playstation 4 and I do not have 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.350
 no mistake they have been mentioning me 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.230
 there on facebook I think it was called in 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.630
 irvine we're a friend who helps me 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.780
 based on information but I did not have 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.860
 problems me in that aspect in 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.120
 incorrectness in correcting errors in 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.319
 to that 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.319
 besides this 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:42.980
 as generally the video happened well 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:46.129
 mentioned that I did not know if they are going to put 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.349
 everything contained in minecraft 1.8 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.000
 of pc that we hope you do because 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.079
 I think it's a long time already 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.409
 time to get a good 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.409
 upgrade 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.160
 and well, it's just that we hope that 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.069
 on September 2 on day 2 of 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.230
 September leave the update this 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.440
 as they also see 4j studies has been 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.630
 too much inactive on twitter 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.470
 that's why he's going to think to me that 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.910
 they are working what is the 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.950
 upgrade 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.690
 and then let's hope it's like that and good 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.370
 this has been all the video I hope that 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.560
 they liked it and they have served this 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.020
 information help me sharing with 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.810
 your friends 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.810
 and we'll see you until next video 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:43.190
 I am more comfort 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:46.190
 of acting and water and structures for 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.190
 build
