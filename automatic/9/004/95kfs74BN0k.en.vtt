00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.370
 Has 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.630
 I am 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.140
 bebra 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.840
 to the church 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:21.200
 over 25 years of building conservation 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:24.740
 active i show you infrared today 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.660
 measuring instrument testo 835 energetic 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.090
 weak spots on the building existed 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.500
 can recognize 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.320
 For that I will do measurements on one 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.750
 unsaniert and a renovated apartment 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.990
 carry out 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.990
 First, we check the renovated apartment 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.880
 the landlord has with Schiller that 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.800
 Mold has problems in your apartment 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.920
 and I set myself the relevant one 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.860
 I now make the selection 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.480
 the north side has one 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.370
 surface temperature of 14.1 degrees the 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.220
 is completely at this season 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:14.940
 no problem I want to see at sea 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.630
 of course one on the northeast side 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:22.229
 geometric cold bridge he has out of 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.350
 temperatures of two degrees plus ca and 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.970
 we will show you one now on the display 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.619
 surface temperature of 91 degrees 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.410
 he sees you coming in now 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:36.630
 critical area rheinwasser accumulation 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:39.780
 Can I find the northwest corner now? 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.229
 sees 7.2 degrees surface temperature 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.330
 image of the condensation would be at 10 4 degrees 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.690
 failure so here now falls 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.300
 instantaneous condensate from another 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.110
 black coloring in the corner sees the 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.069
 mold education 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.500
 Now I present to value the Aasee 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:00.179
 the wwf shows me how high the 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.200
 is mold and that is now 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:10.200
 at 1 by very high at 0 8 starts the 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:12.210
 critical areas another 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.420
 weak point in the building stock is the 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:19.620
 Window reveals the temperature drops 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:22.130
 direction window and upper hammer one 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.550
 high forces of the air lapped and 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.550
 insufficiently insulated 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.660
 I now have all choose their components 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.800
 checked to make even more precise statements 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.840
 to be able to 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.580
 Ventilation should be the 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.090
 Data logger from techno for use 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.860
 bring 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.750
 We're going to the neighbor's apartment now 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.720
 and check a renovated components 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.990
 temperature and humidity and look how 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.990
 it looks there 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.920
 we are here in the redeveloped 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.640
 Apartment in the last working days 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:04.590
 we have insulated the outer walls and 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:08.230
 the ceiling is insulated and installed 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:13.300
 he checks the insulated northwest corner here 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:15.220
 like the unsanierte apartment I drive 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:19.050
 as with the device over which took place around the 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.050
 temperature courses to check 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.100
 there we can realize that we are so 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:30.760
 good as no temperature differences 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:36.970
 as I am now testing the six 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:40.049
 centimeters thick steamed line was 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:43.480
 from the wall surface into the pipe 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:48.489
 and can tell that we are as good as 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:51.480
 no temperature waste have now check 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:55.600
 me the extended shutter box 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.840
 again the area went and was with 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:02.190
 my device in the line 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.190
 hardly any temperature here either 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.710
 As you can see I have that 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:22.680
 test 835 the following advantages 

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:25.120
 I can handle the often difficult 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.800
 Structural questions plausible 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.770
 explain building physical engineering 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.480
 I can give you some advice 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:38.160
 the success of ours 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.160
 Measure I can check
