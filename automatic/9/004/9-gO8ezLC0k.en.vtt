accessories<00:01:14.590> but<00:01:15.159> we<00:01:15.340> had<00:01:15.729> to<00:01:15.820> make<00:01:15.939> them

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
accessories but we had to make them

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.730 
accessories but we had to make them
really<00:01:16.240> cheaply<00:01:16.509> so<00:01:16.600> we<00:01:17.110> were<00:01:17.350> working<00:01:17.500> with<00:01:17.710> a

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
really cheaply so we were working with a

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.499 
really cheaply so we were working with a
factory<00:01:18.100> overseas<00:01:18.520> we<00:01:19.149> had<00:01:19.270> trouble

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
factory overseas we had trouble

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:20.880 
factory overseas we had trouble
communicating<00:01:19.659> with<00:01:20.140> them<00:01:20.320> but<00:01:20.560> we<00:01:20.649> couldn't

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
communicating with them but we couldn't

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.280 
communicating with them but we couldn't
afford<00:01:20.979> to<00:01:21.280> fly<00:01:21.700> there<00:01:22.000> and<00:01:22.270> so<00:01:22.479> we<00:01:22.750> we<00:01:23.110> wanted

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
afford to fly there and so we we wanted

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.130 
afford to fly there and so we we wanted
to<00:01:23.380> be<00:01:23.500> there<00:01:23.649> more<00:01:23.860> often<00:01:24.450> virtually<00:01:25.450> and<00:01:25.750> so

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
to be there more often virtually and so

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.600 
to be there more often virtually and so
we<00:01:26.259> saw<00:01:26.409> some<00:01:26.590> of<00:01:26.680> these<00:01:26.740> telepresence<00:01:27.340> robots

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
we saw some of these telepresence robots

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.429 
we saw some of these telepresence robots
that<00:01:27.700> had<00:01:27.850> been<00:01:27.939> on<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:28.090> market<00:01:28.450> but<00:01:29.350> they

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
that had been on the market but they

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.139 
that had been on the market but they
were<00:01:29.530> very<00:01:29.560> very<00:01:29.799> expensive<00:01:30.430> and<00:01:30.579> we<00:01:30.670> were

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
were very very expensive and we were

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:32.399 
were very very expensive and we were
very<00:01:31.360> small<00:01:31.540> startup<00:01:31.930> we<00:01:32.079> couldn't<00:01:32.350> afford

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
very small startup we couldn't afford

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.490 
very small startup we couldn't afford
those<00:01:32.770> so<00:01:33.399> we<00:01:33.610> we<00:01:34.119> said<00:01:34.299> you<00:01:34.390> know<00:01:34.479> what<00:01:34.600> I<00:01:34.780> bet

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
those so we we said you know what I bet

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:42.070 
those so we we said you know what I bet
we<00:01:35.590> could<00:01:35.710> build<00:01:35.860> one<00:01:36.009> of<00:01:36.100> those<00:01:36.189> ourselves

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.510 

they<00:01:43.080> had<00:01:43.229> two<00:01:43.439> objectives<00:01:43.590> for<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.189> robot

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
they had two objectives for the robot

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.219 
they had two objectives for the robot
that<00:01:45.000> also<00:01:45.210> proved<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.720> be<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.930> biggest

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
that also proved to be the biggest

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.530 
that also proved to be the biggest
challenges<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:47.610> robot<00:01:47.970> needed<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.390> have<00:01:48.509> a

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
challenges the robot needed to have a

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.429 
challenges the robot needed to have a
small<00:01:48.869> base<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.380> stand<00:01:49.890> at<00:01:50.070> human<00:01:50.399> heights

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
small base and stand at human heights

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.810 
small base and stand at human heights
they<00:01:52.439> achieved<00:01:52.799> these<00:01:52.920> objectives<00:01:53.460> by

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
they achieved these objectives by

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.100 
they achieved these objectives by
creating<00:01:54.330> a<00:01:54.420> sleek<00:01:54.690> and<00:01:54.869> slender

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
efforts included a transformed golf

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.609 
efforts included a transformed golf

make<00:02:13.290> this<00:02:13.410> thing<00:02:13.560> really<00:02:13.800> beefy<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.310> know<00:02:14.400> we

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
make this thing really beefy you know we

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.789 
make this thing really beefy you know we
had<00:02:14.610> like<00:02:14.640> 1<00:02:15.450> inch<00:02:15.630> shafts<00:02:16.019> at<00:02:16.290> one<00:02:16.410> point<00:02:16.620> on

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799

into the base can and divots were forced

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.030 
into the base can and divots were forced
to<00:02:33.269> think<00:02:33.510> more<00:02:33.720> creatively<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.470> develop

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
to think more creatively and develop

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.970 
to think more creatively and develop
smaller<00:02:35.400> smart<00:02:35.819> systems<00:02:36.590> we<00:02:37.590> started<00:02:37.920> to

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
smaller smart systems we started to

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.500 
smaller smart systems we started to
figure<00:02:38.190> out<00:02:38.310> what<00:02:38.730> is<00:02:38.819> the<00:02:38.940> design<00:02:39.239> that<00:02:39.269> we

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
figure out what is the design that we

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.059 
figure out what is the design that we
could<00:02:39.690> do<00:02:39.810> what's<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.110> what's<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.500> the

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
could do what's the what's the the

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.680 
could do what's the what's the the
simplest<00:02:41.519> possible<00:02:41.790> design<00:02:42.269> to<00:02:42.450> make<00:02:42.570> this

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
simplest possible design to make this

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.210 
simplest possible design to make this
not<00:02:42.900> look<00:02:43.109> like<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.290> robot<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.799> not<00:02:43.920> look<00:02:44.100> like

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
not look like a robot and not look like

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.440 
not look like a robot and not look like
a<00:02:44.250> battle<00:02:44.609> bot<00:02:44.730> so<00:02:44.880> somebody<00:02:45.180> would<00:02:45.239> want<00:02:45.390> to

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
a battle bot so somebody would want to

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.970 
a battle bot so somebody would want to
have<00:02:45.540> it<00:02:45.630> in<00:02:45.720> their<00:02:45.810> office<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.320> so<00:02:46.739> then<00:02:46.859> we

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
have it in their office and so then we

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.860 
have it in their office and so then we
said<00:02:47.190> how<00:02:47.280> well<00:02:47.489> does<00:02:48.150> this<00:02:48.390> shape<00:02:48.630> that<00:02:48.660> we

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
said how well does this shape that we

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.479 
said how well does this shape that we
came<00:02:49.049> up<00:02:49.109> with<00:02:49.260> with<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.709> wheels<00:02:49.920> that<00:02:50.130> kind

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
came up with with the wheels that kind

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.039 
came up with with the wheels that kind
of<00:02:50.549> just<00:02:50.730> go<00:02:50.820> right<00:02:51.030> around<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.480> body<00:02:51.690> of<00:02:51.810> it

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
of just go right around the body of it

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.140 
of just go right around the body of it
the<00:02:52.410> body<00:02:52.560> kind<00:02:52.799> of<00:02:52.859> disappears<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.640> so<00:02:53.820> in

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
the body kind of disappears and so in

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.180 
the body kind of disappears and so in
that<00:02:54.570> process<00:02:54.780> we<00:02:55.170> were<00:02:55.260> able<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.680> it<00:02:56.070> really

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
that process we were able to it really

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.310 
that process we were able to it really
forced<00:02:56.579> us<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:56.940> make<00:02:57.209> everything<00:02:57.510> smaller<00:02:58.019> and

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
forced us to make everything smaller and

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.009 
forced us to make everything smaller and
lighter<00:02:58.829> and<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.850> just<00:03:00.359> better<00:03:00.630> in<00:03:00.840> general

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
lighter and and just better in general

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.590 
lighter and and just better in general
that<00:03:01.980> won't<00:03:02.190> cause<00:03:02.400> too<00:03:02.609> much<00:03:02.730> damage<00:03:02.790> rid

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
that won't cause too much damage rid

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.449 
that won't cause too much damage rid
muscles<00:03:03.989> its<00:03:04.170> way<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:04.620> water<00:03:04.769> cooler<00:03:05.130> to
