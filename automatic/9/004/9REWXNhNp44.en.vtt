00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.200
 hello to all of us we are 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.210
 found for a new video 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.760
 today a new presentation of 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.730
 theirs so I present you a lure of 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:37.960
 at generation time the trick quynh 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:40.000
 trang skin edition so a year a little 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.519
 complicated for that but a very good 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.850
 theirs so it's a crack 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:51.390
 as its name indicates a notch of 5 cm 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:55.210
 you want to see who is 7 6 g 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.399
 available in three colors one notch very 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.829
 interesting to these profiles and elongated 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.410
 so it's a lure that goes down to a 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.910
 depth of about three meters between 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.619
 3 to 2 meters 50 and 4 meters maximum 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.240
 about how we bring back but that's 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.670
 so really very interesting for 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.390
 basically search the fish like 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.660
 perches 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.310
 the ashes the pike see the black 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.229
 bass it's a lure that should be very 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.200
 react well with this color black bass 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.909
 for example all other colors are 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.680
 all more interesting ones than 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.350
 others will invite you to the time that is 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.470
 really not very expensive it is about 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.259
 7 euros for a 30 press it's not 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.390
 given but it's almost the case it's a 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.580
 very good value for money at the level 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.960
 of this lure and you can you go 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.810
 to be able to see at the end of the video the 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.140
 animations and swimming to do it at 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.580
 the swimming 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.170
 the animations we have in solothurn 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.720
 why fish the areas that we 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.579
 prospecting and you can see that the 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.470
 ashes at the opening they liked 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.040
 this time when there are already traces of 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.860
 teeth on 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.439
 the fish have appreciated so 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.600
 really a very good time if you 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:04.869
 have to take one do not hesitate to the 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.430
 take it's a very good one 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.299
 investment and which guarantees you 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.729
 not take some fish 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.530
 go I blahed no more we end up 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.989
 immediately on the water to see 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.910
 the animation how does it bring back as 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.470
 I bring them how I use this 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.190
 lure and see the posts that takes 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.190
 here we go 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.500
 as you can see on the 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.890
 jerky animations this time the movie 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:34.680
 it's a pulled in 60 cm poor loose 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:37.480
 so having heard their mother and son 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.300
 so that does that it makes breaks like 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.500
 that while they're more macho spending it 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.290
 makes it go up slowly 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.420
 a few centimeters and stop and 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.890
 we restart it is the pike the 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.190
 other goals but my peers that the 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.090
 seems that at that moment they pope 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.680
 as ca dre 6 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.360
 when it seems obvious that at this 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.400
 moment he believes that theirs thanks to 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.190
 god is afraid of him from who starts to 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.220
 from their ca the nerves and not the 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:09.360
 trail in general 4 appetites like 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.880
 an option on the 30 on garbage 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.910
 how animations for example from 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.580
 vegetables is very energetic and a break 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.970
 and especially most of their gods 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.970
 it's effective 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.959
 that 's what sometimes fish do to 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.890
 not deposit preference goes thoroughly 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.000
 sometimes I told them it depends 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.620
 really moments probably not 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.430
 planned but usually at the beginning of the season 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:45.019
 like so three more doctors 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:48.400
 are especially aggressive so it works 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:52.909
 pretty well played and we restart theirs 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.290
 yes oh it's beautiful that I do not know what 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:57.129
 it's but it's a movie fitna not there 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:01.970
 a nice carrot to saint vincent 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:07.450
 they are cared for and ash marl to the 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:09.530
 chestnut who told me ok a center yes 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.000
 it's not the wanted fish because 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.680
 only this time it will start will 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:29.780
 but it's nice to take poster 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:35.630
 that's all we're talking about as 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:37.000
 that a nice little ashes in the 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:44.740
 standards 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.740
 the chestnuts mine at the end of the contest 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:51.580
 we will see if we can not 

00:04:50.179 --> 00:04:53.419
 possible to leave alone 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.719
 it means that there are things that 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:05:00.969
 take soil believe in our research 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:05:00.969
 but as they are fred made easily 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:13.639
 have played little fish is taken in the end 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:17.239
 really at the end of the month the fair entry 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:19.610
 in the end he typed my daughter he touches 

00:05:17.239 --> 00:05:21.800
 I received a quote from theirs and bam he 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.749
 resumed age and shoe he leads a fight 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.029
 so nice with their home 

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:28.149
 generation there that I had told you to 

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:30.379
 the opening works 

00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:40.069
 let's go on I'm going to continue their 

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:42.199
 good fish is very nice it goes away 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:59.529

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:15.090
 pretty little zander and called them 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:17.750
 parts of the world put it into practice 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:23.330
 and it's got everything nickel 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:23.330
