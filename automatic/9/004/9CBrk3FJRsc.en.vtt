00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.500 

next<00:00:01.650> we<00:00:01.770> need<00:00:01.920> to<00:00:02.100> discuss<00:00:02.460> light<00:00:02.820> waves<00:00:03.210> and

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
next we need to discuss light waves and

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.869 
next we need to discuss light waves and
before<00:00:04.290> we<00:00:04.470> talk<00:00:04.680> about<00:00:04.830> light<00:00:05.130> waves<00:00:05.400> we<00:00:05.640> just

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
before we talk about light waves we just

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.299 
before we talk about light waves we just
need<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.089> talk<00:00:06.210> about<00:00:06.509> waves<00:00:07.140> so<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:07.950> question

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
need to talk about waves so the question

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.089 
need to talk about waves so the question
is<00:00:08.490> what<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:08.880> a<00:00:08.910> wave<00:00:09.290> well<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.320> wave<00:00:10.620> is<00:00:11.070> a

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
is what is a wave well a wave is a

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.180 
is what is a wave well a wave is a
disturbance<00:00:11.840> that<00:00:12.840> propagates<00:00:13.650> through<00:00:14.160> a

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
disturbance that propagates through a

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.400 
disturbance that propagates through a
medium<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.120> I'll<00:00:15.570> explain<00:00:15.870> that<00:00:16.020> with<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.230> few

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
medium and I'll explain that with a few

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.400 
medium and I'll explain that with a few
examples<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:17.070> sound<00:00:17.400> wave<00:00:17.760> for<00:00:18.270> example<00:00:18.300> if<00:00:19.199> you

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
examples a sound wave for example if you

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.590 
examples a sound wave for example if you
have<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.560> speaker<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.250> speaker<00:00:21.150> for<00:00:21.449> your

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
have a speaker and a speaker for your

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.870 
have a speaker and a speaker for your
stereo<00:00:21.990> is<00:00:22.199> typically<00:00:22.560> shaped<00:00:23.250> like<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.519> cone

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
stereo is typically shaped like a cone

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.660 
stereo is typically shaped like a cone
and<00:00:24.560> this<00:00:25.560> piece<00:00:25.830> back<00:00:26.010> here<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.400> called<00:00:26.609> the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
and this piece back here is called the

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.269 
and this piece back here is called the
driver<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:28.230> contains<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.800> mechanism

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
driver and that contains the mechanism

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.890 
driver and that contains the mechanism
that<00:00:29.400> shakes<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:29.880> back<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.269> forth<00:00:30.480> so<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.720> just

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
that shakes it back and forth so it just

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.110 
that shakes it back and forth so it just
shakes<00:00:31.019> forward<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.920> back<00:00:32.250> forward<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:33.030> back

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
shakes forward and back forward and back

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.630 
shakes forward and back forward and back
really<00:00:33.510> fast<00:00:33.809> hundreds<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.739> times<00:00:34.950> per<00:00:35.100> second

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
really fast hundreds of times per second

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.090 
really fast hundreds of times per second
but<00:00:36.149> as<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.420> shakes<00:00:36.660> forward<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.290> back<00:00:37.469> it

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
but as it shakes forward and back it

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.000 
but as it shakes forward and back it
shakes<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.670> air<00:00:38.969> in<00:00:39.210> front<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:39.870> that

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
shakes the air in front of it and that

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.130 
shakes the air in front of it and that
disturbance<00:00:41.010> travels<00:00:41.670> through<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.239> air<00:00:42.270> now

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
disturbance travels through the air now

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.590 
disturbance travels through the air now
it's<00:00:43.290> not<00:00:43.410> wind<00:00:43.920> coming<00:00:44.760> out<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.149> traveling

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
it's not wind coming out and traveling

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.410 
it's not wind coming out and traveling
forward<00:00:46.079> it's<00:00:46.680> just<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.239> vibration<00:00:48.239> a

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
forward it's just a vibration a

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.650 
forward it's just a vibration a
disturbance<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.500> travels<00:00:50.070> through<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.610> air

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
disturbance that travels through the air

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.720 
disturbance that travels through the air
this<00:00:51.660> would<00:00:51.899> also<00:00:52.050> be<00:00:52.199> similar<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:53.129> a

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
this would also be similar to a

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.180 
this would also be similar to a
disturbance<00:00:54.629> traveling<00:00:55.199> in<00:00:55.320> anything<00:00:55.920> else

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
disturbance traveling in anything else

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.549 
disturbance traveling in anything else
like<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.460> wave<00:00:56.789> on<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.300> water<00:00:57.570> for<00:00:57.899> example<00:00:58.020> a

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
like a wave on the water for example a

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.580 
like a wave on the water for example a
wave<00:00:59.309> on<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.609> water<00:00:59.850> would<00:01:00.629> be<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> disturbance

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
wave on the water would be a disturbance

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.470 
wave on the water would be a disturbance
that<00:01:01.800> travels<00:01:02.250> across<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.579> surface<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.420> the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
that travels across the surface of the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.560 
that travels across the surface of the
water<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.409> might<00:01:04.650> have<00:01:05.210> well<00:01:06.210> let's<00:01:06.390> draw

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
water so you might have well let's draw

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.160 
water so you might have well let's draw
it<00:01:06.630> like<00:01:06.810> this

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.219 

and<00:01:10.520> these<00:01:11.520> little<00:01:11.790> waves<00:01:12.240> obviously<00:01:13.020> you've

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
and these little waves obviously you've

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.039 
and these little waves obviously you've
seen<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.680> they<00:01:14.010> move<00:01:14.540> across<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.869> surface

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
seen this they move across the surface

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.440 
seen this they move across the surface
of<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.409> water<00:01:16.619> now<00:01:17.369> water<00:01:17.729> isn't<00:01:18.240> really

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
of the water now water isn't really

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.480 
of the water now water isn't really
traveling<00:01:18.960> it's<00:01:19.110> not<00:01:19.290> like<00:01:19.470> if<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.460> a

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
traveling it's not like if this is a

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.580 
traveling it's not like if this is a
pond<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.180> there's<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.360> wave<00:01:21.630> traveling<00:01:22.380> across

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
pond and there's a wave traveling across

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.200 
pond and there's a wave traveling across
the<00:01:22.830> pond<00:01:23.040> it's<00:01:23.220> not<00:01:23.340> like<00:01:23.460> all<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.729> water<00:01:24.000> on

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
the pond it's not like all the water on

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.260 
the pond it's not like all the water on
one<00:01:24.840> side<00:01:24.950> moves<00:01:25.950> across<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.610> ends<00:01:26.790> up<00:01:27.000> on<00:01:27.119> the

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
one side moves across and ends up on the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.090 
one side moves across and ends up on the
other<00:01:27.390> side<00:01:27.509> it's<00:01:27.930> just<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.500> disturbance

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
other side it's just the disturbance

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.160 
other side it's just the disturbance
that<00:01:29.280> travels<00:01:29.729> or<00:01:29.939> if<00:01:30.479> you've<00:01:30.600> taken<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.990> piece

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
that travels or if you've taken a piece

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.770 
that travels or if you've taken a piece
of<00:01:31.290> rope<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.920> say<00:01:32.310> it's<00:01:32.490> fastened<00:01:33.119> down<00:01:33.360> here

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
of rope and say it's fastened down here

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.940 
of rope and say it's fastened down here
and<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.439> grab<00:01:34.680> this<00:01:34.979> end<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:36.390> shake<00:01:36.689> it

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
and you grab this end and you shake it

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.219 
and you grab this end and you shake it
you<00:01:37.950> can<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.640> can<00:01:38.670> shake<00:01:39.479> one<00:01:39.720> in<00:01:39.900> just<00:01:40.020> give

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
you can you can shake one in just give

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.810 
you can you can shake one in just give
it<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.409> shake<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:40.950> little<00:01:41.189> wave<00:01:41.430> pulse

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
it a shake and this little wave pulse

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.539 
it a shake and this little wave pulse
will<00:01:42.600> travel<00:01:42.930> down<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.470> other<00:01:43.619> end<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.130> if

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
will travel down to the other end and if

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.710 
will travel down to the other end and if
you<00:01:44.670> continually<00:01:45.390> shake<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:47.450> you'll<00:01:48.450> get<00:01:48.689> a

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
you continually shake it you'll get a

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.010 
you continually shake it you'll get a
continuous<00:01:49.530> oscillation<00:01:50.340> in<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.579> rope<00:01:54.020> but

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
continuous oscillation in the rope but

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.230 
continuous oscillation in the rope but
the<00:01:55.140> Rope<00:01:55.350> itself<00:01:55.829> doesn't<00:01:56.159> start<00:01:56.520> piling<00:01:57.090> up

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
the Rope itself doesn't start piling up

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.300 
the Rope itself doesn't start piling up
down<00:01:57.540> at<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.750> other<00:01:57.930> end<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.619> rope<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.280> not

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
down at the other end the rope is not

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.610 
and the sound will travel from his vocal
cords<00:03:59.730> through<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.480> air<00:04:00.660> in<00:04:00.900> his<00:04:01.049> helmet<00:04:01.500> and

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
cords through the air in his helmet and

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.410 
cords through the air in his helmet and
he<00:04:01.709> has<00:04:01.829> a<00:04:01.860> little<00:04:02.010> microphone<00:04:02.610> there<00:04:03.120> in<00:04:03.299> his

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
he has a little microphone there in his

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.660 
he has a little microphone there in his
helmet<00:04:03.660> and<00:04:03.959> so<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.739> sound<00:04:05.010> is<00:04:05.220> picked<00:04:05.430> up<00:04:05.610> by

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
helmet and so the sound is picked up by

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.460 
helmet and so the sound is picked up by
the<00:04:05.850> microphone<00:04:06.120> but<00:04:06.570> it's<00:04:06.690> only<00:04:06.810> traveling

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
the microphone but it's only traveling

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.410 
the microphone but it's only traveling
in<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.769> helmet<00:04:08.100> and<00:04:08.250> then<00:04:08.730> he's<00:04:09.060> got<00:04:09.209> a<00:04:09.269> little

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
in the helmet and then he's got a little

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.479 
in the helmet and then he's got a little
radio<00:04:09.750> transmitter<00:04:10.380> or<00:04:10.560> something<00:04:10.920> some

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
radio transmitter or something some

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.110 
radio transmitter or something some
device<00:04:11.850> that<00:04:12.120> will<00:04:12.810> broadcast<00:04:13.799> a<00:04:14.130> radio<00:04:14.579> wave

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
device that will broadcast a radio wave

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.469 
device that will broadcast a radio wave
that<00:04:15.959> will<00:04:16.109> then<00:04:16.290> travel<00:04:16.620> and<00:04:17.209> that<00:04:18.209> will<00:04:18.359> be

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
that will then travel and that will be

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.780 
that will then travel and that will be
picked<00:04:18.720> up<00:04:18.870> by<00:04:19.169> the<00:04:19.489> astronauts<00:04:20.489> on<00:04:20.760> the

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
picked up by the astronauts on the

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.000 
picked up by the astronauts on the
spacecraft<00:04:21.180> or<00:04:21.690> another<00:04:21.930> astronaut<00:04:22.530> floating

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
spacecraft or another astronaut floating

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.629 
spacecraft or another astronaut floating
around

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
around

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.550 
around
outside<00:04:24.120> the<00:04:24.300> space<00:04:24.509> station<00:04:24.539> for<00:04:25.110> example

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
outside the space station for example

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.439 
outside the space station for example
that<00:04:26.099> would<00:04:26.219> be<00:04:26.370> picked<00:04:26.520> up<00:04:26.699> by<00:04:26.879> an<00:04:26.999> antenna

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:27.449 
that would be picked up by an antenna

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.409 
that would be picked up by an antenna
and<00:04:27.749> then<00:04:28.379> the<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:29.069> radio<00:04:29.430> device<00:04:29.849> in<00:04:30.150> his

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
and then the the radio device in his

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.779 
and then the the radio device in his
spacesuit<00:04:30.780> would<00:04:31.229> convert<00:04:31.650> it<00:04:31.800> into<00:04:31.979> a<00:04:32.219> sound

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789 
spacesuit would convert it into a sound

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.059 
spacesuit would convert it into a sound
wave<00:04:33.090> inside<00:04:33.719> his<00:04:34.169> helmet<00:04:34.650> so<00:04:34.680> there's<00:04:35.009> a

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:35.069 
wave inside his helmet so there's a

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:37.610 
wave inside his helmet so there's a
little<00:04:35.310> speaker<00:04:35.580> inside<00:04:36.090> his<00:04:36.300> helmet<00:04:36.509> and<00:04:36.840> and

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
little speaker inside his helmet and and

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.080 
little speaker inside his helmet and and
then<00:04:37.860> he<00:04:38.039> can<00:04:38.219> hear<00:04:38.430> the<00:04:38.550> sound<00:04:38.789> from<00:04:38.969> the

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
then he can hear the sound from the

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.550 
then he can hear the sound from the
speaker<00:04:39.419> because<00:04:39.599> it<00:04:39.840> can<00:04:39.960> travel<00:04:40.139> through

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
speaker because it can travel through

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.649 
speaker because it can travel through
the<00:04:40.710> air<00:04:40.860> in<00:04:41.159> the<00:04:41.310> helmet<00:04:41.669> but<00:04:42.210> there's<00:04:42.389> the

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:42.659 
the air in the helmet but there's the

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:44.360 
the air in the helmet but there's the
sound<00:04:42.930> is<00:04:43.169> not<00:04:43.199> traveling<00:04:43.949> through<00:04:44.189> space

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
sound is not traveling through space

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.550 
sound is not traveling through space
it's<00:04:44.789> a<00:04:44.879> light<00:04:45.060> wave<00:04:45.300> a<00:04:45.599> radio<00:04:46.020> wave<00:04:46.259> that's

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
it's a light wave a radio wave that's

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.260 
it's a light wave a radio wave that's
traveling<00:04:47.039> through<00:04:47.580> space<00:04:47.759> from<00:04:48.120> one

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
traveling through space from one

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.379 
traveling through space from one
astronaut<00:04:48.749> to<00:04:48.900> another<00:04:49.759> if<00:04:50.759> astronauts

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
astronaut to another if astronauts

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.959 
astronaut to another if astronauts
radios<00:04:52.110> break<00:04:52.529> down<00:04:52.800> they<00:04:53.460> could<00:04:53.639> actually

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:53.969 
radios break down they could actually

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:56.360 
radios break down they could actually
lean<00:04:54.539> their<00:04:54.810> heads<00:04:55.080> together<00:04:55.349> said<00:04:56.069> that<00:04:56.219> the

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
lean their heads together said that the

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.790 
lean their heads together said that the
the<00:04:56.610> one<00:04:56.849> helmet<00:04:57.180> would<00:04:57.509> touch<00:04:57.810> another<00:04:58.439> and

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
the one helmet would touch another and

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.339 
the one helmet would touch another and
then<00:04:59.189> the<00:04:59.400> sound<00:04:59.669> could<00:05:00.000> travel<00:05:00.300> from<00:05:01.050> the<00:05:01.169> air

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:01.349 
then the sound could travel from the air

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:03.709 
then the sound could travel from the air
through<00:05:02.039> the<00:05:02.370> physical<00:05:02.879> material<00:05:03.060> of<00:05:03.599> the

helmet<00:05:04.080> and<00:05:04.199> into<00:05:04.500> the<00:05:04.620> other<00:05:04.770> one<00:05:05.069> and<00:05:05.250> the

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 
helmet and into the other one and the

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:07.459 
helmet and into the other one and the
other<00:05:05.789> astronaut<00:05:06.449> could<00:05:06.629> hear<00:05:06.900> him<00:05:07.020> but<00:05:07.349> they

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:07.469 
other astronaut could hear him but they

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:08.869 
other astronaut could hear him but they
can't<00:05:07.710> travel<00:05:07.919> through<00:05:08.039> an<00:05:08.189> empty<00:05:08.400> space<00:05:08.639> a

and water waves and waves on a rope but
we'll<00:05:23.279> be<00:05:23.370> getting<00:05:23.610> the<00:05:23.699> light<00:05:23.849> waves<00:05:24.060> in<00:05:24.240> just

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
we'll be getting the light waves in just

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.050 
we'll be getting the light waves in just
a<00:05:24.509> second<00:05:24.960> know<00:05:25.620> though<00:05:25.889> that<00:05:25.919> waves<00:05:26.339> always

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.519 
goes by individual pieces of water are
bouncing<00:05:47.189> up<00:05:47.339> and<00:05:47.460> down<00:05:47.580> as<00:05:48.029> the<00:05:48.270> wave<00:05:48.449> travels

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:48.529 
bouncing up and down as the wave travels

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:51.589 
bouncing up and down as the wave travels
along<00:05:49.529> the<00:05:49.589> surface<00:05:50.069> so<00:05:50.909> there's<00:05:51.120> always<00:05:51.330> an

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:51.599 
along the surface so there's always an

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:54.230 
along the surface so there's always an
oscillation<00:05:52.259> a<00:05:52.680> back-and-forth<00:05:53.219> motion<00:05:53.729> when

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
oscillation a back-and-forth motion when

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.389 
oscillation a back-and-forth motion when
you<00:05:54.330> have<00:05:54.479> a<00:05:54.509> wave<00:05:54.810> and<00:05:55.139> the<00:05:55.589> oscillation<00:05:55.740> can

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:56.399 
you have a wave and the oscillation can

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:59.570 
you have a wave and the oscillation can
be<00:05:56.460> fast<00:05:56.939> or<00:05:57.330> slow<00:05:57.750> and<00:05:58.139> we<00:05:58.919> speak<00:05:59.159> of<00:05:59.370> the

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
be fast or slow and we speak of the

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.779 
be fast or slow and we speak of the
frequency<00:06:00.449> of<00:06:00.659> the<00:06:01.129> oscillation<00:06:02.129> and<00:06:02.310> that's

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:02.789 
frequency of the oscillation and that's

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:07.820 
frequency of the oscillation and that's
an<00:06:02.939> important<00:06:03.389> term<00:06:03.710> the<00:06:04.710> frequency<00:06:05.460> a<00:06:06.830> high

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
an important term the frequency a high

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.219 
an important term the frequency a high
frequency<00:06:08.689> oscillation<00:06:09.689> means<00:06:09.930> there's<00:06:10.169> a

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:10.229 
frequency oscillation means there's a

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:12.050 
frequency oscillation means there's a
lot<00:06:10.589> of<00:06:10.770> back-and-forth<00:06:10.979> motion<00:06:11.520> in<00:06:11.939> the

lot of back-and-forth motion in the

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.420 
lot of back-and-forth motion in the
given<00:06:12.300> amount<00:06:12.479> of<00:06:12.599> time<00:06:12.659> and<00:06:13.169> a<00:06:13.830> low<00:06:14.099> frequency

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
given amount of time and a low frequency

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.939 
given amount of time and a low frequency
oscillation<00:06:15.419> means<00:06:15.629> there's<00:06:15.899> only<00:06:16.050> a<00:06:16.589> few

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:16.949 
oscillation means there's only a few

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:18.980

back<00:06:17.370> and<00:06:17.610> forth<00:06:17.819> motions<00:06:18.300> in<00:06:18.479> a<00:06:18.629> given<00:06:18.899> amount

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
back and forth motions in a given amount

back and forth motions in a given amount
of<00:06:19.199> time<00:06:19.259> as<00:06:19.710> a<00:06:20.159> good<00:06:20.399> example<00:06:20.699> if<00:06:21.240> you<00:06:22.050> play<00:06:22.289> a

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 
of time as a good example if you play a

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:23.869 
of time as a good example if you play a
musical<00:06:22.529> instrument<00:06:22.949> you're<00:06:23.430> familiar<00:06:23.580> with

00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:23.879 
musical instrument you're familiar with

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:29.089 
musical instrument you're familiar with
with<00:06:24.360> notes<00:06:24.719> and<00:06:24.990> the<00:06:25.680> note<00:06:27.020> middle<00:06:28.020> C<00:06:28.319> is<00:06:28.589> a

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:29.099 
with notes and the note middle C is a

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:33.559 
with notes and the note middle C is a
frequency<00:06:29.879> of<00:06:30.589> 256<00:06:31.589> Hertz<00:06:32.129> and<00:06:32.490> this<00:06:33.149> unit

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:33.569 
frequency of 256 Hertz and this unit

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:34.129 
frequency of 256 Hertz and this unit
Hertz

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:34.139 
Hertz

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:36.230 
Hertz
that's<00:06:34.589> H<00:06:34.919> er

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
that's H er

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.330 
that's H er
and<00:06:36.419> that<00:06:36.930> just<00:06:37.139> stands<00:06:37.350> for<00:06:37.470> an<00:06:37.800> oscillation

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 
and that just stands for an oscillation

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.909 
and that just stands for an oscillation
per<00:06:38.729> second<00:06:39.180> so<00:06:39.800> 256<00:06:40.800> Hertz<00:06:41.220> is<00:06:41.810> 256

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:42.919 
per second so 256 Hertz is 256

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:46.790

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:54.810 
middle C is 440 Hertz so a higher

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.629 
middle C is 440 Hertz so a higher
frequency<00:06:55.199> oscillation<00:06:56.160> and<00:06:56.310> you<00:06:56.400> hear<00:06:56.610> a
