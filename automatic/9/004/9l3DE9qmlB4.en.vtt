00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
and good luck okay after tensioning the

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.589 
and good luck okay after tensioning the
spring<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.370> little<00:03:17.639> bit<00:03:17.819> and<00:03:18.060> looping<00:03:18.510> it

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
spring a little bit and looping it

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.000 
spring a little bit and looping it
around<00:03:18.659> so<00:03:19.079> it<00:03:19.139> won't<00:03:19.349> fall<00:03:19.620> off<00:03:20.030> right<00:03:21.030> here

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
around so it won't fall off right here

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.140 
around so it won't fall off right here
that<00:03:23.010> little<00:03:23.159> spring<00:03:25.519> will<00:03:26.519> do<00:03:26.639> a<00:03:26.670> test<00:03:27.030> here

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
that little spring will do a test here

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.080 
that little spring will do a test here
and<00:03:27.329> see<00:03:27.659> how<00:03:27.810> it<00:03:27.930> goes

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
and see how it goes

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.569 
and see how it goes
you<00:03:30.090> need<00:03:30.269> to<00:03:30.389> push<00:03:30.599> the<00:03:30.980> door<00:03:31.980> so<00:03:32.280> it<00:03:32.370> knows

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
you need to push the door so it knows

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:41.150 
you need to push the door so it knows
that<00:03:32.609> it's<00:03:32.879> closed<00:03:35.180> get<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.299> green<00:03:36.569> light

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.070 

and<00:03:41.400> this<00:03:42.150> is<00:03:42.270> kind<00:03:42.450> of<00:03:42.480> hard<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.690> do<00:03:42.870> a<00:03:42.930> little

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
and this is kind of hard to do a little

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.160 
and this is kind of hard to do a little
one<00:03:43.230> hand<00:03:44.060> but<00:03:45.060> you'll<00:03:45.210> see<00:03:45.450> it<00:03:45.660> spins<00:03:46.020> around

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
one hand but you'll see it spins around

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.510 
one hand but you'll see it spins around
here

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.180 

and<00:03:50.970> there's<00:03:51.210> a<00:03:51.270> little<00:03:51.390> cam<00:03:51.720> there<00:03:52.170> that<00:03:52.470> goes

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
and there's a little cam there that goes

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:59.180 
and there's a little cam there that goes
into<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.550> sensor<00:03:55.970> ready<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.120> copy<00:03:58.190> right

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
into the sensor ready to copy right

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.670 
into the sensor ready to copy right
there<00:03:59.550> and<00:03:59.900> then<00:04:00.900> we'll<00:04:01.140> hit<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.440> color

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
there and then we'll hit the color

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:13.350 
there and then we'll hit the color
button<00:04:03.050> it's<00:04:04.050> copying

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.039 

and<00:04:14.379> there<00:04:15.379> it<00:04:15.470> goes<00:04:15.680> and<00:04:15.709> you<00:04:16.070> can<00:04:16.250> see<00:04:16.870> how<00:04:17.870> it

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
and there it goes and you can see how it

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:31.379 
and there it goes and you can see how it
spins<00:04:18.470> right<00:04:18.829> there

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.530 

okay<00:04:31.960> let's<00:04:32.680> see<00:04:32.889> if<00:04:33.009> it<00:04:33.099> gives<00:04:33.250> us<00:04:33.400> a<00:04:33.580> copy

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
okay let's see if it gives us a copy

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.280 
okay let's see if it gives us a copy
hold<00:04:36.380> that<00:04:36.560> door<00:04:36.830> in<00:04:36.950> place<00:04:37.990> I'm<00:04:38.990> going<00:04:39.020> to<00:04:39.140> let

copy and the toner is a little low and

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.160 
copy and the toner is a little low and
that<00:04:50.030> actually<00:04:50.390> did<00:04:50.540> fix<00:04:50.780> it<00:04:50.990> so<00:04:51.740> the<00:04:52.220> trick

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
I'll show that in just a minute okay the

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.960 
I'll show that in just a minute okay the
side<00:05:02.740> fits<00:05:03.740> under<00:05:04.040> this<00:05:04.160> little<00:05:04.400> lip<00:05:04.730> right

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
side fits under this little lip right

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.990 
side fits under this little lip right
here<00:05:05.650> there's<00:05:06.650> a<00:05:06.680> little<00:05:06.770> indent<00:05:07.280> there<00:05:07.550> and

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
here there's a little indent there and

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.910 
here there's a little indent there and
then<00:05:08.510> there's<00:05:08.660> a<00:05:08.720> little<00:05:08.870> notch<00:05:09.230> over<00:05:09.590> here

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:09.920 
then there's a little notch over here

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.460 
then there's a little notch over here
that<00:05:10.070> it<00:05:10.160> goes<00:05:10.310> into<00:05:10.550> and<00:05:11.000> then<00:05:11.750> that<00:05:12.050> door

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
that it goes into and then that door

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.890 
that it goes into and then that door
goes<00:05:12.740> on<00:05:12.920> the<00:05:13.070> front<00:05:13.370> here<00:05:13.640> when<00:05:14.330> you<00:05:14.450> take<00:05:14.690> off

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
goes on the front here when you take off

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.620 
goes on the front here when you take off
the<00:05:15.170> case<00:05:15.790> you<00:05:16.790> have<00:05:16.910> to<00:05:17.000> take<00:05:17.180> off<00:05:17.390> these<00:05:17.570> two

the case you have to take off these two
screws<00:05:18.320> here<00:05:18.770> and<00:05:20.500> then<00:05:21.500> it<00:05:21.620> latches<00:05:21.860> there<00:05:22.340> on

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
screws here and then it latches there on

screws here and then it latches there on
the<00:05:23.210> bottom<00:05:24.490> so<00:05:25.490> trick<00:05:26.150> is<00:05:26.360> is<00:05:26.540> pushing<00:05:26.780> it<00:05:27.050> up

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.170 
the bottom so trick is is pushing it up

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.660 
the bottom so trick is is pushing it up
under<00:05:27.410> here<00:05:27.650> and<00:05:27.800> getting<00:05:27.980> it<00:05:28.070> all<00:05:28.190> the<00:05:28.340> snap

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:28.670 
under here and getting it all the snap

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:33.730 
under here and getting it all the snap
back<00:05:28.940> into<00:05:28.970> place<00:05:31.600> or<00:05:32.600> to<00:05:32.930> take<00:05:33.110> it<00:05:33.230> apart<00:05:33.500> I

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
back into place or to take it apart I

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.010 
back into place or to take it apart I
use<00:05:34.280> a<00:05:34.310> little<00:05:34.460> screwdriver<00:05:34.940> to<00:05:35.240> pry<00:05:35.540> it<00:05:35.600> there

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
use a little screwdriver to pry it there
