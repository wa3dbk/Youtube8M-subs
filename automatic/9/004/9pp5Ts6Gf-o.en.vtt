00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.410
 very 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:20.220
 but that does not stop me from coming to me 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.500
 another video like that with all the discomfort of 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.660

 A) Yes 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.739
 with this idea learn to do another type 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.879
 of collar or we will make this idea 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.190
 explaining in the pearls and also the 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:42.420
 accessories that other models can make 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.489
 that does not let all this flow 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.619
 Then find in any store 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.019
 jewelery or useless and diego because I want 

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:51.019

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:02.150
 pearls of two colors acrylic drops 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:11.300
 little pins and pins with your 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:20.630
 string skewers 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.300
 and rings 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.410
 and the three main pliers are going to 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.950
 cut the chain the size we want 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.950
 the necklace 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:51.409
 the maxilla normalito inserted two 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:55.390
 pearls cuts and closes we separate and 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.390
 we do the same with the acrylic droplet 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:15.440
 with a ring links these two parts and 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.050
 with other 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.440
 unites this pattern right in the middle of the 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.440
 chain 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:35.360
 I made 15 of these patterns I made seven 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.230
 to the right and seven to the left to 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.230
 from the center 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:48.370
 I keep something like this just put the brooch and 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.370
 ready 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.010
 remember that changing colors and 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.640
 forms of these pearls can be left 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.640
 otherwise 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:45.750
 in the videos 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.260
 not warm 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.970
 freshly rises better because I 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.590
 they did bullying for my past video on 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:59.250
