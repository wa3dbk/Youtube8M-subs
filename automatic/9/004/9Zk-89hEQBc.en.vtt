00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.350
 9 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.740
 from today 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.400
 to relegate it 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.400
 less 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:34.949
 it's not that complicated simple and 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.600
 generally it is not worth who does not like 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:38.460
 working with ways are 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.920
 established and more that are contracted 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.269
 and that are signed is in the right 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.909
 to do what corresponds not 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.949
 as long as you stick to that if you do not 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:49.199
 stick to that good because it is no longer positive 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.730
 nor is it beneficial for any of the 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:51.839
 two entities that are signing a 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.940
 contract is not that simple and 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:56.250
 simply if we have not said 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.840
 a single word today they wanted to touch the 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.670
 valdeolmillos theme good is fine what 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.370
 we played there were people who played him with a lot 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.140
 passion but true passion we do not 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.630
 can see things with that passion nor 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.810
 with that interest that goes beyond what 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.180
 professional and personal to these 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.730
 land we put ourselves 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.410
 and if you know what I mean but here 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.660
 What I can tell you is that we have to 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.630
 have a cool head to be able to take 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.900
 forward things if Mexico is not a 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.130
 banana country to be treated in 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.229
 the way they were treating him and 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.020
 be trying to do here there's no 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.340
 messiah of the messiah that I with that I 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.220
 I remember is the only one that everyone 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.110
 we know if we have never walked saying 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.670
 in the media that we liked that we did not 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.260
 dislike our vows and prevention 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.170
 very respectful they are never answered 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.360
 never in life but I can tell you 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.520
 to professionalism and 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.960
 professionalism that the peel was not 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.400
 manifesto did not want to come from there 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.560
 because I did not want to pay taxes 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.360
 to whom they give money here without paying 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.550
 we all pay taxes in this country 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.080
 we all taxed I did not want to tax here 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.130
 I did not want to pay tribute to her either 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.140
 we are going to deliver the documents 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.540
 that we have to deliver them I do not know 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.340
 if he does not want to tax or I do not know if 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.380
 I exist no double taxation agreement 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.720
 I'm an expert on that but we do 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.850
 we paid taxes and we had to pay 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.650
 taxes if you saw that the 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.600
 first movement of dismissal 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.840
 we are replacing what he did 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.940
 gustavo ayÃ³n we did not do that 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.890
 he did it here declared the coach is 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.930
 responding to your personal interests 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.560
 there are many means you cited it not 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.390
 we went after this good because 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.709
 he started doing in a sector of his from his 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.300
 group within the team 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.890
 another lot of people where you know more than 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.310
 where he really went to the 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.920
 you see the matches he was not in 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.290
 hotels can realize the 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.090
 team sometimes 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.849
 he played better in one way than another 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:53.019
 that all we can see are things 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:55.239
 objective if there were some things you have 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.469
 I need to tell you at this time 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.400
 Everyone knows the basque people what 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:03:03.310
 we know the least suspected the 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.740
 less chance I had to know that 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.900
 there was behind the scenes minimum 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.640
 so then we aspire to another time to 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.930
 work with professional people this 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.140
 people in prayer these people who are 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.300
 commits to something and those who are 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.700
 willing to work differently yes 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.220
 is very important in latin america in 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.310
 our country have contact with the 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.310
 means is very important truly 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.930
 and we would like every day that 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.380
 we have the chance of the luck of 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.120
 have contact with you have them each 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.800
 Once things new new new 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.130
 different positive up for 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.280
 up but good I think it's not for 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.990
 so much noise I do not know I do not tell you I do not think 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.470
 that the players are 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.140
 be 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.260
 so foolish as not to understand that what 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.350
 what we are doing is to improve 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.790
 more staff of sergio with 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:02.519
 you for the subject of the contract 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.980
 I hate the selection what happens is that 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.330
 Sergio had the habit of changing 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.790
 things that were established as they 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.860
 I was telling you what a coincidence that everything 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.930
 he had it with us on day 5 of 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.299
 february in barcelona accompanied me in the 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.299
 trip accompanied by our oak tree yes 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.979
 and he decided and the program and he did 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.610
 the whole tour and all the games of 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:25.350
 preparation of the national team 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.610
 all the relative ones were present 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.650
 of the equipment against which 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.410
 we participate until 4 in the morning 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.240
 five in the morning we left there and as 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.949
 it is possible that they were changing it not 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.990
 they want in Argentina and he complained about 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:39.720
 this and he said that to the boys 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.910
 I never speak for him about things about him 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.510
 he talked about him when he liked john 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.860
 he told the media and in his face that he 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.050
 I was watching for the interests 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.290
 personal and not group interests 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.180
 of the team and the country the first thing that 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.040
 he said was we have never said anything 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.060
 today they asked me to announce something 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:02.310
 I gave it to know really I think that 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.440
 this new era to save soon the 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.480
 land without tasting we had before 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.730
 you liked me I did not have as a player and 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.020
 xalapa you know it well the bill is billed 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.390
 relationship 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.970
 with just two put it some 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.740
 the relationship with gustavo this fracture has 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.350
 liked is a boy who is the 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.890
 reference of the national team also and 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:24.590
 he's a very smart guy no no no 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:27.320
 gustavo risked a lot in this event 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:30.830
 because because he came from a serious injury 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:34.730
 of a serious surgery this then he 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.710
 He said more than he could have 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.140
 given there is no relationship 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.940
 fractured with none of the boys 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.309
 he is on the sidelines of all these dimes 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:47.610
 you go and 

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:50.699
 because they should not be cannon fodder if 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:53.819
 the reality is only one thing is that 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:56.489
 it did not work and well everyone is free 

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:58.019
 to judge things as seen by the 

00:05:56.489 --> 00:06:00.949
 reality is what we are living what 

00:05:58.019 --> 00:06:00.949
 that we have lived inside 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:08.680
 tomorrow the team is very even very 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:12.160
 balanced everything look fortunately 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.510
 I think it's a season that 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.920
 that is going to play different because 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.230
 because all this movement that is 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:20.880
 generates with the dynamics of the team 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:22.910
 national because he imbued himself a lot 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.010
 many 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:27.320
 a lot of claws a lot of that competition of 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:30.190
 overcoming the students of the teams 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.850
 and it is precisely what we are now 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.850
 so is
