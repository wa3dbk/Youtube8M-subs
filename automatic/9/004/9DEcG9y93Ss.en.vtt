00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.799
 welcome everyone to this 3dnews.ru 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.520
 and today we tell you about 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.550
 inexpensive 4k monitor jesus baby 287 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.380
 Kiev 4k means that twenty eight 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.730
 inch screen monitor can 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.939
 boast a resolution of 3840 x 2160 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.340
 points inexpensive means it costs 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.380
 less than 30,000 rubles is quite 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:43.500
 moderate figure for such monitors 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:45.629
 4k grade by 28 inches is a lot of it 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.700
 more than 150 ppi 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.010
 which is more typical for tablets than 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.329
 for monitors as well as this monstrous 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.140
 small desktop icons 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.360
 windows 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.090
 so you can't do without scaling 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.059
 windows 8 makes it better than windows 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.309
 7 and all previous versions but still 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.949
 not in the most convenient way some 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.020
 programs like old photoshop scare 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.560
 small icons and do not scale 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.560
 want to 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.909
 jesus baby 287 kb 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.700
 based on the so-called matrices but don't rush 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.460
 sniff it very contemptuously 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.830
 good that matrix viewing angles from her 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.320
 almost the same as the plays of displays 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.729
 brightness what thing is it 300 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.640
 Conder per square meter and 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:35.210
 contrast reaches 880 to one 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.729
 color width 98 percent 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.840
 srgb that for the so-called. matrices again 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.840
 Not bad 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.410
 no less important is that in jesus 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.510
 took care of setting the matrix. 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.190
 her white is very close to 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.260
 reference position and color 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.450
 the temperature is from an ideal six s 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.330
 half thousand kelvin no more than 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.730
 200 kemer gamma curves except 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.920
 blue curve have the correct shape and 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.259
 are located where necessary and with 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.009
 color accuracy everything is good in 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.640
 general miracle 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.640
 they are tnk 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.420
 with such good initial conditions 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.640
 hardware calibration which we 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.160
 we carry out with the help of the calorimeter x white 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.950
 And Ivan display held much give simply 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.050
 could not calibrated monitor a little 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.060
 loses brightness and contrast but 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.160
 gamma blue curve finally gets on 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.140
 its place and accuracy is the transfer 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.410
 rises to the level of professional 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.410
 displays 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.260
 competitors at the monitor one or two and miscalculate 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.690
 one by one display cases and samsung 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.160
 based on how much we understand on that 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.750
 same type of matrix 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.240
 but competitors don't pay as much 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.410
 attention and and settings so the picture 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.540
 jesus is nicer 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.300
 it justifies it somewhat more 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.550
 high price in general if you want to be on 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.100
 the cutting edge of progress and look towards 4k 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.460
 displays is nothing better than visas to 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.880
 be 287 kb for a reasonable amount yet 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.880
 to find
