00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:27.300 
as it says in a measure that bottom
there<00:02:19.959> station<00:02:20.860> 2<00:02:21.959> 23<00:02:22.959> is<00:02:23.670> 44<00:02:24.840> 45<00:02:25.840> I<00:02:26.260> was<00:02:26.500> 41<00:02:27.040> and

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
there station 2 23 is 44 45 I was 41 and

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.670 
there station 2 23 is 44 45 I was 41 and
any<00:02:28.030> other<00:02:28.239> stations<00:02:28.629> as<00:02:28.810> 60<00:02:30.390> if<00:02:31.390> you<00:02:32.319> look<00:02:32.470> at

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
any other stations as 60 if you look at

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.420 
any other stations as 60 if you look at
the<00:02:32.890> command<00:02:33.099> blocks<00:02:34.260> these<00:02:35.260> are<00:02:35.799> the<00:02:36.040> tests

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
the command blocks these are the tests

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.309 
the command blocks these are the tests
for<00:02:36.670> commands<00:02:37.030> that<00:02:37.360> are<00:02:37.420> hard<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.930> other<00:02:38.110> day

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
for commands that are hard the other day

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.130 
for commands that are hard the other day
so<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:38.680> test<00:02:39.069> for<00:02:39.340> for<00:02:39.730> a<00:02:39.970> player<00:02:40.360> with<00:02:40.720> a<00:02:40.810> radius

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
so a test for for a player with a radius

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.160 
so a test for for a player with a radius
of<00:02:41.290> 5<00:02:41.879> however<00:02:42.879> instead<00:02:43.180> of<00:02:43.299> checking<00:02:43.599> minimum

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
of 5 however instead of checking minimum

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.949 
of 5 however instead of checking minimum
and<00:02:44.379> maximum<00:02:44.440> levels<00:02:45.340> is<00:02:46.120> checking<00:02:46.569> one<00:02:46.840> of

the score values as it all known our

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.870 
the score values as it all known our

as destination and with a minimum level
of<00:02:54.850> 10<00:02:55.209> and<00:02:55.450> then<00:02:56.200> score<00:02:56.680> destination<00:02:57.549> which

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
of 10 and then score destination which

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.039 
of 10 and then score destination which
gives<00:02:58.209> it<00:02:58.299> the<00:02:58.420> maximum<00:02:58.840> level<00:02:59.109> of<00:02:59.260> 10<00:02:59.530> as<00:02:59.739> well

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
gives it the maximum level of 10 as well

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.660 
gives it the maximum level of 10 as well
if<00:03:02.049> you<00:03:02.290> fit<00:03:02.440> within<00:03:02.680> them<00:03:02.889> this<00:03:03.069> will<00:03:03.340> output
