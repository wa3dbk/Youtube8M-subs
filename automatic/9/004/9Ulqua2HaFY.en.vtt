00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:32.490 
the moment is weird and map can use a

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.940 
the moment is weird and map can use a
made<00:07:32.730> it<00:07:32.910> truly<00:07:33.270> is<00:07:33.360> in<00:07:33.480> their<00:07:33.660> end<00:07:33.870> map<00:07:34.800> is

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:34.950 
made it truly is in their end map is

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.680 
made it truly is in their end map is
blank<00:07:35.280> so<00:07:36.150> yeah<00:07:36.990> go<00:07:37.320> try<00:07:37.590> out<00:07:37.620> the<00:07:37.830> end<00:07:38.040> in

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:38.690 
blank so yeah go try out the end in

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:42.980 
blank so yeah go try out the end in
