00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
think he's been so influential to west

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.830 
think he's been so influential to west
and<00:03:05.579> the<00:03:05.730> season<00:03:06.000> he's<00:03:06.120> just<00:03:06.269> been<00:03:06.419> such<00:03:06.659> a

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
and the season he's just been such a

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.379 
and the season he's just been such a
brilliant<00:03:07.560> player<00:03:08.010> in<00:03:08.310> that<00:03:08.370> midfield<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.329> I

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
brilliant player in that midfield and I

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.080 
brilliant player in that midfield and I
do<00:03:09.450> think<00:03:09.750> it<00:03:09.930> is<00:03:09.959> as<00:03:10.169> an<00:03:10.379> upgrade<00:03:10.859> to<00:03:11.159> an<00:03:11.579> 81

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
do think it is as an upgrade to an 81

an<00:03:16.139> upgrade<00:03:16.290> i<00:03:16.500> think<00:03:16.709> i'd<00:03:16.799> be<00:03:16.889> really<00:03:17.489> really

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760

but<00:03:32.069> that<00:03:32.189> would<00:03:32.310> be<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.729> really<00:03:33.389> good<00:03:33.750> card<00:03:34.079> and

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
but that would be a really good card and

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.199 
but that would be a really good card and
a<00:03:34.379> hope<00:03:34.650> i<00:03:35.040> really<00:03:35.340> hope<00:03:35.609> they<00:03:35.909> did<00:03:36.060> get

a hope i really hope they did get

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.050 
a hope i really hope they did get

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
upgraded to a rare card because when the

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.969 
upgraded to a rare card because when the
Gold's<00:03:39.419> non<00:03:39.599> rare<00:03:39.810> you<00:03:39.930> kind<00:03:40.169> of<00:03:40.260> disregard<00:03:40.859> it

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:40.979 
Gold's non rare you kind of disregard it

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:43.580 
Gold's non rare you kind of disregard it
a<00:03:41.040> bit<00:03:41.250> and<00:03:41.280> I<00:03:41.609> think<00:03:42.180> it'd<00:03:42.359> be<00:03:42.389> a<00:03:42.780> very<00:03:43.259> very

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
a bit and I think it'd be a very very

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.979 
a bit and I think it'd be a very very
appealing<00:03:44.159> Center<00:03:44.759> defensive<00:03:45.180> mid<00:03:45.359> for

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
appealing Center defensive mid for

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.979 
appealing Center defensive mid for
people<00:03:46.409> have<00:03:46.650> BPL<00:03:47.189> teams<00:03:47.489> on<00:03:47.849> older<00:03:48.540> team<00:03:48.750> and

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
people have BPL teams on older team and

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.960 
people have BPL teams on older team and
generally<00:03:49.709> hybrids<00:03:50.159> as<00:03:50.280> well<00:03:50.430> it'd<00:03:50.579> be<00:03:50.729> pretty

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
generally hybrids as well it'd be pretty

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.140 
generally hybrids as well it'd be pretty
cool<00:03:51.180> I<00:03:51.509> think<00:03:51.810> he<00:03:52.019> is<00:03:52.229> definitely<00:03:53.150> deserved

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150
