00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:10.600
 find out all the information about your system 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:14.110
 to find out it is not necessary to download 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.060
 no unnecessary programs litter 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.340
 computers 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.290
 I read a lot of questions video to 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.430
 Sorry like me I have not found on 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:27.699
 a new one is perishing can die 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:31.680
 English-speaking but it 's somehow unpleasant 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:33.950
 convenient to watch so we go to start 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.950
 everything 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.230
 standard 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.720
 then down the service 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.989
 and here we open and information about your 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.989
 system 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.220
 and all your system will be described here all 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.230
 what 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.970
 that's all in your computer here 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.910
 driver described 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:02.320
 I'm teero everything is described here for example 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:04.530
 what theater intel core processor 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.559
 platinum 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.559
 at 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.070
 that is, no requested very wrong 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:19.280
 intel pentium dual circuit 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:22.460
 you are 233 71 73 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.030
 come on 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.480
 I have 2 logical processes 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.970
 right here 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.270
 hardware resources and subcategories all 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.340
 what you need 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.969
 chewing memory here is the output all you need 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.429
 still there is some keyboard decrees 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:45.210
 device ports are not about you, everything is there 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:47.340
 and that he is a software environment here drivers 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.939
 for example, it probably depends on me now 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.020
 because he was already hanging out okay so 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.929

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:10.829
 I have a very powerful computer 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:13.560
