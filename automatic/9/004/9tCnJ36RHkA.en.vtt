00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
up on top of this bus faster than being

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.400 
up on top of this bus faster than being

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
important because they can get up on top

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:47.810 
important because they can get up on top
of<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:46.829> bus<00:00:47.070> but<00:00:47.280> they<00:00:47.370> have<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.670> go<00:00:47.760> to

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
of that bus but they have to go to

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.369 
of that bus but they have to go to
certain<00:00:48.120> spot<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.539> be<00:00:48.600> able<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.809> jump<00:00:49.110> up<00:00:49.230> on

certain spot to be able to jump up on

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.170 
certain spot to be able to jump up on
top<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:49.829> bus<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.579> makes<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:50.910> such<00:00:51.149> a

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
top of this bus that makes it such a

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.430 
top of this bus that makes it such a
good<00:00:51.390> strategy<00:00:51.570> because<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.140> get<00:00:52.289> up<00:00:52.410> there

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
good strategy because you get up there

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.830 
good strategy because you get up there
no<00:00:52.770> problem<00:00:53.250> any<00:00:53.640> angle<00:00:54.180> no<00:00:54.360> matter<00:00:54.539> what

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
no problem any angle no matter what

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.540 
no problem any angle no matter what
where's<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.620> zombies<00:00:55.949> they<00:00:55.980> have<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.340> get<00:00:56.460> it

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
where's the zombies they have to get it

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.099 
where's the zombies they have to get it
from<00:00:56.579> certain<00:00:57.030> spots<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.420> they<00:00:57.539> do<00:00:57.600> slow<00:00:57.899> down

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
from certain spots so they do slow down

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.779 
from certain spots so they do slow down
and<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.620> definitely<00:00:58.770> makes<00:00:59.010> them<00:00:59.190> pull<00:00:59.430> up<00:00:59.609> in

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
and it definitely makes them pull up in

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.760 
and it definitely makes them pull up in
one<00:01:00.000> spot<00:01:00.239> below<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:00.960> explosive<00:01:01.379> weapon

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
one spot below you so explosive weapon

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.590 
one spot below you so explosive weapon
like<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.010> mayhem<00:01:02.399> or<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:03.120> know<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.420> because

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
like the mayhem or you know that because

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.390 
like the mayhem or you know that because
it<00:01:04.019> cut<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.379> cauterizer<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:05.040> also<00:01:05.280> really

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
it cut the cauterizer is also really

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.730 
it cut the cauterizer is also really
good<00:01:05.489> because<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.880> its<00:01:06.000> credibility<00:01:06.740> anything

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
good because of its credibility anything

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.649 
good because of its credibility anything
with<00:01:07.920> like<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.250> single<00:01:08.760> shot<00:01:09.060> really<00:01:09.479> good

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
with like the single shot really good

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.480 
with like the single shot really good
like<00:01:09.840> our<00:01:09.990> w7<00:01:10.650> sniper<00:01:10.920> rifle<00:01:11.220> all<00:01:11.369> these

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
like our w7 sniper rifle all these

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.160 
like our w7 sniper rifle all these
things<00:01:11.670> are<00:01:11.760> actually<00:01:11.880> pretty<00:01:12.090> good<00:01:12.299> for<00:01:12.659> this

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
things are actually pretty good for this

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.050 
things are actually pretty good for this
thing<00:01:13.380> just<00:01:13.650> in<00:01:14.130> general<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.670> automatic

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
thing just in general the automatic

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.280 
thing just in general the automatic
weapons<00:01:15.299> are<00:01:15.420> not<00:01:15.509> really<00:01:15.689> great<00:01:16.020> because

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
weapons are not really great because

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
weapons are not really great because
you're<00:01:16.409> not<00:01:16.530> going<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.799> our<00:01:16.860> straight<00:01:17.130> line

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
you're not going in our straight line

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.380 
you're not going in our straight line
you<00:01:17.490> are<00:01:17.580> getting<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.880> lot<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.150> vertical

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
you are getting a lot of vertical

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.359 
you are getting a lot of vertical
distance<00:01:18.900> shotguns<00:01:19.799> are<00:01:19.860> also<00:01:20.009> really<00:01:20.220> good

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
distance shotguns are also really good

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.310 
distance shotguns are also really good
for<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.610> strategy<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:21.869> just<00:01:22.049> general

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
for the strategy this is just general

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.570 
for the strategy this is just general
for<00:01:22.439> killing<00:01:22.650> but<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.830> can<00:01:22.950> basically<00:01:23.100> just

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
for killing but you can basically just

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.190 
for killing but you can basically just
do<00:01:23.729> anything<00:01:24.150> what<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.330> recommend<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.840> getting

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
have to do is keep training them up you

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.400 
have to do is keep training them up you
get<00:02:35.000> a<00:02:35.030> good<00:02:35.240> amount<00:02:35.360> of<00:02:35.540> zombies<00:02:35.840> like<00:02:35.990> 30<00:02:36.260> or

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
get a good amount of zombies like 30 or

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.600 
get a good amount of zombies like 30 or
so<00:02:36.500> zombies<00:02:36.860> then<00:02:36.950> you<00:02:37.070> can<00:02:37.190> just<00:02:37.310> launch<00:02:37.460> a

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
so zombies then you can just launch a

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.760 
so zombies then you can just launch a
rocket<00:02:37.730> or<00:02:38.120> just<00:02:38.540> continue<00:02:38.870> firing<00:02:39.500> on<00:02:39.680> them

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
rocket or just continue firing on them

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:40.960 
rocket or just continue firing on them
what<00:02:39.950> i<00:02:39.980> recommend<00:02:40.130> obviously<00:02:40.640> having<00:02:40.880> the

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
what i recommend obviously having the

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.670 
what i recommend obviously having the
mayhem<00:02:41.240> automatic<00:02:41.870> weapon<00:02:42.110> four<00:02:42.230> points<00:02:42.500> and

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
mayhem automatic weapon four points and

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.050 
mayhem automatic weapon four points and
just<00:02:43.010> keep<00:02:43.130> going<00:02:43.340> around<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:43.580> circle<00:02:43.730> it

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
just keep going around the circle it

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.340 
just keep going around the circle it
might<00:02:44.209> be<00:02:44.300> even<00:02:44.420> worth<00:02:44.780> it<00:02:44.959> to<00:02:45.110> buy<00:02:45.290> the

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
might be even worth it to buy the

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.710 
might be even worth it to buy the
bulldog<00:02:45.800> off<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.340> wall<00:02:46.700> keep<00:02:47.060> upgrading<00:02:47.300> that

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
bulldog off the wall keep upgrading that

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.270 
bulldog off the wall keep upgrading that
and<00:02:47.930> you<00:02:48.170> can<00:02:48.320> get<00:02:48.410> tons<00:02:48.650> and<00:02:48.830> tons<00:02:48.890> of<00:02:49.010> points

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
and you can get tons and tons of points

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.500 
and you can get tons and tons of points
because<00:02:49.430> shotguns<00:02:49.790> actually<00:02:50.090> really<00:02:50.420> really

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
because shotguns actually really really

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.270 
because shotguns actually really really
good<00:02:50.720> at<00:02:50.780> strategy<00:02:50.959> in<00:02:51.620> fact<00:02:51.800> that<00:02:51.950> is<00:02:52.070> what<00:02:52.250> i

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
good at strategy in fact that is what i

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.980 
good at strategy in fact that is what i
do<00:02:52.400> recommend<00:02:52.730> is<00:02:53.120> getting<00:02:53.360> that<00:02:53.420> Bulldog<00:02:53.810> off

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
do recommend is getting that Bulldog off

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.720 
do recommend is getting that Bulldog off
the<00:02:54.110> wall<00:02:54.290> it's<00:02:54.680> not<00:02:54.860> the<00:02:54.980> best<00:02:55.190> weapon<00:02:55.580> in<00:02:55.670> the

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
the wall it's not the best weapon in the

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.400 
the wall it's not the best weapon in the
game<00:02:55.850> but<00:02:56.060> it<00:02:56.450> is<00:02:56.600> very<00:02:56.720> effective<00:02:57.260> and<00:02:57.320> you

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
game but it is very effective and you

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.840 
game but it is very effective and you
can<00:02:57.530> buy<00:02:57.620> it<00:02:57.680> off<00:02:57.800> the<00:02:57.830> wall<00:02:58.010> very<00:02:58.400> very<00:02:58.640> cheap

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
can buy it off the wall very very cheap

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.340 
can buy it off the wall very very cheap
so<00:02:58.910> i<00:02:59.120> definitely<00:02:59.390> recommend<00:02:59.660> it<00:03:00.020> there<00:03:00.230> is<00:03:00.320> a

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
so i definitely recommend it there is a

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.810 
so i definitely recommend it there is a
kind<00:03:00.590> of<00:03:00.680> like<00:03:00.800> a<00:03:00.830> sub<00:03:01.190> strategy<00:03:01.580> to<00:03:01.700> this

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
kind of like a sub strategy to this

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.400 
kind of like a sub strategy to this
where<00:03:01.970> you<00:03:02.060> walk<00:03:02.240> into<00:03:02.450> that<00:03:02.540> big<00:03:02.810> circle<00:03:03.260> room

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
where you walk into that big circle room

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.110 
where you walk into that big circle room
you<00:03:03.770> know<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:03.980> room<00:03:04.430> just<00:03:04.610> to<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.790> left<00:03:04.850> side

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
you know the room just to the left side

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.520 
you know the room just to the left side
there's<00:03:05.390> that<00:03:05.510> circle<00:03:05.840> area<00:03:06.050> that's<00:03:06.260> also<00:03:06.500> a

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
there's that circle area that's also a

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.530 
there's that circle area that's also a
really<00:03:06.770> good<00:03:06.860> area<00:03:07.100> and<00:03:07.790> a<00:03:08.000> lot<00:03:08.300> of<00:03:08.330> good

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
really good area and a lot of good

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.699 
really good area and a lot of good
things<00:03:08.630> about<00:03:08.810> that<00:03:09.110> where<00:03:09.320> I<00:03:09.350> can't<00:03:09.590> just

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
things about that where I can't just

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.110 
things about that where I can't just
going<00:03:09.890> back<00:03:10.010> and<00:03:10.070> forth<00:03:10.400> between<00:03:10.550> those<00:03:10.820> areas

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
going back and forth between those areas

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.000 
going back and forth between those areas
when<00:03:11.690> I<00:03:11.720> do<00:03:11.810> get<00:03:12.020> caught<00:03:12.290> on<00:03:12.440> something<00:03:12.680> so

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
when I do get caught on something so

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.290 
when I do get caught on something so
it's<00:03:13.310> pretty<00:03:13.519> cool<00:03:13.610> you<00:03:13.670> have<00:03:13.820> a<00:03:13.880> good<00:03:14.030> area

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
it's pretty cool you have a good area

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.729 
it's pretty cool you have a good area
next<00:03:14.450> to<00:03:14.570> this<00:03:14.690> area<00:03:14.900> don't<00:03:15.140> get<00:03:15.260> trapped<00:03:15.530> in

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
next to this area don't get trapped in

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.920 
next to this area don't get trapped in
fact<00:03:16.040> I<00:03:16.190> often<00:03:16.430> use<00:03:16.880> this<00:03:17.150> area<00:03:17.420> right<00:03:17.870> here

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
fact I often use this area right here

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.630 
fact I often use this area right here
too<00:03:18.380> for<00:03:18.530> you<00:03:18.650> my<00:03:18.769> shooting<00:03:19.250> alley<00:03:19.400> so<00:03:19.610> I

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
too for you my shooting alley so I

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.830 
too for you my shooting alley so I
collect<00:03:19.910> a<00:03:19.970> bunch<00:03:20.090> of<00:03:20.269> zombies<00:03:20.420> who<00:03:20.660> have<00:03:20.780> an

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
collect a bunch of zombies who have an

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.750 
collect a bunch of zombies who have an
automatic<00:03:21.080> weapon<00:03:21.590> I<00:03:21.739> collect<00:03:22.280> them<00:03:22.400> up<00:03:22.550> go

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
automatic weapon I collect them up go

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.580 
automatic weapon I collect them up go
towards<00:03:23.090> that<00:03:23.239> circle<00:03:23.600> room<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:23.989> I<00:03:24.050> usually

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
towards that circle room and I usually

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.140 
towards that circle room and I usually
don't<00:03:24.739> have<00:03:24.950> any<00:03:25.160> zombie<00:03:25.489> spawning<00:03:25.730> behind<00:03:26.030> me

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
don't have any zombie spawning behind me

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.090 
don't have any zombie spawning behind me
I<00:03:26.180> can<00:03:26.390> use<00:03:26.510> that<00:03:26.540> as<00:03:26.750> a<00:03:26.780> really<00:03:27.230> nice<00:03:27.380> shooting

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
I can use that as a really nice shooting

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.650 
I can use that as a really nice shooting
Lane<00:03:28.280> where<00:03:28.459> I<00:03:28.489> can<00:03:28.610> shoot<00:03:28.730> them<00:03:28.910> all<00:03:29.090> down<00:03:29.120> and

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
Lane where I can shoot them all down and

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.360 
Lane where I can shoot them all down and
then<00:03:29.750> go<00:03:29.900> back<00:03:29.930> into<00:03:30.110> the<00:03:30.500> area<00:03:30.530> with<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.130> bus

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
then go back into the area with the bus

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.770 
then go back into the area with the bus
so<00:03:31.970> if<00:03:32.060> you<00:03:32.120> guys<00:03:32.209> want<00:03:32.420> to<00:03:32.480> get<00:03:32.570> a<00:03:32.600> lot<00:03:32.750> of

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
so if you guys want to get a lot of

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.330 
so if you guys want to get a lot of
points<00:03:33.110> and<00:03:33.260> shoot<00:03:33.620> off<00:03:33.709> your<00:03:33.739> zombies<00:03:34.250> and

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
your automatic weapons that is the

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:36.970 
your automatic weapons that is the
strategy<00:03:35.510> to<00:03:35.840> do<00:03:35.959> it<00:03:36.080> one<00:03:36.530> more<00:03:36.560> thing<00:03:36.890> I

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
strategy to do it one more thing I

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.110 
strategy to do it one more thing I
wanted<00:03:37.160> to<00:03:37.250> know<00:03:37.310> is<00:03:37.519> that<00:03:37.550> you<00:03:37.700> also<00:03:37.850> get<00:03:38.060> a

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
wanted to know is that you also get a

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.030 
wanted to know is that you also get a
bunch<00:03:38.330> of<00:03:38.450> orbitals<00:03:38.989> here<00:03:39.200> on<00:03:39.380> there's<00:03:39.769> two

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
bunch of orbitals here on there's two

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.500 
bunch of orbitals here on there's two
spots<00:03:40.130> where<00:03:40.340> the<00:03:40.489> orbit<00:03:40.700> orbital<00:03:41.209> things<00:03:41.360> can

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
spots where the orbit orbital things can

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.560 
spots where the orbit orbital things can
spawn<00:03:41.780> either<00:03:42.110> in<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:42.530> XO's<00:03:43.090> wear<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.209> suit

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
spawn either in the XO's wear the suit
