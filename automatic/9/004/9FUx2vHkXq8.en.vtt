00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:44.409
 operating environment is well adapted to 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:47.380
 table users then we also have the back 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:51.499

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:55.999

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:58.759
 ok and we also have a standard start menu 

00:01:55.999 --> 00:02:02.090
 windows 8 here then we will 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:04.969
 stay on the taskbar with the 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.869
 right on properties and then we 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:12.080
 we will click on the start menu and we will 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:17.840

 some changes, no icon on the icons 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:50.540
 that they are well adapted there with the new 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:53.510
 and interface and that's it guys so 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:58.390
 we can also see that the elite that 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:02.510
 microsoft added a new 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:06.860
 multiple areas of work, we can 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:10.190
 Click here standing is the one that saw 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.030
 and here you can add an area of 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.810
 job 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:19.730
 Okay so you can see is to press the 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:28.280
 alte button and tab 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:32.390

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:36.200
 pressing the pt is the qom button in 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:39.739
 Douz knows you can see the areas of 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:43.959
 works that were created here then 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:49.790
 This option is very cool there for who wants 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:54.530
 that works with a monitor or several 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:57.590
 monitors and do not like doing this 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.860
 loaded from multiple files in the 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:04.340
 many other things ok then you are 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:07.880
 changes were good and that's it 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:12.170
 so guys it's about the shutdown 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.519
 the option to hang up here and 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:18.019
 only you click here 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:21.640
 In this case, I choose and turn it off, so it's a 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:25.400
 trial version may still occur 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:29.759
 various changes and many other 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.870
 then on issues that we will see 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:35.310
 with time 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:37.800
 I have not yet been told an official date of the 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:42.449
 launch in is and was not confirmed 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:45.210
 nothing ok then this was a first 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:48.990
 analysis then we will do many 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.550
 other more complete analysis and there is ok 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.610
