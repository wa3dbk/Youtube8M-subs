00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
okay so you've probably seen my ipad2

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.190 
okay so you've probably seen my ipad2
embossing<00:00:08.940> at<00:00:09.210> this<00:00:09.360> point<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:09.750> i<00:00:09.809> figured

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
embossing at this point and i figured

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.169 
embossing at this point and i figured
i'd<00:00:10.320> make<00:00:10.440> this<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:10.830> short<00:00:11.130> separate<00:00:11.639> video<00:00:11.880> a

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
i'd make this a short separate video a

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.610 
i'd make this a short separate video a
little<00:00:12.450> bit<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.719> bonus<00:00:13.170> i<00:00:13.290> guess<00:00:13.440> you<00:00:13.530> could

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
little bit of a bonus i guess you could

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.279 
little bit of a bonus i guess you could
say<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.070> this<00:00:14.639> is<00:00:14.790> an<00:00:14.880> unboxing<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.870> Smart

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
say and this is an unboxing of the Smart

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.920 
say and this is an unboxing of the Smart
Cover<00:00:16.560> so<00:00:17.190> which<00:00:17.369> color<00:00:17.609> did<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:17.910> get<00:00:18.119> well

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
Cover so which color did I get well

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.420 
Cover so which color did I get well
you'll<00:00:19.140> have<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.470> wait<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.740> see<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:19.980> find<00:00:20.160> out

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
you'll have to wait and see to find out

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.670 
you'll have to wait and see to find out
so<00:00:21.029> let's<00:00:21.600> get<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.840> tab<00:00:22.020> open<00:00:22.320> on<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.500> back

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
so let's get the tab open on the back

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.480 
so let's get the tab open on the back
here<00:00:23.449> now<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.480> don't<00:00:24.720> really<00:00:25.080> get<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:26.099> big<00:00:26.279> deal

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
here now I don't really get the big deal

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.509 
here now I don't really get the big deal
about<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:27.019> but<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.410> figured<00:00:28.920> I'd<00:00:29.010> get<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.220> anyway

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
about it but I figured I'd get it anyway

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.370 
about it but I figured I'd get it anyway
because<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:30.000> seems<00:00:30.269> nifty<00:00:30.840> enough<00:00:31.109> but<00:00:31.320> I'm

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
because it seems nifty enough but I'm

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.920 
because it seems nifty enough but I'm
still<00:00:31.560> gonna<00:00:31.650> definitely<00:00:31.890> need<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.130> new<00:00:32.489> case

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
still gonna definitely need a new case

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.729 
still gonna definitely need a new case
so<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:33.960> don't<00:00:34.050> know<00:00:34.140> if<00:00:34.320> I'm<00:00:34.410> actually<00:00:34.530> gonna

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
so I don't know if I'm actually gonna

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.340 
so I don't know if I'm actually gonna
end<00:00:34.860> up<00:00:34.920> using<00:00:35.100> this<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:36.450> got<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.020> green

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
end up using this and I got the green

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.869 
end up using this and I got the green
one<00:00:37.559> because<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:37.890> think<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.550> going<00:00:38.700> to

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
one because I think this is going to

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.150 
one because I think this is going to
look<00:00:39.030> awesome<00:00:39.239> on<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.960> white<00:00:40.200> so<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.129> big

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
look awesome on the white so the big

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.610 
look awesome on the white so the big
deal<00:00:41.550> with<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:43.079> there's<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.410> ton<00:00:43.590> of

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
deal with this is that there's a ton of

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.529 
deal with this is that there's a ton of
magnets<00:00:44.100> inside<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.879> just<00:00:45.210> auto

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
magnets inside of this that just auto

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.139 
magnets inside of this that just auto
lock<00:00:46.410> onto<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.010> ipad<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.579> have<00:00:47.730> plastic<00:00:48.090> on

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
lock onto the ipad I have plastic on

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.139 
lock onto the ipad I have plastic on
mine<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:48.510> let's<00:00:48.780> see<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.620> should<00:00:50.100> Hey<00:00:50.879> look<00:00:50.910> at

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
mine so let's see it should Hey look at

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.209 
mine so let's see it should Hey look at
that<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.420> didn't<00:00:51.600> go<00:00:51.660> on<00:00:51.780> correctly<00:00:52.170> there<00:00:53.070> it

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
that it didn't go on correctly there it

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.330 
that it didn't go on correctly there it
is<00:00:53.390> okay<00:00:54.390> it's<00:00:54.960> not<00:00:55.079> exactly<00:00:55.320> perfect<00:00:56.160> i'm

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
is okay it's not exactly perfect i'm

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.770 
is okay it's not exactly perfect i'm
guessing<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.210> may<00:00:57.360> be<00:00:57.420> because<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.690> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
guessing that may be because of the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.540 
guessing that may be because of the
plastic<00:00:58.140> i<00:00:58.230> have<00:00:58.379> on<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.190> cover<00:00:59.430> is

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
plastic i have on it the cover is

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.799 
plastic i have on it the cover is
interesting<00:01:00.120> because<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.570> few

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
interesting because it is a few

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.389 
interesting because it is a few
different<00:01:00.899> things<00:01:01.140> first<00:01:01.590> off<00:01:01.770> its<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.039> stand

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
different things first off its a stand

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.469 
different things first off its a stand
so<00:01:03.500> you<00:01:04.500> flip<00:01:04.830> this<00:01:04.979> over<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.460> few<00:01:05.700> times<00:01:05.760> and

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
so you flip this over a few times and

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.480 
so you flip this over a few times and
then<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.840> can<00:01:07.049> use<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.799> landscape<00:01:08.159> mode

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
then you can use it in landscape mode

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.929 
then you can use it in landscape mode
this<00:01:09.150> way<00:01:09.450> or<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.530> can<00:01:10.680> also<00:01:10.920> flip<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.760> up

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
this way or you can also flip it up

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.000 
this way or you can also flip it up
right<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.540> can<00:01:12.630> go<00:01:12.750> landscape<00:01:13.200> mode<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.799> way

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
right so can go landscape mode this way

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.850 
right so can go landscape mode this way
and<00:01:14.479> on<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.630> hinges<00:01:16.049> there's<00:01:16.409> little<00:01:16.680> pieces

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
and on the hinges there's little pieces

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.320 
and on the hinges there's little pieces
here<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.340> doesn't<00:01:17.580> scratch<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:18.030> metal

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
here so it doesn't scratch the metal

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.390 
here so it doesn't scratch the metal
which<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.600> really<00:01:18.930> good<00:01:19.110> thinking<00:01:19.619> now<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
which is really good thinking now on the

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.630 
which is really good thinking now on the
bottom<00:01:20.729> here<00:01:21.030> flip<00:01:21.869> side<00:01:22.080> there<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.640> micro

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
bottom here flip side there is micro

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.460 
bottom here flip side there is micro
linen<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.479> supposed<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.840> clean<00:01:25.290> off

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
linen and this is supposed to clean off

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.690 
linen and this is supposed to clean off
the<00:01:25.650> screen<00:01:25.950> I'll<00:01:26.159> see<00:01:26.280> how<00:01:26.400> all<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.580> works

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
the screen I'll see how all that works

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.789 
the screen I'll see how all that works
in<00:01:26.880> testing<00:01:27.270> then<00:01:27.780> over<00:01:28.020> here<00:01:28.170> there's<00:01:28.740> a

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
in testing then over here there's a

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.069 
in testing then over here there's a
magnet<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.340> connects<00:01:30.119> with<00:01:30.180> another<00:01:30.540> magnet

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
magnet that connects with another magnet

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.530 
magnet that connects with another magnet
on<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.409> side<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:32.040> ipad<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:33.090> what<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.329> does

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
on the side of the ipad and what it does

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.469 
on the side of the ipad and what it does
is<00:01:34.220> turns<00:01:35.220> off<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.520> screen<00:01:35.790> automatically

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
is turns off the screen automatically

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.450 
is turns off the screen automatically
once<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:37.049> closes<00:01:37.439> down<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:38.100> that's<00:01:38.220> pretty

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
once that closes down so that's pretty

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.760 
once that closes down so that's pretty
cool<00:01:38.549> then<00:01:39.450> it'll<00:01:39.930> go<00:01:39.960> all<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.409> way<00:01:40.439> along<00:01:40.590> the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
cool then it'll go all the way along the

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.130 
cool then it'll go all the way along the
back<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.670> stays<00:01:41.700> there<00:01:42.210> pretty<00:01:42.659> good<00:01:42.869> it

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
back and it stays there pretty good it

pretty strong I'm kind of scared to do

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.420 
pretty strong I'm kind of scared to do
this<00:01:49.409> right<00:01:49.680> now<00:01:49.710> I'm<00:01:49.950> going<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.159> show<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.340> how

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.100 
this right now I'm going to show you how
strong<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.270> can<00:01:51.479> hold<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.840> weight<00:01:51.899> of

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
strong it is it can hold the weight of

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.010 
strong it is it can hold the weight of
the<00:01:52.170> ipad<00:01:52.530> no<00:01:53.130> problem<00:01:54.090> now<00:01:54.600> this<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.990> the

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
the ipad no problem now this is the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.929 
the ipad no problem now this is the
polycarbonate<00:01:55.860> version<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.759> goes<00:01:56.850> from

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
polycarbonate version and it goes from

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.149 
polycarbonate version and it goes from
about<00:01:57.060> 40<00:01:57.450> bucks<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.960> think<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.740> seems<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.040> little

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
about 40 bucks I think it seems a little

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.190 
about 40 bucks I think it seems a little
overpriced<00:01:59.610> for<00:01:59.850> what<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.119> actually<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.630> and

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
overpriced for what it actually is and

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.480 
overpriced for what it actually is and
the<00:02:01.500> leather<00:02:01.680> version<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:02.130> think<00:02:02.280> goes<00:02:02.399> for

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
the leather version I think goes for

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.399 
the leather version I think goes for
about<00:02:02.549> thirty<00:02:02.939> dollars<00:02:03.270> more<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:04.079> this<00:02:04.259> is

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
about thirty dollars more so this is

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.649 
about thirty dollars more so this is
definitely<00:02:04.590> sort<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.399> luxury<00:02:05.759> add<00:02:06.180> onto<00:02:06.420> an

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659
