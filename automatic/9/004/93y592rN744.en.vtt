00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.500
 greet you friends in this video i 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.290
 I will tell about the next power of strategy 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.630
 this will be a tennis strategy given 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.450
 I see the strategy of trying to sell 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.980
 on the Internet and ask for it 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:26.900
 not less than 15,000 rubles so 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.900
 open live bets are loaded 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:36.930
 choose tennis and we start 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:40.440
 view all bets are looking for all matches 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.020
 score 40 40 before we found the score 4040 we 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.500
 we bet that this game will 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:50.870
 break that is 11 game ep2 that is 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.370
 The server will lose this game average 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:58.170
 odds on such an outcome will be in 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.719
 around two and a half sometimes I did 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.780
 a break bet when we were filing 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:08.340
 score more or shipyard cent at all 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.619
 it comes to 5 sometimes it even reaches 7 and 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.189
 I will say that such factors are not rare 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:19.140
 bets are made equal to fleets 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:23.009
 amounts to five or ten openings 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.080
 percent of the bank I bet on this 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.619
 strategies on your main worker 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.600
 network and average it turns out that if 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.360
 put five percent of the bank 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.750
 somewhere through what settings you get 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:41.400
 one hundred percent bank again this is what 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:44.790
 the average result is now talk 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.200
 what kind of match should be put best 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:52.439
 this strategy works on those tournaments and 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.829
 play little experience on young tennis players 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:59.100
 tennis players who worry 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.409
 i start to lose commit a lot not 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.109
 forced errors 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.700
 need to take a match and where are the tennis players 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:11.549
 weak feed ideally of course bad 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.590
 Women's IT tournaments various 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:16.110
 challenger and fallen 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.950
 in no case recommended 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:24.090
 tournaments there oh now 500 masters and those 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:28.260
 more there big slam tournaments in general 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:31.290
 Here is another strategy 15,000 rubles 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.500
 This strategy and completely nailed those not 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:38.569
 less generally earn on betting 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.569
 good luck everyone all bye
