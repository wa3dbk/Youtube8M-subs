 consider that it will improve the mobility of citizens while 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.010
 will increase the modernity of the railway infrastructures of the country 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.450
 and its international prestige 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.860
 with this work 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.200
 it has already been said 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.430
 and with the line 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.860
 madrid valencia 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.860
 that next Saturday inaugurate their majesties the kings 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.300
 Spain is confirmed 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.100
 as the country of europe with the most extensive network 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.900
 Of high speed 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.350
 a reality that puts us in the first division 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.630
 of sophistication in modern means of transport 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.420
 that in addition to increasing the mobility and interrelation of our citizens 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.640
 reinforcement 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.870
 our territorial cohesion 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.620
 and our energy efficiency 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.190
 finally the high speed 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.370
 It gives us international prestige 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:52.730
 and power 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.310
 the brand image 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.320
 in one way 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.900
 possible 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.370
 and durán 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.700
 with an investment of 3 thousand 530 million euros 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.899
 this new infrastructure of 314 kilometers in length reduces the time 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.350
 trip from madrid to albacete between 25 and 30 minutes with a total duration 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.890
 of an hour and a half its launch will take place next Sunday day 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.060
 19 next to the new station of the bird in albacete demonstrating thus according to 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.450
 the minister of development José Blanco pointed out that the government of Spain is 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.269
 punctual with its commitments an undeniably historical inauguration that 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.540
 converts to castilla-la mancha in the first region of the country that has 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.370
 all its provincial capitals connected by line ave very few 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.150
 regions 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.559
 throughout the world they have a transport system 

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:39.359
 so advanced 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.419
 I think it can be counted 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:43.289
 with the fingers of one hand 

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:44.899
 but I also know 

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:46.639
 that are countless 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:49.709
 the federations of Castilians and Castilians 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.669
 who have had to listen 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:53.389
 the same phrase 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:55.539
 You have to be patient 

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:58.969
 for too long it was said that this earth 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:00.949
 what to expect 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:02.309
 but the future 

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:03.979
 he's waiting for us 

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:05.409
 it is built 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:07.869
 and we have to build it together 

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:08.889
 together 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:11.479
 we can continue to build the future 

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:13.219
 that is the role of your message 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:16.829
 to bring this first bird to basin 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.439
 and albacete 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:21.430
 For his part, the president of Castilla-La Mancha José María Bardada 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.550
 highlighted the progress that has been made in this region in terms of 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.220
 infrastructures until it managed to break the isolation to which it was subjected 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.000
 converting it into the best communicated autonomous community of Spain and 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.550
 with more kilometers in high-speed service across the country in 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.239
 Castilla la Mancha 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.609
 Of course we have broken the vicious circle of isolation 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:48.229
 with the inaugurations of today 80 percent of the population of castilla-la 

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:49.419
 stain 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:50.880
 it will be less 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.150
 30 minutes from an art station 

00:03:55.529 --> 00:03:59.239
 something that is really was spectacular mind 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.779
 absolutely transformer 

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:03.989
 all provincial capitals 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.249
 albacete if the real 

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:08.980
 Unusual Cuenca Guadalajara 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.739
 more puertollano 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.699
 they already have anen and in a future soul 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:15.980
 and talavera 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.609
 and the atrocities of the stain will also have 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:26.110
 a truly revolutionary situation I insist we could not 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.910
 Sound 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.069
 barely 

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:29.460
 a few years 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.229
 for the president of the community of madrid hope aguirre in the 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.680
 inauguration of this connection reveals 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.560
 the national interest to transform the mobility of Spain and to structure the 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.240
 territory in the hand of infrastructures that break the 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.569
 distances as is the case with the bird 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:47.930
 today two new capitals and incorporate at high speed 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.039
 290 kilometers of road are added to the network 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:53.590
 to those who will join 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.749
 in a few days the 140 between the leverage and the leverage 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.780
 although it is true that there is a lot of work ahead to complete the 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.279
 more than 900 kilometers of this project 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:14.900
 alicante castellón cartagena murcia and other cities of east await with 

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:20.029
 expectation the moment of joining this morning that little by little and with 

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:21.030
 a lot of effort 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.749
 it is spreading throughout Spain 

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:26.900
 this connection or mine that will open on Saturday 18 their 

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:29.270
 majjes the kings text counts up valencia 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.180
 it supposes the extension of the Spanish network of high speed in 438 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:38.810
 new kilometers to reach 2 thousand 665 a fact without a doubt important 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.780
 taking into account that it will place Spain in the second country in the world 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.370
 after china and in the first of europe in number of kilometers of 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:46.929
 high performance in service
