okay<00:04:00.130> so<00:04:01.130> downside<00:04:01.610> to<00:04:01.790> this<00:04:01.910> is<00:04:02.150> if<00:04:02.360> you<00:04:02.450> know

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
okay so downside to this is if you know

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.180 
okay so downside to this is if you know
how<00:04:02.630> to<00:04:02.720> work<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:03.020> program<00:04:03.410> you<00:04:03.650> can<00:04:03.860> kind<00:04:04.100> of

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
how to work the program you can kind of

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.370 
how to work the program you can kind of
move<00:04:04.400> your<00:04:04.640> head<00:04:04.820> around<00:04:04.850> maybe<00:04:05.840> until<00:04:06.260> it

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
move your head around maybe until it

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.320 
move your head around maybe until it
kind<00:04:06.590> of<00:04:06.740> matches<00:04:07.070> somebody's<00:04:07.490> face<00:04:07.760> so<00:04:08.300> that

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
kind of matches somebody's face so that

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.360 
kind of matches somebody's face so that
it<00:04:08.480> barely<00:04:08.840> gets<00:04:09.230> above<00:04:09.500> the<00:04:09.650> yellow<00:04:09.770> line<00:04:09.920> and

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
it barely gets above the yellow line and

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.950 
it barely gets above the yellow line and
that<00:04:10.490> it'll<00:04:10.640> lock<00:04:10.850> you<00:04:11.000> in<00:04:11.150> but<00:04:11.360> it<00:04:11.540> still<00:04:11.810> is<00:04:11.930> a

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:11.960 
that it'll lock you in but it still is a

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.420 
that it'll lock you in but it still is a
free<00:04:12.260> program<00:04:12.470> it's<00:04:12.860> really<00:04:12.920> cool<00:04:13.250> if<00:04:13.370> you

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
free program it's really cool if you

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.650 
free program it's really cool if you
guys<00:04:13.520> want<00:04:13.760> to<00:04:13.790> show<00:04:13.940> your<00:04:14.090> friends<00:04:14.480> and<00:04:14.570> I
