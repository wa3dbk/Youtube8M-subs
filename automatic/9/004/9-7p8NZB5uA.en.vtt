00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.620
 good to all the kids are less and 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.100
 welcome back on my channel with a new one 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.930
 video 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.730
 today I propose another cam strike a 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.650
 my opinion very very very beautiful a 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.090
 unlike the last one I did that 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.010
 however it remained a beautiful cream but not 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.929
 at this level because I define it 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.179
 so beautiful because then time is 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:27.560
 relatively normal on three minutes three 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:30.650
 minutes and a half the thing I liked 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.780
 of this caen and that done alone is 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.150
 now on kevin's youtube only if it is 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.700
 they see very few because it really is 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.220
 it's hard to make his ghosts anyway 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.800
 now I've been taking it lately 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.880
 hand and I'm doing quite a bit of that but 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.440
 now i'm trying to do the most 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.690
 possible in only to be able to bring you 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.010
 high quality gameplay then like 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.560
 you can see done with one in 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.960
 budget with front kick and caricatures 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.820
 increased on frates and did not play up 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.970
 I always left a screen because 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.350
 in fact the comrades did not play for 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.000
 spots and popper flags because in fact 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.400
 I was in the sun I had no companions a 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.750
 support me the rewards were support 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.030
 which I think are the most thing 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.799
 important to make a cam alone or yes 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.250
 they were the ammunition crate and know how i 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:15.350
 jackets ok the game will end with a 61 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.330
 8 however fairly good result 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.590
 but let's start immediately with the topic of 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.520
 comment on today because as mentioned 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.990
 also in the last video 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.670
 I would like to give you some comments on this 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:29.180
 existentially you do n't give up bullshit 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.010
 ok for prizes for premise i want to tell you 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.350
 what any stuff to say in this video 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.900
 it's not because I wonder a player 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.770
 strong of kodo because I consider myself a pro 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.840
 gamer 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.610
 I know I have some skills maybe 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.470
 to be able, if not, I would n't do these 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.750
 I would not like this time and games 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.270
 I don't want to pull it too hard though 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.280
 I understand that maybe some quality there 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.110
 I too, this was just a small one 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.000
 premise that I wanted to make you do not want 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.240
 I don't want to put my head up 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.010
 pumped but precisely it was a premise today 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.590
 what I will talk to you about will talk about what 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.630
 makes a player strong because he is 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.610
 strong and why I want to do this 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.490
 he comments and because lately I was 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.159
 feeling many stupid crap 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.290
 even huge huge crap though 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:15.230
 we want to tell her that way 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.659
 bad concerning call of duty ghost 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.220
 I was hearing people coming to me from me 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:21.320
 he came to me and said 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.890
 oh no but now unplayable bossa because 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.420
 I don't have headphones ok I understand 1 one 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.820
 once i came it makes me goss is 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.890
 unplayable because I don't have the hull e 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.750
 a little less 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.850
 in a while but they even come to say that 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.690
 ghost is unplayable because they don't have the 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:41.030
 armchair made as they say ergonomic 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.370
 only that is missing and precisely because 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.050
 because I play with instrumentation 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.960
 normal do not think that I play with 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.360
 who knows what the game setup may be with 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.400
 a very beautiful fabo television 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.130
 because you will also have it quite large 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.690
 also seen in the blog but I play with 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.490
 the audio point of the television is 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.270
 without headphones I have no headphones whatsoever 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:05.750
 play with the default joystick on 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.550
 xbox joystick and ps3 my 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.610
 joystick does not even have the l1 key 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.050
 so you can understand a little and why 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.640
 I say this because I want you to understand 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.050
 that to be good call players 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.420
 of duty are two things 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.010
 2 which characterize a character 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.650
 good player from a mediocre player 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.720
 the first is the undisputed experience 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.550
 because obviously you play a lot 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.530
 more experience and obviously results 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.989
 the second arrives first instead of vi 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.910
 I mean it's psychology because if you are 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.040
 part with the goal today I do the 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.630
 cream the kehm you do at least there is not 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.260
 a huge challenge that continues to die a 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.320
 20 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.390
 The Kehm do the course VABO the first 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.950
 point in the meantime which one the barrel goes the first one 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.320
 point is the experience because with that 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.880
 you can really do everything though 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.260
 the second is psychology because one 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.500
 once you know how to play you know how to move 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.690
 the keys have the high consideration of 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.040
 himself saying I am strong by that me 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.500
 I'm doing it really 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.570
 very important girls so get on 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.850
 always the ideas that are not in the lead 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.190
 setup to make a player is not the scafa 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.450
 make a player a player is made 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.220
 by itself 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.989
 so guys qualcomm entry and video 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.790
