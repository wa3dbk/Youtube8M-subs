00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.660 

dyslexia<00:00:07.080> makes<00:00:07.440> it<00:00:07.590> hard<00:00:07.830> for<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.130> brain<00:00:08.370> to

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
dyslexia makes it hard for the brain to

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.030 
dyslexia makes it hard for the brain to
recognize<00:00:08.880> a<00:00:09.210> written<00:00:09.600> word<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.139> pronounce

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
recognize a written word and pronounce

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.430 
recognize a written word and pronounce
the<00:00:11.280> way<00:00:11.400> it<00:00:11.460> sounds<00:00:11.940> as<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.059> whole<00:00:12.360> it's<00:00:13.020> almost

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
the way it sounds as a whole it's almost

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.100 
the way it sounds as a whole it's almost
as<00:00:13.740> if<00:00:13.889> each<00:00:14.190> word<00:00:15.150> is<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:17.090> process<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.750> says<00:00:18.930> if

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.110 
as if each word is a process it says if

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.560 
as if each word is a process it says if
it's<00:00:19.200> broken<00:00:19.530> down<00:00:19.950> to<00:00:20.250> its<00:00:20.400> simplest<00:00:20.970> format

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
it's broken down to its simplest format

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.269 
it's broken down to its simplest format
and<00:00:21.810> I'm<00:00:21.990> seeing<00:00:22.529> in<00:00:22.920> turn<00:00:23.910> fear<00:00:24.900> rooms<00:00:27.199> and

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
and I'm seeing in turn fear rooms and

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.370 
and I'm seeing in turn fear rooms and
the<00:00:29.279> way<00:00:29.429> some<00:00:29.490> dyslexic<00:00:30.330> brain<00:00:30.509> see<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.169> page

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
the way some dyslexic brain see the page

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.550 
the way some dyslexic brain see the page
can<00:00:32.130> make<00:00:32.369> reading<00:00:32.669> even<00:00:33.390> harder<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:34.350> any

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:34.560 
can make reading even harder so any

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.980 
can make reading even harder so any
parts<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.370> page<00:00:35.580> a<00:00:35.610> brighter<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.720> there's

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:36.990 
parts of the page a brighter and there's

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.049 
parts of the page a brighter and there's
this<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.260> these<00:00:37.410> little<00:00:37.710> lights<00:00:38.160> marks

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
this and these little lights marks

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.119 
this and these little lights marks
throughout<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.690> writing<00:00:40.230> was<00:00:40.590> as<00:00:40.710> if<00:00:40.860> there's

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
throughout the writing was as if there's

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.520 
throughout the writing was as if there's
gaps<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.879> there's<00:00:42.059> little<00:00:42.270> nooks<00:00:43.199> and

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
gaps and there's little nooks and

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.090 
gaps and there's little nooks and
crannies<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.600> so<00:00:45.600> it's<00:00:46.020> become<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:46.710> slow

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
crannies in it so it's become so slow

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.880 
crannies in it so it's become so slow
and<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:47.610> for<00:00:48.239> me<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.510> read<00:00:48.690> something<00:00:48.960> fluently

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
and so for me to read something fluently

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.090 
and so for me to read something fluently
is<00:00:50.070> just<00:00:50.489> impossible<00:00:51.260> for<00:00:52.260> some<00:00:52.440> dyslexics

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
is just impossible for some dyslexics

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.619 
is just impossible for some dyslexics
the<00:00:53.370> way<00:00:53.520> words<00:00:53.760> are<00:00:53.940> laid<00:00:54.090> out<00:00:54.120> on<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.600> page

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
the way words are laid out on the page

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.959 
the way words are laid out on the page
adds<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.800> difficulty<00:00:56.160> they<00:00:56.430> have<00:00:56.609> reading

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
adds to the difficulty they have reading

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.689 
adds to the difficulty they have reading
so<00:00:57.690> Cara's<00:00:58.050> going<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.410> see<00:00:58.590> optometrist<00:00:59.309> Nigel

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
so Cara's going to see optometrist Nigel

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.689 
so Cara's going to see optometrist Nigel
Burnett<00:01:00.059> hard<00:01:00.350> when<00:01:01.350> you're<00:01:01.469> reading<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.800> book

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
Burnett hard when you're reading a book

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.939 
Burnett hard when you're reading a book
do<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.179> see<00:01:03.420> all<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.780> words<00:01:04.019> all<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:04.470> line<00:01:04.710> or

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
do you see all the words all in line or

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.110 
do you see all the words all in line or
do<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.100> sometimes<00:01:05.280> see<00:01:05.670> them<00:01:05.730> swirling

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
do you sometimes see them swirling

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.880 
do you sometimes see them swirling
around<00:01:06.480> or<00:01:06.900> yeah<00:01:07.800> just<00:01:08.610> get<00:01:09.150> these<00:01:09.680> marks<00:01:10.680> in

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
around or yeah just get these marks in

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.490 
around or yeah just get these marks in
the<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.460> page<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.570> white<00:01:12.810> really

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
the in the page and the white really

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.859 
the in the page and the white really
comes<00:01:13.740> through<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.640> gaps<00:01:14.909> I'm<00:01:15.570> sort<00:01:15.810> of

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
comes through in the gaps I'm sort of

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:16.670 
comes through in the gaps I'm sort of
confused

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
confused

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.219 
confused
Nigel<00:01:17.490> thinks<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.970> white<00:01:18.180> background<00:01:18.479> can

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
Nigel thinks the white background can

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.140 
Nigel thinks the white background can
trigger<00:01:19.470> this<00:01:19.710> visual<00:01:20.159> stress<00:01:20.520> what<00:01:21.119> I

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
trigger this visual stress what I

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.460 
trigger this visual stress what I
believe<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.810> know<00:01:21.930> if<00:01:22.020> you're<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.229> dark

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
believe you know if you're in a dark

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.569 
believe you know if you're in a dark
room<00:01:22.680> you're<00:01:22.860> suddenly<00:01:23.009> going<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.369> very

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:23.579 
room you're suddenly going to very

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:26.300 
room you're suddenly going to very
bright<00:01:23.850> surroundings<00:01:24.420> before<00:01:25.040> for<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.070> it's

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
bright surroundings before for you it's

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.010 
bright surroundings before for you it's
like<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:26.640> all<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.909> time<00:01:27.180> for<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.689> white

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
like that all the time for a white

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.749 
like that all the time for a white
background<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:28.650> we<00:01:28.860> need<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.100> soften<00:01:29.340> down<00:01:29.640> the

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
background so we need to soften down the

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.030 
background so we need to soften down the
white<00:01:29.880> background<00:01:30.439> every<00:01:31.439> color<00:01:31.710> has<00:01:31.920> a

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
white background every color has a

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.819 
white background every color has a
different<00:01:32.130> wavelength<00:01:32.960> for<00:01:33.960> some<00:01:34.170> dyslexics

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
different wavelength for some dyslexics

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.980 
different wavelength for some dyslexics
white<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.579> too<00:01:35.820> intense<00:01:36.210> for<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.509> brain<00:01:36.780> to

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
white is too intense for the brain to

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.499 
white is too intense for the brain to
process<00:01:37.229> easily<00:01:37.820> and<00:01:38.820> what<00:01:39.000> we<00:01:39.090> do<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.390> use

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
process easily and what we do to use

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.840 
process easily and what we do to use
color<00:01:39.810> filters<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:41.130> slow<00:01:41.490> down<00:01:41.670> the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
color filters to slow down the

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.850 
color filters to slow down the
wavelength<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.390> light<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> book<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.649> needs

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
wavelength of light so a book that needs

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.620 
wavelength of light so a book that needs
to<00:01:43.979> take<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.280> four<00:01:44.520> hours<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.850> read<00:01:45.119> you'll

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
to take you four hours to read you'll

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.490 
to take you four hours to read you'll
read<00:01:45.810> in<00:01:45.930> two<00:01:46.140> hours

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
read in two hours

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.350 
read in two hours
but<00:01:47.040> not<00:01:47.189> only<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.490> but<00:01:47.790> after<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.210> two

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
but not only that but after the two

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.280 
but not only that but after the two
hours<00:01:48.540> we're<00:01:48.689> going<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.869> ask<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.170> what

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
hours we're going to ask you what

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
hours we're going to ask you what
happened<00:01:49.320> in<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.740> book<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.040> you'll<00:01:50.159> actually

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
happened in the book and you'll actually

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.249 
happened in the book and you'll actually
say<00:01:50.880> oh<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:50.969> remember<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:54.259> but

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
say oh I remember this this and this but

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.050 
say oh I remember this this and this but
if<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.469> put<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:55.770> over<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.280> yeah<00:01:57.030> that

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
if I put this over it yeah that

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.899 
if I put this over it yeah that
straightaway<00:01:58.049> makes<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.619> comfortable<00:01:59.040> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
straightaway makes it comfortable the
