00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.699

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.680
 this type of drawing in this line has the 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.250
 drawing of a dandelion that is that 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:54.250
 Lovely little plant fm is super cute 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:58.629
 that you just to and came out beautiful teeth 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.530
 I've done this nail inspired by the 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.199
 I already saw 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.100
 but it was not any specific that I 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.190
 I tried to copy 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.039
 I shot in the head did as I thought 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.429
 I would be and I hope you like it so well. 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:14.710
 have good and stayed like that and I started 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:15.640
 applying crochet of the patron throughout the 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.920
 my nail 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.710
 I'll get the fine brush and if I 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.799
 improvise and I'll get some 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.229
 and I'll start by doing the 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:29.259
 stem of my dandelion at last 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.479
 the importance of the 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.520
 just you I'll do the ramifications that 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.520
 are those neighboring petals of the 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.000
 lion and I will do everything around this 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.000
 tip 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.289
 and I will also make the small ones between 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.880
 these cases to give a 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.939
 in this drawing as if you were looking 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.549
 he had three-dimensional 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:58.189
 thereafter from each end of this 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:01.939
 unification I'll pull others will stay 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:04.579
 minors are those of wb yeats 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:07.280
 lion that when you 're just for her that 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:09.049
 keeps them hanging a little there and goes 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.039
 pulling doing it all around 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.039
 of this give 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.510
 including the inside petals line 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:39.379
 after that I'll do the drawing that 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.090
 it's in my ring that's the petals 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:48.260
 neighbors already released 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:50.829
 I'll clean one up and one here. 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.829
 down 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.670

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.480

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.720
 avon 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.500
 I will apply on top of all the drawing and 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.500
 I'll leave it like this 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.690
