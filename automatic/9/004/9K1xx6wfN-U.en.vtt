00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:03.679 

so<00:00:02.399> here's<00:00:02.610> a<00:00:02.669> couple<00:00:02.939> more<00:00:03.060> sequence

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
so here's a couple more sequence

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.410 
so here's a couple more sequence
problems<00:00:04.430> and<00:00:05.430> again<00:00:05.730> we're<00:00:05.940> just<00:00:05.970> trying<00:00:06.330> to

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
problems and again we're just trying to

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.940 
problems and again we're just trying to
ask<00:00:06.569> ourselves<00:00:06.810> do<00:00:07.200> these<00:00:07.379> sequences

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
ask ourselves do these sequences

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.490 
ask ourselves do these sequences
converge<00:00:08.370> or<00:00:08.670> diverge<00:00:08.700> and<00:00:09.500> sometimes

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
converge or diverge and sometimes

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.959 
converge or diverge and sometimes
they'll<00:00:10.710> put<00:00:10.740> your<00:00:11.099> little<00:00:11.340> formula<00:00:11.820> in

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
they'll put your little formula in

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.049 
they'll put your little formula in
brackets<00:00:12.630> in<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.679> other<00:00:13.860> examples<00:00:14.549> we<00:00:14.820> just

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
brackets in the other examples we just

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.650 
brackets in the other examples we just
had<00:00:15.240> you<00:00:15.690> know<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:16.020> sub<00:00:16.410> n<00:00:16.590> they<00:00:17.039> get<00:00:17.400> they

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
had you know a sub n they get they

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.660 
had you know a sub n they get they
denote<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:18.810> at<00:00:18.960> using<00:00:19.350> this<00:00:19.439> notation<00:00:19.680> but

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
denote it at using this notation but

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.910 
denote it at using this notation but
these<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.240> notations<00:00:22.170> are<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.439> same<00:00:22.680> they

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
these the notations are the same they

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.650 
these the notations are the same they
could<00:00:23.130> have<00:00:23.220> wrote<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.640> sub<00:00:23.939> N<00:00:24.090> equals<00:00:24.119> this

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
could have wrote a sub N equals this

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.730 
could have wrote a sub N equals this
stuff<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.260> same<00:00:25.859> idea<00:00:26.390> so<00:00:27.390> same<00:00:28.289> basic

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
stuff and same idea so same basic

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.470 
stuff and same idea so same basic
principle<00:00:29.369> I'm<00:00:29.519> going<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.789> look<00:00:29.910> at<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.150> limit

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
principle I'm going to look at the limit

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.840 
principle I'm going to look at the limit
as<00:00:30.510> n<00:00:31.050> goes<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.380> infinity<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:33.300> stuff<00:00:34.850> 2

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
as n goes to infinity of this stuff 2

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.830 
as n goes to infinity of this stuff 2
and<00:00:36.030> minus<00:00:36.329> 1<00:00:36.360> factorial<00:00:37.020> over<00:00:38.239> 2n<00:00:39.239> plus<00:00:39.719> 1

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
and minus 1 factorial over 2n plus 1

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.510 
and minus 1 factorial over 2n plus 1
factorial<00:00:40.250> and<00:00:42.469> again<00:00:43.469> factorials<00:00:44.219> can<00:00:44.370> be<00:00:44.489> a

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
factorial and again factorials can be a

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.240 
factorial and again factorials can be a
little<00:00:44.940> tricky<00:00:45.329> but<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:46.410> basic<00:00:46.770> idea<00:00:47.129> in

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
little tricky but the basic idea in

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.060 
little tricky but the basic idea in
sequences<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:48.000> series<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.920> usually<00:00:49.920> what

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
sequences in series is usually what

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.290 
sequences in series is usually what
you'll<00:00:50.219> try<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.460> do<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.879> you'll<00:00:51.090> try<00:00:51.270> to

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
you'll try to do is you'll try to

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.350 
you'll try to do is you'll try to
simplify<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:51.840> stuff<00:00:52.260> down<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:53.360> again

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
simplify this stuff down so again

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.650 
simplify this stuff down so again
remember<00:00:54.719> 2<00:00:55.289> n<00:00:55.469> minus<00:00:55.500> 1<00:00:55.890> factorial<00:00:56.309> that's<00:00:57.149> 2n

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
remember 2 n minus 1 factorial that's 2n

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.399 
remember 2 n minus 1 factorial that's 2n
minus<00:00:58.289> 1<00:01:00.230> times<00:01:02.030> 2n<00:01:03.030> minus<00:01:03.600> 2<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:04.140> keep

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
minus 1 times 2n minus 2 I keep

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.190 
minus 1 times 2n minus 2 I keep
subtracting<00:01:04.619> 1<00:01:05.129> away

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
subtracting 1 away

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.770 
subtracting 1 away
2n<00:01:07.200> minus<00:01:07.830> 3<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.760> eventually<00:01:09.390> I'll<00:01:09.540> keep

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
2n minus 3 and eventually I'll keep

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.070 
2n minus 3 and eventually I'll keep
going<00:01:10.310> multiplying<00:01:11.310> until<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.700> get<00:01:11.880> 3<00:01:12.330> times<00:01:12.780> 2

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
going multiplying until I get 3 times 2

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.390 
going multiplying until I get 3 times 2
times<00:01:14.010> 1<00:01:15.140> again<00:01:16.140> assuming<00:01:16.560> ends<00:01:16.860> large<00:01:17.100> enough

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
times 1 again assuming ends large enough

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.310 
times 1 again assuming ends large enough
to<00:01:17.430> have<00:01:17.670> all<00:01:17.880> these<00:01:18.060> terms<00:01:18.360> but<00:01:18.750> it's<00:01:19.049> going

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
to have all these terms but it's going

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.700 
to have all these terms but it's going
off<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.650> infinity<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:20.400> we<00:01:20.700> can<00:01:20.850> assume<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.710> 2n

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
off to infinity so we can assume that 2n

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.300 
off to infinity so we can assume that 2n
plus<00:01:22.979> 1<00:01:23.280> will<00:01:23.520> that's<00:01:23.670> 2n<00:01:24.360> plus<00:01:24.689> 1<00:01:25.280> then<00:01:26.280> I

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
plus 1 will that's 2n plus 1 then I

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.609 
plus 1 will that's 2n plus 1 then I
multiply<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.030> by<00:01:27.090> one<00:01:27.509> smaller<00:01:27.960> which<00:01:28.409> would

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
multiply that by one smaller which would

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.580 
multiply that by one smaller which would
just<00:01:28.799> be<00:01:28.860> 2n<00:01:29.430> then<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.360> multiply<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.140> by<00:01:31.200> 1

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
just be 2n then I multiply that by 1

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.620 
just be 2n then I multiply that by 1
smaller<00:01:31.979> which<00:01:32.400> would<00:01:32.579> be<00:01:32.670> 2<00:01:32.850> n<00:01:32.970> minus<00:01:33.000> 1

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
smaller which would be 2 n minus 1

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.280 
smaller which would be 2 n minus 1
and<00:01:33.900> then<00:01:34.500> I'd<00:01:34.619> have<00:01:34.770> 2<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.220> minus<00:01:35.549> 2<00:01:36.290> again

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
and then I'd have 2 and minus 2 again

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.480 
and then I'd have 2 and minus 2 again
all<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.650> way<00:01:37.740> down<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.100> 3<00:01:38.369> times<00:01:38.670> 2<00:01:38.970> times<00:01:39.329> 1

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
all the way down to 3 times 2 times 1

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.990 
all the way down to 3 times 2 times 1
well<00:01:41.490> notice<00:01:42.439> I've<00:01:43.439> got<00:01:43.979> all<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.880> these

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
well notice I've got all of these

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.749 
well notice I've got all of these
factors<00:01:45.869> starting<00:01:46.380> with<00:01:46.619> 2<00:01:46.799> n<00:01:46.920> minus<00:01:46.950> 1<00:01:47.250> 2<00:01:47.640> n

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
factors starting with 2 n minus 1 2 n

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.490 
factors starting with 2 n minus 1 2 n
minus<00:01:47.790> 2<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.450> that's<00:01:48.570> exactly<00:01:49.170> what's<00:01:49.350> on<00:01:49.439> the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
minus 2 and that's exactly what's on the

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.069 
minus 2 and that's exactly what's on the
numerator<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.909> can<00:01:51.119> actually<00:01:51.299> cancel<00:01:51.930> out

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
numerator so I can actually cancel out

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.490 
numerator so I can actually cancel out
all<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.350> numerator<00:01:53.299> with<00:01:54.299> part<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.170> what's<00:01:55.380> on

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
all the numerator with part of what's on

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.709 
all the numerator with part of what's on
the<00:01:55.560> denominator<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.790> threes<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.479> twos

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
the denominator so threes the twos

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.440 
the denominator so threes the twos
everything<00:01:58.649> will<00:01:58.770> cancel<00:01:59.159> out<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.579> I'm<00:02:00.240> just

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
everything will cancel out and I'm just

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.510 
everything will cancel out and I'm just
left<00:02:00.689> with<00:02:00.840> these<00:02:01.320> couple<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.799> terms<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.399> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
left with these couple of terms in the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.580 
left with these couple of terms in the
denominator<00:02:03.350> so<00:02:04.350> really

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
denominator so really

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.919 
denominator so really
an<00:02:06.729> equivalent<00:02:07.729> way<00:02:07.909> of<00:02:07.939> rewriting<00:02:08.690> this

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
an equivalent way of rewriting this

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.589 
an equivalent way of rewriting this
original<00:02:09.530> sequence<00:02:09.849> would<00:02:10.849> simply<00:02:11.300> be<00:02:11.480> 1<00:02:12.260> over

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
original sequence would simply be 1 over

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:20.020 
original sequence would simply be 1 over
2n<00:02:14.599> plus<00:02:14.900> 1<00:02:15.670> times<00:02:16.670> 2n<00:02:17.300> and<00:02:17.920> as<00:02:18.920> n<00:02:19.520> gets<00:02:19.700> very

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
2n plus 1 times 2n and as n gets very

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.270 
2n plus 1 times 2n and as n gets very
big<00:02:20.360> clearly<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.380> denominator<00:02:21.950> is<00:02:22.099> going<00:02:22.130> to

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
big clearly the denominator is going to

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.729 
big clearly the denominator is going to
get<00:02:22.430> very<00:02:22.459> big<00:02:22.940> you<00:02:23.510> have<00:02:23.660> 1<00:02:23.930> over<00:02:23.959> a<00:02:24.200> very<00:02:24.560> very

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
get very big you have 1 over a very very

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.550 
get very big you have 1 over a very very
large<00:02:25.220> number<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.910> you'll<00:02:26.660> end<00:02:26.840> up<00:02:26.930> getting<00:02:27.110> 0

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
large number and you'll end up getting 0

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.580 
large number and you'll end up getting 0
out<00:02:27.800> as<00:02:28.040> your<00:02:28.250> answer<00:02:28.610> so<00:02:29.120> again<00:02:30.050> we<00:02:30.260> would<00:02:30.410> say

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
out as your answer so again we would say

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.040 
out as your answer so again we would say
this<00:02:30.769> original<00:02:31.730> sequence<00:02:31.940> does<00:02:32.630> in<00:02:32.810> fact

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
this original sequence does in fact

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:45.420 
this original sequence does in fact
converge<00:02:39.130> ok<00:02:40.130> maybe<00:02:41.060> one<00:02:41.569> more<00:02:41.810> example<00:02:42.440> here

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.759 

let's<00:02:46.430> look<00:02:46.670> at<00:02:46.880> so<00:02:47.660> again<00:02:47.750> same<00:02:48.110> instructions

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
let's look at so again same instructions

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.070 
let's look at so again same instructions

does it converge or diverge this
particular<00:02:51.410> sequence<00:02:51.890> and<00:02:53.980> guess<00:02:54.980> I<00:02:55.040> should

is<00:03:17.049> well<00:03:18.049> you<00:03:18.829> know<00:03:18.859> as<00:03:19.190> n<00:03:19.430> gets<00:03:19.670> bigger<00:03:19.940> you

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
is well you know as n gets bigger you

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.930 
is well you know as n gets bigger you
know<00:03:20.660> cosine<00:03:21.260> squared<00:03:21.680> of<00:03:21.799> 1<00:03:22.010> cosine<00:03:22.579> squared

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
know cosine squared of 1 cosine squared

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.390 
know cosine squared of 1 cosine squared
of<00:03:23.030> 2<00:03:23.239> cosine<00:03:23.630> square<00:03:24.109> root<00:03:24.200> of<00:03:24.260> 3<00:03:24.560> those<00:03:25.220> are

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
of 2 cosine square root of 3 those are

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.590 
of 2 cosine square root of 3 those are
kind<00:03:25.609> of<00:03:25.670> tricky<00:03:25.910> numbers<00:03:26.359> to<00:03:26.510> evaluate

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
kind of tricky numbers to evaluate

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.940 
kind of tricky numbers to evaluate
intuitively<00:03:29.600> again<00:03:30.019> though<00:03:30.230> if<00:03:30.500> you<00:03:30.920> think

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
intuitively again though if you think

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.160 
intuitively again though if you think
about<00:03:31.190> cosine<00:03:33.850> cosine<00:03:34.850> of<00:03:35.269> anything<00:03:35.900> is

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
about cosine cosine of anything is

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.890 
about cosine cosine of anything is
always<00:03:36.950> between<00:03:37.489> negative<00:03:38.090> 1<00:03:38.569> and<00:03:38.900> positive<00:03:38.980> 1

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
always between negative 1 and positive 1

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.140 
always between negative 1 and positive 1
well<00:03:41.900> so<00:03:42.500> what's<00:03:42.769> cosine<00:03:43.040> squared<00:03:43.790> of<00:03:43.940> n

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
well so what's cosine squared of n

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.949 
well so what's cosine squared of n
between<00:03:46.030> don't<00:03:47.030> say<00:03:47.239> positive<00:03:47.750> 1<00:03:47.930> and

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
between don't say positive 1 and

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.599 
between don't say positive 1 and
positive<00:03:48.200> 1<00:03:48.530> you<00:03:48.829> got<00:03:48.980> to<00:03:49.069> be<00:03:49.160> careful<00:03:49.340> you

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
positive 1 you got to be careful you

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:54.699 
positive 1 you got to be careful you
can't<00:03:49.910> just<00:03:50.150> square<00:03:50.510> both<00:03:50.540> sides<00:03:50.720> of<00:03:51.200> this

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.920 

so<00:03:55.370> I'm<00:03:55.430> taking<00:03:55.609> numbers<00:03:56.060> between<00:03:56.239> negative<00:03:56.599> 1

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
so I'm taking numbers between negative 1

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.339 
so I'm taking numbers between negative 1
and<00:03:57.230> positive<00:03:57.260> 1<00:03:58.629> well<00:03:59.629> let's<00:03:59.810> see<00:03:59.930> if<00:04:00.049> I<00:04:00.170> take

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
and positive 1 well let's see if I take

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.860 
and positive 1 well let's see if I take
any<00:04:00.650> number<00:04:01.129> in<00:04:01.430> this<00:04:01.670> interval<00:04:02.150> from<00:04:02.359> 0<00:04:02.750> to

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
any number in this interval from 0 to

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.089 
any number in this interval from 0 to
positive<00:04:03.019> 1<00:04:04.060> 0<00:04:05.060> 1<00:04:05.450> maybe<00:04:05.780> I<00:04:05.930> use<00:04:06.109> the<00:04:06.290> 3rd<00:04:06.560> 1/2

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
positive 1 0 1 maybe I use the 3rd 1/2

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:10.449 
positive 1 0 1 maybe I use the 3rd 1/2
1/4<00:04:07.489> if<00:04:08.120> I<00:04:08.689> square<00:04:09.079> those<00:04:09.260> numbers<00:04:09.709> I'm<00:04:09.950> still

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
1/4 if I square those numbers I'm still

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.009 
1/4 if I square those numbers I'm still
going<00:04:10.579> to<00:04:10.609> get<00:04:10.730> numbers<00:04:11.090> back<00:04:11.389> between<00:04:11.659> 0<00:04:12.319> &amp;<00:04:12.530> 1

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
going to get numbers back between 0 &amp; 1

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.509 
going to get numbers back between 0 &amp; 1
likewise<00:04:15.019> if<00:04:15.230> I<00:04:15.319> take<00:04:15.500> a<00:04:15.530> number<00:04:15.709> between<00:04:16.009> 0

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
likewise if I take a number between 0

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.819 
likewise if I take a number between 0
and<00:04:16.579> negative<00:04:16.940> 1<00:04:17.259> negative<00:04:18.259> 1/2<00:04:18.799> negative

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
and negative 1 negative 1/2 negative

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.180 
and negative 1 negative 1/2 negative
one-third<00:04:19.789> when<00:04:20.479> I<00:04:20.509> square<00:04:21.019> those<00:04:21.320> I'm<00:04:21.709> going

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
one-third when I square those I'm going

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
one-third when I square those I'm going
to<00:04:22.280> get<00:04:22.430> numbers<00:04:22.850> between<00:04:23.030> still<00:04:23.840> 0<00:04:24.500> and<00:04:24.740> 1<00:04:24.889> so

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
to get numbers between still 0 and 1 so

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.070 
to get numbers between still 0 and 1 so
cosine<00:04:26.210> squared<00:04:26.660> of<00:04:26.810> n<00:04:26.960> is<00:04:27.229> in<00:04:27.470> between<00:04:27.590> 0<00:04:28.580> &amp;<00:04:28.910> 1

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
cosine squared of n is in between 0 &amp; 1

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.700 
cosine squared of n is in between 0 &amp; 1
so<00:04:30.910> you<00:04:31.910> may<00:04:32.210> remember<00:04:32.570> the<00:04:32.930> squeeze<00:04:33.349> theorem

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
so you may remember the squeeze theorem

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.950 
so you may remember the squeeze theorem
with<00:04:34.009> doing<00:04:34.280> limits<00:04:34.699> and<00:04:34.940> that's<00:04:35.720> what<00:04:35.870> I'm

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
with doing limits and that's what I'm

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.740 
with doing limits and that's what I'm
going<00:04:36.110> to<00:04:36.139> do<00:04:36.349> in<00:04:36.500> this<00:04:36.650> case<00:04:36.889> so<00:04:37.820> it<00:04:38.270> says<00:04:38.720> that

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
going to do in this case so it says that

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.089 
going to do in this case so it says that
cosine<00:04:39.430> squared<00:04:40.430> of<00:04:40.639> n<00:04:41.210> over<00:04:41.990> 2<00:04:42.560> to<00:04:42.830> the<00:04:42.979> N

00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:43.099 
cosine squared of n over 2 to the N

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:45.520 
cosine squared of n over 2 to the N
that's<00:04:44.060> always<00:04:44.630> going<00:04:44.810> to<00:04:44.840> be<00:04:44.930> greater<00:04:45.169> than

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
that's always going to be greater than

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.580 
that's always going to be greater than
or<00:04:45.680> equal<00:04:45.800> to<00:04:46.039> 0<00:04:46.820> over<00:04:47.479> 2<00:04:47.660> to<00:04:47.840> the<00:04:47.870> N<00:04:47.990> which<00:04:48.530> is

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
or equal to 0 over 2 to the N which is

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
equal to 1 over 2 to the N and if I look

equal to 1 over 2 to the N and if I look

at the limit as n goes to infinity of 0

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
and I look at the limit as n goes to

both of these cases certainly as n goes

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
to infinity of 0 I'm just going to get 0

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.100 
to infinity of 0 I'm just going to get 0
and<00:05:16.250> I'm<00:05:16.880> going<00:05:17.060> to<00:05:17.090> get<00:05:17.240> the<00:05:17.360> same<00:05:17.570> thing<00:05:17.870> the

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
and I'm going to get the same thing the

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.439 
and I'm going to get the same thing the
limit<00:05:18.409> as<00:05:18.500> n<00:05:18.620> goes<00:05:18.650> to<00:05:18.860> infinity<00:05:19.070> of<00:05:19.580> 1<00:05:19.789> over<00:05:20.240> 2

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:20.449 
limit as n goes to infinity of 1 over 2

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:22.980 
limit as n goes to infinity of 1 over 2
to<00:05:20.570> the<00:05:20.630> N<00:05:20.720> is<00:05:20.990> also<00:05:21.349> going<00:05:21.530> to<00:05:21.590> equal<00:05:21.949> 0

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
to the N is also going to equal 0

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.240 
to the N is also going to equal 0
obviously<00:05:23.990> if<00:05:24.080> n<00:05:24.259> is<00:05:24.380> getting<00:05:24.650> bigger<00:05:24.860> the

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
obviously if n is getting bigger the

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.560 
obviously if n is getting bigger the
denominator<00:05:25.759> is<00:05:25.880> getting<00:05:26.000> bigger<00:05:26.330> and<00:05:26.509> bigger

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
denominator is getting bigger and bigger

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.700 
denominator is getting bigger and bigger
and<00:05:26.900> bigger<00:05:27.080> so<00:05:28.570> the<00:05:29.570> limit<00:05:29.870> on<00:05:29.960> the<00:05:30.080> left<00:05:30.289> is<00:05:30.470> 0

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
and bigger so the limit on the left is 0

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.649 
and bigger so the limit on the left is 0
the<00:05:31.009> limit<00:05:31.099> on<00:05:31.310> the<00:05:31.430> right<00:05:31.639> is<00:05:31.820> 0<00:05:32.090> by<00:05:32.599> the

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:32.659 
the limit on the right is 0 by the

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:34.960 
the limit on the right is 0 by the
squeeze<00:05:33.169> theorem<00:05:33.500> that<00:05:33.979> implies<00:05:34.460> that<00:05:34.490> the

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
squeeze theorem that implies that the

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.350 
squeeze theorem that implies that the
limit<00:05:35.330> of<00:05:35.479> the<00:05:35.659> middle<00:05:35.960> thing<00:05:36.169> is<00:05:37.360> also

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
limit of the middle thing is also

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.640 
limit of the middle thing is also
getting<00:05:38.690> squeezed<00:05:39.550> to<00:05:40.550> that<00:05:40.699> same<00:05:41.060> limit

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
getting squeezed to that same limit

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.490 
getting squeezed to that same limit
which<00:05:42.650> again<00:05:42.979> is<00:05:43.220> 0<00:05:43.720> so<00:05:44.720> we<00:05:44.750> can<00:05:44.900> conclude<00:05:45.229> that

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
which again is 0 so we can conclude that

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.469 
which again is 0 so we can conclude that
this<00:05:45.800> original<00:05:46.430> sequence<00:05:46.699> at<00:05:47.150> the<00:05:47.270> very

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
this original sequence at the very

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:49.960 
this original sequence at the very
beginning<00:05:47.960> that<00:05:48.080> we<00:05:48.169> started<00:05:48.560> with<00:05:48.740> this<00:05:49.699> is

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970 
beginning that we started with this is

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.580 
beginning that we started with this is
in<00:05:50.180> fact<00:05:50.419> again<00:05:50.780> a<00:05:51.130> convergent<00:05:52.130> sequence<00:05:53.590> so

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.590 
in fact again a convergent sequence so

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.529 
in fact again a convergent sequence so
again<00:05:55.130> in<00:05:55.280> general<00:05:55.490> the<00:05:55.970> way<00:05:56.090> that<00:05:56.270> you<00:05:56.389> have

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:56.539 
again in general the way that you have

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:58.839 
again in general the way that you have
to<00:05:56.659> do<00:05:56.870> these<00:05:57.080> just<00:05:57.949> take<00:05:58.130> the<00:05:58.280> limit<00:05:58.460> as<00:05:58.699> n

00:05:58.839 --> 00:05:58.849 
to do these just take the limit as n

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:00.879 
to do these just take the limit as n
goes<00:05:58.880> to<00:05:59.060> infinity<00:05:59.330> you<00:06:00.139> may<00:06:00.289> have<00:06:00.470> to<00:06:00.590> rewrite

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:00.889 
goes to infinity you may have to rewrite

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:03.490 
goes to infinity you may have to rewrite
your<00:06:00.949> factorials<00:06:01.909> you<00:06:02.659> may<00:06:02.810> have<00:06:02.990> to<00:06:03.110> use<00:06:03.289> the

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
your factorials you may have to use the

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.159 
your factorials you may have to use the
squeeze<00:06:03.919> theorem<00:06:04.279> you<00:06:05.270> may<00:06:05.510> have<00:06:05.810> to<00:06:05.990> be<00:06:06.139> a

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169 
squeeze theorem you may have to be a

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:08.960 
squeeze theorem you may have to be a
little<00:06:06.380> more<00:06:06.620> clever<00:06:06.950> with<00:06:07.250> your<00:06:07.430> arguments

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:08.970 
little more clever with your arguments

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.170 
little more clever with your arguments
but<00:06:09.210> this<00:06:09.390> is<00:06:09.510> the<00:06:09.660> basic<00:06:10.020> idea
