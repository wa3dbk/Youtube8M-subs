00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
let's get make that clear from the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.919 
let's get make that clear from the
beginning<00:01:44.200> there's<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.409> big<00:01:45.619> hits<00:01:46.929> where

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
beginning there's the big hits where

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:49.960

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
he's hitting the chords loud and with

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.029 
he's hitting the chords loud and with
space<00:01:50.240> in<00:01:50.479> between<00:01:50.600> and<00:01:51.080> then<00:01:51.619> there's<00:01:51.890> the

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
space in between and then there's the

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.350 
space in between and then there's the
rest<00:01:52.190> of<00:01:52.429> the<00:01:52.520> song<00:01:52.759> where<00:01:53.030> you<00:01:53.060> could

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
rest of the song where you could

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.419 
rest of the song where you could

no<00:03:59.180> one<00:03:59.330> else<00:03:59.480> would<00:03:59.720> think<00:03:59.870> of<00:04:00.019> this<00:04:00.140> if<00:04:00.350> you

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
no one else would think of this if you

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.410 
no one else would think of this if you
didn't<00:04:00.830> know<00:04:01.040> some<00:04:01.340> music<00:04:01.730> theory<00:04:02.060> at<00:04:02.180> least

didn't know some music theory at least

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.000 
didn't know some music theory at least
so<00:04:02.989> I'm<00:04:03.080> gonna<00:04:03.170> start<00:04:03.320> from<00:04:03.470> the<00:04:03.530> beginning

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
so I'm gonna start from the beginning

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:13.449 
so I'm gonna start from the beginning
recap<00:04:04.610> and<00:04:04.820> get<00:04:04.970> to<00:04:05.120> the<00:04:05.239> point<00:04:05.480> where<00:04:05.630> we<00:04:05.750> are

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:19.779 

minor<00:04:15.669> and<00:04:16.669> then<00:04:18.100> here's<00:04:19.100> the<00:04:19.280> part<00:04:19.519> that<00:04:19.699> you

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
minor and then here's the part that you

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:21.370 
minor and then here's the part that you
might<00:04:20.030> have<00:04:20.180> trouble<00:04:20.389> figuring<00:04:20.690> out<00:04:21.079> if<00:04:21.259> you

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
might have trouble figuring out if you

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.100 
might have trouble figuring out if you
went<00:04:21.500> on<00:04:21.650> your<00:04:21.799> own<00:04:21.979> this<00:04:22.520> is<00:04:22.759> a<00:04:22.789> C<00:04:23.150> major<00:04:23.600> so<00:04:24.020> he

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
went on your own this is a C major so he

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.230 
went on your own this is a C major so he
actually<00:04:24.259> switches<00:04:24.860> from<00:04:25.070> a<00:04:25.160> C<00:04:25.400> minor<00:04:25.699> earlier

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
actually switches from a C minor earlier

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.840 
actually switches from a C minor earlier
to<00:04:26.810> a<00:04:26.840> C<00:04:27.199> major<00:04:27.470> now<00:04:27.979> and<00:04:28.280> that's<00:04:28.400> what<00:04:28.610> gives

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
to a C major now and that's what gives

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.210 
to a C major now and that's what gives
it<00:04:29.000> that<00:04:29.060> sort<00:04:29.479> of<00:04:29.630> a<00:04:29.690> happy<00:04:30.320> feeling<00:04:30.680> or

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
it that sort of a happy feeling or

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.340 
it that sort of a happy feeling or
grandiose<00:04:31.850> feeling<00:04:32.479> is<00:04:32.630> considered<00:04:33.229> to<00:04:33.320> be

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
grandiose feeling is considered to be

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.850 
grandiose feeling is considered to be
major<00:04:33.850> and<00:04:34.850> so<00:04:35.570> it's<00:04:35.720> that<00:04:35.930> big<00:04:36.139> chord<00:04:36.530> and

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
major and so it's that big chord and

then after that he wraps it up the last

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.499 
then after that he wraps it up the last

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:44.509 
two chords are an F minor okay this is a

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:47.050 
two chords are an F minor okay this is a
first<00:04:44.930> fret<00:04:45.440> bar<00:04:45.680> with<00:04:45.889> an<00:04:46.039> E<00:04:46.280> minor<00:04:46.490> in<00:04:46.789> front

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
of it and then the next chord this is

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.790 
of it and then the next chord this is
kind<00:04:49.669> of<00:04:49.729> interesting<00:04:50.090> and<00:04:50.539> this<00:04:51.169> is<00:04:51.229> sort<00:04:51.710> of

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
kind of interesting and this is sort of

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.610 
kind of interesting and this is sort of
exactly<00:04:52.699> what<00:04:52.849> he's<00:04:52.940> playing<00:04:53.150> the<00:04:54.080> next<00:04:54.259> chord

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
right before we start over at the

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.960 
right before we start over at the
beginning<00:04:57.080> of<00:04:57.470> this<00:04:57.560> progression<00:04:58.099> again<00:04:58.220> that

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
beginning of this progression again that

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.920 
beginning of this progression again that
is<00:04:59.180> a<00:04:59.210> G<00:04:59.660> minor<00:05:00.139> seven<00:05:01.039> that<00:05:01.910> is<00:05:02.120> a<00:05:02.150> third<00:05:02.539> fret

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
fifth fret fifth string okay so it's not

like<00:05:09.349> a<00:05:09.380> regular<00:05:09.620> minor<00:05:10.250> basically<00:05:11.180> a<00:05:11.449> regular

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
like a regular minor basically a regular

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.749 
like a regular minor basically a regular
minor<00:05:12.139> would<00:05:12.380> be<00:05:12.500> with<00:05:12.680> the<00:05:12.830> pinkie<00:05:13.310> you<00:05:13.460> take

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
okay and that wraps up the chord

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.640 
okay and that wraps up the chord
progression<00:05:19.909> let<00:05:20.270> me<00:05:20.360> go<00:05:20.479> over<00:05:20.659> that<00:05:20.900> one<00:05:21.260> time

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
progression let me go over that one time

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.500 
progression let me go over that one time
in<00:05:21.860> its<00:05:22.010> completeness<00:05:22.490> you<00:05:22.880> can<00:05:23.030> sort<00:05:23.240> of<00:05:23.300> wrap

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
in its completeness you can sort of wrap

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:39.080
