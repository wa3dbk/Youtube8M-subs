 and he has more money because he was playing 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.260
 in persia and there was a lot of chs and like 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.059
 you are the girls complain about like 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.920
 let's see why in this kind of 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.920
 rpg games is necessary 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:51.160
 computer defines the one that please 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.600
 the virgin feast to reserve that is the 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.579
 delay produced by the 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.739
 telecommunication that hinders the 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.809
 development of the morning itself causing 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.280
 disorientation or discomfort in the 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.190
 sound 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.049
 details while all communication the 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.270
 instance implies a certain delay in 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.909
 the arrival the messages of beenox 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.860
 lapse is applied when this delay of 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.420
 long enough to 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.880
 hinder the interaction of 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.730
 users and make evident the lack of 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.460
 summits 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:23.280
 a modern case will be online games 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.560
 massive in which sometimes a 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.270
 character that has had a few seconds and 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.070
 After a while the messages from 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.140
 server will be received to great 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.020
 speed what causes a bad 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.790
 gameplay result many times in 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.010
 lose the game or in some 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.420
 penalty points 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.420

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.100
 My voice is sensual and there you have the 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.220
 which is totally necessary in any 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.740
 telecommunication or in any kind of 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.900
 massive online game so seriously not 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.600
 no need to complain currelar 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.540
 because it can be your connection or the 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.300
 of server but yes in any any 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.770

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:10.179
 because because it's difficult to coordinate I do not know 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.100
