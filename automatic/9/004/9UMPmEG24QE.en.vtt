on it's not bad to come for level right

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.750 
on it's not bad to come for level right
now<00:02:38.260> it's<00:02:38.440> better<00:02:38.620> than<00:02:38.800> it<00:02:38.920> was<00:02:39.100> last<00:02:39.310> year

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
now it's better than it was last year

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.420 
now it's better than it was last year
you<00:02:40.000> got<00:02:40.120> a<00:02:40.150> new<00:02:40.360> cushion<00:02:40.570> okay<00:02:41.500> modified<00:02:42.220> the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
you got a new cushion okay modified the

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.390 
you got a new cushion okay modified the
seat<00:02:42.670> some<00:02:42.940> more<00:02:43.410> I've<00:02:44.410> got<00:02:44.620> a<00:02:44.650> lot<00:02:44.920> of<00:02:44.950> driving

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
seat some more I've got a lot of driving

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.540 
seat some more I've got a lot of driving
probably<00:02:46.170> 900<00:02:47.170> plus<00:02:47.350> miles<00:02:47.680> this<00:02:47.950> past<00:02:48.250> year

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
probably 900 plus miles this past year

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.780 
probably 900 plus miles this past year
and<00:02:49.120> trying<00:02:49.480> to<00:02:49.570> figure<00:02:49.780> out<00:02:50.280> how<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.310> make<00:02:51.610> it

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
and trying to figure out how to make it

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.090 
and trying to figure out how to make it
comfortable

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
comfortable

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.600 
comfortable
so<00:02:53.280> it's<00:02:53.670> not<00:02:53.850> bad<00:02:54.060> driving<00:02:54.540> down<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.870> road

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
so it's not bad driving down the road

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.130 
so it's not bad driving down the road
probably<00:02:56.610> rides<00:02:56.970> better<00:02:57.270> with<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.660> trailer

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
probably rides better with the trailer

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.470 
probably rides better with the trailer
on<00:02:58.350> it<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.560> little<00:02:59.070> more<00:03:01.760> you<00:03:02.760> guys<00:03:02.940> came<00:03:03.330> in<00:03:03.450> a

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
on it a little more you guys came in a

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.940 
on it a little more you guys came in a
little<00:03:03.600> bit<00:03:03.750> early<00:03:04.140> and<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:04.470> managed<00:03:04.740> to<00:03:04.830> make

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
little bit early and you managed to make

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.890 
little bit early and you managed to make
a<00:03:04.980> few<00:03:05.250> passes<00:03:05.730> at<00:03:05.970> LS<00:03:06.330> fest<00:03:06.570> which<00:03:06.780> is

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
a few passes at LS fest which is

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.840 
a few passes at LS fest which is
happening<00:03:07.050> sort<00:03:07.470> of<00:03:07.620> almost<00:03:08.010> simultaneously

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
happening sort of almost simultaneously

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.940 
happening sort of almost simultaneously
and<00:03:09.150> then<00:03:09.630> they<00:03:09.750> kicked<00:03:09.930> you<00:03:10.020> out<00:03:10.080> but<00:03:10.380> uh<00:03:10.410> so

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
and then they kicked you out but uh so

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.880 
and then they kicked you out but uh so
why'd<00:03:11.100> you<00:03:11.130> run<00:03:11.660> well<00:03:12.660> in<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:13.020> first<00:03:13.290> first

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
why'd you run well in the first first

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.220 
why'd you run well in the first first
pass<00:03:14.220> around<00:03:14.430> at<00:03:14.750> 7:17<00:03:15.750> out<00:03:16.260> of<00:03:16.380> 96<00:03:17.600> and<00:03:18.600> came

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
pass around at 7:17 out of 96 and came

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.170 
pass around at 7:17 out of 96 and came
back<00:03:19.260> and<00:03:19.740> I<00:03:19.860> ran<00:03:20.100> into<00:03:20.250> this<00:03:20.520> fellow<00:03:20.850> that

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
back and I ran into this fellow that

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.560 
back and I ran into this fellow that
used<00:03:21.690> to<00:03:21.870> tune<00:03:22.080> up<00:03:22.410> lots<00:03:22.710> of<00:03:22.860> power<00:03:23.300> he<00:03:24.300> looked

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
used to tune up lots of power he looked

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.900 
used to tune up lots of power he looked
at<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.870> programming<00:03:25.380> and<00:03:25.800> we<00:03:26.070> changed<00:03:26.670> a<00:03:26.730> few

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
at the programming and we changed a few

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:35.390 
at the programming and we changed a few
things<00:03:27.240> and<00:03:27.600> ran<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.850> 687<00:03:29.850> 200<00:03:34.400> yesterday

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400

the track had been really prepped real
well<00:03:43.740> they<00:03:43.980> really<00:03:44.250> prepped<00:03:44.640> it<00:03:45.140> perfectly

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.410

and yesterday we came in about noon time
and<00:03:58.250> the<00:03:59.250> changes<00:03:59.760> didn't<00:04:00.120> seem<00:04:00.270> to<00:04:00.390> do<00:04:00.540> any

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
and the changes didn't seem to do any

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.230 
and the changes didn't seem to do any
work<00:04:00.960> that<00:04:01.850> we<00:04:02.850> made

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.750 

what<00:04:06.240> a<00:04:06.270> bad<00:04:06.420> place<00:04:06.660> to<00:04:06.690> be<00:04:07.050> no<00:04:07.640> well<00:04:08.640> it

what a bad place to be no well it
doesn't<00:04:09.030> mean<00:04:09.150> anything<00:04:09.450> unless<00:04:09.840> you're<00:04:10.170> here

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
doesn't mean anything unless you're here

doesn't mean anything unless you're here
on<00:04:10.470> Friday<00:04:11.160> so<00:04:11.850> what's<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.150> engine<00:04:12.420> in<00:04:12.540> it

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
on Friday so what's the engine in it

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:18.050 
on Friday so what's the engine in it
it's<00:04:13.200> not<00:04:13.770> exactly<00:04:14.310> an<00:04:14.520> LSA<00:04:16.310> 414<00:04:17.310> small-block

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
it's not exactly an LSA 414 small-block

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.030 
it's not exactly an LSA 414 small-block
Chevy<00:04:18.540> gonna<00:04:18.959> do<00:04:19.200> while<00:04:19.440> I<00:04:19.470> built<00:04:20.340> the

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
Chevy gonna do while I built the

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.520 
Chevy gonna do while I built the
twin-turbo<00:04:23.040> 80<00:04:23.970> millimeter<00:04:24.540> so<00:04:25.140> it's<00:04:25.320> sort<00:04:25.500> of

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
twin-turbo 80 millimeter so it's sort of

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.110 
twin-turbo 80 millimeter so it's sort of
similar<00:04:26.040> to<00:04:26.070> the<00:04:26.190> engines<00:04:26.610> that<00:04:26.700> are<00:04:26.820> like<00:04:27.000> in

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
similar to the engines that are like in

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
the same pretty much the same company

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.180 
the same pretty much the same company
though<00:04:37.620> their<00:04:37.890> motors<00:04:38.220> a<00:04:38.310> little<00:04:38.550> bit<00:04:38.669> smaller

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190
