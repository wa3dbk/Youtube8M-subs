nude<00:05:49.110> ones<00:05:49.380> so<00:05:49.950> I've<00:05:50.070> been<00:05:50.220> called<00:05:50.490> Sparkle

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
nude ones so I've been called Sparkle

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.540 
nude ones so I've been called Sparkle
nude<00:05:51.180> and<00:05:51.390> then<00:05:51.450> one<00:05:51.660> cold<00:05:51.930> Kashmir<00:05:52.710> and<00:05:52.920> these

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
nude and then one cold Kashmir and these

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.220 
nude and then one cold Kashmir and these
are<00:05:53.700> just<00:05:53.730> so<00:05:54.210> pretty<00:05:54.420> like<00:05:54.660> to<00:05:54.780> put<00:05:54.930> them<00:05:55.080> on

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 
are just so pretty like to put them on

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.660 
are just so pretty like to put them on
and<00:05:55.380> then<00:05:55.500> maybe<00:05:55.620> put<00:05:55.800> an<00:05:55.890> eyeshadow<00:05:56.190> on<00:05:56.460> top

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:56.670 
and then maybe put an eyeshadow on top

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.820 
and then maybe put an eyeshadow on top
because<00:05:57.270> on<00:05:57.720> these<00:05:57.960> tend<00:05:58.230> to<00:05:58.260> crease<00:05:58.590> if<00:05:58.740> you

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
because on these tend to crease if you

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.010 
because on these tend to crease if you
don't<00:05:58.980> actually<00:05:59.310> put<00:05:59.490> something<00:06:00.000> on<00:06:00.240> top<00:06:00.810> of

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
don't actually put something on top of

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.660 
don't actually put something on top of
them<00:06:01.170> or<00:06:01.440> you<00:06:01.710> know<00:06:01.830> do<00:06:02.010> something<00:06:02.250> with<00:06:02.520> them

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:02.670 
them or you know do something with them

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.970 
them or you know do something with them
because<00:06:03.050> they're<00:06:04.050> just<00:06:04.140> like<00:06:04.320> really<00:06:04.500> creamy

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:04.980 
because they're just like really creamy

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.680 
because they're just like really creamy
so<00:06:05.220> they<00:06:05.460> just<00:06:05.490> piece<00:06:05.880> every<00:06:06.090> time<00:06:06.240> like<00:06:06.420> link

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
so they just piece every time like link

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.270 
so they just piece every time like link
your<00:06:06.840> eyes<00:06:06.960> or<00:06:07.200> do<00:06:07.290> something<00:06:07.500> like<00:06:07.650> that<00:06:07.830> and
