watt<00:03:23.260> LEDs<00:03:23.859> or<00:03:24.849> 7<00:03:25.329> watt<00:03:25.540> LEDs<00:03:26.760> giving<00:03:27.760> you

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:27.909 
watt LEDs or 7 watt LEDs giving you

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:33.990 
watt LEDs or 7 watt LEDs giving you
dimming<00:03:28.900> flexibility<00:03:32.220> but<00:03:33.220> also<00:03:33.400> similar

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
dimming flexibility but also similar

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.129 
dimming flexibility but also similar
light<00:03:34.269> performance<00:03:36.510> and<00:03:37.510> what<00:03:37.690> we<00:03:37.810> have<00:03:37.959> here

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
light performance and what we have here

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.490 
light performance and what we have here
again<00:03:38.290> is<00:03:39.000> 80%<00:03:40.000> energy<00:03:40.120> saving<00:03:40.780> over<00:03:41.079> its

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
again is 80% energy saving over its

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:52.610 
again is 80% energy saving over its
tungsten<00:03:41.949> halogen<00:03:42.099> equivalents

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620
