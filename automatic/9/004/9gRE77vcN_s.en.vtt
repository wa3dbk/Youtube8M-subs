00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
fashion and take a look at the collapse

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.580 
fashion and take a look at the collapse
here<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.600> collapse<00:02:01.810> is<00:02:02.020> a<00:02:02.050> little<00:02:02.260> different

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
here the collapse is a little different

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.190 
here the collapse is a little different
its<00:02:02.740> got<00:02:02.890> like<00:02:03.010> a<00:02:03.070> double<00:02:03.550> hinge<00:02:03.930> with<00:02:04.930> a

its got like a double hinge with a
plastic<00:02:05.710> end<00:02:06.190> cap<00:02:06.460> there<00:02:06.760> so<00:02:07.060> that's<00:02:07.540> how<00:02:07.720> you

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
plastic end cap there so that's how you

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.410 
plastic end cap there so that's how you
basically<00:02:08.229> strap<00:02:08.769> the<00:02:09.039> watch<00:02:09.250> in<00:02:09.580> on<00:02:10.239> your

wrist and gives you that feel and lock
that<00:02:13.989> you<00:02:14.140> need<00:02:14.409> in<00:02:14.680> terms<00:02:14.920> of<00:02:15.249> your

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
that you need in terms of your

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.759

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
balls with the qualcomm toq i can see

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.680 
balls with the qualcomm toq i can see
also<00:02:20.040> they<00:02:20.220> stay<00:02:20.640> in<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.819> corner<00:02:21.150> we're<00:02:21.420> on

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
also they stay in the corner we're on

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.530 
also they stay in the corner we're on
the<00:02:21.840> right<00:02:21.959> hand<00:02:22.170> side<00:02:22.290> where<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:22.830> would

adjust the watch and that's how you

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.680 
adjust the watch and that's how you
actually<00:02:26.160> clasp<00:02:26.610> it<00:02:26.849> together<00:02:27.150> so<00:02:27.420> in<00:02:27.540> terms

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
actually clasp it together so in terms

of you is going to 220 PPI display it's

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.170 
of you is going to 220 PPI display it's
called<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.250> Mirasol<00:02:41.640> display<00:02:42.000> which

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
called the Mirasol display which

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.570 
called the Mirasol display which
actually<00:02:42.420> does<00:02:42.780> one<00:02:43.019> in<00:02:43.319> sunlight<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:44.099> the

actually does one in sunlight and the
expect<00:02:44.910> is<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.090> have<00:02:45.269> a<00:02:45.660> great<00:02:46.590> battery<00:02:46.799> life

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
expect is to have a great battery life

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.680 
expect is to have a great battery life
of<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.400> couple<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:47.760> days<00:02:47.940> so<00:02:48.150> about<00:02:48.390> two<00:02:48.569> or

three days before we charging your

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.059 
three days before we charging your
device<00:02:50.880> which<00:02:51.420> is<00:02:51.569> very<00:02:51.870> very<00:02:52.049> cool<00:02:52.349> now<00:02:52.860> this

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
device which is very very cool now this

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.250 
device which is very very cool now this
is<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.250> charging<00:02:53.730> cradle<00:02:54.090> it's<00:02:54.209> got<00:02:54.390> microUSB

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
is the charging cradle it's got microUSB

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.850 
is the charging cradle it's got microUSB
to<00:02:56.099> actually<00:02:56.579> plug<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:56.880> in<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.150> charge<00:02:57.180> and

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
to actually plug it in to charge and

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.440 
to actually plug it in to charge and
that's<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:59.040> micro<00:02:59.310> USB<00:02:59.340> port<00:03:00.090> you<00:03:00.269> know<00:03:00.390> it

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
that's a micro USB port you know it

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.039 
that's a micro USB port you know it
opens<00:03:00.900> up<00:03:01.049> to<00:03:01.500> reveal<00:03:01.790> a<00:03:02.790> charging<00:03:03.540> surface

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
opens up to reveal a charging surface

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.220 
opens up to reveal a charging surface
for<00:03:04.349> me<00:03:04.940> for<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:05.970> talk<00:03:06.269> and<00:03:06.420> also<00:03:06.720> a<00:03:06.750> cradle

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
for me for the talk and also a cradle

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.800 
for me for the talk and also a cradle
dock<00:03:07.410> holder<00:03:07.890> for<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.730> wireless<00:03:09.060> headphones

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
dock holder for the wireless headphones

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.600 
dock holder for the wireless headphones
which<00:03:10.349> of<00:03:10.530> course<00:03:10.560> hopefully<00:03:10.950> we'll<00:03:11.310> get<00:03:11.430> at

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
which of course hopefully we'll get at

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.670 
which of course hopefully we'll get at
some<00:03:11.879> point<00:03:12.180> in<00:03:12.329> time<00:03:12.360> so<00:03:13.110> you<00:03:13.170> can<00:03:13.319> see<00:03:13.500> the

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
some point in time so you can see the

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.350 
some point in time so you can see the
wireless<00:03:13.980> headphones<00:03:14.370> really<00:03:14.700> go<00:03:14.879> in<00:03:15.060> there

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
wireless headphones really go in there

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.020 
wireless headphones really go in there
and<00:03:15.890> and<00:03:16.890> you<00:03:17.250> can<00:03:17.370> actually<00:03:17.519> place<00:03:18.000> the

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
and and you can actually place the

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.180 
and and you can actually place the
headphones<00:03:18.510> in<00:03:18.690> there<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.140> then<00:03:19.290> also<00:03:19.470> on<00:03:19.889> the

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
headphones in there and then also on the

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.830 
headphones in there and then also on the
left<00:03:20.400> hand<00:03:20.549> side<00:03:20.700> you<00:03:21.090> actually<00:03:21.359> push<00:03:21.600> that

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
left hand side you actually push that

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.490 
left hand side you actually push that
button<00:03:22.079> which<00:03:22.470> should<00:03:23.120> bring<00:03:24.120> up<00:03:24.420> your<00:03:24.900> the
