00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
plants and then the plastic plants are

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:21.320 
plants and then the plastic plants are
just<00:01:18.270> small<00:01:18.960> rock<00:01:19.950> based<00:01:20.250> plastic<00:01:21.030> clamps

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
just small rock based plastic clamps

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.749 
just small rock based plastic clamps
gives<00:01:21.570> them<00:01:21.720> easy<00:01:22.710> access<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.399> surface

gives them easy access to the surface

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.160 
gives them easy access to the surface
that's<00:01:23.970> important<00:01:24.420> when<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.630> water<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:25.049> going

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
that's important when the water is going

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.380 
that's important when the water is going
to<00:01:25.259> have<00:01:25.409> any<00:01:25.619> depth<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.130> like<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.549> this

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
to have any depth to it like this this

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.850 
to have any depth to it like this this
tank<00:01:27.600> has<00:01:27.750> about<00:01:28.020> five<00:01:28.229> inches<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.560> depth

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
tank has about five inches of depth

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.490 
tank has about five inches of depth
which<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.369> lot<00:01:29.610> for<00:01:29.789> a<00:01:29.850> baby<00:01:30.330> mud<00:01:30.569> turtle<00:01:30.899> but

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
which is a lot for a baby mud turtle but

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.139 
which is a lot for a baby mud turtle but
if<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.710> have<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.039> heavily<00:01:32.280> planted<00:01:32.759> like<00:01:32.909> this

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
if you have it heavily planted like this

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.450 
if you have it heavily planted like this
they<00:01:33.659> can<00:01:33.720> easily<00:01:34.200> get<00:01:34.350> up<00:01:34.440> and<00:01:34.619> down<00:01:34.710> this

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
they can easily get up and down this

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.070 
they can easily get up and down this
also<00:01:35.670> allows<00:01:36.060> them<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.420> opportunity<00:01:36.450> to

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
also allows them the opportunity to

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.660 
also allows them the opportunity to
learn<00:01:37.200> how<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.380> swim<00:01:37.799> in<00:01:37.979> deeper<00:01:38.220> water<00:01:38.429> which

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
learn how to swim in deeper water which

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.279 
learn how to swim in deeper water which
is<00:01:38.819> important<00:01:39.299> when<00:01:39.869> you're<00:01:40.020> going<00:01:40.049> to

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
is important when you're going to

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:42.320 
is important when you're going to
release<00:01:40.590> them<00:01:40.799> which<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.159> which<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.880> did<00:01:42.060> just

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
release them which I which I did just

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.700 
release them which I which I did just
earlier<00:01:42.659> this<00:01:42.720> month

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.220 

so<00:01:49.310> it's<00:01:49.610> a<00:01:49.880> pretty<00:01:50.330> well<00:01:50.540> settled<00:01:50.810> patching

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
so it's a pretty well settled patching

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.100 
so it's a pretty well settled patching
tank<00:01:52.030> once<00:01:53.030> again<00:01:53.270> there's<00:01:53.480> that<00:01:53.630> Moss<00:01:53.870> ball

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
tank once again there's that Moss ball

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.390 
tank once again there's that Moss ball
patch<00:01:54.350> which<00:01:54.620> is<00:01:54.740> one<00:01:54.890> of<00:01:54.950> their<00:01:55.070> favorite
