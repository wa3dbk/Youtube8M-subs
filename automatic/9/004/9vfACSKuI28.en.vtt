00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
light and the same thing goes along the

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.210 
light and the same thing goes along the
lines<00:02:18.540> of<00:02:18.720> moats<00:02:19.290> light<00:02:19.620> now<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.890> difference

lines of moats light now the difference

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.710 
lines of moats light now the difference
between<00:02:20.310> Mokes<00:02:20.700> light<00:02:20.940> in<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.420> reason<00:02:21.630> why

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
between Mokes light in the reason why

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.300 
between Mokes light in the reason why
you<00:02:21.780> may<00:02:21.960> get<00:02:22.110> some<00:02:22.290> more<00:02:22.560> of<00:02:22.650> them<00:02:22.740> over<00:02:22.980> time

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
you may get some more of them over time

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.640 
you may get some more of them over time
is<00:02:23.820> because<00:02:24.450> after<00:02:24.840> your<00:02:24.930> level<00:02:25.200> 20<00:02:25.530> the

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
is because after your level 20 the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.870 
is because after your level 20 the
experience<00:02:26.160> that<00:02:26.190> you<00:02:26.340> gain<00:02:26.550> from<00:02:26.730> doing

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
experience that you gain from doing

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
missions or raids or you know farming

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.280 
missions or raids or you know farming
actually<00:02:29.910> rolls<00:02:30.150> into<00:02:30.420> motive<00:02:30.870> lights<00:02:31.080> as<00:02:31.230> a

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
actually rolls into motive lights as a

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.260 
actually rolls into motive lights as a
type<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:31.709> currency<00:02:32.100> so<00:02:32.490> that's<00:02:32.670> one<00:02:32.910> other<00:02:33.090> way

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
type of currency so that's one other way

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.640 
type of currency so that's one other way
you<00:02:33.330> get<00:02:33.600> them<00:02:33.750> now<00:02:33.900> both<00:02:34.110> of<00:02:34.140> which<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:34.530> can

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
runs not consistently enough that you

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.490 
runs not consistently enough that you

what<00:04:06.120> I<00:04:06.150> mean<00:04:06.420> by<00:04:06.480> that<00:04:06.660> is<00:04:06.870> each<00:04:07.260> one<00:04:07.530> of<00:04:07.560> the

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
what I mean by that is each one of the

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.440 
what I mean by that is each one of the
shards<00:04:08.070> of<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.220> energies<00:04:08.610> is<00:04:08.820> designated<00:04:09.329> for

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
shards of the energies is designated for

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.720 
shards of the energies is designated for
a<00:04:09.630> certain<00:04:09.930> thing<00:04:10.079> you<00:04:10.290> get<00:04:10.410> energies<00:04:10.860> to<00:04:11.610> go

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
a certain thing you get energies to go

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.190 
a certain thing you get energies to go
ahead<00:04:12.000> towards<00:04:12.299> your<00:04:12.390> weapons<00:04:12.750> and<00:04:12.900> you<00:04:13.019> need

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
ahead towards your weapons and you need

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.900 
ahead towards your weapons and you need
shards<00:04:13.650> for<00:04:14.100> your<00:04:14.280> armor<00:04:14.549> and<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:14.700> reason

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
shards for your armor and the reason

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.370 
shards for your armor and the reason
shards<00:04:15.269> are<00:04:15.360> most<00:04:15.540> sought-after<00:04:15.780> right<00:04:16.229> now

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
shards are most sought-after right now

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.750 
shards are most sought-after right now
is<00:04:16.530> because<00:04:16.650> again<00:04:17.040> people<00:04:17.250> are<00:04:17.459> wanting<00:04:17.669> to

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
is because again people are wanting to

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.280 
is because again people are wanting to
upgrade<00:04:17.910> their<00:04:18.209> light<00:04:18.419> level<00:04:18.810> trying<00:04:19.079> to<00:04:19.169> get

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
upgrade their light level trying to get

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.440 
upgrade their light level trying to get
to<00:04:19.380> level<00:04:19.530> 30<00:04:19.829> or<00:04:20.100> higher<00:04:20.130> and<00:04:20.579> higher<00:04:20.609> and<00:04:21.060> to

to level 30 or higher and higher and to

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.060 
to level 30 or higher and higher and to
do<00:04:21.599> that<00:04:21.750> you<00:04:21.810> need<00:04:22.049> shards<00:04:22.410> to<00:04:22.560> upgrade<00:04:22.860> your

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
do that you need shards to upgrade your

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.700 
do that you need shards to upgrade your
armor<00:04:23.700> so<00:04:24.210> how<00:04:24.780> do<00:04:24.840> you<00:04:24.990> farm<00:04:25.260> these<00:04:25.440> things

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
armor so how do you farm these things

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.870 
armor so how do you farm these things
and<00:04:25.860> it's<00:04:26.070> easy<00:04:26.280> you<00:04:26.580> need

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
and it's easy you need

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.240 
and it's easy you need
to<00:04:26.940> get<00:04:27.060> legendary<00:04:27.600> items<00:04:28.020> now<00:04:28.230> what<00:04:28.890> you<00:04:29.040> do

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
to get legendary items now what you do

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.310 
to get legendary items now what you do
and<00:04:29.520> in<00:04:29.970> the<00:04:30.060> same<00:04:30.240> the<00:04:30.510> same<00:04:30.540> thing<00:04:30.930> applies

and in the same the same thing applies

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.930 
and in the same the same thing applies
to<00:04:31.650> when<00:04:31.890> you<00:04:31.980> dismantle<00:04:32.520> them<00:04:32.640> you<00:04:32.760> need<00:04:32.880> to

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
to when you dismantle them you need to

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.910 
to when you dismantle them you need to
dismantle<00:04:33.210> exotics<00:04:34.140> and<00:04:34.290> legendaries<00:04:34.770> and

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
dismantle exotics and legendaries and

when<00:04:35.010> you<00:04:35.100> do<00:04:35.220> that<00:04:35.430> you<00:04:35.550> can<00:04:35.670> get<00:04:35.760> two<00:04:35.970> or

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
when you do that you can get two or

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.850 
when you do that you can get two or
three<00:04:36.390> shards<00:04:36.930> if<00:04:37.020> it's<00:04:37.140> an<00:04:37.230> exotic<00:04:37.680> or

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
three shards if it's an exotic or

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.520 
three shards if it's an exotic or

zur and to get those ascendant energies

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.490 
zur and to get those ascendant energies
you<00:05:30.420> can<00:05:30.540> do<00:05:30.630> the<00:05:30.750> same<00:05:30.930> thing<00:05:31.230> with<00:05:31.410> your

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
you can do the same thing with your

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.560 
you can do the same thing with your
marks<00:05:31.920> so<00:05:32.490> your<00:05:32.640> Vanguard<00:05:33.090> marks<00:05:33.420> your

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
marks so your Vanguard marks your

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.230 
marks so your Vanguard marks your
crucible<00:05:33.840> marks<00:05:34.230> and<00:05:34.440> again<00:05:35.100> by<00:05:35.370> armor<00:05:36.000> from

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
crucible marks and again by armor from

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.120 
crucible marks and again by armor from
your<00:05:36.510> guys<00:05:36.690> down<00:05:37.050> below<00:05:37.410> in<00:05:37.560> the<00:05:37.650> staircase

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
your guys down below in the staircase

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.530 
your guys down below in the staircase
you<00:05:38.280> can<00:05:38.400> go<00:05:38.490> in<00:05:38.610> there<00:05:38.730> and<00:05:38.790> buy<00:05:38.940> you<00:05:39.390> know<00:05:39.510> a

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
you can go in there and buy you know a

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.060 
you can go in there and buy you know a
piece<00:05:39.750> of<00:05:39.780> armor<00:05:40.170> every<00:05:40.380> week<00:05:40.560> for<00:05:40.770> that<00:05:40.920> so

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
piece of armor every week for that so

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.260 
piece of armor every week for that so
that's<00:05:41.220> two<00:05:41.370> pieces<00:05:41.670> of<00:05:41.700> armor<00:05:41.940> that<00:05:42.060> could

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
that's two pieces of armor that could

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.790 
that's two pieces of armor that could
potentially<00:05:42.330> be<00:05:42.780> up<00:05:42.960> to<00:05:43.080> six<00:05:43.260> shards<00:05:43.710> or

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
potentially be up to six shards or

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.950 
potentially be up to six shards or
energies<00:05:44.250> per<00:05:44.850> week<00:05:45.090> and<00:05:45.300> on<00:05:45.420> the<00:05:45.450> off<00:05:45.660> week

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
energies per week and on the off week

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.450 
energies per week and on the off week
you'll<00:05:46.110> be<00:05:46.230> able<00:05:46.320> to<00:05:46.470> get<00:05:46.590> four<00:05:46.890> of<00:05:47.070> them<00:05:47.220> so

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
you'll be able to get four of them so

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.040 
you'll be able to get four of them so
that's<00:05:47.640> one<00:05:48.000> way<00:05:48.030> you<00:05:48.240> can<00:05:48.420> consistently<00:05:48.930> do

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
that's one way you can consistently do

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:22.890 
from chess you can also get us into

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:24.470 
from chess you can also get us into
shards<00:06:23.160> and<00:06:23.340> energies<00:06:23.730> from<00:06:23.880> doing<00:06:24.180> that<00:06:24.300> as

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:24.480 
shards and energies from doing that as

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.450 
shards and energies from doing that as
well<00:06:24.630> so<00:06:24.660> outside<00:06:25.470> of<00:06:25.530> doing<00:06:25.860> the<00:06:26.160> daily

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
well so outside of doing the daily

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.910 
well so outside of doing the daily
public<00:06:26.970> events<00:06:27.420> and<00:06:27.570> looking<00:06:28.260> in<00:06:28.380> chests<00:06:28.680> and

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:30.750 
doing the the dismantling which is also

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.330 
doing the the dismantling which is also
the<00:06:30.870> most<00:06:30.960> effective<00:06:31.500> way<00:06:31.710> to<00:06:31.740> actually<00:06:32.070> get

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
the most effective way to actually get

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.890 
the most effective way to actually get
these<00:06:32.490> things<00:06:32.640> especially<00:06:32.910> them<00:06:33.270> in<00:06:33.420> bulk<00:06:33.690> is

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 
these things especially them in bulk is

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.050 
these things especially them in bulk is
by<00:06:34.320> dismantling<00:06:34.680> legendaries<00:06:35.460> and<00:06:35.610> exotics

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 
by dismantling legendaries and exotics

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.580 
by dismantling legendaries and exotics
the<00:06:36.630> only<00:06:36.780> other<00:06:36.810> way<00:06:37.050> to<00:06:37.080> get<00:06:37.290> them<00:06:37.410> is<00:06:37.500> from

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
the only other way to get them is from

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:38.960 
the only other way to get them is from
doing<00:06:37.919> raids<00:06:38.190> unfortunately<00:06:38.760> you're<00:06:38.850> going

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:38.970 
doing raids unfortunately you're going

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.420 
doing raids unfortunately you're going
to<00:06:39.030> need<00:06:39.150> six<00:06:39.390> people<00:06:39.660> to<00:06:39.750> do<00:06:39.900> those

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:40.430 
to need six people to do those

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.130 
to need six people to do those
that's<00:06:40.580> a<00:06:40.670> little<00:06:40.880> bit<00:06:40.970> harder<00:06:41.270> to<00:06:41.300> do<00:06:41.630> more

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:42.140 
that's a little bit harder to do more

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.440 
that's a little bit harder to do more
time<00:06:42.530> consuming<00:06:42.740> but<00:06:43.610> you<00:06:43.760> can<00:06:44.000> get<00:06:44.240> a<00:06:44.270> couple

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:44.450 
time consuming but you can get a couple

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.360 
time consuming but you can get a couple
from<00:06:44.750> certain<00:06:45.080> chests<00:06:45.380> inside<00:06:45.800> of<00:06:46.010> the<00:06:46.100> raids

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.370 
from certain chests inside of the raids

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.480 
from certain chests inside of the raids
and<00:06:46.700> also<00:06:47.030> again<00:06:47.390> reward<00:06:47.810> system<00:06:48.170> so<00:06:48.440> like<00:06:49.340> I

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:49.490 
and also again reward system so like I
