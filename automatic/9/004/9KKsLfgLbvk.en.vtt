we're<00:00:13.879> delighted<00:00:14.120> with<00:00:14.749> the<00:00:15.019> software<00:00:15.320> that

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
we're delighted with the software that

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.290 
we're delighted with the software that
we<00:00:15.619> get<00:00:15.829> from<00:00:15.860> Siemens<00:00:16.369> PLM<00:00:16.550> I<00:00:16.910> mean<00:00:17.060> to<00:00:17.210> the

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
we get from Siemens PLM I mean to the

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.910 
we get from Siemens PLM I mean to the
point<00:00:17.450> where<00:00:17.690> we've<00:00:17.810> been<00:00:17.929> using<00:00:18.140> it<00:00:18.380> now<00:00:18.410> for

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
point where we've been using it now for

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.550 
point where we've been using it now for
nearly<00:00:19.189> 14<00:00:19.699> years<00:00:19.730> it<00:00:20.330> just<00:00:20.990> gets<00:00:21.140> better<00:00:21.289> and

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
nearly 14 years it just gets better and

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.800 
nearly 14 years it just gets better and
better<00:00:21.710> the<00:00:22.490> the<00:00:23.060> great<00:00:23.269> thing<00:00:23.449> is<00:00:23.539> that<00:00:23.599> the

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
better the the great thing is that the

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:42.279 
how the product is going to be developed
and<00:00:39.469> I<00:00:40.340> have<00:00:40.550> to<00:00:40.699> say<00:00:40.910> throughout<00:00:41.539> the<00:00:41.870> 14

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:42.289 
and I have to say throughout the 14

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:44.380 
and I have to say throughout the 14
years<00:00:42.590> we<00:00:42.710> work<00:00:42.949> with<00:00:43.160> them<00:00:43.280> they've<00:00:43.699> stuck<00:00:44.120> to

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
years we work with them they've stuck to

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.119 
years we work with them they've stuck to
that<00:00:44.420> roadmap<00:00:44.809> what<00:00:45.440> they<00:00:45.590> say<00:00:45.829> they're<00:00:46.010> going

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
that roadmap what they say they're going

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.700 
that roadmap what they say they're going
to<00:00:46.190> deliver<00:00:46.489> they<00:00:46.850> do<00:00:46.910> deliver<00:00:47.329> and<00:00:47.780> on<00:00:48.440> time

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
to deliver they do deliver and on time

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.130 
to deliver they do deliver and on time
and<00:00:49.129> it<00:00:49.340> benefits<00:00:49.789> the<00:00:50.210> business<00:00:50.600> more<00:00:50.899> and

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
and it benefits the business more and

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.470 
and it benefits the business more and
more<00:00:54.430> it's<00:00:55.430> really<00:00:55.730> important<00:00:56.090> that<00:00:56.120> we're<00:00:56.359> at

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
more it's really important that we're at

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.400 
more it's really important that we're at
the<00:00:56.629> cutting<00:00:57.079> edge<00:00:57.320> of<00:00:57.739> available<00:00:58.519> technology

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
the cutting edge of available technology

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.479 
the cutting edge of available technology
we're<00:01:00.410> constantly<00:01:00.739> looking<00:01:01.190> for<00:01:01.250> new

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
we're constantly looking for new

materials new manufacturing processes
and<00:01:04.250> really<00:01:05.120> what<00:01:05.269> we're<00:01:05.420> trying<00:01:05.630> to<00:01:05.750> do<00:01:05.930> is<00:01:06.049> to

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
and really what we're trying to do is to

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.100 
and really what we're trying to do is to
go<00:01:06.290> through<00:01:06.439> as<00:01:06.530> many<00:01:06.710> iterations<00:01:07.130> of<00:01:08.110> design

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
go through as many iterations of design

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.530 
go through as many iterations of design
ideas<00:01:09.590> as<00:01:09.710> we<00:01:09.860> possibly<00:01:10.070> can<00:01:10.610> and<00:01:10.909> working

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
ideas as we possibly can and working

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.469 
with with the NX system and team center
enables<00:01:15.470> us<00:01:15.560> a<00:01:15.710> very<00:01:16.100> rapid<00:01:16.670> turnaround<00:01:16.970> and

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
enables us a very rapid turnaround and

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.050 
enables us a very rapid turnaround and
the<00:01:17.930> ability<00:01:18.350> to<00:01:18.530> go<00:01:18.560> through<00:01:19.130> many<00:01:19.729> many

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
the ability to go through many many

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.149 
the ability to go through many many
iterations<00:01:20.270> of<00:01:20.930> different<00:01:21.320> design<00:01:21.650> ideas

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
iterations of different design ideas

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.270 
iterations of different design ideas
particularly<00:01:23.030> in<00:01:23.509> our<00:01:23.750> wind<00:01:24.049> tunnel<00:01:24.170> one<00:01:25.159> of

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
particularly in our wind tunnel one of

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.340 
particularly in our wind tunnel one of
the<00:01:25.369> problems<00:01:25.579> we<00:01:25.909> faced<00:01:26.210> was<00:01:26.420> that<00:01:26.869> when<00:01:27.140> we

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
the problems we faced was that when we

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.039 
the problems we faced was that when we
introduced<00:01:27.860> rapid<00:01:28.369> prototyping<00:01:29.000> it<00:01:29.600> required

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
introduced rapid prototyping it required

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.109 
introduced rapid prototyping it required
the<00:01:30.170> designer<00:01:30.649> to<00:01:30.829> produce<00:01:31.159> a<00:01:31.490> completely

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
the designer to produce a completely

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.080 
the designer to produce a completely
closed<00:01:32.479> clean<00:01:33.049> solid<00:01:33.530> model<00:01:34.100> of<00:01:34.250> each<00:01:34.790> of<00:01:34.970> the

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
closed clean solid model of each of the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.700 
closed clean solid model of each of the
different<00:01:35.270> iterations<00:01:36.020> that<00:01:36.229> he<00:01:36.350> wanted<00:01:36.590> to

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
different iterations that he wanted to

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.249 
different iterations that he wanted to
try<00:01:36.950> in<00:01:37.009> a<00:01:37.130> wind<00:01:37.280> tunnel<00:01:37.810> this<00:01:38.810> presented<00:01:39.170> a

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
try in a wind tunnel this presented a

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.080 
try in a wind tunnel this presented a
problem<00:01:39.380> for<00:01:39.740> us<00:01:39.770> because<00:01:39.860> this<00:01:40.399> created<00:01:41.030> a

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
problem for us because this created a

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.819 
problem for us because this created a
bottleneck<00:01:41.270> in<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.720> design<00:01:42.049> office<00:01:42.439> with<00:01:42.710> the

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
bottleneck in the design office with the

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:44.170 
bottleneck in the design office with the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.510 
detailed models our friends at siemens
PLM<00:01:47.630> came<00:01:47.899> to<00:01:48.079> us<00:01:48.229> and<00:01:48.439> said<00:01:48.500> we<00:01:49.070> have<00:01:49.490> a

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
PLM came to us and said we have a

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.980 
PLM came to us and said we have a
solution<00:01:49.880> to<00:01:50.149> that<00:01:50.240> problem<00:01:50.299> and<00:01:50.810> it<00:01:50.899> was

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
solution to that problem and it was

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.530 
solution to that problem and it was
parametric<00:01:51.530> modeling<00:01:51.890> and<00:01:52.270> they<00:01:53.270> ran<00:01:53.479> a

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
parametric modeling and they ran a

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.990 
parametric modeling and they ran a
workshop<00:01:53.750> here<00:01:54.530> at<00:01:54.710> red<00:01:55.310> bull<00:01:55.460> racing<00:01:55.579> and

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
workshop here at red bull racing and

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.359 
workshop here at red bull racing and
taught<00:01:56.930> our<00:01:57.140> designers<00:01:57.740> how<00:01:57.979> to<00:01:58.039> produce

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
taught our designers how to produce

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.300 
taught our designers how to produce
solid<00:01:58.939> models<00:01:59.270> with<00:01:59.570> with<00:01:59.810> key<00:02:00.049> parameters

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
solid models with with key parameters

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.670 
solid models with with key parameters
that<00:02:01.310> were<00:02:01.430> very<00:02:01.460> quickly<00:02:01.850> changeable<00:02:02.450> so<00:02:02.869> the

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
that were very quickly changeable so the

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.429 
that were very quickly changeable so the
designer<00:02:04.039> will<00:02:04.250> now<00:02:04.369> produce<00:02:04.810> single<00:02:05.810> generic

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
designer will now produce single generic

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.320 
designer will now produce single generic
model<00:02:06.740> of<00:02:07.100> for<00:02:07.310> example<00:02:07.670> a<00:02:07.729> front<00:02:08.000> wing<00:02:08.149> end

on<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.069> car<00:02:25.310> it<00:02:25.730> could<00:02:26.060> be<00:02:26.240> hydraulics<00:02:26.930> or

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
on the car it could be hydraulics or

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.360 
on the car it could be hydraulics or
transmission<00:02:28.040> or<00:02:28.870> aerodynamics<00:02:29.870> or
