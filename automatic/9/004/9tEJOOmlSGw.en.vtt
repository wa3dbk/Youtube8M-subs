00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
completely natural so that won't be an

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.790 
completely natural so that won't be an
issue<00:01:17.940> for<00:01:18.150> me

space<00:01:29.360> but<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.390> might<00:01:30.750> actually<00:01:30.930> stop<00:01:31.380> blow

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
space but I might actually stop blow
