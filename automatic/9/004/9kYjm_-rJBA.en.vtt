well I guess I'll put my potatoes the
Russian<00:00:04.009> banana<00:00:05.009> our<00:00:05.190> fingerling<00:00:05.670> potatoes

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:06.529 
Russian banana our fingerling potatoes

Russian banana our fingerling potatoes
and<00:00:07.529> this<00:00:07.649> raised<00:00:07.890> bed<00:00:08.099> here<00:00:08.130> I'm<00:00:08.490> not<00:00:08.610> really

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
and this raised bed here I'm not really

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.330 
and this raised bed here I'm not really
using<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.210> cold<00:00:09.450> frame<00:00:10.099> seems<00:00:11.099> like<00:00:11.219> we

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
using the cold frame seems like we

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.640 
using the cold frame seems like we
jumped<00:00:12.240> right<00:00:12.269> into<00:00:12.540> summer<00:00:14.299> so<00:00:15.350> let<00:00:16.350> me<00:00:16.410> clear

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
jumped right into summer so let me clear

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.970 
jumped right into summer so let me clear
up<00:00:16.770> this<00:00:16.890> bed<00:00:17.220> or<00:00:17.910> clean<00:00:18.150> up<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.449> bed<00:00:18.630> and

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
up this bed or clean up the bed and

00:00:18.980 --> 00:01:54.870 
up this bed or clean up the bed and
plant<00:00:19.980> some<00:00:20.160> potatoes

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.969 

so<00:01:55.390> I<00:01:55.480> cleaned<00:01:55.720> up<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:55.840> bed<00:01:56.110> and<00:01:56.409> I've<00:01:56.680> dug<00:01:56.950> a

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
so I cleaned up the bed and I've dug a

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.210 
so I cleaned up the bed and I've dug a
trench<00:01:58.320> because<00:01:59.320> I<00:01:59.409> want<00:01:59.590> to<00:01:59.650> heal<00:01:59.800> up<00:01:59.979> I'm

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
trench because I want to heal up I'm

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.450 
trench because I want to heal up I'm
gonna<00:02:00.370> have<00:02:00.580> to<00:02:00.729> heal<00:02:00.880> up<00:02:01.030> a<00:02:02.040> couple<00:02:03.040> of<00:02:03.160> times

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
gonna have to heal up a couple of times

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.050 
gonna have to heal up a couple of times
as<00:02:04.300> the<00:02:04.510> plants<00:02:04.870> grow<00:02:05.310> but<00:02:06.310> I<00:02:06.340> guess<00:02:06.550> initially

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
as the plants grow but I guess initially

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.639 
as the plants grow but I guess initially
you<00:02:07.210> plant<00:02:07.479> them<00:02:07.630> two<00:02:07.840> to<00:02:07.990> three<00:02:08.200> inches<00:02:08.440> deep

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
you plant them two to three inches deep

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.230 
you plant them two to three inches deep
12<00:02:09.580> inches<00:02:09.880> apart<00:02:10.240> in<00:02:10.890> rows<00:02:11.890> of<00:02:12.130> 30<00:02:12.370> to<00:02:12.580> 36

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
12 inches apart in rows of 30 to 36

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.160 
12 inches apart in rows of 30 to 36
inches<00:02:13.510> apart<00:02:13.990> which<00:02:14.230> I<00:02:14.410> can't<00:02:14.650> do<00:02:14.890> so<00:02:15.430> in<00:02:16.270> one

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
inches apart which I can't do so in one

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.110 
inches apart which I can't do so in one
raised<00:02:17.380> bed<00:02:17.410> I'll<00:02:17.920> just<00:02:18.100> put<00:02:18.340> one<00:02:18.550> row<00:02:18.790> down<00:02:19.030> in

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
raised bed I'll just put one row down in

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.210 
raised bed I'll just put one row down in
the<00:02:19.180> middle<00:02:19.450> here<00:02:19.720> I<00:02:20.010> don't<00:02:21.010> know<00:02:21.070> how<00:02:21.130> many

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
the middle here I don't know how many

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.920 
the middle here I don't know how many
banana<00:02:22.290> bananas<00:02:23.290> I<00:02:23.620> don't<00:02:24.040> I<00:02:24.570> don't<00:02:25.570> know<00:02:25.780> how

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
banana bananas I don't I don't know how

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.100 
banana bananas I don't I don't know how
many<00:02:25.990> fingerlings<00:02:26.709> you<00:02:26.920> get<00:02:27.130> off<00:02:27.280> of<00:02:27.310> each<00:02:28.110> one

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
many fingerlings you get off of each one

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.530 
many fingerlings you get off of each one
of<00:02:29.260> these<00:02:29.380> potatoes<00:02:29.890> starters<00:02:30.670> here<00:02:33.330> as<00:02:34.330> you

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
of these potatoes starters here as you

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.729 
of these potatoes starters here as you
can<00:02:34.570> see<00:02:35.020> I<00:02:36.750> cut<00:02:37.750> them<00:02:37.959> a<00:02:37.989> couple<00:02:38.260> of<00:02:38.410> days<00:02:38.560> ago

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
can see I cut them a couple of days ago

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:46.800 
can see I cut them a couple of days ago
and<00:02:39.390> they've<00:02:40.390> calloused<00:02:40.930> over<00:02:42.330> and<00:02:43.330> I<00:02:45.750> got<00:02:46.750> a

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
and they've calloused over and I got a

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.880 
and they've calloused over and I got a
couple<00:02:47.019> eyes<00:02:47.260> on<00:02:47.590> each<00:02:47.800> hopefully<00:02:49.800> so<00:02:50.800> you

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
couple eyes on each hopefully so you

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.670 
couple eyes on each hopefully so you
just<00:02:51.010> put<00:02:51.220> them<00:02:51.370> in<00:02:51.550> I<00:02:52.410> guess

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
just put them in I guess

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
just put them in I guess
now<00:02:54.640> this<00:02:54.820> raised<00:02:55.060> bed<00:02:55.090> also<00:02:55.540> I<00:02:55.750> put<00:02:55.870> wire<00:02:56.320> mesh

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
now this raised bed also I put wire mesh

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.550 
now this raised bed also I put wire mesh
on<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:57.760> bottom<00:02:58.330> of<00:02:58.450> it<00:02:58.570> so<00:02:58.600> I<00:02:58.780> hopefully

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
on the bottom of it so I hopefully

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.120 
on the bottom of it so I hopefully
there'll<00:02:59.799> be<00:02:59.830> no<00:03:01.320> no<00:03:02.320> critters<00:03:02.620> coming<00:03:02.950> up

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
there'll be no no critters coming up

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.960 
there'll be no no critters coming up
from<00:03:03.250> underneath<00:03:05.070> so<00:03:06.070> there's<00:03:06.340> one<00:03:06.580> with<00:03:06.790> the

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
from underneath so there's one with the

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.069 
from underneath so there's one with the
eye<00:03:07.500> facing<00:03:08.500> up<00:03:09.180> here's<00:03:10.180> an<00:03:10.329> easy<00:03:10.480> one<00:03:10.750> with<00:03:10.959> an

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
eye facing up here's an easy one with an

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:22.120 
eye facing up here's an easy one with an
eye<00:03:11.230> facing<00:03:11.709> up

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:32.420 

there's<00:03:23.060> one

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.190 

I'm<00:03:32.939> going<00:03:33.209> to<00:03:33.299> have<00:03:33.420> enough<00:03:33.659> here<00:03:33.959> for

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
I'm going to have enough here for

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.750 
I'm going to have enough here for
another<00:03:34.379> raised<00:03:34.680> bed<00:03:35.659> so<00:03:36.659> I<00:03:36.689> can<00:03:36.810> move<00:03:37.110> one

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
another raised bed so I can move one

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.140 
another raised bed so I can move one
this<00:03:38.760> looks<00:03:39.030> like<00:03:39.150> in<00:03:39.329> high<00:03:39.510> I<00:03:39.540> think<00:03:41.150> right

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
this looks like in high I think right

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:49.870 
this looks like in high I think right
there

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:04:02.970 

hmm

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.650 

and<00:04:03.459> one<00:04:03.760> here<00:04:05.430> so<00:04:06.430> I<00:04:06.459> put<00:04:06.730> a<00:04:06.760> couple<00:04:06.970> of<00:04:07.120> inches

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:19.949 

hopefully<00:04:11.459> raccoons<00:04:12.459> don't<00:04:12.760> eat<00:04:12.940> potatoes

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.670 

it's<00:04:20.959> pretty<00:04:21.200> loose<00:04:21.380> soil<00:04:21.680> too<00:04:23.500> so<00:04:24.500> that

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
it's pretty loose soil too so that

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.650 
it's pretty loose soil too so that
should<00:04:24.860> give<00:04:25.010> me<00:04:25.100> room<00:04:25.310> to<00:04:28.180> Hill<00:04:29.180> up<00:04:29.360> around

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
should give me room to Hill up around

00:04:29.660 --> 00:05:03.490 
should give me room to Hill up around
these<00:04:29.930> when<00:04:30.170> they<00:04:31.660> start<00:04:32.660> growing

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.710 

now<00:05:04.070> I<00:05:04.100> did<00:05:04.400> read<00:05:04.550> online<00:05:04.730> that<00:05:05.000> they

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
now I did read online that they

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.580 
now I did read online that they
recommend<00:05:06.260> not<00:05:06.500> putting<00:05:06.560> any<00:05:08.230> manure<00:05:09.230> or

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
recommend not putting any manure or

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.360 
recommend not putting any manure or
compost<00:05:10.060> or<00:05:11.060> any<00:05:11.570> lime<00:05:11.900> in<00:05:12.110> the<00:05:12.200> soil<00:05:12.470> because

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
compost or any lime in the soil because

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.400 
compost or any lime in the soil because
that<00:05:13.550> can<00:05:13.730> promote<00:05:14.560> scab<00:05:16.090> which<00:05:17.090> is<00:05:17.510> a<00:05:17.540> potato

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
that can promote scab which is a potato

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.680 
that can promote scab which is a potato
disease<00:05:19.360> not<00:05:20.360> to<00:05:20.480> be<00:05:20.600> confused<00:05:20.990> with<00:05:21.430> callus

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
disease not to be confused with callus

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.930 
disease not to be confused with callus
if<00:05:23.690> you<00:05:23.870> think<00:05:24.110> a<00:05:24.590> scab<00:05:25.010> is<00:05:25.190> what<00:05:25.370> would<00:05:25.670> form

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
if you think a scab is what would form

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.960 
if you think a scab is what would form
after<00:05:26.150> you<00:05:26.450> cut<00:05:26.660> the<00:05:26.690> potato<00:05:27.550> but<00:05:28.550> when<00:05:28.850> you

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
after you cut the potato but when you

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.070 
after you cut the potato but when you
cut<00:05:29.180> the<00:05:29.300> potato<00:05:29.630> on<00:05:29.840> purpose<00:05:30.290> you<00:05:31.220> want<00:05:31.460> it<00:05:31.550> to

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
cut the potato on purpose you want it to

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.940 
cut the potato on purpose you want it to
form<00:05:33.080> a<00:05:33.200> callus<00:05:33.680> before<00:05:34.340> you<00:05:34.460> plant<00:05:35.320> but<00:05:36.320> yeah

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
form a callus before you plant but yeah

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.360 
form a callus before you plant but yeah
so<00:05:37.430> if<00:05:37.580> you<00:05:37.730> add<00:05:37.970> wine<00:05:38.330> or<00:05:38.840> manure<00:05:39.440> or<00:05:40.340> compost

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
so if you add wine or manure or compost

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.040 
so if you add wine or manure or compost
that<00:05:41.210> could<00:05:41.830> promote<00:05:43.240> scab<00:05:44.240> disease<00:05:44.750> on

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
that could promote scab disease on

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.510 
that could promote scab disease on
potatoes<00:05:45.590> so<00:05:45.770> they<00:05:45.860> don't<00:05:46.040> recommend<00:05:46.460> doing

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
potatoes so they don't recommend doing

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.730 
potatoes so they don't recommend doing
that<00:05:48.820> so<00:05:49.820> hopefully<00:05:50.810> I<00:05:51.050> won't<00:05:51.320> have<00:05:51.470> any

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
that so hopefully I won't have any

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.420 
that so hopefully I won't have any
experience<00:05:52.340> with<00:05:52.430> the<00:05:52.730> tail<00:05:52.910> diseases<00:05:53.570> I

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
experience with the tail diseases I

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.380 
experience with the tail diseases I
think<00:05:55.430> whether<00:05:55.610> that's<00:05:55.820> potato<00:05:56.180> bugs<00:05:56.480> -<00:05:58.390> so

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390 
think whether that's potato bugs - so

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.100 
think whether that's potato bugs - so
I've<00:05:59.450> got<00:05:59.630> it<00:05:59.720> watered<00:06:00.020> in<00:06:01.690> and<00:06:02.690> I'll<00:06:02.900> probably

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
I've got it watered in and I'll probably

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.720 
I've got it watered in and I'll probably
have<00:06:03.260> a<00:06:03.380> second<00:06:03.800> raised<00:06:03.950> bed<00:06:04.220> because<00:06:04.460> I<00:06:04.490> have

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:04.730 
have a second raised bed because I have

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.580 
have a second raised bed because I have
some<00:06:04.940> leftover<00:06:07.600> so<00:06:08.600> today's<00:06:08.930> Tuesday<00:06:09.440> April

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590 
some leftover so today's Tuesday April

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.400 
some leftover so today's Tuesday April
17th<00:06:10.400> I've<00:06:10.790> got<00:06:11.030> my<00:06:11.180> Russian<00:06:11.630> banana

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:12.410 
17th I've got my Russian banana

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.030 
17th I've got my Russian banana
fingerling<00:06:13.160> potatoes<00:06:13.850> planted<00:06:14.860> and<00:06:15.860> they'll

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.040 
fingerling potatoes planted and they'll

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.440 
fingerling potatoes planted and they'll
probably<00:06:16.250> have<00:06:16.490> a<00:06:16.550> second<00:06:17.000> raised<00:06:17.180> bed

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:17.450 
probably have a second raised bed

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:21.310 
probably have a second raised bed
because<00:06:17.720> I've<00:06:17.840> got<00:06:18.169> plenty<00:06:18.410> left<00:06:18.560> over<00:06:20.320> this

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:21.320 
because I've got plenty left over this

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.010 
because I've got plenty left over this
