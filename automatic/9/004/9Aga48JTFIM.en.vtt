00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
different buckles abound and it will now

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.469 
different buckles abound and it will now
create<00:02:03.869> two<00:02:04.869> sequence<00:02:05.289> lists<00:02:06.060> for<00:02:07.060> us<00:02:07.149> one<00:02:07.450> for

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
create two sequence lists for us one for

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.080 
create two sequence lists for us one for

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
look at the season Parker so let's just

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.030 
look at the season Parker so let's just
reeling<00:02:19.090> that<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:21.220> equalize<00:02:22.709> right<00:02:23.709> so<00:02:23.890> what

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
reeling that to equalize right so what

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.819 
reeling that to equalize right so what
we'll<00:02:24.190> do<00:02:24.400> now<00:02:24.430> is<00:02:24.610> to<00:02:25.060> do<00:02:26.019> reference<00:02:26.380> assembly

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829 
we'll do now is to do reference assembly

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:30.479 
we'll do now is to do reference assembly
of<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.910> e.coli<00:02:28.299> weeks<00:02:28.890> against<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.069> e<00:02:30.099> coli

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
of the e.coli weeks against the e coli

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.789 
of the e.coli weeks against the e coli
genome<00:02:30.940> reference<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.910> I'll<00:02:33.910> just<00:02:34.090> buy<00:02:34.480> some

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
genome reference and I'll just buy some

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.870 
genome reference and I'll just buy some
default<00:02:35.799> parameters<00:02:36.280> to<00:02:36.430> use<00:02:36.549> in<00:02:36.760> the

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
default parameters to use in the

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.290 
default parameters to use in the
algorithm

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.390 

which<00:02:40.690> is<00:02:40.810> Melanie<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.710> so<00:02:41.860> what<00:02:42.010> happens<00:02:42.280> in

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
which is Melanie and so what happens in

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.950 
which is Melanie and so what happens in
the<00:02:42.460> is<00:02:42.880> that<00:02:44.520> deletes<00:02:45.520> are<00:02:45.850> aligned<00:02:46.720> against

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
the is that deletes are aligned against

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.680 
the is that deletes are aligned against
the<00:02:47.110> reference<00:02:47.430> there<00:02:48.430> in<00:02:48.550> this<00:02:48.730> sorted<00:02:49.510> by

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
the reference there in this sorted by

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.560 
the reference there in this sorted by
land<00:02:50.050> start<00:02:50.380> position<00:02:50.860> and<00:02:51.300> violently<00:02:52.300> the

copy<00:02:53.230> of<00:02:53.320> the<00:02:53.530> reference<00:02:53.860> is<00:02:54.630> annotated<00:02:55.630> with

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
copy of the reference is annotated with

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.010

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
the differences between the deletes and

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:05.040 
the differences between the deletes and
their<00:02:59.260> relevance<00:03:01.020> and<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.910> results<00:03:04.420> the

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
their relevance and the results the

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.100 
their relevance and the results the
analysis<00:03:05.560> should<00:03:06.270> be<00:03:07.270> available<00:03:07.450> in<00:03:08.020> a<00:03:08.080> few

seconds

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.410 

so<00:03:18.190> this<00:03:18.430> is<00:03:18.610> the<00:03:19.470> yes<00:03:20.470> simply<00:03:20.700> object

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
so this is the yes simply object

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.070 
so this is the yes simply object
it<00:03:22.660> shows<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:24.540> reference<00:03:25.540> sequence<00:03:25.900> here

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
it shows the reference sequence here

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.390 
it shows the reference sequence here
annotated<00:03:27.010> with<00:03:27.840> differences<00:03:29.220> it<00:03:30.220> has<00:03:30.370> a

how many we discover that position and
then<00:03:36.370> what<00:03:37.239> we<00:03:37.330> have<00:03:37.480> here<00:03:37.690> are<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:37.959> reads<00:03:38.170> the

invitations<00:05:19.660> so<00:05:20.660> let's<00:05:20.840> try<00:05:21.050> to<00:05:21.080> find<00:05:21.470> some

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
invitations so let's try to find some

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.560 
invitations so let's try to find some
local<00:05:22.130> reasons<00:05:23.830> and<00:05:24.880> you<00:05:25.880> see<00:05:26.090> that<00:05:26.330> if<00:05:26.539> we

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
local reasons and you see that if we

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.620 
local reasons and you see that if we
said<00:05:26.930> that<00:05:26.960> threshold<00:05:27.380> of<00:05:27.680> three<00:05:28.099> so<00:05:28.639> we<00:05:29.360> find

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
said that threshold of three so we find

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.790 
said that threshold of three so we find
just<00:05:29.870> we<00:05:30.530> just<00:05:30.560> find<00:05:31.159> just<00:05:32.289> one<00:05:33.289> low<00:05:33.440> coverage

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
just we just find just one low coverage

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.529 
just we just find just one low coverage
region<00:05:34.220> and<00:05:34.990> it<00:05:35.990> turns<00:05:36.500> out<00:05:36.650> to<00:05:36.800> be<00:05:36.830> a<00:05:36.979> triplet

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:37.539 
region and it turns out to be a triplet

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:42.309 
region and it turns out to be a triplet
outside<00:05:38.539> of<00:05:38.690> any<00:05:39.310> coding<00:05:40.310> regions<00:05:40.960> as<00:05:41.960> defined

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:42.319 
outside of any coding regions as defined

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:44.740 
outside of any coding regions as defined
by<00:05:42.349> this<00:05:42.470> see<00:05:42.770> in<00:05:42.949> CI<00:05:43.310> annotations<00:05:43.849> and<00:05:44.120> so

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
by this see in CI annotations and so

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.170 
by this see in CI annotations and so
probably<00:05:45.320> the<00:05:46.220> sequence<00:05:46.580> DNA<00:05:46.820> is

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
probably the sequence DNA is

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.230 
probably the sequence DNA is
functionally<00:05:47.930> identical<00:05:48.500> to<00:05:49.070> the<00:05:49.220> reference

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.730 

alright<00:05:53.240> thank<00:05:53.570> you<00:05:53.630> for<00:05:53.720> watching<00:05:54.199> hope<00:05:54.710> you

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
alright thank you for watching hope you

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.640 
alright thank you for watching hope you
like<00:05:54.979> what<00:05:55.159> you<00:05:55.250> saw<00:05:55.719> miss<00:05:56.719> 11<00:05:57.110> features<00:05:57.469> to

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
like what you saw miss 11 features to

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.230 
like what you saw miss 11 features to
the<00:05:57.740> workbench<00:05:58.070> and<00:05:58.430> we<00:05:58.550> look<00:05:58.909> forward<00:05:59.150> to

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
the workbench and we look forward to

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:09.439 
the workbench and we look forward to
Melissa<00:05:59.719> and<00:06:00.020> to<00:06:00.560> hearing<00:06:00.800> your<00:06:00.889> feedback

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:09.449
