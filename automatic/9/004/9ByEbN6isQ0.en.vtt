that<00:01:36.860> we<00:01:36.980> had<00:01:37.130> with<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:37.520> device<00:01:37.790> is<00:01:38.030> that<00:01:38.270> they

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
that we had with the device is that they

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.750 
that we had with the device is that they
have<00:01:38.810> added<00:01:39.230> a<00:01:39.350> micro<00:01:39.650> SD<00:01:39.860> card<00:01:40.100> slot<00:01:40.310> which<00:01:40.730> is

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
have added a micro SD card slot which is

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.910 
have added a micro SD card slot which is
on<00:01:41.090> this<00:01:41.270> corner<00:01:41.570> over<00:01:41.600> here<00:01:41.780> but<00:01:42.650> once<00:01:42.830> you

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
on this corner over here but once you

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.650 
on this corner over here but once you
open<00:01:42.950> that<00:01:43.280> up<00:01:43.430> there<00:01:43.700> is<00:01:43.790> absolutely<00:01:44.450> nothing

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
open that up there is absolutely nothing

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.360 
open that up there is absolutely nothing
in<00:01:44.930> there<00:01:45.110> so<00:01:45.140> you<00:01:45.320> can't<00:01:45.530> really<00:01:45.650> add<00:01:45.890> a<00:01:45.920> micro

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
in there so you can't really add a micro

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.370 
in there so you can't really add a micro
SD<00:01:46.610> card<00:01:46.790> into<00:01:46.940> this<00:01:47.120> device<00:01:47.390> which<00:01:48.260> is
