00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.270
 found on the table the former puntonet line 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.290
 today I show a smartphone that I use 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.620
 usually 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.940
 here and then the Neapolitan permits 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.740
 by user roth 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.340
 here is how important it is to use it 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.930
 usually in the nine understand it is like 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.930
 having the phone the eighth does not mean 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.000
 have a phone that is unreliable or that 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.519
 here are problems in general 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.650
 I use the phone as usual 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.070
 even for the job for me it's fine 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.420
 but as it is also to all the others nothing 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.630
 this is posed however to understand to 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.250
 see this non- samsung in detail 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:43.020
 galaxy mega 5.8 dual sim 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.320
 this is an imported model I make you 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.230
 see the box and far you can see 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:54.510
 here the writings are in kasia language 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:57.510
 tina qui net is a ds version of csc 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.710
 different from that and distributed in 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.149
 Europe 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.530
 I would like to see a part charge either 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.629
 different 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.129
 in fact for every smartphone they imported 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.010
 let's avoid see also then with 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.570
 adapter or a power supply such as 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.780
 this 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.259
 so here we are going to see 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.970
 with that our device then the 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.939
 present what they did to me for 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.130
 have user permissions on this 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.140
 smartphone admitted that in the modified 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.659
 we have installed on the partition 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.630
 primary application for management 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.100
 of permits once the new application 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.140
 let's see our application 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.590
 in this case for the management of 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.570
 permits we installed super on that 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.710
 not my opinion has a good application 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.390
 easy to use, reliable as 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.950
 average good is important here 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.060
 install an application 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.399
 permissions for eco viruses and applications 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.930
 malign we say motogp 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.539
 also this application allows 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.509
 also to disable time la 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:03.960
 temporarily user permissions 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.880
 fight on the smartphone to perform a 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.849
 update of the vault and then the 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.360
 quality of later with this 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:15.170
 important not to update the phone 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.269
 maximum security simplicity here 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:22.049
 let's go and see nothing what we said there 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:24.390
 fan the ability of you're allowed on 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:27.180
 smartphone so much people install all 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.180
 those applications that normally do not 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:36.150
 could you install lets me 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:39.599
 also exploit the micro sd for for 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.660
 applications what android it 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:45.360
 allows only partially are not there 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.829
 enabled permission partially chess it 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.680
 only allows for any application 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:52.739
 instead a broken smartphone lies 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.920
 flight we can order here this case 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:58.530
 as a slow asd application then 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.060
 then I'll show you a tour 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.600
 in the above it is however very 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.639
 simple that lets you move them all 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.480
 the applications we want is also the 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:12.030
 video games on a micro sd of this 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.459
 there he will be really useful in 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.540
 how much can you make the most of the 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.420
 your rom memory 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.299
 that's why you can go too 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:25.019
 use a micro sd post then let's see 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:27.480
 that our routes have been 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:31.250
 carried out successfully to do it there 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.250
 that we verify 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:39.250
 here you see here you see that we have i 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.599
 permit god center 8 bad luck but 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.390
 we go to see then we also have them 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.700
 browser 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:50.329
 and here is to go and peek at the fausta 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.980
 folder our signs are system 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.920
 that the operating system 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.450
 and here is important if not experts 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.480
 of new modified android 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.599
 absolutely the system files in 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.670
 how much you will be able not to cause damage 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:06.109
 firmly on the smartphone because that 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.870
 it's hard to stay with 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:12.859
 be careful how much we can re 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:15.139
 install the rom or you may lose the 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:19.250
 customizations for eight install 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:21.160
 everything as it was in originality and for 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.630
 they'll have more marks anyway 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.360
 recommends with changes made 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.449
 if you don't know but the operating system 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.010
 anyway I make changes to the 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.410
 our operating system for example 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.949
 we also manage to reach languages ​​and 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:39.380
 not featured on our rock version 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:42.650
 of samsung here for example a version 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:45.050
 Asian and does not contain Italian we 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.470
 we can easily install it here 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:51.289
 we enable it from the csc while we install 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.669
 and make missing language 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:54.860
 this is an intervention that we can 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:57.949
 run maybe that's why anyway 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.449
 request some experience and oh well 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:03.620
 go on 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:06.380
 here on the site there is a detailed page 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:10.220
 where I summarize all the services and we can 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:12.080
 carry out here we must have have 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.380
 since then we have with ours 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.229
 important management order 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.389
 our application for management 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:22.970
 of the roundabouts we have said is the spring e 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:25.180
 va well we can install programs for 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.880
 important backups 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:31.690
 a backup you will believe you 'll find so much to 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:34.990
 about then super downloads and lets 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:37.630
 to take advantage of the excuse our 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.940
 3g connection of the smartphone 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.160
 I close which together to make 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.699
 download the files this allows 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.919
 have more bandwidth capacity and and is 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:48.850
 important here are some cases always 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:51.220
 naturally 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:56.770
 let's say the server that sends us the 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:06:02.970
 data we have sufficient power for 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:02.970
 sony we say the best then we sing 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:10.930
 as we see what this point is here 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.729
 your smartphone as you see is like of 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.190
 default for English but simply 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:17.050
 the management take and then we can 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:21.430
 go into series applications that 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:24.280
 whatever else is good for me at this point 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:26.169
 I showed a little what it consists of 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.650
 the service of not 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:32.580
 and at this point I greet you and I hope to 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.580
 hear you soon
