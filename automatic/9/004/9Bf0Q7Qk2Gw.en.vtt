important piece of Vancouver's future I

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.569 
important piece of Vancouver's future I
mean<00:00:31.050> obviously<00:00:31.470> we're<00:00:31.740> not<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.920> city<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.399> can

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
mean obviously we're not a city that can

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.880 
mean obviously we're not a city that can
grow<00:00:32.940> in<00:00:33.180> land<00:00:33.450> base<00:00:33.870> anymore<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:34.649> we're<00:00:34.800> gonna

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
grow in land base anymore so we're gonna

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.490 
grow in land base anymore so we're gonna
have<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.130> find<00:00:35.399> new<00:00:35.550> creative<00:00:36.000> solutions<00:00:36.899> to

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
have to find new creative solutions to

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.270 
fit people within the land footprint
that<00:00:39.570> we<00:00:39.750> have<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.320> small<00:00:40.920> works<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.250> a

the<00:00:43.950> premise<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.640> company<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.090> we<00:00:45.239> could

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
the premise of the company that we could

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.119 
the premise of the company that we could
actually<00:00:45.629> create<00:00:46.170> some<00:00:46.530> really<00:00:46.800> dynamic

family housing that wouldn't change the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.100 
family housing that wouldn't change the
neighborhoods<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.520> would<00:00:50.789> allow<00:00:51.120> really<00:00:52.079> a

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
neighborhoods that would allow really a

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.110 
neighborhoods that would allow really a
very<00:00:52.710> dynamic<00:00:52.980> use<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.699> suburban

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
very dynamic use of the suburban

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.939 
very dynamic use of the suburban
landmass<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.960> surrounds<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.530> core<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.770> the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
city so this is one of four models that

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.410 
city so this is one of four models that
we<00:00:58.890> make<00:00:59.070> for<00:00:59.219> Vancouver<00:00:59.789> this<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.300> very

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.340 
face for how the house works one of the
things<00:01:12.090> you'll<00:01:12.210> see<00:01:12.270> behind<00:01:12.630> us<00:01:12.750> here<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.140> what

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
things you'll see behind us here is what

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.440 
things you'll see behind us here is what
we<00:01:13.380> call<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.890> ambient<00:01:14.369> canvas<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:14.880> what<00:01:15.330> it

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
we call the ambient canvas and what it

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.060 
we call the ambient canvas and what it
is<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:15.810> actually<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.380> giant<00:01:16.740> energy

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
is is it's actually a giant energy

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.609 
is is it's actually a giant energy
display<00:01:17.460> meter<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:19.170> actually<00:01:19.409> changes

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
display meter and it it actually changes

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.289 
display meter and it it actually changes
over<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.280> course<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.759> day<00:01:20.939> with<00:01:21.150> your

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
over the course of the day with your

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.179 
over the course of the day with your
energy<00:01:21.630> usage<00:01:21.840> habits<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.799> other<00:01:22.979> thing

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
energy usage habits the other thing

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.770 
energy usage habits the other thing
we've<00:01:23.340> done<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.640> integrated<00:01:24.090> social<00:01:24.299> media

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
we've done is integrated social media

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.749 
we've done is integrated social media
because<00:01:25.380> we'd<00:01:25.710> built<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.070> entire<00:01:26.250> thing<00:01:26.610> on

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
because we'd built this entire thing on

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.760 
because we'd built this entire thing on
a<00:01:26.790> web<00:01:27.030> backbone<00:01:27.540> we<00:01:27.990> can<00:01:28.140> integrate<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.619> your

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
a web backbone we can integrate in your

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.620 
a web backbone we can integrate in your
Facebook<00:01:29.159> page<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.610> your<00:01:29.790> car<00:01:30.030> pooling<00:01:30.299> page

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
Facebook page and your car pooling page

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.440 
Facebook page and your car pooling page
so<00:01:30.930> it's<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.409> symbol<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.460> kind<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:33.000> housing

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
so it's a symbol of a kind of housing

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.719 
so it's a symbol of a kind of housing
video<00:01:34.170> sustainable<00:01:34.829> outcomes<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.400> it's<00:01:35.520> also

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
video sustainable outcomes and it's also

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.270 
video sustainable outcomes and it's also
an<00:01:36.329> important<00:01:36.810> demonstration<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.979> new

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
an important demonstration of new

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.219 
an important demonstration of new
technologies<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.270> can<00:01:39.450> move<00:01:39.600> our<00:01:39.780> housing

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
technologies that can move our housing

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.889 
technologies that can move our housing
stock<00:01:40.500> towards<00:01:41.280> what's<00:01:41.490> called<00:01:41.729> neff<00:01:41.939> zero<00:01:42.240> so

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
stock towards what's called neff zero so

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.210 
stock towards what's called neff zero so
this<00:01:43.020> house<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.259> designed<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.979> be<00:01:44.100> at<00:01:44.189> zero

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
this house is designed to be at zero

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.850 
this house is designed to be at zero
energy<00:01:44.790> house<00:01:45.270> which<00:01:45.600> means<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.990> over<00:01:46.530> the

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
energy house which means that over the
