00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.809 

hello<00:00:06.200> there<00:00:06.500> everyone<00:00:06.770> today<00:00:07.430> we're<00:00:07.670> going

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:07.819 
hello there everyone today we're going

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:10.030 
hello there everyone today we're going
to<00:00:07.939> be<00:00:08.090> building<00:00:08.300> a<00:00:08.630> trapdoor<00:00:09.110> elevator<00:00:09.710> where

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:10.040 
to be building a trapdoor elevator where

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.670 
to be building a trapdoor elevator where
you<00:00:10.250> hold<00:00:10.520> down<00:00:10.730> jump<00:00:11.090> or<00:00:11.270> rapidly<00:00:11.870> press<00:00:12.469> it

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:12.680 
you hold down jump or rapidly press it

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:19.150 
you hold down jump or rapidly press it
so<00:00:13.100> this<00:00:14.059> is<00:00:14.090> my<00:00:14.240> design<00:00:14.750> it<00:00:15.469> is<00:00:16.990> five<00:00:17.990> by<00:00:18.680> three

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
so this is my design it is five by three

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.329 
so this is my design it is five by three
and<00:00:19.640> then<00:00:20.000> it's<00:00:20.180> infinitely<00:00:20.930> stackable<00:00:21.679> with

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:22.339 
and then it's infinitely stackable with

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:27.130 
and then it's infinitely stackable with
these<00:00:22.849> modules<00:00:23.650> so<00:00:24.650> let's<00:00:25.189> get<00:00:25.400> to<00:00:25.699> it<00:00:26.210> you're

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
these modules so let's get to it you're

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.340 
these modules so let's get to it you're
going<00:00:27.980> up<00:00:28.579> up<00:00:29.089> up<00:00:29.419> up<00:00:30.339> and<00:00:31.660> we<00:00:32.660> come<00:00:33.020> to<00:00:33.260> our

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
going up up up up and we come to our

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.380 
going up up up up and we come to our
platform<00:00:33.890> it's<00:00:35.260> it's<00:00:36.260> more<00:00:36.530> for<00:00:36.710> the<00:00:36.860> novelty

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
platform it's it's more for the novelty

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.920 
platform it's it's more for the novelty
and<00:00:38.390> it's<00:00:38.990> more<00:00:39.410> resource<00:00:40.400> friendly<00:00:40.940> for<00:00:41.300> SP

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
and it's more resource friendly for SP

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.310 
and it's more resource friendly for SP
players<00:00:42.230> that's<00:00:42.590> why<00:00:43.010> I<00:00:43.040> built<00:00:43.580> it<00:00:43.880> so<00:00:44.320> that's

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
players that's why I built it so that's

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.940 
players that's why I built it so that's
design<00:00:46.100> that's<00:00:46.520> the<00:00:46.940> design<00:00:47.410> it's<00:00:48.410> very

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
design that's the design it's very

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.910 
design that's the design it's very
compact<00:00:49.550> I've<00:00:49.910> seen<00:00:50.180> another<00:00:50.480> one<00:00:50.750> which<00:00:51.110> has

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
compact I've seen another one which has

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.480 
compact I've seen another one which has
to<00:00:52.160> infinitely<00:00:52.760> loop<00:00:53.150> out<00:00:53.390> and<00:00:53.990> I<00:00:54.890> saw<00:00:55.310> that

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:55.490 
to infinitely loop out and I saw that

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.850 
to infinitely loop out and I saw that
that<00:00:55.700> was<00:00:55.850> inefficient<00:00:56.690> so<00:00:57.260> I<00:00:57.470> made<00:00:57.770> this<00:00:59.860> so

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
that was inefficient so I made this so

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.200 
that was inefficient so I made this so
here<00:01:01.070> we<00:01:01.160> go<00:01:01.190> to<00:01:01.310> the<00:01:01.520> building<00:01:03.699> we<00:01:04.699> start<00:01:05.000> with

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
here we go to the building we start with

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.669 
here we go to the building we start with
our<00:01:05.239> autumn<00:01:05.990> platform<00:01:06.470> and<00:01:06.680> then<00:01:07.490> build<00:01:07.700> up

00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:08.679 
our autumn platform and then build up

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:11.679 
our autumn platform and then build up
just<00:01:09.679> like<00:01:09.799> that<00:01:10.009> as<00:01:10.219> high<00:01:10.490> as<00:01:10.640> you<00:01:10.789> want<00:01:10.820> it<00:01:11.149> or

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
just like that as high as you want it or

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:19.289 
just like that as high as you want it or
can<00:01:11.869> we<00:01:11.929> build<00:01:12.049> it<00:01:12.200> to<00:01:13.009> that<00:01:13.460> level<00:01:14.320> like<00:01:15.320> that

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.639 

okay

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.039 

there<00:01:24.649> we<00:01:24.740> go<00:01:25.090> it's<00:01:26.090> pretty<00:01:26.329> simple<00:01:26.630> for<00:01:26.750> this

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
there we go it's pretty simple for this

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:34.420 
there we go it's pretty simple for this
part<00:01:28.539> okay<00:01:29.539> now<00:01:32.020> directly<00:01:33.020> behind<00:01:33.619> the<00:01:34.070> button

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
part okay now directly behind the button

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.700 
part okay now directly behind the button
you<00:01:34.610> want<00:01:34.759> to<00:01:34.820> put<00:01:34.909> a<00:01:34.939> repeater<00:01:35.360> and<00:01:35.570> then<00:01:36.530> that

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
you want to put a repeater and then that

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.010 
you want to put a repeater and then that
repeater<00:01:37.039> has<00:01:37.310> to<00:01:37.520> split<00:01:37.820> signals<00:01:38.390> this<00:01:38.810> is

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
repeater has to split signals this is

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.130 
repeater has to split signals this is
just<00:01:39.320> to<00:01:39.500> help<00:01:39.619> you<00:01:39.890> jump<00:01:40.429> up<00:01:42.340> okay<00:01:43.340> now<00:01:44.140> now

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
just to help you jump up okay now now

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:52.289 
just to help you jump up okay now now
you<00:01:45.200> do<00:01:45.409> this<00:01:46.539> put<00:01:47.539> that<00:01:47.750> there<00:01:49.390> come<00:01:50.390> here

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
you do this put that there come here

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:59.830 
you do this put that there come here
oops<00:01:53.299> that<00:01:54.049> was<00:01:54.319> unintentional<00:01:57.069> okay<00:01:58.840> right

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
oops that was unintentional okay right

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.830 
oops that was unintentional okay right
there<00:02:00.259> and<00:02:01.030> then<00:02:02.030> as<00:02:02.240> you<00:02:02.270> can<00:02:02.569> see<00:02:02.689> the<00:02:02.810> bottom

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
there and then as you can see the bottom

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.880 
there and then as you can see the bottom
one<00:02:03.229> comes<00:02:03.470> here<00:02:03.590> up<00:02:04.189> and<00:02:05.200> then<00:02:06.200> up<00:02:06.470> and<00:02:06.830> then

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
one comes here up and then up and then

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.430 
one comes here up and then up and then
this<00:02:07.759> one<00:02:07.819> comes<00:02:08.209> up<00:02:08.390> and<00:02:09.069> then<00:02:10.069> up<00:02:10.310> again<00:02:11.440> okay

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
this one comes up and then up again okay

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.039 
this one comes up and then up again okay
and<00:02:12.739> then<00:02:12.890> we<00:02:12.980> move<00:02:13.160> on<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.459> here<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:15.500> here<00:02:17.049> so

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
and then we move on to here and here so

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:24.630 
and then we move on to here and here so
here<00:02:18.590> just<00:02:19.250> like<00:02:19.430> that<00:02:21.459> and<00:02:22.459> then<00:02:22.640> there<00:02:22.910> then

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
here just like that and then there then

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.920 
here just like that and then there then
we<00:02:25.640> move<00:02:25.819> up<00:02:25.970> another<00:02:26.360> layer<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:28.630> do<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.750> same

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
we move up another layer and do the same

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:41.559 
we move up another layer and do the same
thing<00:02:34.780> okay<00:02:35.780> there<00:02:35.959> we<00:02:36.079> go<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:40.359> you<00:02:41.359> keep

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
thing okay there we go and you keep

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.080 
thing okay there we go and you keep
doing<00:02:41.989> this<00:02:42.170> so<00:02:42.709> it's<00:02:43.100> pretty<00:02:43.370> simple<00:02:43.670> I'll

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
doing this so it's pretty simple I'll

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.240 
doing this so it's pretty simple I'll
continue<00:02:44.480> it<00:02:44.750> all<00:02:44.959> the<00:02:45.139> way<00:02:45.230> up<00:02:45.380> just<00:02:45.980> for

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
continue it all the way up just for

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.400 
continue it all the way up just for
demonstration<00:02:46.459> purposes<00:02:47.269> but<00:02:47.630> you<00:02:48.200> really

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
demonstration purposes but you really

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.340 
demonstration purposes but you really
don't<00:02:48.590> have<00:02:48.799> to<00:02:48.889> watch<00:02:49.100> the<00:02:49.400> rest<00:02:49.780> as<00:02:50.780> long<00:02:51.019> as

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
don't have to watch the rest as long as

00:02:51.350 --> 00:03:02.080 
don't have to watch the rest as long as
you<00:02:51.530> have<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.680> core<00:02:56.319> there<00:02:57.319> we<00:02:57.440> go<00:03:00.430> and<00:03:01.430> again

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
you have the core there we go and again

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.080 
you have the core there we go and again
and<00:03:02.410> Ramos<00:03:03.410> not<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.709> top<00:03:03.920> this<00:03:04.430> should<00:03:04.819> be<00:03:04.940> the

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
and Ramos not the top this should be the

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:17.860 
and Ramos not the top this should be the
last<00:03:05.120> iteration<00:03:07.389> we<00:03:08.389> go<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.930> we're<00:03:12.920> done<00:03:16.870> so

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
last iteration we go and we're done so

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.400 
last iteration we go and we're done so
this<00:03:18.049> is<00:03:18.230> an<00:03:18.380> extremely<00:03:19.010> simple<00:03:19.549> elevator<00:03:20.410> and

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
this is an extremely simple elevator and

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.800 
this is an extremely simple elevator and
it's<00:03:22.040> perfect<00:03:22.489> for<00:03:22.519> SMP<00:03:22.910> because<00:03:23.359> it<00:03:23.510> doesn't

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
it's perfect for SMP because it doesn't

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.349 
it's perfect for SMP because it doesn't
use<00:03:23.959> all<00:03:24.109> the<00:03:24.230> slime<00:03:24.500> balls<00:03:24.859> that<00:03:25.670> Pistons<00:03:26.120> use

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
use all the slime balls that Pistons use

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:30.490
