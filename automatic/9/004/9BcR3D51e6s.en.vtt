00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
eyeshadows how when you get it wet it's

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.250 
eyeshadows how when you get it wet it's
like<00:03:57.660> super<00:03:58.230> foil<00:03:58.739> II<00:03:58.980> and<00:03:59.190> like<00:03:59.459> I<00:03:59.900> don't<00:04:00.900> know

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
like super foil II and like I don't know

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.050 
like super foil II and like I don't know
I<00:04:01.290> just<00:04:01.560> love<00:04:02.160> it

I just love it

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.530 
I just love it
so<00:04:04.060> then<00:04:04.330> as<00:04:04.659> far<00:04:05.200> as<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:06.280> edge<00:04:06.519> goes<00:04:07.060> here<00:04:07.420> I'm

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
so then as far as the edge goes here I'm

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.300 
so then as far as the edge goes here I'm
going<00:04:07.659> to<00:04:07.750> take<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:08.079> on<00:04:08.319> the<00:04:08.860> brush<00:04:09.069> that<00:04:09.250> I

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
going to take the on the brush that I

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.030 
going to take the on the brush that I
use<00:04:09.489> to<00:04:09.519> apply<00:04:09.790> the<00:04:10.299> red<00:04:10.959> shade<00:04:11.260> originally

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
use to apply the red shade originally

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.940 
use to apply the red shade originally
and<00:04:12.250> I'm<00:04:12.340> going<00:04:12.610> to<00:04:12.670> blend<00:04:13.090> that<00:04:13.569> edge<00:04:13.900> so<00:04:14.799> it's

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
and I'm going to blend that edge so it's

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.620 
and I'm going to blend that edge so it's
all<00:04:15.220> nice<00:04:15.610> and<00:04:16.000> soft

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.540 

and<00:04:20.810> again<00:04:21.440> that<00:04:21.620> will<00:04:21.739> emphasize<00:04:22.220> a<00:04:22.250> little

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
and again that will emphasize a little

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.100 
and again that will emphasize a little
bit<00:04:22.640> of<00:04:22.730> that<00:04:22.820> red<00:04:23.030> now<00:04:23.180> see<00:04:23.450> how<00:04:23.630> I<00:04:23.660> have<00:04:23.960> the

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
bit of that red now see how I have the

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.930 
bit of that red now see how I have the
bright<00:04:24.470> shocking<00:04:25.040> purple<00:04:25.430> right<00:04:25.550> there<00:04:25.760> and

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
bright shocking purple right there and

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.940 
bright shocking purple right there and
then<00:04:26.360> it<00:04:26.540> fades<00:04:26.780> up<00:04:26.960> into<00:04:27.260> that<00:04:27.380> kind<00:04:27.710> of<00:04:27.740> like

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
then it fades up into that kind of like

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.730 
then it fades up into that kind of like
sunrise<00:04:28.820> or<00:04:29.180> sunset<00:04:29.210> of<00:04:29.720> like<00:04:30.050> the<00:04:30.230> red<00:04:30.440> and

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
sunrise or sunset of like the red and

then<00:04:31.190> the<00:04:31.340> transition<00:04:31.850> shade<00:04:31.970> in<00:04:32.150> the<00:04:32.240> my<00:04:32.330> skin

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
then the transition shade in the my skin

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.200

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
tone I like that I'm going to take that

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.750 
tone I like that I'm going to take that
same<00:04:35.480> pigment<00:04:36.050> and<00:04:36.380> just<00:04:36.770> put<00:04:37.250> a<00:04:37.280> little<00:04:37.370> bit

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
same pigment and just put a little bit

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.380

in<00:04:37.970> the<00:04:38.120> inner<00:04:38.270> corners<00:04:38.930> just<00:04:39.350> to<00:04:40.120> make<00:04:41.120> them<00:04:41.330> a

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
in the inner corners just to make them a

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
in the inner corners just to make them a
little<00:04:41.780> bit<00:04:42.050> more<00:04:42.410> intense<00:04:43.100> and<00:04:43.490> bright

little bit more intense and bright

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.300

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
in the inner corners here shouldn't be a

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.750 
in the inner corners here shouldn't be a
whole<00:04:53.810> lot<00:04:53.840> of<00:04:54.110> it<00:04:54.230> there<00:04:54.380> anyway<00:04:54.890> go<00:04:55.280> back<00:04:55.490> to
