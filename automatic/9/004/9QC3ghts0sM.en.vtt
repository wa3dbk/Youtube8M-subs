like<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.260> for<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.530> little<00:01:07.680> while<00:01:08.330> and<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.540> just

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
like that for a little while and I just

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.170 
like that for a little while and I just
got<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.580> cat<00:01:11.790> on<00:01:12.000> it

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
got the cat on it

00:01:12.180 --> 00:02:01.480 
got the cat on it
so<00:01:12.330> now<00:01:12.479> it's<00:01:12.750> pretty<00:01:13.080> much<00:01:13.170> straight

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.530
