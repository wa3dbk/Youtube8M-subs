did<00:03:51.430> I<00:03:51.579> guess<00:03:51.730> drafting<00:03:52.239> those<00:03:52.390> coming<00:03:52.810> to

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
did I guess drafting those coming to

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.149 
did I guess drafting those coming to
play<00:03:53.079> a<00:03:53.109> little<00:03:53.379> bit<00:03:53.500> here<00:03:53.650> yeah<00:03:53.920> you<00:03:53.980> could

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:54.159 
play a little bit here yeah you could

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:55.440 
play a little bit here yeah you could
definitely<00:03:54.340> use<00:03:54.609> the<00:03:54.730> draft<00:03:54.969> you're<00:03:55.150> up<00:03:55.239> about

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
definitely use the draft you're up about

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.449 
definitely use the draft you're up about
180<00:03:56.049> miles<00:03:56.260> an<00:03:56.439> hour<00:03:56.590> before<00:03:57.069> you<00:03:57.189> start

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
180 miles an hour before you start

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:58.740 
180 miles an hour before you start
getting<00:03:57.730> on<00:03:57.790> the<00:03:57.849> brakes<00:03:58.090> and<00:03:58.359> start<00:03:58.569> down

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
getting on the brakes and start down

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.089 
getting on the brakes and start down
shifting<00:03:59.170> so<00:03:59.319> you<00:03:59.379> can<00:03:59.590> definitely<00:03:59.739> use<00:04:00.069> that

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
shifting so you can definitely use that

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:01.790 
shifting so you can definitely use that
to<00:04:00.430> your<00:04:00.519> advantage

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
egg see Ambrose he just makes a peak

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.630 
egg see Ambrose he just makes a peak
every<00:04:04.140> time<00:04:04.320> they<00:04:04.440> get<00:04:04.560> to<00:04:04.710> a<00:04:04.740> corner<00:04:04.980> but<00:04:05.310> I

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
every time they get to a corner but I

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.400 
every time they get to a corner but I
don't<00:04:06.330> think<00:04:06.600> you're<00:04:06.870> gonna<00:04:06.960> see<00:04:07.140> a<00:04:07.170> lot<00:04:07.350> of

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
don't think you're gonna see a lot of

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.020 
don't think you're gonna see a lot of
aggressive<00:04:07.770> moves<00:04:08.160> this<00:04:08.370> early<00:04:08.730> in<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:08.880> race

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
aggressive moves this early in the race

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.610 
aggressive moves this early in the race
I<00:04:09.270> think<00:04:09.480> the<00:04:09.570> thing<00:04:09.750> is<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:10.080> thief<00:04:10.230> they<00:04:10.500> just

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
I think the thing is the thief they just

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.050 
I think the thing is the thief they just
want<00:04:10.740> to<00:04:10.770> stay<00:04:10.950> in<00:04:11.100> line<00:04:11.250> here<00:04:11.460> stay<00:04:11.640> caught<00:04:11.850> up

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
want to stay in line here stay caught up

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.850 
want to stay in line here stay caught up
they're<00:04:12.510> actually<00:04:12.840> letting<00:04:13.050> Kirk<00:04:13.320> Bush<00:04:13.590> get

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
looking inside of gaps like he's got an

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.060 
looking inside of gaps like he's got an
