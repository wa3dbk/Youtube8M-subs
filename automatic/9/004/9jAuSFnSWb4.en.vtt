00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.430
 childish play is not necessarily something 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.380
 not interesting and probably the most flattering 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.390
 a compliment for such a project is when 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.540
 and an adult gamer with pleasure in it 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.490
 chopped remember any roof spyro 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.680
 or for example a series of lego games 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.289
 they all lured the players without any problems 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.420
 of any age and here at the newly minted 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.670
 console playstation 4 goes nick 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.230
 which judging by the first view yet 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.480
 may interest someone 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:41.180
 older than elementary school so let's 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:45.650
 see if he succeeded in it 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.659
 all discuss the plot of the story here such 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.089
 people learned to use the power of the ancients 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:52.070
 relics for energy production though 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:53.809
 about these relics themselves and little of what 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.790
 was known they were just found in 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.830
 caves around the world and here in one of 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.290
 such a catacomb one professor found 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.269
 some special artifact that could 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.379
 manage relics and also possessed 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:07.010
 own consciousness 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:09.320
 this was our main character not only 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.600
 he will introduce you to him right away 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.700
 go to hell to kill the evil 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.380
 goblins who got hold of tanks somewhere 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.630
 and airplanes and began to attack cities 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.939
 people incidentally still from their human 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.979
 companions are plotting something bad 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.859
 this is the way to fight these two 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.229
 front alternately company will be niku 

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:29.420
 make up a professor that found him and yet 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.969
 two assistants and here I allow myself 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.070
 go to the disadvantages because you do not 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:36.789
 something that not enough in what has always been 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.499
 the appeal of games of a similar genre in 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.219
 characters remember again crash 

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:42.530
 bandicoot 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:45.140
 he said nothing to no one 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.210
 communicated but his grimaces grimaces and even 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.259
 death animations made you love 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.509
 this hero is the same situation with dexter 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:55.520
 not so much a lumberjack but a redhead 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.039
 squirrel from jack and dexter heroes 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.590
 I felt the character and he remembers well 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.179
 here in nike there are no such even 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.859
 polygonal monster is not particularly 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:05.719
 sociable only and that 

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:07.639
 admire some of their new clothes 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:09.770
 but before that we still get the most 

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:10.160
 the main thing is that everything seems to be serious 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.500
 soup 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.930
 That is, the game looks like three-dimensional 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.450
 cartoon someone dreamworks but 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.690
 this is no joke even a hint of them 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.730
 no 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.830
 if in terms of the history of heroes nick is pretty 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.500
 much inferior to their fellow genre 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.100
 then with the gameplay all a bit 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.500
 better 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.090
 the base part is fights usually 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.700
 have to deal with a couple of three 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.460
 enemies that need to be clean face there 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.360
 ordinary kick and unusual 2 split 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.490
 another 3 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.530
 either damage around the radius is applied 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.170
 either they are turning into small 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.120
 tornado or throws pieces of his 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.940
 body over long distances striking immediately 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.010
 several opponents use them 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.140
 can not always only if you have accumulated 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.880
 a certain amount of amber crystals 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.310
 which is plentifully scattered throughout 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.870
 levels besides them are still boxes with 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.610
 relics which are not only 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.290
 restore lost life but also 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.020
 increase their maximum number a 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.150
 also in other words the more nick 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.870
 collects pieces of himself the more he 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.150
 becomes 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.920
 and maybe from my tiny state 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.870
 grow to house size 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.240
 just a few minutes ago you 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.490
 feared little bugs with bather nym 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:22.810
 engine and now no problems with the pair 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:24.640
 hooks you carry huge robots not 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.260
 embarrassed nickname use instead 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.840
 relics and other similar in form 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.989
 items can become glass 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.030
 wood and tin are missing only 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.190
 windy and windless in all these 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.959
 add-ons don't just change a bit 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.910
 appearance of the hero but also add 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.160
 some additional features 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.500
 wood can catch fire metal will 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.270
 to attract magnets the ice will melt 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.570
 in the sun glass does not give security 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.700
 laser notice you and there is still 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.920
 much more variety not cop 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.290
 emerald diamonds and so on 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.480
 only to unlock them is necessary 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.920
 collect special collectible stones 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.330
 which are hidden in special 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.100
 collectible chests which 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.110
 hiding behind special secret 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.580
 walled-up walls there you can still 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.680
 find pieces of additional devices 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.390
 gathering which is completely possible again 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.750
 did add some new chips 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.670
 for the main character and the whole it is 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.470
 all gameplay and again you can 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.140
 to complain because he very much 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.300
 monotonous it turns out good games 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.580
 This type of stages with fights alternate with 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.260
 stages of platform jumps races and 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.600
 other acrobatic etudes 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.620
 but here it is such a miser that they can not 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.840
 perceive them 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.970
 and because of this it is worth perceiving 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.520
 seriously so these are enemies and complexity 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.440
 foes so many varieties like 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.810
 no wonder everyone has to look 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.940
 own approach since dies nick 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.370
 from a pair of buttings even in your very 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.310
 formidable not only enemies do not attack 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.110
 one by one and a whole crowd and believe me even 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.910
 on the normal go through everything not 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.310
 get and die have enough 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.889
 many times and go through the same places 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.750
 also because the bag with checkpoints 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:00.820
 early development was half empty 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.470
 so that and they put on pretty 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.720
 decent distance from each other 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.699
 sometimes three or four battles divide 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.330
 save points and here it is a lot 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:12.910
 and here we come to disappointing 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.410
 ending story though it is but without 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.720
 interesting heroes of humor 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.699
 and the gameplay is squabbling and makes 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.800
 sweat but monotonous and and can quickly 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:22.510
 bother with all this gathering 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.530
 additional things are unlikely to be 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.630
 many engage 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.680
 and even more so pereprohodit new game 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:32.740
 Nick type laudable zeal yes no it 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.810
 just prohodnyak exactly what at once 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.060
 the toy is quite rolling but in memory 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.530
 long stay and hardly you 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.530
 want to go through it again
