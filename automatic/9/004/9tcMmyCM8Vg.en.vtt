 I would like to tell you about the fashion which 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.740

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.650
 will add 20 new types of wolves this 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.750

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.880
 then you and the wolf is exactly what it is called and 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.039
 I'll say right away that all wolves can 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.140
 tame like this for a long time 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.090
 tormented and he will converge she is copper 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.340
 let's plant him here let's 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.800
 look further who is our next wolf 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.540
 the next wolf is black black 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.760
 black wolf which is called 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.290
 if it turns out that it is coal wolf 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.450
 I honestly don't remember how it is 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.850
 translated but it is really black and 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.160
 you can also tame it 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.620
 further what's next for the wolf here 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.350
 We are a creeper wolf and it is better not to touch 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.300
 because he will explode he will explode 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.199
 if you attack him look 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.989
 on attractive face 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.090
 how cute when two wolves beat each other 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.190
 and by the way from each wolf that falls 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.920
 the element from which it is made that is 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.840
 for example from the creeper wolves will fall out 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.000
 actually pores look further on 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.540
 us is a wolf which if i don't 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.729
 am wrong 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.409
 diamond therefore falls out of it 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.330
 diamond let's tame it 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.340
 for we will have another diamond 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.890
 cassidy black wolf so on we have 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.720
 there is a wolf which is earthen the most 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.640
 ordinary earthwolf forgive 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.159
 well, not enough to fall from it 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.470
 well he is so cute damn it 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.659
 We are a wolf who is a little unusual 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.009
 this lime wolf itself is like this 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.960
 here he looks out of him 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.229
 actually know what falls out of it 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.159
 falls out to the layers i.e. slime farther 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.829
 we go all 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.390
 enter if i'm not mistaken wolf ask 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.549
 forgiveness for sometimes stumbling 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.649
 by the way if you tamed the interval to something 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.670
 he will have such green eyes and this 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.560
 will be your darling 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.450
 the interval that will be possible 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.700
 teleport so be careful with 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.649
 him further we look at the wolf which 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.140
 fiery he can be found only in hell 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.759
 and you can also tame it 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.409
 own light you can call it 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.780

 said began of them falls that 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.560
 the element with which it is not necessary that is, if 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.599
 you will kill this nice golden one 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.400

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.530
