00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 today when the TV gets thinner and 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.660
 lighter than some pictures on their wall 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.160
 less than half of buyers for 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.420
 many are just more accustomed to put 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.700
 TV on the dressers 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.160
 shelves and other furniture but how to make it 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.450
 steady but infinitely enlarged legs 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.150
 impossible they will become too 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.630
 cumbersome solution offered by the company 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.630
 sony will present the concept in edge 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.760
 implemented in the w 95 series is 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.609
 a new form of the devices themselves in cross section 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.009
 resembling pyramids in 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.500
 stands for white edge that is 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.719
 wide edges of the tv made for this 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.809
 sheriff profile concept than ordinary 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.149
 but not over the entire height and bottom only when 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.219
 this thickness of the shell in the bottom 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.829
 slightly more than the flagship 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.989
 last yearâ€™s models but the main thing is 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.420
 how new tvs are arranged 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.579
 because of the special profile of the special legs 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.460
 and the location of the components inside the center 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.170
 gravity they have shifted down from which the whole 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.480
 the design has gained astounding 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.940
 stability while it takes 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.610
 less space than models with 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.380
 traditional leg thickness increase 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.030
 housing allowed to accommodate more 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.189
 high quality speakers with acoustic 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.799
 maze to improve the transmission of the lower 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.210
 frequencies but the main change is higher 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.640
 sony tv concerns quality 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.060
 images are not exactly new

 technology extender give a moment earlier by 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.720
 Essentially this is a new highlight to the panel 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.330

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.189
 local dimming of the screen from what 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.320
 the contrast increases several times 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.689
 what is real in one frame 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.520
 they are dynamic to evaluate not needed 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.770
 measuring sand enough just 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.710
 any concert also in the backlight 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.869
 Awl technology applied and - 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.640
 giving the flowers a special saturation from 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.250
 such a picture is difficult to look away 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.380
 nature helmets carnivals evening streets 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.830
 will conquer anyone who appreciates quality 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.500
 portray 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.360
 they are and given the availability of beautiful media
