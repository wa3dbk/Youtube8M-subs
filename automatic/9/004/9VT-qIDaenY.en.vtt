00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.940 
can see so it's just like the max planck
track<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.300> there<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.780> think<00:01:43.409> it's<00:01:43.619> like<00:01:43.770> good

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
track I there I think it's like good

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.240 
track I there I think it's like good
lines<00:01:44.220> but<00:01:44.580> same<00:01:45.149> thing<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:46.160> honestly<00:01:47.160> really

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
lines but same thing I honestly really

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.760

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
like using liquid eyeliner pins right

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.340 
like using liquid eyeliner pins right
now<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:50.190> think<00:01:50.280> they're<00:01:50.789> really<00:01:51.119> easy<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:52.320> use

now I think they're really easy to use

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.740 
now I think they're really easy to use
but<00:01:52.920> it's<00:01:53.550> just<00:01:53.789> going<00:01:53.910> to<00:01:53.940> get<00:01:54.119> me<00:01:54.360> into<00:01:54.570> the
