could<00:03:53.489> just<00:03:53.670> take<00:03:53.879> it<00:03:53.939> and<00:03:55.250> push<00:03:56.250> it<00:03:56.400> in<00:03:56.519> and<00:03:56.730> it

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
could just take it and push it in and it

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.979 
could just take it and push it in and it
works<00:03:56.970> so<00:03:58.010> this<00:03:59.010> is<00:03:59.220> a<00:03:59.250> three<00:03:59.670> button<00:04:00.090> kind<00:04:00.840> of

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
works so this is a three button kind of

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.690 
works so this is a three button kind of
mouse<00:04:01.170> i<00:04:01.500> mean<00:04:01.709> you<00:04:01.769> can<00:04:01.920> use<00:04:02.099> it<00:04:02.250> with<00:04:02.370> 3d

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
mouse i mean you can use it with 3d

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.580 
mouse i mean you can use it with 3d
programs<00:04:03.239> like<00:04:03.450> maya<00:04:03.720> i<00:04:04.110> mean<00:04:04.290> i've<00:04:04.349> tested

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
programs like maya i mean i've tested

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.890 
programs like maya i mean i've tested
with<00:04:04.860> maya<00:04:05.099> works<00:04:05.489> so<00:04:06.180> this<00:04:06.450> is<00:04:06.629> will<00:04:06.750> be<00:04:06.870> the

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
with maya works so this is will be the

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.619 
with maya works so this is will be the
left<00:04:07.769> click<00:04:08.010> of<00:04:08.159> course<00:04:08.370> and<00:04:08.640> then<00:04:09.060> this

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629 
left click of course and then this

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:12.170 
left click of course and then this
button<00:04:09.900> right<00:04:10.080> here<00:04:10.439> is<00:04:11.069> the<00:04:11.730> middle<00:04:11.970> click

button right here is the middle click
and<00:04:12.500> right<00:04:13.500> click<00:04:13.769> so<00:04:14.430> it's<00:04:14.580> basically<00:04:14.849> like<00:04:14.970> a

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
and right click so it's basically like a

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.530 
and right click so it's basically like a
three<00:04:15.540> button<00:04:15.780> Mouse<00:04:16.139> except<00:04:16.620> it's<00:04:16.919> like<00:04:17.130> this

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
three button Mouse except it's like this

right here like once called of course

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.700 
right here like once called of course
the<00:04:35.060> driver<00:04:35.330> and<00:04:35.690> other<00:04:35.960> names<00:04:36.080> call<00:04:36.290> flicks

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
the driver and other names call flicks

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.920 
the driver and other names call flicks
that<00:04:37.400> what<00:04:37.760> that<00:04:37.790> does<00:04:37.940> it<00:04:38.300> enables<00:04:38.750> you<00:04:38.870> to

go try it out I haven't modified any
settings<00:04:59.000> in<00:04:59.120> Photoshop<00:04:59.600> so<00:05:00.050> let's<00:05:00.290> create<00:05:00.530> a

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
settings in Photoshop so let's create a

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:09.280 
settings in Photoshop so let's create a
new<00:05:00.740> project<00:05:02.410> okay<00:05:03.610> and<00:05:04.610> let's<00:05:04.820> zoom<00:05:05.090> in<00:05:08.290> okay

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
new project okay and let's zoom in okay

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.730 
new project okay and let's zoom in okay
now<00:05:09.680> let's<00:05:09.920> see<00:05:10.130> the<00:05:10.310> brush<00:05:10.810> this<00:05:11.810> thing<00:05:12.080> this

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
now let's see the brush this thing this

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.570 
now let's see the brush this thing this
tablet<00:05:13.130> has<00:05:13.360> 100<00:05:14.390> I<00:05:14.600> mean<00:05:15.070> 1024<00:05:16.070> levels<00:05:16.280> of

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
tablet has 100 I mean 1024 levels of

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.580 
tablet has 100 I mean 1024 levels of
sensitivity<00:05:16.900> that's<00:05:17.900> what<00:05:18.080> it<00:05:18.170> says<00:05:18.350> but

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
sensitivity that's what it says but

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.740 
sensitivity that's what it says but
let's<00:05:18.950> try<00:05:19.130> it<00:05:19.220> out<00:05:19.370> this<00:05:20.000> by<00:05:20.300> the<00:05:20.360> way<00:05:20.510> this<00:05:20.630> is

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
let's try it out this by the way this is

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.520 
let's try it out this by the way this is
my<00:05:20.810> first<00:05:20.840> tablet<00:05:21.590> so<00:05:21.950> I'm<00:05:22.280> not<00:05:22.430> sure<00:05:22.490> how<00:05:22.640> it's

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
my first tablet so I'm not sure how it's

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.210 
my first tablet so I'm not sure how it's

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
working so yeah you can see there's

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.810 
working so yeah you can see there's
variable<00:05:29.120> pressure<00:05:29.450> levels<00:05:30.020> and<00:05:31.010> thickness

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
variable pressure levels and thickness

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.940 
variable pressure levels and thickness
when<00:05:32.120> you<00:05:32.240> do<00:05:32.450> press<00:05:32.690> at<00:05:32.870> different<00:05:34.090> strengths

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
when you do press at different strengths

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.500 
when you do press at different strengths
there<00:05:36.950> you<00:05:37.070> go<00:05:37.250> I<00:05:37.460> really<00:05:38.120> don't<00:05:38.270> know<00:05:38.390> I'm

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
there you go I really don't know I'm

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.850 
there you go I really don't know I'm
drawing<00:05:38.840> you<00:05:38.930> I'm<00:05:39.020> just<00:05:39.140> testing<00:05:39.590> out<00:05:39.680> the

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
drawing you I'm just testing out the

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.490 
drawing you I'm just testing out the
brush<00:05:42.670> so<00:05:43.670> it<00:05:43.850> works<00:05:44.000> pretty<00:05:44.120> well<00:05:44.270> and<00:05:44.690> it

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
brush so it works pretty well and it

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.410 
brush so it works pretty well and it
also<00:05:45.650> works<00:05:45.980> in<00:05:46.190> Maya<00:05:46.580> if<00:05:46.910> you're<00:05:47.030> doing<00:05:47.240> any

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:47.420 
also works in Maya if you're doing any

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.320 
also works in Maya if you're doing any
3d<00:05:47.720> programs<00:05:48.230> because<00:05:48.830> you<00:05:49.760> still<00:05:50.000> have<00:05:50.150> like

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
3d programs because you still have like

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.310 
3d programs because you still have like
a<00:05:50.390> mouse<00:05:50.660> in<00:05:50.690> your<00:05:51.020> hand

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
so let's go over to Miele see if okay

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.300 
so let's go over to Miele see if okay
you<00:06:03.620> can<00:06:03.770> still<00:06:03.980> select<00:06:04.310> faces<00:06:05.060> do<00:06:05.630> your<00:06:05.870> whole

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
you can still select faces do your whole

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.910 
you can still select faces do your whole
keystrokes<00:06:07.310> like<00:06:08.140> it's<00:06:09.140> very<00:06:09.320> easy<00:06:09.500> I<00:06:09.770> don't

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:09.920 
keystrokes like it's very easy I don't

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.220 
keystrokes like it's very easy I don't
know<00:06:10.070> it's<00:06:10.280> very<00:06:10.510> simple<00:06:11.510> to<00:06:11.630> use<00:06:11.840> it's<00:06:12.080> not

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:12.230 
know it's very simple to use it's not

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.680 
know it's very simple to use it's not
like<00:06:12.380> too<00:06:12.680> complicated<00:06:13.220> although<00:06:14.210> I<00:06:14.240> prefer

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690 
like too complicated although I prefer

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.630 
like too complicated although I prefer
using<00:06:14.870> a<00:06:15.050> mouse<00:06:15.260> with<00:06:15.500> 3d<00:06:15.770> programs<00:06:16.190> it's<00:06:16.430> more

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:16.640 
using a mouse with 3d programs it's more

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.480 
using a mouse with 3d programs it's more
uh<00:06:16.670> I<00:06:17.090> don't<00:06:17.480> know<00:06:17.600> means<00:06:17.840> to<00:06:17.960> it<00:06:18.310> but<00:06:19.310> you<00:06:19.370> can

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490 
uh I don't know means to it but you can

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.850 
uh I don't know means to it but you can
still<00:06:19.640> do<00:06:19.850> your<00:06:20.000> simple<00:06:20.660> basic<00:06:21.170> tasks<00:06:21.620> like

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860 
still do your simple basic tasks like

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.530 
still do your simple basic tasks like
pan<00:06:22.610> mean<00:06:23.390> roll<00:06:23.810> whatever<00:06:24.740> that's<00:06:24.860> called<00:06:25.540> pan

so what can I say this tablet's good it
works<00:06:35.220> and<00:06:35.640> of<00:06:36.420> course<00:06:36.630> it's<00:06:36.780> not<00:06:36.900> like<00:06:37.110> as

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:37.320 
works and of course it's not like as

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.580 
works and of course it's not like as
fancy<00:06:37.890> as<00:06:37.920> a<00:06:38.010> Wacom<00:06:38.550> or<00:06:38.790> anything<00:06:39.000> like<00:06:39.240> that

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:39.590 
fancy as a Wacom or anything like that

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.890 
fancy as a Wacom or anything like that
but<00:06:40.590> it<00:06:41.250> gets<00:06:41.370> the<00:06:41.520> job<00:06:41.550> done<00:06:41.790> and<00:06:42.300> this<00:06:42.450> is<00:06:42.510> a

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900
