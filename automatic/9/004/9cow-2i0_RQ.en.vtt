eating<00:00:18.180> that<00:00:18.750> switches<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.740> switches<00:00:20.160> your

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
eating that switches the switches your

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.890 
eating that switches the switches your
body<00:00:20.520> from<00:00:20.789> burning<00:00:21.180> glucose<00:00:21.660> and

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
body from burning glucose and

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.560 
body from burning glucose and
carbohydrates<00:00:22.619> as<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.859> main<00:00:23.400> fuel<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:24.119> burning

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
carbohydrates as a main fuel to burning

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.500 
carbohydrates as a main fuel to burning
ketones<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.590> fats<00:00:25.859> as<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.609> main<00:00:26.939> field<00:00:27.240> for

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
ketones and fats as a main field for

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.620 
ketones and fats as a main field for
your<00:00:27.599> system<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:28.710> our<00:00:29.160> bodies<00:00:29.910> get<00:00:30.150> energy

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
your system so our bodies get energy

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.319 
your system so our bodies get energy
from<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.109> food<00:00:31.320> we<00:00:31.500> intake<00:00:31.890> right<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.940> that

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
from the food we intake right so that

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.150 
from the food we intake right so that
energy<00:00:33.630> could<00:00:34.140> basically<00:00:34.350> come<00:00:34.860> from

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
energy could basically come from

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.569 
energy could basically come from
different<00:00:36.000> different<00:00:36.750> macros<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:38.010> can<00:00:38.370> come

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
different different macros it can come

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.330 
different different macros it can come
from<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.540> main<00:00:39.980> macro<00:00:40.980> which<00:00:41.190> is

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
from the main macro which is

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.250 
from the main macro which is
carbohydrates<00:00:42.030> which<00:00:42.210> everyone<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.079> eating

carbohydrates in very very big amounts

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.100 
carbohydrates in very very big amounts
or<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:46.739> can<00:00:46.950> come<00:00:47.129> from<00:00:47.160> fat<00:00:47.910> which<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:48.989> the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
or it can come from fat which is the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.090 
or it can come from fat which is the
ketogenic<00:00:49.710> diet

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
to try to keep my corpse under 20 grams

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.240 
to try to keep my corpse under 20 grams
so<00:03:28.480> what<00:03:28.660> I<00:03:28.690> did<00:03:28.810> is<00:03:29.140> I<00:03:29.170> start<00:03:29.680> with<00:03:29.739> the<00:03:30.010> pods

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
so what I did is I start with the pods

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.340 
so what I did is I start with the pods
which<00:03:30.520> are<00:03:30.670> already<00:03:31.090> predetermined<00:03:31.420> 20<00:03:32.140> grams

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
which are already predetermined 20 grams

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.850 
which are already predetermined 20 grams
and<00:03:32.590> then<00:03:33.040> I

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
and then I

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.160 
and then I
I<00:03:35.030> calculated<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.240> protein<00:03:36.660> which<00:03:36.840> there<00:03:37.080> is

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
I calculated the protein which there is

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.390 
I calculated the protein which there is
a<00:03:37.200> formula<00:03:37.800> for<00:03:38.010> it<00:03:38.070> and<00:03:38.250> then<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.850> fact<00:03:39.150> I

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
a formula for it and then the fact I

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.920 
a formula for it and then the fact I
deduced<00:03:41.400> from<00:03:41.970> from<00:03:42.360> the<00:03:42.510> whole<00:03:42.690> calculation

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
deduced from from the whole calculation

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.670 
deduced from from the whole calculation
here's<00:03:43.800> how<00:03:44.040> I<00:03:44.070> did<00:03:44.250> it<00:03:44.580> so<00:03:44.880> carbs<00:03:45.420> 20<00:03:45.810> grams<00:03:46.080> we

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
here's how I did it so carbs 20 grams we

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.150 
here's how I did it so carbs 20 grams we
know<00:03:46.860> that<00:03:47.100> carbs<00:03:47.520> are<00:03:47.760> 4<00:03:48.600> calories<00:03:49.320> per<00:03:49.680> gram

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
know that carbs are 4 calories per gram

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.650 
know that carbs are 4 calories per gram
so<00:03:50.960> 20<00:03:51.960> grams<00:03:52.230> times<00:03:52.740> 4<00:03:53.130> is<00:03:53.310> 80<00:03:53.670> calories<00:03:53.910> so

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
so 20 grams times 4 is 80 calories so

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.000 
so 20 grams times 4 is 80 calories so
that's<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.170> amount<00:03:55.380> of<00:03:55.560> calories<00:03:55.980> that

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
that's the amount of calories that

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.370 
that's the amount of calories that
you're<00:03:56.310> going<00:03:56.490> to<00:03:56.550> be<00:03:56.670> getting<00:03:57.030> from<00:03:57.540> eating

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
you're going to be getting from eating

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.610 
you're going to be getting from eating
20<00:03:59.070> grams<00:03:59.310> of<00:03:59.460> carbs<00:03:59.820> again<00:04:00.210> and<00:04:00.420> then<00:04:01.020> protein

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
20 grams of carbs again and then protein

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.180 
20 grams of carbs again and then protein
I<00:04:01.860> calculated<00:04:02.870> 150<00:04:03.870> pounds<00:04:04.260> I<00:04:04.380> divided<00:04:04.920> it<00:04:05.040> by

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
I calculated 150 pounds I divided it by

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.340 
I calculated 150 pounds I divided it by
2<00:04:05.220> point<00:04:05.730> 2<00:04:05.940> which<00:04:06.480> is<00:04:06.720> 2<00:04:08.000> there<00:04:09.000> is<00:04:09.150> 2.2<00:04:09.990> pounds

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
2 point 2 which is 2 there is 2.2 pounds

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.460 
2 point 2 which is 2 there is 2.2 pounds
in<00:04:10.800> one<00:04:11.340> kilogram<00:04:11.700> so<00:04:12.270> we<00:04:12.450> convert<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:13.110> pounds

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
in one kilogram so we convert the pounds

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.590 
in one kilogram so we convert the pounds
to<00:04:13.620> 2<00:04:13.770> kilograms<00:04:14.250> and<00:04:14.459> if<00:04:14.790> this<00:04:14.910> is<00:04:15.120> 68

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
to 2 kilograms and if this is 68

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.990 
to 2 kilograms and if this is 68
kilograms<00:04:15.900> and<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:17.130> recommended<00:04:17.579> daily

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
kilograms and the recommended daily

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.710 
kilograms and the recommended daily
intake<00:04:18.419> for<00:04:19.380> a<00:04:19.410> person<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.130> be<00:04:20.630> following<00:04:21.630> the

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
intake for a person to be following the

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.970 
intake for a person to be following the
ketogenic<00:04:22.079> diet<00:04:22.530> is<00:04:22.740> no<00:04:23.160> more<00:04:23.400> than<00:04:23.520> 1.5<00:04:24.180> grams

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
ketogenic diet is no more than 1.5 grams

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.140 
ketogenic diet is no more than 1.5 grams
per<00:04:25.980> kilogram<00:04:26.610> of<00:04:27.210> body<00:04:27.540> weight<00:04:27.690> a<00:04:28.169> day<00:04:28.830> so<00:04:29.490> we

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
per kilogram of body weight a day so we

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.170 
per kilogram of body weight a day so we
take<00:04:30.419> I<00:04:30.600> didn't<00:04:31.080> go<00:04:31.230> for<00:04:31.500> 1.5<00:04:32.070> because<00:04:33.000> that's

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
take I didn't go for 1.5 because that's

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.020 
take I didn't go for 1.5 because that's
a<00:04:33.330> lot<00:04:33.510> of<00:04:33.570> protein<00:04:33.900> I<00:04:34.290> hope<00:04:34.800> I<00:04:34.950> went<00:04:35.310> for<00:04:35.490> 1.2

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
a lot of protein I hope I went for 1.2

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.930 
a lot of protein I hope I went for 1.2
grams<00:04:36.450> per<00:04:36.960> kilogram<00:04:37.169> so<00:04:37.890> I<00:04:37.919> multiply<00:04:38.610> that<00:04:38.880> by

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
grams per kilogram so I multiply that by

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.040 
grams per kilogram so I multiply that by
68<00:04:39.840> which<00:04:40.080> is<00:04:40.200> 150<00:04:40.860> pounds<00:04:41.160> and<00:04:41.250> it<00:04:41.790> gave<00:04:42.000> me<00:04:42.050> 81

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
68 which is 150 pounds and it gave me 81

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.850 
68 which is 150 pounds and it gave me 81
grams<00:04:43.260> for<00:04:44.250> any<00:04:44.430> 81.6<00:04:45.360> grams<00:04:45.690> per<00:04:46.290> day<00:04:46.560> of

to to be energetic diet if you multiply

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.460 
to to be energetic diet if you multiply

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
that by 4 calories protein has 4

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:56.469 
that by 4 calories protein has 4
calories<00:04:55.680> per<00:04:55.890> gram

it<00:04:57.479> gives<00:04:57.780> me<00:04:57.990> three<00:04:58.200> hundred<00:04:58.470> and<00:04:58.560> twenty<00:04:58.800> six

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
it gives me three hundred and twenty six

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.360 
it gives me three hundred and twenty six

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.610 
point four calories of conserve calories
that<00:05:02.729> you're<00:05:02.880> going<00:05:03.000> to<00:05:03.060> be<00:05:03.229> consuming<00:05:04.229> a<00:05:04.350> day

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
that you're going to be consuming a day

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.460

eighty<00:05:07.770> one<00:05:08.010> point<00:05:08.550> six<00:05:08.910> grams<00:05:09.240> that<00:05:09.450> you're

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
eighty one point six grams that you're

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.960 
eighty one point six grams that you're
going<00:05:09.750> to<00:05:09.780> be<00:05:09.870> eating<00:05:10.050> a<00:05:10.290> day<00:05:10.440> if<00:05:10.650> we<00:05:11.250> add<00:05:11.520> those

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
going to be eating a day if we add those

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.230 
going to be eating a day if we add those
two<00:05:12.390> it<00:05:13.320> gives<00:05:13.530> us<00:05:13.740> four<00:05:13.979> hundred<00:05:14.010> roughly<00:05:14.700> 400

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
two it gives us four hundred roughly 400

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.780 
two it gives us four hundred roughly 400
calories<00:05:15.720> so<00:05:16.110> we're<00:05:16.320> getting<00:05:16.650> 400<00:05:17.220> calories<00:05:17.760> a

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
calories so we're getting 400 calories a

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.930 
calories so we're getting 400 calories a
day<00:05:17.940> from<00:05:18.810> carbs<00:05:19.410> and<00:05:19.560> protein<00:05:19.950> what<00:05:20.460> we<00:05:20.610> do<00:05:20.760> is

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
day from carbs and protein what we do is

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.469 
day from carbs and protein what we do is
we<00:05:21.120> take<00:05:21.330> that<00:05:21.919> 1286<00:05:22.919> which<00:05:23.490> is<00:05:23.700> for<00:05:24.180> the

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
we take that 1286 which is for the

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.050 
we take that 1286 which is for the
female<00:05:24.870> to<00:05:25.050> lose<00:05:25.229> weight<00:05:25.500> we<00:05:26.160> deduct<00:05:26.580> from<00:05:26.940> it

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
female to lose weight we deduct from it

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.790 
female to lose weight we deduct from it
the<00:05:27.180> 4

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
the 4

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.589 
the 4
calories<00:05:28.220> and<00:05:28.430> it<00:05:28.759> gives<00:05:29.000> us<00:05:29.180> how<00:05:29.389> many

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:29.599 
calories and it gives us how many

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:31.300 
calories and it gives us how many
calories<00:05:29.870> we<00:05:30.110> need<00:05:30.379> to<00:05:30.500> be<00:05:30.620> in<00:05:30.800> taking<00:05:31.159> from

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
calories we need to be in taking from

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.040 
calories we need to be in taking from
fat<00:05:31.580> very<00:05:32.090> simple<00:05:32.599> so<00:05:33.020> we<00:05:33.349> take<00:05:33.560> 1286<00:05:34.629> 1286<00:05:35.629> to

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
fat very simple so we take 1286 1286 to

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.920 
fat very simple so we take 1286 1286 to
lose<00:05:36.259> weight<00:05:36.470> -<00:05:37.220> 400<00:05:37.759> 400<00:05:38.300> is<00:05:38.389> the<00:05:38.419> calories

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
lose weight - 400 400 is the calories

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.249 
lose weight - 400 400 is the calories
from<00:05:39.110> the<00:05:39.740> carbs<00:05:40.220> and<00:05:40.340> the<00:05:40.909> protein<00:05:41.569> and<00:05:41.810> it

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:42.259 
from the carbs and the protein and it

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:45.939 
from the carbs and the protein and it
gives<00:05:42.530> me<00:05:42.680> a<00:05:44.289> 886<00:05:45.289> calories

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:45.949 
gives me a 886 calories

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:48.909 
gives me a 886 calories
so<00:05:46.400> that's<00:05:46.840> 886<00:05:47.840> hours<00:05:48.110> you<00:05:48.289> need<00:05:48.409> to<00:05:48.560> intake

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
so that's 886 hours you need to intake

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:51.879 
so that's 886 hours you need to intake
per<00:05:49.159> day<00:05:49.400> for<00:05:50.180> your<00:05:50.419> fat<00:05:50.720> intake<00:05:51.169> if<00:05:51.440> you

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:51.889 
per day for your fat intake if you

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:54.490 
per day for your fat intake if you
divide<00:05:52.220> it<00:05:52.370> by<00:05:52.550> 9<00:05:52.819> because<00:05:53.389> fat<00:05:54.169> has<00:05:54.470> nine

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
divide it by 9 because fat has nine

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.110 
divide it by 9 because fat has nine
calories<00:05:55.069> per<00:05:55.550> gram<00:05:55.580> you<00:05:56.000> get<00:05:56.720> 98<00:05:57.710> grams<00:05:58.400> per

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
calories per gram you get 98 grams per

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.420 
calories per gram you get 98 grams per
day<00:05:59.389> for<00:05:59.870> your<00:06:00.050> fat<00:06:00.259> intake<00:06:00.710> that's<00:06:01.190> how<00:06:01.370> you

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
day for your fat intake that's how you

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:14.379 
how much you want to eat protein but I
do<00:06:12.349> it<00:06:12.620> this<00:06:12.770> way<00:06:13.009> because<00:06:13.580> it's<00:06:13.729> much<00:06:13.940> simpler

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:14.389 
do it this way because it's much simpler

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:17.050 
do it this way because it's much simpler
these<00:06:14.810> ones<00:06:15.080> are<00:06:15.259> predetermined<00:06:15.949> and<00:06:16.430> this

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.060 
these ones are predetermined and this

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.629 
these ones are predetermined and this
one<00:06:17.270> you<00:06:17.389> just<00:06:17.419> deduct<00:06:17.900> these<00:06:18.229> two<00:06:18.520> from<00:06:19.520> the

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:19.639 
one you just deduct these two from the

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:21.909 
one you just deduct these two from the
total<00:06:19.969> calories<00:06:20.449> that<00:06:20.629> you<00:06:20.750> need<00:06:20.930> to<00:06:21.080> intake

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919 
total calories that you need to intake

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:24.430 
total calories that you need to intake
and<00:06:22.159> it<00:06:22.370> gives<00:06:22.580> you<00:06:22.699> the<00:06:22.849> grams<00:06:23.569> of<00:06:23.719> fat<00:06:23.930> so

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 
and it gives you the grams of fat so

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.760 
and it gives you the grams of fat so
pretty<00:06:24.949> much<00:06:25.190> this<00:06:25.460> is<00:06:25.520> how<00:06:25.789> you<00:06:25.849> calculate<00:06:26.210> on

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:26.770 
pretty much this is how you calculate on

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.300 
pretty much this is how you calculate on
your<00:06:27.770> macros<00:06:28.699> and<00:06:29.259> stay<00:06:30.259> in<00:06:30.319> ketosis<00:06:31.009> it's

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:31.310 
your macros and stay in ketosis it's

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.080 
your macros and stay in ketosis it's
good<00:06:31.699> for<00:06:31.969> you<00:06:32.120> read<00:06:32.690> about<00:06:33.020> it<00:06:33.259> research<00:06:33.740> it
