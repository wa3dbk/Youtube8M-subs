00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.780
 in element angels do nothing good and 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.059
 this potter observatory and today had 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.160
 to make a video because today day 2 of 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.710
 May and May 2 is an important date 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.740
 for harry potter's fans 17 years ago 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.100
 happened the battle of hogwarts there in 2 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.320
 May 1998 and even though it has already 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.609
 made a video of this theme last year 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.859
 I find it interesting to do it again 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.140
 because because every year that passes the 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.210
 harry potter fans mature new 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.520
 situations happen new friendships are 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.649
 made and these tributes to me are 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.290
 tributes that should always be made 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.239
 beloved characters who unfortunately 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.010
 fired from us during this battle 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.050
 I think it's important to use the observatory 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.539
 potter for this kind of homage to 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.030
 show fans that the channel is alert 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.260
 to these dates that they are also 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.680
 important to me 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.690
 so today is May 2 17 years of 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.120
 battle of hogwarts and observatory 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.520
 Potter made this homage that you are going 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.729
 see you next and I hope you 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.189
 then follows the homage that the 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.510
 Potter observatory made for 17 years 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.510
 from the battle of hogwarts 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.950
 the game there the game follow and a hero 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.950
 microsoft asked mitchell 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.340
 O 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.120
 ah 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.100
 is the degree of commitment that 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.340
 determines success not number of 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.340
 followers 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.720
 it is not the building is absolutely 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.720
 retired woman said that our mother 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.260
 ah ah 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.220
 nobody 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.220
 may know 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.239
 I swear I did not want to do anyone. 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.280
 cry this time but sometimes it's 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.260
 inevitable when you say goodbye 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.150

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.250
