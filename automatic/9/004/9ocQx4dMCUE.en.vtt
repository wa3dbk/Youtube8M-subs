about<00:00:21.090> going<00:00:21.630> into<00:00:21.930> online<00:00:22.650> after<00:00:23.519> playing<00:00:23.789> my

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
about going into online after playing my

about going into online after playing my
first<00:00:24.240> game<00:00:24.710> was<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.769> scoring<00:00:26.430> system<00:00:26.670> I

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
first game was the scoring system I

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.120 
first game was the scoring system I
think<00:00:28.320> there's<00:00:28.500> going<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.710> be<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.830> lot<00:00:29.099> of

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
think there's going to be a lot of

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.040 
think there's going to be a lot of
controversy<00:00:29.970> around<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.300> scoring<00:00:30.630> system<00:00:30.779> in

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
controversy around the scoring system in

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.690 
controversy around the scoring system in
this<00:00:31.199> as<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.560> can<00:00:31.710> see<00:00:31.890> depending<00:00:32.369> on<00:00:32.489> what

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
this as you can see depending on what

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.660 
this as you can see depending on what
type<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:32.910> hits<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.450> get<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:34.590> will<00:00:34.829> score

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
amount of points if bigger hits you

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.380

get some big points for some big hits
you<00:01:01.079> didn't<00:01:01.350> get<00:01:01.500> recognized<00:01:02.129> for<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.390> think

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
you didn't get recognized for so I think

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.270 
you didn't get recognized for so I think
there's<00:01:03.870> going<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.110> be<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.260> lot<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.500> controversy

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
there's going to be a lot of controversy

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.760 
there's going to be a lot of controversy
floating<00:01:05.760> around<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.150> idea<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.439> point

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
floating around that idea of the point

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.370 
floating around that idea of the point
system<00:01:08.070> we'll<00:01:08.460> see<00:01:08.670> how<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:08.820> works<00:01:08.970> out<00:01:09.360> when<00:01:10.350> I

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
system we'll see how it works out when I

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.200 
system we'll see how it works out when I
first<00:01:10.619> heard<00:01:11.010> about<00:01:11.130> this<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.670> was<00:01:11.790> thinking

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
first heard about this I was thinking

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.480 
first heard about this I was thinking
that<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.630> was<00:01:12.720> just<00:01:12.930> going<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.140> be<00:01:13.369> maybe<00:01:14.369> like

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
that it was just going to be maybe like

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.120 
that it was just going to be maybe like
last<00:01:14.909> one<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.360> live<00:01:15.600> or<00:01:16.020> someone<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.409> cause<00:01:16.740> the

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
last one to live or someone to cause the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.980 
last one to live or someone to cause the
most<00:01:17.310> damage<00:01:17.490> like<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.030> health<00:01:18.360> system<00:01:18.630> not<00:01:18.960> a

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
most damage like a health system not a

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.649 
most damage like a health system not a
point<00:01:19.320> system<00:01:19.610> because<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.759> will<00:01:21.150> see<00:01:21.390> once

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
point system because you will see once

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.300 
point system because you will see once
you<00:01:21.780> die<00:01:21.960> here<00:01:22.200> my<00:01:22.409> health<00:01:22.680> bar<00:01:22.920> on<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.130> bottom

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
you die here my health bar on the bottom

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.450 
you die here my health bar on the bottom
right<00:01:23.640> there<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.150> top<00:01:24.630> part<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.110> wheel

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
right there on the top part of the wheel

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.890 
right there on the top part of the wheel
once<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.580> go<00:01:26.729> down<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.939> zero<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.360> do<00:01:27.689> actually

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
once you go down to zero you do actually

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.490 
once you go down to zero you do actually
respawn<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:28.950> come<00:01:29.939> back<00:01:29.970> into<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.570> Derby

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
respawn and you come back into the Derby

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.460 
respawn and you come back into the Derby
I<00:01:31.530> guess<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.920> would<00:01:32.100> say<00:01:32.630> it<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.960> pretty<00:01:34.200> fun

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
I guess you would say it is a pretty fun

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.810 
I guess you would say it is a pretty fun
game<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.979> think<00:01:35.880> maybe<00:01:36.240> they<00:01:36.540> could<00:01:36.750> add<00:01:37.700> one<00:01:38.700> or

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
game I think maybe they could add one or

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.600 
game I think maybe they could add one or
two<00:01:38.850> more<00:01:39.060> people<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.720> think<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.680> six<00:01:41.189> I

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
two more people I think this is six I

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.940 
two more people I think this is six I
would<00:01:42.210> actually<00:01:42.360> be<00:01:42.630> fine<00:01:42.840> with<00:01:43.020> having<00:01:43.170> ten

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
would actually be fine with having ten

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.010 
would actually be fine with having ten
people<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.640> right<00:01:45.060> here<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.299> do<00:01:45.420> rack<00:01:45.780> up<00:01:45.930> a

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
people in it right here I do rack up a

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.399 
people in it right here I do rack up a
little<00:01:46.259> nice<00:01:46.409> streak<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:47.450> 33<00:01:48.450> terminations<00:01:49.229> in

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409
