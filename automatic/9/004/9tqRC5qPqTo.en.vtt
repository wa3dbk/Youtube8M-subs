00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.039

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.689
 wrist on the inner part of its divo 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:56.610
 the body of her you want the 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.020

 switching off and stand by 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.930
 in this regard I'm going to turn on the 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.450
 device that really starts up 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.890
 few seconds 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.040
 the display is curved so really 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.540
 really nice and at first start there 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.760
 asked to be configured with a 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.800
 samsung gear fit manager then with a 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.310
 device and samsung actually are 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.450
 come out configure it with a hicks e 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.610
 works quite well apart from a few 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.800
 things anyway and I will detail these things 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.480
 in separate video and I will explain how 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.780
 will configure for this to happen 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.770
 dear fit with a device other than 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.480
 a samsung 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.760
 the strap can then be removed 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.910
 if it breaks we can interchange the 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.680
 strap and what else I would say nothing 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.940
 you can challenge themselves to questions within 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.850
 of the comments of this video inside 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.800

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.030
 question which we will answer of course 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.770
 inside the 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.390
 the fence we are going to follow between 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.209
