00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.780
 then the score the pioneer in the industry 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.430
 polymers for agriculture comes 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.920
 bringing news to the fair as well 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.170
 We invite you here so that 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.580
 Everyone come to know you, it's very beautiful. 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.400
 park is very beautiful three ponds 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:32.350
 growing barbarously and we believe 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.350
 that the fair has a great success 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.880
 here at the forest panel headquarters we 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.670
 We received lots of emails from people 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.230
 asking what happens to the togo of the 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.930
 eucalyptus that lies on the ground 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.690
 soon after harvest it spoils the sun 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.550
 after him and I can not tell any more 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.989
 let's go to the consultant's word board 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.989
 the answer you will see now 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.960
 How long has this forest been? 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.479
 been planted for as long as 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.130
 She is 14 months old and today 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.469
 Here is a second courtyard is no longer 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.380
 exactly the first planting was a 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:24.689
 pasture area a according to nodes 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.329
 we had a little unexpected finger 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.039
 event in the area and we have cut 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:31.979
 area with four years old 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.299
 I see that they all stayed here 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:39.030
 first planting right 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:41.429
 How long has it been to take it from here? How 's it going? 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.530
 the planting is 14 months until the 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:44.310
 Crop area and leave ready for 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.280
 planting 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.140
 we take around 60 to 70 days 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.530
 we can say that these few are 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.259
 with 16 months of 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.709
 good pedro frÃ¢ncio cut off the 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.599
 myth that the top is on the ground and ends 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:02.489
 with the soil after you remove the 

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:05.280
 Heaven will not hurt anything else. 

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:07.259
 here we are proving that the stump 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.850
 in fact after a period of 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:13.350
 silence in decay, serving as a 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.239
 nutrients there from nutrition to the 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.519
 plant then it ends up decomposing 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:22.139
 can see that it is practically all of it 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:24.450
 It could have been fine, and that ends the 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:26.639
 knowledge and shows that we 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.970
 we made a reform here in this 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:31.829
 condition is it will serve as nutrients 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.480
 to the plant that is coming 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.340
 roots that are underground is 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.920
 serving as nutrients for the plant 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.530
 beyond the humidity that we have in the soil 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.660
 in this period the humidity that we 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.389
 we have a soil of eucalyptus then ulbra 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.849
 then there are two myths that many 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:50.310
 people do not end up in the 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:53.459
 subject does not know about forest 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.169
 the calypso bi silque culture ends up 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.989
 there denigrating the image of forestry 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:03:00.510
 of a new job work 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.239
 well done a job is very well 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.760
 performed there placing these paradigms 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.919
 there it is as a hindrance to the 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.389
 forestry development in the country outside the 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:12.480
 substrate that is not 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:14.699
 and it looks like it has a substrate that helps me 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.209
 these chickens and the branches and 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:19.290
 leaves is coming from pruning is also 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.329
 an excellent 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.359
 composition of organic matter and also 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:28.049
 is to restore degraded soils and 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:30.299
 this is increasing so is the cycling 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:33.959
 of nutrients in the soil will also return 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:38.329
 the leaves are those leaves the leaves are 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:41.189
 the branches they are is an excellent and 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.420
 compiled and performed throughout this part 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:44.909
 of organic matter 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.799
 I would say the eucalyptus we all talk about 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:49.859
 that ends with the ground it is a 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:52.439
 restoration of soils then restoration 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:54.389
 soil restorer it is an optimizer 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:55.290
 the water resource and all 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.760
 resources 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.310
 forestry is more than 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.859
 proven to be excellent is a 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.959
 excellent investment and she also 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:09.150
 eucalyptus is excellent is an excellent 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:11.129
 positive result for the environment 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.620
 also from the moment that 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:18.799
 and the impact therein also the use of 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.799
 native bushes plus a broken myth 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:33.620
 comes the largest forestry event in 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:39.979
 center west brazil three ponds 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:43.689
 from 10 to 13 April 2012 in the 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:47.830
 the world pulp capital 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:53.090
 lectures and technical visits and news 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:57.620
 in machinery and implements pimps 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:59.689
 all gathered in one place, but the 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:04.699
 opportunity to visit all 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:07.129
 forestry companies in the region planting 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:09.070
 from eucalyptus rocket to 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:11.890
 nurseries 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.290
 a three forest ponds is one 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:18.540
 of the municipal 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:21.430
 three ponds forest panel organization 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.380
 do not leave there that in the next block you 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.460
 will meet the group fought in space 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.000
 business 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.000
 by now
