00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
see we have a big block for it on the

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.970 
see we have a big block for it on the
engine<00:00:24.029> stand<00:00:24.150> here<00:00:24.510> that's<00:00:25.140> got<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.320> new<00:00:25.740> sharp

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
engine stand here that's got a new sharp

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.009 
engine stand here that's got a new sharp
one<00:00:26.310> together<00:00:26.609> we<00:00:27.420> did<00:00:27.570> put<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.689> new<00:00:27.779> set<00:00:27.930> of

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
one together we did put a new set of

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.300 
one together we did put a new set of
bearings<00:00:28.230> immense<00:00:28.560> we<00:00:28.710> want<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:28.949> see<00:00:29.070> what<00:00:29.189> the

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
bearings immense we want to see what the

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.189 
bearings immense we want to see what the
oil<00:00:29.369> parents's<00:00:30.060> one<00:00:30.449> forward<00:00:30.840> before<00:00:30.929> you

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
oil parents's one forward before you

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.130 
oil parents's one forward before you
finish<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.619> bill<00:00:32.270> that<00:00:33.270> mr.<00:00:33.600> gage<00:00:33.780> here<00:00:33.989> he

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
finish the bill that mr. gage here he

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.810 
finish the bill that mr. gage here he
seemed<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.410> demonstrate<00:00:34.890> using<00:00:35.250> plastic

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
seemed to demonstrate using plastic

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.850 
seemed to demonstrate using plastic
needs<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.059> check<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.510> what<00:00:37.410> we<00:00:37.500> did<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.739> we

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
needs to check that what we did is we

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.850 
needs to check that what we did is we
took<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.219> number<00:00:38.579> one<00:00:38.760> mean<00:00:39.660> cab<00:00:39.930> off<00:00:40.170> and

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
took the number one mean cab off and

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.590 
took the number one mean cab off and
we're<00:00:40.950> gonna<00:00:41.040> slip<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.370> plastic<00:00:41.760> age<00:00:41.940> 90

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
we're gonna slip the plastic age 90

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.779 
we're gonna slip the plastic age 90
degrees<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:42.989> partner<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:44.309> we<00:00:44.399> do<00:00:44.550> that

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
degrees to the partner and we do that

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:45.770 
degrees to the partner and we do that
because<00:00:44.940> that's<00:00:45.149> where<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.420> bearings<00:00:45.750> the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
because that's where the bearings the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.600 
because that's where the bearings the
thickest<00:00:46.170> point<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:47.070> bearing<00:00:47.309> actually

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
thickest point the bearing actually

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.639 
thickest point the bearing actually
tapers<00:00:47.940> off<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.600> whip<00:00:48.930> towards<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.350> parting

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
tapers off and whip towards the parting

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:50.900 
tapers off and whip towards the parting
line<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.129> want<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.340> make<00:00:50.430> sure<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.760> take

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
line so you want to make sure you take

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.279 
line so you want to make sure you take
your<00:00:51.059> measurement<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.629> thickest<00:00:51.989> pointer

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
your measurement in the thickest pointer

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.709 
your measurement in the thickest pointer
barrier<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:53.460> go<00:00:53.579> ahead<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.789> put<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.120> plastic

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
barrier so go ahead and put this plastic

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:03.229 
barrier so go ahead and put this plastic
gauge<00:00:54.899> on<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.800> cream<00:00:56.100> champ<00:00:56.340> here<00:00:56.550> here

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.880 

got<00:01:04.239> there<00:01:04.449> and<00:01:05.050> what<00:01:05.199> we're<00:01:05.320> gonna<00:01:05.409> do<00:01:05.620> is<00:01:05.740> put

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
got there and what we're gonna do is put

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.740 
got there and what we're gonna do is put
the<00:01:05.979> mean<00:01:06.159> gift<00:01:06.460> list<00:01:06.729> bearing<00:01:07.120> down<00:01:07.240> and<00:01:07.630> then

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
the mean gift list bearing down and then

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.670 
the mean gift list bearing down and then
we're<00:01:07.900> gonna<00:01:08.020> tour<00:01:08.229> code<00:01:08.380> on<00:01:08.530> the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
we're gonna tour code on the

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.950 
we're gonna tour code on the
manufacturer<00:01:09.250> specification<00:01:12.600> now<00:01:13.600> as<00:01:13.780> you're

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.260 
going to be crushed to the final reading
at<00:01:26.229> that<00:01:26.470> point<00:01:26.740> take<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:27.040> main<00:01:27.220> cap<00:01:27.430> off<00:01:27.670> to

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
at that point take the main cap off to

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.290 
at that point take the main cap off to
use<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.630> scale<00:01:28.900> that's<00:01:29.050> on<00:01:29.229> the<00:01:29.290> past<00:01:29.530> each

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
use the scale that's on the past each

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.109 
use the scale that's on the past each
paper<00:01:31.300> there<00:01:31.660> and<00:01:31.960> they'll<00:01:32.110> give<00:01:32.320> you<00:01:32.350> a<00:01:32.470> man

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
paper there and they'll give you a man

now<00:01:40.740> we<00:01:41.740> have<00:01:42.009> the<00:01:42.250> main<00:01:45.899> captain<00:01:46.899> II<00:01:46.990> can't

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
now we have the main captain II can't

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:48.930 
now we have the main captain II can't
often<00:01:47.500> see<00:01:47.890> what<00:01:48.039> the<00:01:48.130> last<00:01:48.340> of<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.610> treats

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
often see what the last of the treats

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:55.300 
often see what the last of the treats
look<00:01:49.360> at<00:01:49.509> the<00:01:49.630> gauge

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310
