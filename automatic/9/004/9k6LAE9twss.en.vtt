00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
correct number of teeth the minute wheel

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.260 
correct number of teeth the minute wheel
has<00:01:47.710> been<00:01:47.860> replaced<00:01:48.340> with<00:01:48.490> one<00:01:48.850> having<00:01:49.240> the

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
has been replaced with one having the

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.330 
has been replaced with one having the
correct<00:01:49.630> number<00:01:49.899> of<00:01:49.929> teeth<00:01:50.259> now<00:01:50.979> let's<00:01:51.159> verify

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
correct number of teeth now let's verify

00:01:51.340 --> 00:02:08.719 
correct number of teeth now let's verify
that<00:01:51.759> our<00:01:51.970> hand<00:01:52.330> works<00:01:52.630> properly

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:24.050 

okay<00:02:09.479> let's<00:02:09.690> try<00:02:09.810> one<00:02:09.899> more<00:02:10.080> time

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.840 

looks<00:02:24.630> good
