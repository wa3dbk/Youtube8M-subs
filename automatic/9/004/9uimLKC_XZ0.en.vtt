00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
trap in one of the buildings near the

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.690 
trap in one of the buildings near the
roadblock<00:02:53.019> interesting<00:02:54.019> so<00:02:55.010> it<00:02:55.220> seems<00:02:55.430> like

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
roadblock interesting so it seems like

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.509 
roadblock interesting so it seems like
he's<00:02:55.880> trying<00:02:56.239> to<00:02:56.360> contain<00:02:56.870> them<00:02:57.260> and<00:02:57.680> not<00:02:58.220> even

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
he's trying to contain them and not even

00:02:58.519 --> 00:02:59.710 
he's trying to contain them and not even
trying<00:02:58.700> to<00:02:58.850> bother<00:02:59.000> to<00:02:59.180> take<00:02:59.300> the<00:02:59.450> city<00:02:59.660> I

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
trying to bother to take the city I

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.500 
trying to bother to take the city I
think<00:02:59.810> what<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.800> strategy<00:03:01.160> might<00:03:01.700> be<00:03:01.730> set<00:03:02.390> it

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
think what the strategy might be set it

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.380 
think what the strategy might be set it
around<00:03:02.750> that<00:03:02.840> lower<00:03:03.650> VP<00:03:04.250> point<00:03:04.580> that's<00:03:05.060> still

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
around that lower VP point that's still

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.810 
around that lower VP point that's still
