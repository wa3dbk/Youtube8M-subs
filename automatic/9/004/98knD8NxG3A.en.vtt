00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:08.059 

well<00:00:05.879> we<00:00:06.120> felt<00:00:06.509> first<00:00:06.750> of<00:00:06.899> all<00:00:07.049> that<00:00:07.230> that<00:00:07.620> we

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
well we felt first of all that that we

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.860 
well we felt first of all that that we
wanted<00:00:08.370> to<00:00:08.460> prepare<00:00:08.790> one<00:00:09.030> game<00:00:09.240> at<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.389> time<00:00:09.480> so

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
wanted to prepare one game at a time so

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.530 
wanted to prepare one game at a time so
for<00:00:10.080> us<00:00:10.110> this<00:00:10.769> was<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.099> final<00:00:11.280> we<00:00:12.210> got<00:00:12.360> through

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
for us this was the final we got through

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.839 
for us this was the final we got through
one<00:00:12.690> game<00:00:12.900> I<00:00:13.170> think<00:00:14.040> now<00:00:14.190> that<00:00:14.250> I<00:00:14.429> see<00:00:14.700> the

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
one game I think now that I see the

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.730 
one game I think now that I see the
whole<00:00:15.000> game<00:00:15.179> obviously<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:15.809> think<00:00:16.109> we<00:00:16.230> we<00:00:16.560> have

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
whole game obviously I think we we have

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.590 
whole game obviously I think we we have
to<00:00:16.859> play<00:00:17.010> better<00:00:17.190> we<00:00:18.029> have<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.270> play<00:00:18.420> better

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
to play better we have to play better

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.810 
to play better we have to play better
for<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:18.930> long<00:00:19.199> longer<00:00:19.770> period<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.250> time<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.460> think

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
for a long longer period of time I think

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.240 
for a long longer period of time I think
there<00:00:21.300> was<00:00:21.420> some<00:00:21.570> good<00:00:21.600> moments<00:00:21.930> for<00:00:22.230> us<00:00:22.320> but

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
there was some good moments for us but

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.189 
there was some good moments for us but
overall<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.970> think<00:00:24.210> we<00:00:24.420> have<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.630> maintain<00:00:24.779> that

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
overall I think we have to maintain that

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.720 
overall I think we have to maintain that
for<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.410> longer<00:00:25.590> period<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.949> time<00:00:26.039> if<00:00:26.340> we're

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
for a longer period of time if we're

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.769 
for a longer period of time if we're
going<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.880> be<00:00:27.029> successful<00:00:27.359> in<00:00:27.660> this

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
going to be successful in this

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.160 
going to be successful in this
tournament<00:00:28.189> it<00:00:29.189> was<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.699> was<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.849> tough<00:00:30.090> game<00:00:30.300> we

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
tournament it was it was a tough game we

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.330 
tournament it was it was a tough game we
knew<00:00:31.289> they<00:00:31.439> were<00:00:31.500> going<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.679> come<00:00:31.859> out<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.130> be

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
knew they were going to come out and be

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.280 
knew they were going to come out and be
the<00:00:32.759> intense<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.390> really<00:00:33.600> come<00:00:33.809> at<00:00:33.960> us<00:00:33.989> and

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
the intense and really come at us and

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.639 
the intense and really come at us and
try<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.620> play<00:00:35.570> but<00:00:36.570> like<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:36.809> said<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.380> most

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
try and play but like you said the most

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.280 
try and play but like you said the most
important<00:00:37.980> things<00:00:38.190> we<00:00:38.340> got<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.790> win<00:00:38.910> and

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
important things we got the win and

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.420 
important things we got the win and
we're<00:00:40.290> just<00:00:40.410> moving<00:00:40.500> on<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.800> next<00:00:40.980> game<00:00:41.160> I

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
we're just moving on to the next game I

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.619 
we're just moving on to the next game I
think<00:00:41.910> we<00:00:41.969> just<00:00:42.059> need<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.270> play<00:00:42.390> with<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.540> little

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
think we just need to play with a little

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.270 
think we just need to play with a little
more<00:00:42.809> confidence<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.530> know<00:00:43.620> especially<00:00:43.829> when

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
more confidence you know especially when

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.889 
more confidence you know especially when
we<00:00:44.399> were<00:00:44.489> up<00:00:44.700> 2-0<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.300> game<00:00:45.510> we<00:00:45.660> just<00:00:45.690> need

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
we were up 2-0 in the game we just need

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.569 
we were up 2-0 in the game we just need
to<00:00:45.989> keep<00:00:46.110> pressing<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.649> keep<00:00:46.860> keep<00:00:47.190> going<00:00:47.430> for

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
to keep pressing and keep keep going for

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.920 
to keep pressing and keep keep going for
the<00:00:47.640> third<00:00:47.850> goal<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.239> just<00:00:48.480> need<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.690> put

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
the third goal you just need to put

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.279 
the third goal you just need to put
teams<00:00:49.079> away<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:50.809> you<00:00:51.809> know<00:00:51.899> if<00:00:52.020> we<00:00:52.110> got<00:00:52.230> a

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
teams away and you know if we got a

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.510 
teams away and you know if we got a
third<00:00:52.559> goal<00:00:52.739> in<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:52.949> game<00:00:53.129> i<00:00:53.160> think<00:00:53.280> we've

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
third goal in that game i think we've

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.610 
third goal in that game i think we've
been<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.670> really<00:00:54.449> easy<00:00:54.690> game<00:00:55.050> but<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.410> know<00:00:55.500> we

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
been a really easy game but you know we

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.930 
been a really easy game but you know we
just<00:00:55.710> let<00:00:55.920> him<00:00:56.010> hang<00:00:56.129> around<00:00:56.250> i<00:00:56.610> think<00:00:56.789> we<00:00:56.850> just

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
just let him hang around i think we just

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.729 
just let him hang around i think we just
need<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.149> when<00:00:57.809> we<00:00:57.899> have<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> chance<00:00:58.260> put<00:00:58.559> teams

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
need a when we have the chance put teams

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.889 
need a when we have the chance put teams
away<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:59.190> think<00:00:59.699> we<00:00:59.820> missed<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.270> lot<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.539> chances

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
away I think we missed a lot of chances

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.689 
away I think we missed a lot of chances
i<00:01:01.140> think<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.440> particular<00:01:01.620> after<00:01:02.280> we<00:01:02.399> took<00:01:02.550> the

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
i think in particular after we took the

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.780 
i think in particular after we took the
2-0<00:01:03.180> lead<00:01:03.449> there<00:01:03.989> were<00:01:04.080> many<00:01:04.640> breakaways<00:01:05.640> that

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
2-0 lead there were many breakaways that

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.370 
2-0 lead there were many breakaways that
we<00:01:05.909> had<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.299> were<00:01:06.390> four<00:01:06.600> on<00:01:06.720> three<00:01:06.930> four<00:01:07.350> and

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
we had that were four on three four and

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.830 
we had that were four on three four and
four<00:01:07.799> where<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.430> felt<00:01:08.820> like<00:01:08.939> if<00:01:09.150> we<00:01:09.330> had<00:01:09.810> a

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
four where I felt like if we had a

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.780 
four where I felt like if we had a
little<00:01:10.200> bit<00:01:10.320> more<00:01:10.500> conviction<00:01:11.100> conviction<00:01:11.340> to

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
little bit more conviction conviction to

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.420 
little bit more conviction conviction to
to<00:01:12.330> go<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.570> goal<00:01:12.920> that<00:01:13.920> we<00:01:14.040> really<00:01:14.280> could<00:01:14.400> have

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
to go to goal that we really could have

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.859 
to go to goal that we really could have
put<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.700> game<00:01:14.850> away<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.119> was<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.450> little

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
put the game away I was a little

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.690 
put the game away I was a little
disappointed<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:17.100> we<00:01:17.220> weren't<00:01:17.400> hungry

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
disappointed that that we weren't hungry

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.090 
disappointed that that we weren't hungry
enough<00:01:18.060> at<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.540> end<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.810> first<00:01:18.990> half<00:01:19.100> to

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
enough at the end of the first half to

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.310 
enough at the end of the first half to
finish<00:01:20.250> them<00:01:20.520> off<00:01:20.720> yeah<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.750> thought<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.080> mean

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
finish them off yeah I thought I mean

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.850 
finish them off yeah I thought I mean
they<00:01:22.470> had<00:01:22.619> some<00:01:23.159> very<00:01:23.310> good<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.759> talented

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
they had some very good and talented

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.380 
they had some very good and talented
attacking<00:01:25.860> players<00:01:26.100> but<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.729> thought<00:01:27.119> we<00:01:27.270> dealt

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
attacking players but I thought we dealt

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.380 
attacking players but I thought we dealt
with<00:01:27.540> them<00:01:27.689> reason<00:01:28.530> reasonably<00:01:29.040> well

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
with them reason reasonably well

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.609 
with them reason reasonably well
obviously<00:01:30.390> we<00:01:30.630> don't<00:01:30.930> like<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.140> give<00:01:31.320> up<00:01:31.409> goals

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
obviously we don't like to give up goals

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.270 
obviously we don't like to give up goals
but<00:01:32.040> uh<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.850> keep<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.960> lead<00:01:34.290> i<00:01:34.530> guess<00:01:34.770> is

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
but uh to keep the the lead i guess is

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.550 
but uh to keep the the lead i guess is
always<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.909> plus<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.450> mean<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.049> was<00:01:37.170> really<00:01:37.259> happy

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
always a plus I mean I was really happy

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.520 
always a plus I mean I was really happy
with<00:01:37.829> what<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.070> accomplished<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.670> game<00:01:38.909> and

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
with what I accomplished this game and

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.080 
with what I accomplished this game and
the<00:01:40.530> environment<00:01:40.799> just<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.400> guess<00:01:41.549> motivated

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
the environment just I guess motivated

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.030 
the environment just I guess motivated
me<00:01:42.240> because<00:01:42.600> all<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.810> crowd<00:01:43.049> just<00:01:43.350> booing<00:01:43.860> us

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
me because all the crowd just booing us

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.300 
me because all the crowd just booing us
and<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.520> just<00:01:44.909> wanted<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.180> play<00:01:45.299> good<00:01:45.570> and

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
and I just wanted to play good and

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.100 
and I just wanted to play good and
luckily<00:01:47.310> things<00:01:47.909> worked<00:01:48.659> out<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.990> way<00:01:49.020> I

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
luckily things worked out the way I

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.840 
luckily things worked out the way I
wanted<00:01:49.380> him<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:49.979> got<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.340> goal<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.700> we

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
wanted him to and I got the goal and we

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.060 
wanted him to and I got the goal and we
got<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.000> PK<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.630> we<00:01:51.720> scored<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.170> we<00:01:52.920> got<00:01:53.040> the

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
got the PK and we scored and we got the

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.249 
got the PK and we scored and we got the
win<00:01:53.250> defensively<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.240> think<00:01:54.689> we<00:01:54.840> went<00:01:55.049> through

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
win defensively I think we went through

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.160 
win defensively I think we went through
a<00:01:55.680> good<00:01:56.369> ten<00:01:56.610> minute<00:01:57.149> period<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.630> time<00:01:57.810> when<00:01:58.049> we

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
a good ten minute period of time when we

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.280 
a good ten minute period of time when we
struggle<00:01:58.590> in<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.460> second<00:01:59.759> half<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.119> was<00:02:00.290> right

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
struggle in the second half it was right

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.770 
struggle in the second half it was right
after<00:02:01.439> their<00:02:01.680> first<00:02:01.860> goal<00:02:02.390> right<00:02:03.390> after<00:02:03.630> their

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
after their first goal right after their

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.709 
after their first goal right after their
goal<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:05.000> but<00:02:06.000> after<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.390> thought<00:02:06.509> we

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
goal and but after that I thought we

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:07.700 
goal and but after that I thought we
were<00:02:06.810> pretty<00:02:06.869> solid<00:02:07.350> throughout<00:02:07.530> the

needed to settle it down a little bit

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.970 
needed to settle it down a little bit
but<00:02:21.600> I<00:02:21.630> mean<00:02:21.870> we're<00:02:22.410> just<00:02:22.440> one<00:02:22.620> of<00:02:22.710> those<00:02:22.800> games

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
but I mean we're just one of those games

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.650 
but I mean we're just one of those games
the<00:02:23.220> crowd<00:02:23.370> was<00:02:23.580> coming<00:02:23.820> against<00:02:24.120> us<00:02:24.270> you<00:02:24.540> know

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.490 
and once I got the second goal everyone
was<00:02:27.240> kind<00:02:27.330> of<00:02:27.450> pumped<00:02:27.660> up<00:02:27.750> on<00:02:27.870> their<00:02:27.990> side<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:28.470> I

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
was kind of pumped up on their side so I

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.010

little jittery there in the second half

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.220 
little jittery there in the second half
but<00:02:32.490> I<00:02:32.550> mean<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:32.820> was<00:02:32.880> good<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.270> we<00:02:33.510> came<00:02:34.110> out
