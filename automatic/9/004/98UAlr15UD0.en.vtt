00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:05.020
 Toyota Motor Corporation is a comprehensive exhibition of custom cars 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.710
 In "Tokyo Auto Salon 2011" 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.400
 Lightweight and compact FR sports concept car 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.179
 We exhibited "T-SPORTS" 

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:18.240
 The weight of the car is less than 1t 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.130
 On the other hand, it is 1.3 L 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.699
 As we put medium capacity engine 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:23.650
 Sufficient power-weight ratio 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.199
 I think I'm getting 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.769
 Engine is a genuine thing of cami 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:27.880
 As we bring as it is 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.769
 110 horsepower comes out 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:33.920
 Total length of 3810 mm and less than 4 m 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.450
 Very compact 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.650
 It is style 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.880
 (I am) Toyota Technical Association 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.090
 I'm a member but 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.850
 This is a corporate volunteer group 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.230
 Apart from normal business 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.559
 After work and in between 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.690
 We gather together and variously 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.910
 Make a plan or write a public relations 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.059
 Like a circle doing that 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:54.620
 It is a group 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.379
 Here members gather 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:58.719
 I made this car this time 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:01.070
 Last year at the Toyota Technology Association 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.340
 I have had a questionnaire 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.679
 In a variety of cars 

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:05.820
 "What kind of car do you want?" 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.790
 When I asked a question 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.359
 "The compact and affordable sports car 

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:11.390
 Questionnaire (opinion) that we want if we have " 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.920
 Because it was very many 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.000
 If we had such a car 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.740
 Because I thought I wanted 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.100
 I started with the idea of ​​making a chop 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.030
 T-SPORTS front "cami" 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.450
 Cabin is "Copen" 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.180
 Lear is based on the Altezza 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.990
 After all it was made compact FR 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.159
 Bring Cami's FR unit as it is 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.509
 Just because the rear of the cami is rigid suspension 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.960
 Because I really wanted to use an independent suspension system 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.530
 I brought the Artezza 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.920
 Just because it does not fit the width of the car at all 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.620
 Because the vehicle width of Altezza is large 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.329
 Improve some of the suspension members 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:48.729
 Make the tread smaller 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.950
 In the form of matching the width of the vehicle 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.430
 To realize that it is fun to run 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.300
 As we made a system of independent suspension system of FR 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.800
 To be able to understand that it is FR at a glance as a design 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.209
 I tried to be 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:06.219
 Long nose short deck 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:08.300
 In the old-fashioned style 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.450
 I think I could have something like that
