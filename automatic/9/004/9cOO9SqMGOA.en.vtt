iphone to show you the Lakotas and first

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.380 
iphone to show you the Lakotas and first
thing<00:00:24.890> you<00:00:24.980> notice<00:00:25.340> they're<00:00:25.580> both<00:00:25.940> with

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
thing you notice they're both with

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.109 
thing you notice they're both with
thrown<00:00:26.810> mesh<00:00:27.340> same<00:00:28.340> pocket<00:00:29.290> pretty<00:00:30.290> much<00:00:30.500> I

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
thrown mesh same pocket pretty much I

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.529 
thrown mesh same pocket pretty much I
noticed<00:00:32.119> that<00:00:32.270> the<00:00:32.689> the<00:00:33.530> Volt<00:00:34.309> fade<00:00:35.180> blacked

00:00:35.529 --> 00:00:35.539 
noticed that the the Volt fade blacked

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:39.220 
noticed that the the Volt fade blacked
of<00:00:35.750> old<00:00:35.960> was<00:00:36.260> a<00:00:36.289> lot<00:00:36.789> harder<00:00:37.789> mesh<00:00:38.270> feeling

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
of old was a lot harder mesh feeling

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.430 
of old was a lot harder mesh feeling
than<00:00:39.730> the<00:00:40.730> Royal<00:00:40.999> to<00:00:41.269> white<00:00:41.480> and<00:00:41.659> I<00:00:41.780> don't<00:00:42.289> I

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
than the Royal to white and I don't I

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.250 
than the Royal to white and I don't I
think<00:00:42.769> that's<00:00:42.920> just<00:00:43.039> because<00:00:43.670> when<00:00:44.510> I<00:00:44.809> noticed

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
think that's just because when I noticed

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.329 
think that's just because when I noticed
that<00:00:45.499> a<00:00:45.999> Jew<00:00:46.999> orders<00:00:47.449> it<00:00:47.690> from<00:00:48.019> Jim<00:00:48.980> a<00:00:49.129> whack

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:49.339 
that a Jew orders it from Jim a whack

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:53.950 
that a Jew orders it from Jim a whack
urging<00:00:49.999> lacks<00:00:50.300> sorry<00:00:50.659> and<00:00:51.399> I<00:00:52.449> think<00:00:53.449> just<00:00:53.870> the

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
urging lacks sorry and I think just the

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.799 
urging lacks sorry and I think just the
dying<00:00:54.350> the<00:00:55.249> initial<00:00:55.429> dying<00:00:55.850> of<00:00:56.149> the<00:00:56.179> soft<00:00:56.539> mesh

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
dying the initial dying of the soft mesh

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.200 
dying the initial dying of the soft mesh
just<00:00:57.079> kind<00:00:57.289> of<00:00:57.379> makes<00:00:58.039> it<00:00:58.159> a<00:00:58.190> lot<00:00:58.339> harder<00:00:58.399> to

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
just kind of makes it a lot harder to

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.809 
just kind of makes it a lot harder to
begin<00:00:59.449> with<00:00:59.629> so<00:00:59.659> many<00:01:00.019> me<00:01:00.829> coats<00:01:01.159> it's<00:01:01.489> just

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:01.819 
begin with so many me coats it's just

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:05.740 
begin with so many me coats it's just
like<00:01:02.379> just<00:01:03.379> a<00:01:03.559> lot<00:01:03.920> harder<00:01:03.949> naturally<00:01:04.790> right

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
like just a lot harder naturally right

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.630 
like just a lot harder naturally right
now<00:01:05.870> I<00:01:05.900> got<00:01:05.930> it<00:01:06.170> on<00:01:06.260> titan<00:01:06.560> but<00:01:06.920> not<00:01:07.370> for<00:01:07.610> long

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
now I got it on titan but not for long

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.200 
now I got it on titan but not for long
and<00:01:08.060> put<00:01:08.240> it<00:01:08.330> on<00:01:08.420> an<00:01:08.540> all<00:01:08.720> black<00:01:08.960> shaft<00:01:09.290> and<00:01:10.210> i

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
and put it on an all black shaft and i

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.720 
and put it on an all black shaft and i
have<00:01:11.510> to<00:01:11.659> say<00:01:11.870> it<00:01:12.020> looks<00:01:12.170> really<00:01:13.040> nice<00:01:13.280> with

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:13.730 
have to say it looks really nice with

the same pocket this one is a little a
little<00:01:25.370> more<00:01:25.760> pinched<00:01:26.210> whoever<00:01:26.840> i<00:01:26.930> bought<00:01:27.140> if

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
little more pinched whoever i bought if

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.770 
little more pinched whoever i bought if
my<00:01:27.500> thing<00:01:27.740> pinched<00:01:28.220> it<00:01:28.340> a<00:01:28.370> little<00:01:28.490> bit<00:01:28.780> because

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
my thing pinched it a little bit because

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.840 
my thing pinched it a little bit because
the<00:01:30.170> you<00:01:30.530> see<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:30.860> top<00:01:31.070> of<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:31.340> head<00:01:31.460> is<00:01:31.640> a<00:01:31.670> lot

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
the you see the top of the head is a lot

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.660 
the you see the top of the head is a lot
more<00:01:32.030> narrow<00:01:32.360> and<00:01:32.980> right<00:01:33.980> here<00:01:34.280> it<00:01:34.430> looks<00:01:34.610> like

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
more narrow and right here it looks like

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.220 
more narrow and right here it looks like
it<00:01:34.820> flares<00:01:35.120> more<00:01:35.390> than<00:01:35.540> it<00:01:35.600> does<00:01:35.630> on<00:01:35.810> this<00:01:36.020> one

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
it flares more than it does on this one

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.590 
it flares more than it does on this one
or<00:01:36.740> maybe<00:01:37.310> I'm<00:01:37.550> just<00:01:37.580> crazy<00:01:37.790> and<00:01:39.670> also<00:01:40.670> if<00:01:41.120> you

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
or maybe I'm just crazy and also if you

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.180 
or maybe I'm just crazy and also if you
look<00:01:41.750> at<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:41.900> bottom<00:01:42.170> of<00:01:42.230> this<00:01:42.350> one<00:01:42.590> comes<00:01:43.070> out

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
look at the bottom of this one comes out

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.770 
look at the bottom of this one comes out
a<00:01:43.250> lot<00:01:43.490> farther<00:01:43.790> than<00:01:43.940> it<00:01:44.150> does<00:01:44.300> on<00:01:44.330> that<00:01:44.570> one

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
a lot farther than it does on that one

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.770 
a lot farther than it does on that one
and<00:01:44.960> that<00:01:45.020> might<00:01:45.590> just<00:01:45.860> be<00:01:46.040> the<00:01:46.070> UM<00:01:46.540> the<00:01:47.540> mesh

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
and that might just be the UM the mesh

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.150 
and that might just be the UM the mesh
again<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:49.670> Volt<00:01:49.970> mesh<00:01:50.270> that<00:01:50.480> he<00:01:50.570> orders<00:01:51.160> and

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
again the Volt mesh that he orders and

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.690 
again the Volt mesh that he orders and
uh<00:01:52.190> oh<00:01:52.910> gosh<00:01:53.420> i<00:01:53.690> love<00:01:53.930> these<00:01:54.410> these<00:01:55.130> sticks<00:01:55.520> I
