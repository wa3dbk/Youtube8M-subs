00:00:00.016 --> 00:00:01.069
 Hey everyone, I am Liu Ding. 

00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:03.087
 I want to bring you an important message today. 

00:00:03.087 --> 00:00:05.090
 You also know that this is another year. 

00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:08.075
 Someone stole my gold!! 

00:00:08.075 --> 00:00:11.026
 Hey? Mys has also been stolen! 

00:00:11.026 --> 00:00:14.018
 Oh! And mine! I am finished! 

00:00:14.018 --> 00:00:16.047
 Uh... he stole my milk. 

00:00:16.047 --> 00:00:18.005
 Oh, it seems that we are... 

00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:20.017
 Was it patronized by the elf? 

00:00:21.085 --> 00:00:23.081
 That's right, it's almost St. Patrick's Day (3/17, Irish festival, this is just the legendary Irish elf who collects gold) 

00:00:23.081 --> 00:00:26.052
 Now the threat level has changed from red to the highest risk of green (elf in green) (3/17, Irish festival, this is just the legendary Irish elf who collects gold) 

00:00:26.052 --> 00:00:30.019
 In this 2012 Elf Day, there will only be one thing in the kitchen... 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.065
 Party!!! 

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:33.087
 "Elf Trap"!! 

00:00:33.087 --> 00:00:35.040
 Oh, bad (crap) 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.036
 You mean, "Hey, trap"? 

00:00:38.036 --> 00:00:39.099
 Ok, "ah, trap" 

00:00:39.099 --> 00:00:42.079
 But you want to catch Lian En, I have to work harder. 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:43.079
 Since you all asked for it 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.092
 We will send you a trap again, completely free! 

00:00:45.092 --> 00:00:48.027
 Oh, double trap! 

00:00:48.027 --> 00:00:49.025
 Not so much 

00:00:49.025 --> 00:00:50.059
 Each of our patent traps 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.073
 Made from 100% anti-performing steel 

00:00:52.073 --> 00:00:55.047
 Forged from a violent goblin on the active volcano's mountainside 

00:00:55.047 --> 00:00:57.074
 Oh, it’s a trap. 

00:00:57.074 --> 00:00:59.065
 I will catch your stupid dead demon sooner or later! 

00:00:59.065 --> 00:01:02.067
 Now you can make this nasty guy start to rather never step into your home. 

00:01:02.067 --> 00:01:04.020
 This is not just that I said it. 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.010
 Our house used to have elves running in. 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.006
 At least three or four times a week 

00:01:08.006 --> 00:01:11.003
 But now our gold is safe, thanks to... 

00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:12.044
 "Elf Trap!" 

00:01:12.044 --> 00:01:13.094
 Why do I buy a "elf trap"? 

00:01:13.094 --> 00:01:16.024
 Because I love the rainbow!! 

00:01:16.024 --> 00:01:19.001
 Me too, little guy 

00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:20.013
 Hey, trap! 

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:22.068
 Yeah! Help me get 1 billion rainbows out for the rainbow!! 

00:01:22.068 --> 00:01:24.045
 What are you when I am? A whole pack of rainbow fruit candy? 

00:01:24.045 --> 00:01:26.058
 Oh, I love the elf trap. 

00:01:26.058 --> 00:01:29.069
 Useful at home or at the company 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:32.011
 I even put one on the car! 

00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:34.038
 Ah!! High speed trap! 

00:01:35.073 --> 00:01:37.025
 Order now, we will send one more 

00:01:37.025 --> 00:01:38.043
 Dwarf apple 

00:01:38.043 --> 00:01:39.064
 Oh, don’t be like this. 

00:01:39.064 --> 00:01:41.035
 Not enough? no problem 

00:01:41.035 --> 00:01:43.030
 Because we also launched a new upgraded version. 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.023
 Now you can give a shoe and a shoehorn to the nuisance 

00:01:46.023 --> 00:01:47.006
 Shoehorn? (Shoehorn) 

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:49.031
 Then why don't you just give me a foot massage? 

00:01:49.031 --> 00:01:50.048
 (shoeforn is a shoehorn, but can be literally translated into the corner of the shoe, so these shoes have long angles) 

00:01:50.048 --> 00:01:52.027
 Hey, hit my little clover. 

00:01:52.027 --> 00:01:53.014
 Not enough? 

00:01:53.014 --> 00:01:54.011
 Don't come again, please. 

00:01:54.011 --> 00:01:58.086
 That's right! With the "Elves Launcher", you don't have to face the "battle or flight" choice, you can have both! (fight and flight, originally meant to face or escape in the face of challenges) 

00:01:58.086 --> 00:02:00.080
 Can we pause again? 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.079
 I don't need it now... 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:08.012
 (Lian En was thrown out and flew up -flight, and this behavior is in fight, so Liu Ding just said that there can be both fight and flight) 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.088
 Yeah, trap shooting, but trap is a trap, so it can also be understood as a trap launch. 

00:02:12.088 --> 00:02:14.097
 But slow, there are more! 

00:02:14.097 --> 00:02:16.060
 If you order within an hour 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.029
 We will also attach a piece of bait at the same time - Fool's gold to you 

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:21.038
 Ah! Got you! 

00:02:21.038 --> 00:02:23.028
 Hey, trap! 

00:02:23.028 --> 00:02:24.040
 I lied to you 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.003
 Haha, you are defeated. 

00:02:26.003 --> 00:02:27.056
 If you order within 15 minutes 

00:02:27.056 --> 00:02:29.019
 We will add a second long-horned shoe! 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.025
 What is the second? 

00:02:30.025 --> 00:02:32.073
 Oh, my lucky charm! 

00:02:32.073 --> 00:02:38.038
 It is the "elf trap!" You can save a lot of gold with a little extra cost! 

00:02:38.038 --> 00:02:40.024
 Order a set of elf traps today. 

00:02:40.024 --> 00:02:42.024
 There are three simple payment methods, as long as the cash is $19.99 

00:02:42.024 --> 00:02:44.004
 Or use a check and a credit card, but please don’t send gold over. 

00:02:44.004 --> 00:02:45.020
 Do not use in inappropriate places 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.045
 No effect on Xiaobai 

00:02:47.012 --> 00:02:48.097
 rotten! 

00:02:48.097 --> 00:02:50.041
 Stupid white 

00:02:51.096 --> 00:02:53.004
 Hey, hey, everyone. 

00:02:53.004 --> 00:02:54.054
 Thank you for watching my new movie. 

00:02:54.054 --> 00:02:56.063
 You know that whenever you press the like button 

00:02:56.063 --> 00:02:58.081
 Will Lian En’s "Clover" be smashed once? 

00:02:58.081 --> 00:03:01.037
 So just press it like it. 

00:03:01.037 --> 00:03:02.016
 Come on, press it! 

00:03:04.016 --> 00:03:07.003
