shading<00:01:24.600> system<00:01:24.750> here<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.650> then<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.729> can

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
shading system here and then you can

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.539 
shading system here and then you can
find<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.509> new<00:01:27.780> node<00:01:28.380> here<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.250> script

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
find the new node here and the script

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.749 
find the new node here and the script
category<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.479> I'll<00:01:30.659> just<00:01:30.869> add<00:01:31.079> script<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:32.100> now

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
category so I'll just add script and now

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.609 
category so I'll just add script and now
you<00:01:32.820> can<00:01:33.030> choose<00:01:33.329> whether<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:34.020> want<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.470> load

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
you can choose whether you want to load

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.460 
you can choose whether you want to load
an<00:01:34.829> existing<00:01:35.210> text<00:01:36.210> block<00:01:36.570> from<00:01:36.990> inside<00:01:37.350> of

external OSL shader from your hard drive

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.340 
external OSL shader from your hard drive
and<00:01:42.290> we<00:01:43.290> will<00:01:43.439> do<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.890> in<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.579> case<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.350> I

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
and we will do that in this case and I

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.100 
and we will do that in this case and I
have<00:01:46.530> my<00:01:46.799> folder<00:01:47.250> here<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:48.829> let's<00:01:49.829> take<00:01:50.130> this

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
have my folder here and let's take this

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.740 
have my folder here and let's take this
example<00:01:52.110> texture<00:01:53.119> as<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.270> can<00:01:54.420> see<00:01:54.630> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
example texture as you can see the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.959 
example texture as you can see the
script<00:01:55.020> automatically<00:01:55.590> compiled<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.759> we

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
script automatically compiled so we

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.870 
script automatically compiled so we
change<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.420> workflow<00:01:57.810> here<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.020> bit<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.880> it

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
change the workflow here a bit and it

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.639 
change the workflow here a bit and it
automatically<00:02:00.450> compiles<00:02:00.960> now<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.259> generates

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
automatically compiles now it generates

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.920 
automatically compiles now it generates
the<00:02:01.829> inputs<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.790> outputs<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.719> can

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
the inputs and the outputs and I can

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.770 
the inputs and the outputs and I can
just<00:02:04.140> connect<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.369> color<00:02:05.700> output<00:02:05.969> here<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.659> my

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
just connect the color output here to my

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.999 
just connect the color output here to my
diffuse<00:02:07.140> shader<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.849> start<00:02:08.849> rendering<00:02:09.209> and

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
diffuse shader and start rendering and

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.820 
diffuse shader and start rendering and
yeah<00:02:11.009> as<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.310> can<00:02:11.459> see<00:02:11.670> there<00:02:12.660> is<00:02:12.810> our

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
yeah as you can see there is our

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.680 
yeah as you can see there is our
you<00:02:14.430> texture<00:02:14.970> pattern<00:02:15.270> we<00:02:15.480> have<00:02:15.510> here<00:02:17.540> you<00:02:18.540> can

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
you texture pattern we have here you can

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.990 
you texture pattern we have here you can
see<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.900> code<00:02:19.110> for<00:02:19.320> that<00:02:19.500> here<00:02:19.770> it's<00:02:20.130> not<00:02:20.340> that

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
see the code for that here it's not that

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.710 
see the code for that here it's not that
complicated

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
complicated

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.080 
complicated
I<00:02:21.810> found<00:02:22.140> this<00:02:22.260> example<00:02:22.620> online<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.940> was

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
I found this example online it was

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.040 
I found this example online it was
originally<00:02:24.600> written<00:02:25.230> in<00:02:25.670> GLSL<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.690> ports

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
originally written in GLSL and the ports

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.590 
originally written in GLSL and the ports
to<00:02:28.290> OS<00:02:28.620> ed<00:02:28.800> was<00:02:29.010> not<00:02:29.160> really<00:02:29.430> difficult<00:02:29.610> you

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
to OS ed was not really difficult you

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.210 
to OS ed was not really difficult you
can<00:02:30.720> see<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.020> parameters<00:02:31.770> here

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
can see the parameters here

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.000 
can see the parameters here
which<00:02:32.400> are<00:02:32.640> used<00:02:32.850> to<00:02:33.120> generate<00:02:33.890> input<00:02:34.890> in

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
which are used to generate input in

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.030 
which are used to generate input in
output<00:02:35.400> circuits<00:02:36.350> so<00:02:37.350> I<00:02:37.410> can<00:02:37.530> use<00:02:37.680> that<00:02:37.710> as

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
output circuits so I can use that as

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.420 
output circuits so I can use that as
part<00:02:38.340> of<00:02:38.520> your<00:02:38.880> texture<00:02:39.750> or<00:02:39.900> material<00:02:40.310> now<00:02:41.310> we

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
part of your texture or material now we

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.970 
part of your texture or material now we
can<00:02:41.580> change<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.970> scale<00:02:42.210> here<00:02:42.570> you<00:02:42.840> can<00:02:43.020> make

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
can change the scale here you can make

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.360 
can change the scale here you can make
it<00:02:44.070> a<00:02:44.130> bit<00:02:44.310> bigger<00:02:44.850> for<00:02:45.030> example<00:02:45.750> or<00:02:46.370> change

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
it a bit bigger for example or change

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:55.250 
it a bit bigger for example or change
the<00:02:47.550> rotation<00:02:48.680> so<00:02:50.360> yep<00:02:52.820> okay<00:02:53.820> um<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.959> will<00:02:55.170> now

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
the rotation so yep okay um I will now

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.860 
the rotation so yep okay um I will now
show<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.500> another<00:02:55.800> example<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:56.550> also<00:02:57.420> found

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
show you another example I also found

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.440 
show you another example I also found
this<00:02:58.020> script<00:02:58.350> online<00:02:58.740> and<00:02:59.250> written<00:02:59.550> in<00:02:59.700> GLSL

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
this script online and written in GLSL

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.570 
this script online and written in GLSL
on<00:03:00.690> this<00:03:00.840> website<00:03:01.050> here<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.650> it's<00:03:02.520> an

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
on this website here and it's an

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.640 
on this website here and it's an
interesting<00:03:02.880> stripes<00:03:03.600> pattern<00:03:04.020> and<00:03:04.230> I<00:03:04.530> have

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
interesting stripes pattern and I have

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.000 
interesting stripes pattern and I have
modified<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:05.100> bit<00:03:05.430> too<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:06.650> have<00:03:07.650> some

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
modified a bit too and have some

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.760 
modified a bit too and have some
parameters<00:03:09.000> here<00:03:09.540> which<00:03:09.780> can<00:03:10.020> be<00:03:10.200> changed

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
parameters here which can be changed

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.540 
parameters here which can be changed
during<00:03:11.070> runtime<00:03:12.080> so<00:03:13.080> I<00:03:13.110> will<00:03:13.440> again<00:03:13.709> just<00:03:14.250> load

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
during runtime so I will again just load

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.740 
during runtime so I will again just load
the<00:03:14.940> script<00:03:15.330> note<00:03:15.720> here<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:16.820> load<00:03:17.820> the<00:03:18.150> OSL

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
the script note here and load the OSL

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.979 
the script note here and load the OSL
file<00:03:19.110> from<00:03:19.440> my<00:03:19.560> hard<00:03:19.769> drive<00:03:20.090> which<00:03:21.090> is<00:03:21.120> note

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
file from my hard drive which is note

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.090 
file from my hard drive which is note
stripes<00:03:22.530> dot<00:03:22.980> OSL<00:03:23.580> in<00:03:23.760> this<00:03:23.880> case<00:03:24.769> and<00:03:25.769> again

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
stripes dot OSL in this case and again

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.600 
stripes dot OSL in this case and again
it<00:03:26.340> automatically<00:03:27.090> compiled<00:03:27.780> shader<00:03:28.610> let's

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
it automatically compiled shader let's

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.020 
it automatically compiled shader let's
connect<00:03:30.269> it<00:03:30.360> again<00:03:30.630> with<00:03:30.750> my<00:03:30.900> shader<00:03:31.170> here<00:03:31.590> and

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
connect it again with my shader here and

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.020 
connect it again with my shader here and
start<00:03:33.030> rendering<00:03:33.330> and<00:03:33.650> now<00:03:34.650> you<00:03:34.709> can<00:03:34.950> see<00:03:35.250> this

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
start rendering and now you can see this

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.000 
start rendering and now you can see this
interesting<00:03:37.220> stripes<00:03:38.220> pattern<00:03:38.700> here<00:03:39.890> we<00:03:40.890> have

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
interesting stripes pattern here we have

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.040 
interesting stripes pattern here we have
several<00:03:41.370> options<00:03:41.700> here<00:03:42.000> for<00:03:42.150> example<00:03:42.540> I<00:03:42.870> can

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
several options here for example I can

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:49.220 
several options here for example I can
change<00:03:43.350> the<00:03:43.769> offset<00:03:43.920> of<00:03:46.160> pattern<00:03:47.810> if<00:03:48.810> I<00:03:49.019> want

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
change the offset of pattern if I want

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.860 
change the offset of pattern if I want
to<00:03:49.440> animate<00:03:49.769> that<00:03:49.950> I<00:03:50.340> can<00:03:50.670> animate<00:03:51.209> this<00:03:51.510> time

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
to animate that I can animate this time

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.500 
to animate that I can animate this time
socket<00:03:52.290> so<00:03:52.830> if<00:03:52.980> we<00:03:53.130> go<00:03:53.280> and<00:03:53.970> a<00:03:54.269> bit<00:03:56.510> foreign

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
socket so if we go and a bit foreign

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.910 
socket so if we go and a bit foreign
time<00:03:57.810> you<00:03:58.080> can<00:03:58.260> see<00:03:59.030> all<00:04:00.030> kinds<00:04:00.780> of<00:04:00.920> changes

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
time you can see all kinds of changes

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.500 
time you can see all kinds of changes
here<00:04:02.130> the<00:04:02.519> pattern<00:04:02.820> changes<00:04:02.850> so<00:04:03.300> you<00:04:03.390> can

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
here the pattern changes so you can

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.720 
here the pattern changes so you can
animate<00:04:03.750> that<00:04:04.019> for<00:04:04.200> example<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:04.830> I<00:04:05.370> can<00:04:05.400> also

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
animate that for example and I can also

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.810 
animate that for example and I can also
and<00:04:06.209> change<00:04:07.140> the<00:04:07.380> amount<00:04:07.680> of<00:04:07.860> stripes<00:04:08.280> which

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
and change the amount of stripes which

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.449 
and change the amount of stripes which
are<00:04:09.030> being<00:04:09.269> generated<00:04:09.630> so<00:04:10.110> if<00:04:10.320> we<00:04:10.470> only<00:04:10.620> type

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
are being generated so if we only type

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.900 
are being generated so if we only type
in<00:04:11.610> one<00:04:11.820> you<00:04:12.780> see<00:04:13.049> only<00:04:13.290> this<00:04:13.560> one<00:04:13.860> little<00:04:14.580> line

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
in one you see only this one little line

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.680 
in one you see only this one little line
here<00:04:14.940> you<00:04:15.620> can<00:04:16.620> just<00:04:16.830> increase<00:04:17.130> that<00:04:17.459> and<00:04:17.760> to

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
here you can just increase that and to

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.160 
here you can just increase that and to
get<00:04:18.840> your<00:04:19.019> additional<00:04:19.790> stripes

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
get your additional stripes

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.840 
get your additional stripes
this<00:04:23.170> will<00:04:23.380> look<00:04:23.530> even<00:04:23.890> more<00:04:24.040> interesting<00:04:24.700> if

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
this will look even more interesting if

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.060 
this will look even more interesting if
we<00:04:25.240> change<00:04:25.510> the<00:04:25.630> diffuse<00:04:25.990> shader<00:04:26.020> to<00:04:26.830> an

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
we change the diffuse shader to an

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:36.840 
we change the diffuse shader to an
emission<00:04:27.640> one<00:04:29.160> so<00:04:30.160> yeah<00:04:35.190> okay<00:04:36.190> and<00:04:36.220> this<00:04:36.580> can

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
emission one so yeah okay and this can

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.270 
emission one so yeah okay and this can
also<00:04:37.090> be<00:04:37.300> used<00:04:37.450> as<00:04:37.960> the<00:04:38.020> world<00:04:38.620> background<00:04:39.100> for

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
also be used as the world background for

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.370 
also be used as the world background for
example<00:04:39.760> so<00:04:40.150> if<00:04:40.480> we<00:04:41.040> go<00:04:42.040> to<00:04:42.100> our<00:04:43.380> world

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380

let's<00:04:46.390> pause<00:04:46.750> rendering<00:04:47.200> for<00:04:47.440> a<00:04:47.470> second<00:04:49.830> we

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
let's pause rendering for a second we

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.280 
let's pause rendering for a second we
can<00:04:50.980> now<00:04:51.160> also<00:04:51.460> just<00:04:51.970> add<00:04:52.210> this<00:04:52.420> OSI<00:04:52.960> script

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
can now also just add this OSI script

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:59.000 
can now also just add this OSI script
dot<00:04:53.730> point<00:04:54.730> it's<00:04:55.030> 2d<00:04:55.480> shader<00:04:56.320> again<00:04:56.680> and<00:04:57.570> I

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
dot point it's 2d shader again and I

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.200 
dot point it's 2d shader again and I
didn't<00:05:00.010> automatically<00:05:00.640> automatically

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
didn't automatically automatically

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.930 
didn't automatically automatically
compile<00:05:01.780> here<00:05:02.080> and<00:05:02.740> therefore<00:05:03.010> I<00:05:03.160> can<00:05:03.310> just<00:05:03.520> go

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
compile here and therefore I can just go

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.660 
compile here and therefore I can just go
to<00:05:04.000> my<00:05:04.270> side<00:05:04.480> panel<00:05:04.900> to<00:05:05.140> my<00:05:05.470> side<00:05:06.100> region<00:05:06.460> here

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:06.670 
to my side panel to my side region here

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:15.390 
to my side panel to my side region here
and<00:05:07.260> update<00:05:08.260> it<00:05:08.410> and<00:05:09.810> connect<00:05:10.810> it<00:05:10.960> again

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.390 

yep<00:05:16.000> and<00:05:16.210> you're<00:05:16.900> the<00:05:17.080> the<00:05:17.949> vector<00:05:18.280> is

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
yep and you're the the vector is

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.490 
yep and you're the the vector is
probably<00:05:18.790> wrong<00:05:19.030> so<00:05:19.810> I<00:05:19.870> will<00:05:20.050> just<00:05:20.229> quickly

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
probably wrong so I will just quickly

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.050 
probably wrong so I will just quickly
add<00:05:22.440> texture<00:05:23.440> coordinate<00:05:23.830> note<00:05:24.010> and<00:05:24.340> take<00:05:24.820> the

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
add texture coordinate note and take the

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.730 
add texture coordinate note and take the
window<00:05:26.020> back<00:05:26.260> to<00:05:26.410> here

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
window back to here

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:33.290 
window back to here
and<00:05:28.110> change<00:05:29.110> to<00:05:29.260> offset<00:05:29.560> a<00:05:29.620> bit<00:05:31.680> so<00:05:32.680> now<00:05:32.889> I<00:05:32.919> can

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
and change to offset a bit so now I can

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.230 
and change to offset a bit so now I can
have<00:05:34.300> this<00:05:34.510> pattern<00:05:34.840> here<00:05:35.229> as<00:05:35.530> my<00:05:35.770> background

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
have this pattern here as my background

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.790 
have this pattern here as my background
if<00:05:37.240> I<00:05:37.389> decrease<00:05:37.630> the<00:05:37.900> strength<00:05:38.229> of<00:05:38.440> the

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
if I decrease the strength of the

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.120 
if I decrease the strength of the
emission<00:05:39.520> and<00:05:39.820> the<00:05:40.720> lance<00:05:41.050> become<00:05:41.710> less<00:05:41.919> thick

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
emission and the lance become less thick

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:49.230 
emission and the lance become less thick
yeah<00:05:45.389> that's<00:05:46.389> basically<00:05:46.630> it<00:05:46.990> I<00:05:47.970> hope<00:05:48.970> you<00:05:49.090> get

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
yeah that's basically it I hope you get

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.450 
yeah that's basically it I hope you get
an<00:05:49.330> idea<00:05:49.690> about<00:05:49.810> open<00:05:50.650> shading<00:05:50.949> language<00:05:51.039> and

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
an idea about open shading language and

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.820 
an idea about open shading language and
its<00:05:51.639> possibilities<00:05:52.060> and<00:05:52.570> the<00:05:53.440> current

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
its possibilities and the current

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.510 
its possibilities and the current
implementation<00:05:54.190> in<00:05:55.060> seconds<00:05:56.070> again<00:05:57.070> this

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
implementation in seconds again this

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.969 
implementation in seconds again this
script<00:05:57.880> note<00:05:58.060> should<00:05:58.300> be<00:05:58.419> in<00:05:58.479> trunk<00:05:58.810> very<00:05:59.710> soon

00:05:59.969 --> 00:05:59.979 
script note should be in trunk very soon

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:02.760 
script note should be in trunk very soon

like to use it now you can go to guitar

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.790 
like to use it now you can go to guitar
