00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:07.890
 hello i am today with anouk 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.500
 coaching change and organizations 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.210
 all my coaches point fr then very 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.990
 often the room is a real 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.210
 mess 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.250
 indeed there may be clothes 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.550
 who are lying on the ground or 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.890
 magazines to solve this problem at 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.400
 tells us how to tidy up his 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.439
 bedroom 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.090
 look good the room is the place 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.160
 where we sleep it must be the place the 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.689
 more relaxing from home and to be 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.399
 opponent must be tidy 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.469
 what we find most often 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.989
 in a room are the clothes 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.270
 be it dirty clothes that 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.309
 drag clean clothes that have 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.750
 not been tidy yet or the clothes 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.430
 who have just been bought 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.969
 yet nothing easier than 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.559
 to put away his clothes, it takes exactly 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.090
 thirty seconds of the winged leads into the 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.840
 basket of dirty laundry rather than the 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.000
 throw down 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.340
 in the same way once their 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.629
 passengers finished storing them right away 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.370
 in the cabinet rather than leaving 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.789
 hanging out on a chair plays on a 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.129
 furniture 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.290
 it does not take over as it is 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.540
 similarly for magazines the 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.189
 daily or books once they 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.710
 have been read no reason to let them 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.439
 drag on the floor in a pile 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.689
 make sure to throw them away once 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.860
 you no longer use it and for the 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.200
 books once they have been read 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.850
 put them in the library for 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.259
 those who take medication avoid 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.180
 to hang out on the night table 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.290
 it's not very aesthetic and it's 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.000
 not very good for morale 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.130
 try putting them away in a pretty 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.740
 box on the night table something else 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.450
 that I often see in my clients who 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.490
 contribute to disorder and that's all 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.530
 unsightly is the table to 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.600
 ironing trailing you necessarily have 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.040
 the possibility of the row behind the 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.130
 door of your toilet or behind the 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.659
 bathroom door do it the 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.460
 ironing board has nothing to do in 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.380
 the bedroom for the fans of the 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.530
 shopping that regularly returns to the 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.540
 house with four shopping bags made 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.219
 the effort to immediately tidy up your 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.880
 new clothes or put them to the 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.409
 machine 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.759
 there is no reason for the 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.810
 shopping scenes pile up in 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.810
 your room for weeks
