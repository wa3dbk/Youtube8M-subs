00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.960 
so you want to click create a new
network<00:02:15.950> either<00:02:16.280> you<00:02:16.459> click<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.790> button

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
network either you click the button

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.820 
network either you click the button
right<00:02:17.060> here<00:02:17.090> or<00:02:17.420> you<00:02:17.840> go<00:02:17.930> Network<00:02:18.290> create<00:02:18.799> a

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
right here or you go Network create a

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.339 
right here or you go Network create a
new<00:02:19.420> then<00:02:20.420> you're<00:02:20.569> going<00:02:20.660> to<00:02:20.780> specify<00:02:21.080> a

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
new then you're going to specify a

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.860 
new then you're going to specify a
network<00:02:21.739> ID<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:22.069> password<00:02:22.430> a<00:02:22.880> network<00:02:23.480> ID<00:02:23.690> is

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
network ID and password a network ID is

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.180 
network ID and password a network ID is
simply<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.230> username<00:02:24.680> for<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:24.950> network

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
simply the username for the network

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.320 
simply the username for the network
password<00:02:25.459> is<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.819> password

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
password is the password

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.580 
password is the password
so<00:02:26.540> other<00:02:26.660> people<00:02:26.690> can't<00:02:27.110> connect<00:02:27.349> to<00:02:27.410> it<00:02:27.530> if
