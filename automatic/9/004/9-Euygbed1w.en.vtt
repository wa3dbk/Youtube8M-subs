00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.230

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.730
 Californian I see it's my routine 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.189
 of the moment that's what I do three 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.450
 almost all the time to my hair 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.099
 I love doing business as you see at 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.070
 level of long hours wandering 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.960
 but it's okay it's very natural so here we go 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.279
 if you want to watch the tutorial I 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.320
 lets you watch immediately 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.270
 ok first of all so here it's the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.710
 natural hair so that is to say that 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.210
 I washed them and I let them and let them 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.440
 dry in the open air so you can 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.879
 to see that he is still very 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.170
 very smooth so to start you 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.640

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.480
 so mine comes from us that's me 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.370
 an American brand 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.170
 I had offered including a goat time 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.480
 of this same brand in a contest 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.780

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.280

 I will tell you about this bouquet their 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.610
 briefly because in all honesty 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.160
 I find it great 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.329
 and for me there is no better end I 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.640
 not tested all the pains of the world 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.879
 but I find it really very very 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.739
 well 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.330
 I speak knowingly it's 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.090
 to say that I have very very thin hair 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.320
 smooth you 'll have noticed it and the 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.340
 problem i will give you an example 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.190
 typical 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.560
 I was doing curls but really 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.270
 big curls for one evening and two 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.789
 hours after actually my loops I had 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.200
 limit the choices lice so I you 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:23.399
 tells when we love we spend time 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.530
 to do these things and that in the end two 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.390
 hours after well it's all down and 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.250
 its fauna a little bit the balls and 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.200
 angela I liked having her sides 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.030
 loop but it never stayed and then 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.830
 there then with him but I you 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.110
 do not tell it works of thunder 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.020
 in all honesty luck may 8th hyper 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.849
 delighted I I'm doing my curls and the 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.619
 next day I still have loops it's 

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:44.880
 just amazing finally really I 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.970
 think it's really good 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.020
 so here I am closing the parenthesis we are going 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.610
 come back the hairstyle and so you go 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.649
 need a hair clip 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.259
 so here he went through basic things nothing 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.700
 of very interesting and also of a 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.470
 heat protector so that's it 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.760
 a product you put directly on 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.260
 hair to avoid friends 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.880
 with the warmth that are his 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.920
 smooth hair hours etc 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.120
 I will put you link directly bar 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.950
 info if you're interested 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.330
 after any fact to the 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.500
 the essential thing is really to protect 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.820
 its shows of heat so for 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.170
 start I 'm going to tie some of 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.140
 my hair so I'll start with 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.670
 remove all the top draw a line to 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.670
 from the top of my ears 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.769
 and I attach so for starters I'm going 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:31.650
 come grabbed my hair separate them into 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.480
 two parts brought to the front and 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.489
 this part there I go there separate 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.599
 against two parties to make a 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.940
 hair lock put you my book 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.829
 their vertical and I want to come 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.170
 wrapped my lock of hair around 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:49.430
 hear good of tension do not burn 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.430
 because it's very very hot 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.460
 and here I am, I have a first loop 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.980
 here I want to come here take my other 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.010
 hair strand I'm going to do the same 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.010
 thing 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.910
 and here and I will do the same thing 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.240
 on the other side so I split in two 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.240
 parts 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.440
 do not have to be loops 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.659
 perfect so I'll come a little bit past 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.629
 my fingers in the loops I'm going 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:27.680
 then detached my hair and it's not 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:29.780
 our section 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.319
 so I resume but slightly more 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.319
 time level 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.490
 so here I take the first wick I 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.380
 am exactly the same thing I have 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.430
 done just now so I take a 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.430
 wick and I curl 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.280
 there is some support in a sense 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.330
 and then after in the other me I wear 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.910
 always in the absence so I take 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.040
 this is how it is and I actually place my 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.690
 group them at the back of the wick and 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.920
 I'm going then I'm doing 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.540
 always in his style I try to 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.620
 always do the same thing after 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.120
 you can very well leave in a 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.160
 other meaning to give a style but me 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.720
 it's true that there for this hairstyle I 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.540
 always go in that direction and then 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.150
 I'm going to come tasks and the rest of 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.490
 my hair and I 'm going to finish a little bit 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:36.460
 done here and there catch the rest of the 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.460
 wicks and loops and in turn 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.360
 or 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.920
 or 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.960
 so there for the wick that is in front 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.940
 so who the two wicks that surround 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.600
 my face what I have to do is that 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.010
 I just learned the wick and I 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.600
 will come to actually pass my book their 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.000
 behind so it'll be the same 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.990
 principle that other loops except 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.940
 that there I am not surrounded mameche 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:13.040
 fully I go surrounded like those 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:17.060
 so he only once and small to 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.710
 little pull down so that's an effect 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.660
 but that it does not pass something 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.910
 not a loop right on the front 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.220
 of the face but really little vague side 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:28.030
 but light I'm going to take the Mass that 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.030
 was just behind 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.030
 I now do exactly the same 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.030
 thing and retirees 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:41.409
 that's the end result you know we 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.840
 can pass to your mother in the 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:46.509
 hair story to just give a 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.759
 had become a little more natural to his 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:53.529
 waves 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:56.409
 so that's adding more volume and 

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:58.569
 here I hope this little video 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:59.830
 routine will have pleased you I make you 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:02.939
 very big kisses and I tell you the 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.939
 next ciao 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.949
 see
