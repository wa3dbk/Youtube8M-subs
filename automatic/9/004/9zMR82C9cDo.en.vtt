00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.460
 you came back to all 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.830
 September in 2014 in Buenos Aires 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:13.700
 few days left for spring and it's 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.700
 time to plant voyeur 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.199
 last year 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.109
 here in sane 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.019
 in these envelopes so to speak 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:33.500
 when different large classes of 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.500
 melon skin of toad 2014 02 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.910
 Now it's time to start 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:44.040
 planting because the 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.040
 Spring practically winter 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:53.390
 of everything described toad skin melon 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.910
 Better written 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.350
 and I have another class inside 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.780
 empty a little bit this more better written 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.980
 I have grape seeds of course already 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.350
 times last more than a year 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.350
 so one can conserve thousand toad 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.950
 we can not 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:24.730
 to that organic and organic million because 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.370
 they are happy of this melon 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:30.520
 that were not purchased but are the 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:35.040
 seeds to decide inga white melon 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:39.110
 organic 2014 02 that is to say is the melon 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:43.550
 that as you saw in other videos 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.820
 we ate this year then now what 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.400
 what I do and its high organic seeds 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.250
 in the next video I show how 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.390
 shall see 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.480
 well here we have crisis 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.420
 different milone class 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.230
 the seeds are very very similar and 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.580
 they had organic 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:08.620
 no organisms were made 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.620
 7 is a child's seeds written 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.280
 and the toad skin seeds that 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.700
 you very strange I do not know if it's going to grow here 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.890
 air monkeys 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.030
 notice that they are not exactly the same 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.520
 the seeds 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.190
 the best written is this its most clear 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.870
 and this was the toads are darker 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.519
 and these are of another tone 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.860
 that's why we have to be careful in 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.989
 classify them very well to avoid 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.470
 problems what I'm going to do is 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.790
 start to simply encrypt and the most 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.510
 external 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:46.959
 let's put three because three because not 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.900
 we know which one is strong and when I 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:53.530
 I put directly 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.420
 the little seed is the breed of lady 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.430
 and then covering with earth with two 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.990
 centimeters of earth so that our 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.790
 little pot here I'm going to put the melon 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.840
 written 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.840
 in the middle 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.319
 one more 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.319
 and another one here 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.510
 in our little pot the melon toad that 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.549
 never poses here in Buenos Aires and 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.900
 what are you seeing here the first 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.120
 bird that is the plan of Buenos Aires that 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.690
 it might come out and we'll go back to 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.690
 place here 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.489
 three seeds per plant 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.489
 we go up with earth 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:39.080
 we hope nature does its part 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.450
 well I hope you have been useful 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.800
 and what they have seen of course 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.800
