00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.930
 that's it 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.810
 Y 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.250
 in contrast to these because they are very 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.720
 well here pride welcome in our 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.040
 countdown video in this 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.270
 occasion we are going to make a quick break 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.670
 down and I'm going to bring you all the 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.800
 information that has been collected from 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.240
 that came out the teaser of black ops 3 up 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.520
 the date that is a lot of information 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.620
 filtered things theories possible rumors 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.360
 but first let's start with 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.550
 what is confirmed that is first the 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.410
 breakdown of the teaser as you will know the 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.660
 teaser consists of seeing several letters 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.010
 numbers and symbols spinning around 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.899
 what seems to be the silhouette of a 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.550
 soldier who later revealed us the 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.079
 full image that apparently is a 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.640
 promotional art for black ops 3 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.289
 the first thing we hear in the trailer 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.179
 it's a voice saying this should 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.250
 help you remember all this is a 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:56.929
 phrase said in black ops 1 and after 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.820
 we heard two more sentences of this same 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:01.010
 game next let's hear three 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.899
 more quotes from black ops 2 one of them 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.000
 being they always need men 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.260
 like us and then we hear a 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.659
 phrase that we have not heard until the 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.880
 moment which says our greatest 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.980
 barrier is our own fear our 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.710
 own doubts the only thing that we 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.870
 stop is how far we want to get 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.210
 this phrase is possibly what 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.440
 represent the plot or the concept that 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.390
 wants to carry out white 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.400
 3 that's why they showed us first 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.590
 the 1 after the 2 and the last the 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.180
 3 later they do not give us the letters of 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.490
 the numbers in three parts of the video 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.590
 we see three different coordinates the 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.230
 first of them takes us to a school 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.420
 primary in singapore the second of them 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.360
 takes us to the bridge October 6 in 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.060
 Cairo in Egypt and the last one brings us to 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.829
 a prison in swiss switzerland 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.360
 these three places are possibly going to 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.619
 be important when playing the 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.119
 campaign maybe the main events 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.829
 they are going to take and most of 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.659
 visions we will be in these places 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:55.579
 also throughout video we see several 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.960
 hieroglyphs symbols and strange things 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.180
 that is the moment we have not understood 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.619
 but also a part we see this logo 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.270
 that they had revealed to us which is like 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.830
 a trident within a circle not yet 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.479
 we know what it means to look like it's going to 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.920
 have importance within the story 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.929
 also in the video in certain parts 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.190
 we get to see the number 115 of what 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.660
 which refers to the element 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.610
 main in the zombie saga 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.290
 curiously also in a few frames 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.000
 we get to see a snap chat logo on 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.709
 which can be scanned like the one 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.390
 in some black ops 2 maps however 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.700
 I have not been able but some people 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.860
 they say that this simply takes you to 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.239
 snap the heart of duty and finally 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.160
 we can see that all these 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.110
 symbols letters and numbers are rotating 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.209
 around a soldier which looks like 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.519
 be like that a remake of the soldier of the 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.170
 original cover of black ops 1 that 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.510
 it would be all for the teaser and now let's go 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.890
 to the information filtered inside the 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.330
 source code of the official call site 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.160
 of duty two pieces of 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.780
 very valuable information the first of 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.430
 them being this promotional image that 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.500
 you have seen that it is the soldier already 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.300
 had shown that we saw in the teaser and 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.130
 behind him is the 3d black ops 3 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.680
 and the following is the official description 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.360
 of the game which says well black ops 3 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.070
 is the first title for the next 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.350
 generation of the black ops series 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.910
 developed by treyarch the creator of 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.860
 two of the most played games in the 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.540
 history of call of duty black ops' 3 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.090
 takes the players to a dark and 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.890
 twisted future where a new race 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.660
 of black operations soldiers emerges 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.090
 and the boundary line between humanity and 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.410
 the technology is not well defined in 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.870
 a world where military robotics 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.460
 avant-garde defines the war with three 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.680
 unique game modes campaign 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.750
 multiplayer and zombies the fans are going to 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.510
 receive the most profound and ambitious 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.060
 charge never done is the description 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.160
 official gentlemen ok now several things 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.470
 within this first what will be the 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.450
 plot of the story what will be the 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.120
 concept that will handle black ops 3 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.520
 we know that it will be in the future that will 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.500
 to be what appears to be a sequel to 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.140
 whites 2 however now it seems that 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.180
 the technology is getting dark 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.950
 so to speak and this instead of 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.320
 we will tell you the technology 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.570
 it controls us and apparently 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.580
 this basis of the plot of this game what 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.690
 which really was started and a little 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.090
 raised in the game before 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.230
 2 being in the future many people 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.120
 is complaining about the costumes' 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.800
 sexes and they're saying that the soldier in 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.990
 the cover in this promotional image 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.520
 filtered has an exo suit however 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.100
 I do not think it's like that and I feel like it's 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.930
 only part of the technological suit that 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.490
 this soldier has something else that 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.720
 much discussed is about whether this 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.910
 game will be available for the 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.100
 previous generation that is xbox 360 and 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.900
 playstation3 and not just for expansion and 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.790
 playstation 4 there are several rumors 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.290
 it really is a bit quick for you already 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.970
 stop creating these games for the 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.740
 previous generation however there 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.140
 official sources that point towards 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.480
 both sides first the user shinobi 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.860
 602 which told us that this game was 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.060
 I was going to call black ops 3 and I was going to 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.160
 be set in the future which 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.200
 was correct confirms that indeed this 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.970
 title will reach 360 and playstation3 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.440
 however, he will not be in charge of 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.940
 trailer that will be in charge of another 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.960
 study as well as sledgehammer is a 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.970
 charge of advanced warfare in the 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.350
 new generation and high moon studios 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.880
 is in charge in the old generation 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.370
 there is also a source in a certain way 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.510
 official which points to only going to 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.430
 be available for the next 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.170
 generation which is the play channel 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.030
 station this channel uploaded the video of 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:02.090
 teaser of black ops 3 and after 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.480
 title put playstation 4 the problem is 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.190
 that in past videos 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.840
 when the game is available for 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.850
 both generations not only puts 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.100
 playstation 4 but it puts playstation 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.020
 4 and playstation 3 like in this video that 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.820
 they are seeing another rumor of the ego 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.380
 important is the fact that maybe the 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.670
 cob are going to get to willy as 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.530
 For the first time it was necessary to call of 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.390
 duty can clean your account 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.400
 nintendo towards this site as well as 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.050
 you can clean your xbox user or 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.150
 playstation but for the first time with 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.620
 nintendo this had never happened but 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.360
 remember that these latest news are 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.190
 rumors and you do not have to take anything for granted 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.390
 and remember also not to believe everything 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.490
 see on the internet about possible 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.780
 leaks or contents of the 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.910
 next game if they do not come from a 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.530
 reliable source what if it is more than 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.270
 confirmed is the fact that the trailer 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.700
 of launch of this game will come out 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.990
 on April 26 in a couple of weeks and 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.430
 remember that you have the channel going to 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.140

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.880
 this one break down a very analysis 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.740
 deep and absolutely all the 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.970
 information that comes out about 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.410
 this title so well nothing is being 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.730
 excited gentlemen remember to share 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.620

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:00.360
