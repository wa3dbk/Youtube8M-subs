00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.520
 welcome to another magazine capsule 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.470
 official xbox this time with tips 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.880
 basics of ray man legends one of the 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.789
 best platform games 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.859
 recent launch 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.810
 probably the most complicated challenges 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.269
 of this title are the time trials or 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.099
 invaded, the difficulty of 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.540
 these challenges is directly proportional 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.129
 to your intention to obtain both 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.199
 gold trophies that correspond to 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.870
 free the three creatures and reach 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:40.730
 the necessary score of luxe though 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.620
 at first these challenges look simple 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.420
 at an advanced point of the game you'll have 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.970
 a margin of error of just two or three 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.949
 seconds so the recommendations are 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.500
 never release the race button or 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:54.199
 right trigger memorize the tours 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.780
 and probably the most important one to launch 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.409
 blows while running while doing this 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.420
 latest 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:00.920
 rayman takes an extra boost that can 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.650
 make a difference in the clock to 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.059
 reach your goal considering that only 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.100
 you have the opportunity to get from 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.780
 point a to point b without a scratch is 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.079
 you probably will not get over it in your first 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.750
 try and in the second or third but 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:16.670
 we create none is impossible 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.070
 in this title everything has a value 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.140
 chained is to say unlock levels 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.820
 challenges or characters depends on that 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.229
 also play that's why our 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.300
 insistence that you do not throw in the towel 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.010
 when it comes to traveling a level to 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.590
 perfection and if possible 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.110
 picking up every light that are these orbs 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.610
 that look like electrified flies but 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.930
 do not worry if you want to play with 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.550
 another character and you do not have the 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.710
 enough looks to unlock it 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.020
 there are many ways to achieve 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.510
 required score for example exchange 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.190
 points and new play repeating until the 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.770
 the musical level of the mariachi 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.960
 madness or constantly visiting the 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.080

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.460
 three options you will get it if you still do not 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.500
