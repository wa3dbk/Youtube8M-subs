00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.670
 we consider and mfp epson xp 322 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.340
 the printer was packed by 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.590
 standard foam and polyethylene 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.480
 in addition to shipping foam and 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.240
 manufacturer include kit here 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.310
 such a driver disk which you 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.880
 be able to install drivers on the printer and 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.300
 scanner 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.179
 as well as all the necessary documentation in 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.759
 the bundle still comes with a 220 power cord 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.680
 volt 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.450
 I want to warn you in advance the company 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.309
 the manufacturer does not complete its 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.620
 devices yusb cable 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.390
 so you have to buy it 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.370
 separately let's now consider 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.530
 the main characteristics of this 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.250
 printing device we begin our review 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.530
 please scanner epson xp 322 it 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.640
 maximum format is a4 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.129
 1200 high resolution at 2400 pixels 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.320
 the next important characteristic of this 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.390
 devices and the copper in order to 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.700
 copy the document must select 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.990
 appropriate menu item and run 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.930
 copying a document 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.479
 and now let's take a look at one of 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.760
 most important functions for home and office 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.259
 this is a print print format given 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:22.140
 a4 devices with maximum resolution 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:24.240
 5760 by 1440 points which is pretty good 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.369
 as for the budget model you can 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.159
 print borderless with maximum 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.229
 speeds of up to 30 pages per minute but on 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.290
 In fact, printing speed is approximately 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.450
 15 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.370
 they have a minute let's look at 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.650
 additional functions of this pro 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.080
 which in my opinion is very useful 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.970
 in the home or small office 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.120
 function without which it is difficult to imagine 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.230
 modern world is wi-fi 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.510
 the manufacturer probably expected that 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.980
 everyone prints without wires so no 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.530
 put the cable you can connect 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.870
 device without excess cords as well 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.630
 print directly from your smartphone and others 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.600
 devices running ios and android 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.090
 while you do not need a router and it 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.400
 all thanks to the wi fi derek feature yet 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.860
 One useful feature is a lot of functionality. 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.370
 this is a memory stick 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.580
 in epson xp 322 has a color LCD display 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.640
 diagonal of 34 centimeters let's 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.350
 consider the paper feed tray as 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.140
 see his top boot with 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.790
 up to 100 sheets and at the end 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.250
