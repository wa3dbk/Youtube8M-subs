pop<00:01:53.759> up<00:01:54.000> next<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.840> now<00:01:55.049> it's<00:01:55.380> like<00:01:55.829> it's

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
pop up next to it now it's like it's

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.990 
pop up next to it now it's like it's
like<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.030> same<00:01:57.329> as<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.899> overworld<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:59.040> if<00:01:59.909> I

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
like the same as the overworld so if I

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.240 
like the same as the overworld so if I
go<00:02:00.119> in<00:02:00.240> here<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:01.259> can<00:02:01.350> see<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:02.070> is

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
go in here and you can see that that is

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.679 
go in here and you can see that that is
pretty<00:02:02.520> much<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.700> same<00:02:03.060> as<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.390> was<00:02:03.509> in<00:02:03.540> the

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
pretty much the same as it was in the

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.539 
pretty much the same as it was in the
overworld<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.320> place<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.740> down<00:02:04.829> there<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.399> was

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
overworld I place that down there it was

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.190 
overworld I place that down there it was
about<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:05.820> far<00:02:06.270> away<00:02:06.360> from<00:02:06.689> my<00:02:06.750> other<00:02:06.899> things

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
about that far away from my other things

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.400 
about that far away from my other things
so<00:02:07.439> if<00:02:07.890> we<00:02:08.250> go<00:02:08.399> all<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.849> way<00:02:08.879> over<00:02:09.119> here<00:02:09.410> like

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
so if we go all the way over here like

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.460 
so if we go all the way over here like
if<00:02:10.590> we<00:02:10.739> can't

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
if we can't

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.430 
if we can't
that<00:02:11.740> way<00:02:11.890> but<00:02:12.580> if<00:02:13.150> we<00:02:13.210> go<00:02:13.540> over<00:02:13.570> here<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.140> we

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
that way but if we go over here and we

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.800 
that way but if we go over here and we
placed<00:02:14.710> on<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:14.980> door<00:02:15.160> right<00:02:15.310> here<00:02:15.700> we<00:02:16.480> go<00:02:16.630> in

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
placed on the door right here we go in

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.320 
placed on the door right here we go in
it<00:02:16.930> boom<00:02:17.530> we<00:02:18.190> actually<00:02:18.370> pop<00:02:18.790> up<00:02:19.000> all<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.240> way

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
it boom we actually pop up all the way

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.180 
it boom we actually pop up all the way
over<00:02:19.540> here<00:02:19.570> which<00:02:20.110> i<00:02:20.320> think<00:02:20.410> is<00:02:20.710> really<00:02:21.010> cool

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
over here which i think is really cool

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.950 
over here which i think is really cool
this<00:02:21.550> is<00:02:21.670> how<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:21.820> craft<00:02:22.060> a<00:02:22.240> warp<00:02:22.510> door<00:02:22.750> by<00:02:22.930> the

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
this is how you craft a warp door by the

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.200 
this is how you craft a warp door by the
way<00:02:23.140> if<00:02:23.320> you<00:02:23.410> were<00:02:23.560> you're<00:02:24.400> wondering<00:02:24.850> now

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
way if you were you're wondering now

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.520 
way if you were you're wondering now
let's<00:02:25.390> just<00:02:25.600> say<00:02:25.750> that<00:02:25.780> you're<00:02:26.200> going

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
let's just say that you're going

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.200 
let's just say that you're going
dimension<00:02:27.220> hunting<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:27.940> you're<00:02:28.030> just

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
dimension hunting and you're just

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.180 
dimension hunting and you're just
walking<00:02:28.870> around<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.500> you're<00:02:29.590> like<00:02:29.740> blah<00:02:30.010> blah

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
walking around and you're like blah blah

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.460 
walking around and you're like blah blah
i'm<00:02:30.520> getting<00:02:30.850> stuck<00:02:31.240> in<00:02:31.450> dimensions<00:02:31.990> what<00:02:32.380> am

got a place down these blocks or
whatever<00:02:44.380> put<00:02:44.920> down<00:02:45.070> a<00:02:45.100> dimensional<00:02:45.640> door

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
whatever put down a dimensional door

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.100 
whatever put down a dimensional door
open<00:02:46.420> it<00:02:46.540> up<00:02:46.800> actually<00:02:47.800> a<00:02:49.110> transdimensional

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
open it up actually a transdimensional

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.010 
open it up actually a transdimensional
trap<00:02:50.890> door<00:02:51.100> sorry<00:02:51.610> knew<00:02:52.240> that<00:02:52.420> you<00:02:52.570> open<00:02:52.810> it<00:02:52.870> up

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
trap door sorry knew that you open it up

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.100 
trap door sorry knew that you open it up
and<00:02:53.080> you<00:02:53.200> jump<00:02:53.470> through<00:02:53.530> and<00:02:53.950> boom<00:02:54.670> I<00:02:55.120> don't

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
know what that sound was but that

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.050 
know what that sound was but that
indicated<00:02:58.540> that<00:02:58.720> we<00:02:59.110> were<00:02:59.709> back<00:02:59.950> in<00:03:00.190> front<00:03:00.850> of

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
indicated that we were back in front of

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.780 
indicated that we were back in front of
this<00:03:01.270> door<00:03:01.770> so<00:03:02.770> that's<00:03:02.950> very<00:03:03.190> cool<00:03:03.430> if<00:03:03.670> you're

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
this door so that's very cool if you're

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.880 
this door so that's very cool if you're
going<00:03:04.030> like<00:03:04.150> dungeon<00:03:04.780> not<00:03:05.440> dungeon

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
going like dungeon not dungeon

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.610 
going like dungeon not dungeon
dimensional<00:03:07.020> exploring<00:03:08.020> I<00:03:08.140> guess<00:03:08.350> you<00:03:08.470> could

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
dimensional exploring I guess you could

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.350 
dimensional exploring I guess you could
say<00:03:08.860> and<00:03:09.070> you<00:03:09.160> get<00:03:09.280> trapped<00:03:09.580> you<00:03:10.120> don't<00:03:10.300> know

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
say and you get trapped you don't know

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.760 
say and you get trapped you don't know
where<00:03:10.510> to<00:03:10.570> go<00:03:10.810> you<00:03:10.870> just<00:03:11.080> put<00:03:11.290> down<00:03:11.410> this<00:03:11.500> trap

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
where to go you just put down this trap

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.949 
where to go you just put down this trap
door<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:12.280> boom<00:03:12.580> get<00:03:13.360> that<00:03:13.570> that's<00:03:13.810> how<00:03:13.900> you

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
door and boom get that that's how you

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.190 
door and boom get that that's how you
craft<00:03:14.260> it<00:03:14.500> and<00:03:14.650> that<00:03:15.489> is<00:03:15.790> actually<00:03:16.200> quite

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
craft it and that is actually quite

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.790 
craft it and that is actually quite
amazingly<00:03:17.920> awesome<00:03:18.430> so<00:03:19.000> we<00:03:19.090> go<00:03:19.180> back<00:03:19.209> in<00:03:19.480> here

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
amazingly awesome so we go back in here

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.940 
amazingly awesome so we go back in here
this<00:03:20.800> is<00:03:21.010> called<00:03:21.250> a<00:03:21.489> rift<00:03:22.030> signature<00:03:23.019> now<00:03:23.290> what

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
this is called a rift signature now what

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.490 
this is called a rift signature now what
this<00:03:24.100> riff<00:03:24.459> signature<00:03:25.030> does<00:03:25.360> is<00:03:25.660> if<00:03:26.080> you

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
this riff signature does is if you

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.280 
this riff signature does is if you
destroy<00:03:26.950> one<00:03:27.190> of<00:03:27.220> these<00:03:27.370> doors<00:03:27.670> and<00:03:28.330> you<00:03:29.110> want

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
destroy one of these doors and you want

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.990 
destroy one of these doors and you want
to<00:03:29.380> get<00:03:29.500> back<00:03:29.709> to<00:03:30.040> where<00:03:30.340> that<00:03:30.550> door<00:03:30.790> was

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
to get back to where that door was

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.420 
to get back to where that door was
destroyed<00:03:31.570> all<00:03:32.200> i<00:03:32.260> have<00:03:32.380> to<00:03:32.410> do<00:03:32.620> is<00:03:32.650> destroy

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
destroyed all i have to do is destroy

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.220 
destroyed all i have to do is destroy
the<00:03:33.610> door<00:03:33.820> well<00:03:34.239> i<00:03:34.269> mean<00:03:34.540> if<00:03:34.690> it<00:03:34.780> actually<00:03:34.900> gets

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
the door well i mean if it actually gets

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.900 
the door well i mean if it actually gets
destroyed<00:03:35.620> you<00:03:36.070> go<00:03:36.190> back<00:03:36.370> and<00:03:36.400> then<00:03:36.730> come<00:03:36.880> back

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
destroyed you go back and then come back

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.030 
destroyed you go back and then come back
in<00:03:37.180> and<00:03:37.480> you'll<00:03:37.720> notice<00:03:37.930> that<00:03:38.050> there<00:03:38.440> is<00:03:38.650> this

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
in and you'll notice that there is this

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.160 
in and you'll notice that there is this
thing<00:03:39.100> a<00:03:39.370> whole<00:03:39.550> bunch<00:03:39.700> of<00:03:39.790> particles<00:03:40.170> now

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
thing a whole bunch of particles now

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.500 
thing a whole bunch of particles now
that<00:03:41.980> is<00:03:42.280> pretty<00:03:42.519> much<00:03:42.640> like<00:03:42.700> the<00:03:42.970> memory<00:03:43.390> of

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
that is pretty much like the memory of

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.370 
that is pretty much like the memory of
where<00:03:44.170> that<00:03:44.470> door<00:03:45.010> led<00:03:45.459> to<00:03:45.790> so<00:03:46.720> if<00:03:46.959> you<00:03:47.140> get

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
where that door led to so if you get

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.830 
where that door led to so if you get
this<00:03:47.590> rift<00:03:48.040> signature<00:03:48.730> and<00:03:48.970> you<00:03:49.360> right<00:03:49.630> click

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
this rift signature and you right click

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.350 
this rift signature and you right click
it<00:03:50.049> on<00:03:50.170> the<00:03:50.320> block<00:03:50.530> that<00:03:50.769> the<00:03:50.920> rift<00:03:51.160> is<00:03:51.340> on<00:03:51.519> then

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
it on the block that the rift is on then

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.740 
it on the block that the rift is on then
you<00:03:52.690> will<00:03:52.930> get<00:03:53.860> the<00:03:54.250> rift<00:03:55.000> inside<00:03:55.540> of<00:03:55.690> your

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
you will get the rift inside of your

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.160 
you will get the rift inside of your
riffs<00:03:55.989> signature<00:03:56.530> and<00:03:57.330> so<00:03:58.330> you<00:03:58.390> can<00:03:58.630> use<00:03:58.930> this

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
riffs signature and so you can use this

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.410 
riffs signature and so you can use this
riff<00:03:59.410> signature<00:03:59.980> to<00:04:00.280> put<00:04:00.580> it<00:04:00.670> on<00:04:00.760> another<00:04:00.970> door

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
riff signature to put it on another door

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.340 
riff signature to put it on another door
so<00:04:01.690> we<00:04:01.840> like<00:04:02.519> put<00:04:03.519> ourselves<00:04:03.670> like<00:04:04.420> over<00:04:04.930> here

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
so we like put ourselves like over here

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.259 
so we like put ourselves like over here
I<00:04:05.560> can't<00:04:06.010> freak<00:04:06.489> it<00:04:06.610> place<00:04:06.790> down<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.239> block

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
I can't freak it place down the block

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.740 
I can't freak it place down the block
gosh<00:04:07.930> and<00:04:08.799> we<00:04:09.519> placed<00:04:09.820> on<00:04:10.000> the<00:04:10.090> rift<00:04:10.330> signature

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
gosh and we placed on the rift signature

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.470 
gosh and we placed on the rift signature
right<00:04:10.900> here<00:04:10.959> it<00:04:11.440> will<00:04:11.739> put<00:04:12.130> the<00:04:12.610> rift<00:04:13.000> over

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
right here it will put the rift over

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.920 
right here it will put the rift over
here<00:04:13.870> if<00:04:14.160> it<00:04:15.160> a<00:04:15.310> freaking<00:04:15.670> place<00:04:15.880> it<00:04:16.060> down<00:04:16.299> so<00:04:16.900> I

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
here if it a freaking place it down so I

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.360 
here if it a freaking place it down so I
don't<00:04:17.229> know<00:04:17.320> what<00:04:17.410> the<00:04:17.500> problem<00:04:17.709> was<00:04:18.040> but<00:04:18.280> it

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
don't know what the problem was but it

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.500 
don't know what the problem was but it
wouldnt<00:04:18.519> let<00:04:18.549> me<00:04:18.729> place<00:04:18.940> down<00:04:19.120> the<00:04:19.239> rift

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
wouldnt let me place down the rift

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.110 
wouldnt let me place down the rift
inside<00:04:20.020> of<00:04:20.169> the<00:04:20.260> dimensions<00:04:20.830> so<00:04:21.160> I<00:04:21.400> came<00:04:22.000> out

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
inside of the dimensions so I came out

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.390 
inside of the dimensions so I came out
here<00:04:22.150> and<00:04:22.360> put<00:04:22.840> it<00:04:22.960> in<00:04:23.050> the<00:04:23.200> real<00:04:23.410> world<00:04:23.680> now<00:04:23.979> it

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
here and put it in the real world now it

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.290 
here and put it in the real world now it
puts<00:04:24.729> this

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
puts this

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.210 
puts this
r if<00:04:25.569> it's<00:04:25.780> the<00:04:25.960> same<00:04:25.990> thing<00:04:26.229> but<00:04:26.680> it<00:04:27.099> just

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
r if it's the same thing but it just

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.249 
r if it's the same thing but it just
looks<00:04:27.550> like<00:04:27.909> black<00:04:28.300> in<00:04:28.539> the<00:04:28.629> real<00:04:28.810> world<00:04:29.050> so

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:29.259 
looks like black in the real world so

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:30.960 
looks like black in the real world so
you<00:04:29.349> can<00:04:29.470> see<00:04:29.680> it<00:04:29.800> because<00:04:30.460> if<00:04:30.550> it<00:04:30.639> was<00:04:30.729> black

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
you can see it because if it was black

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.939 
you can see it because if it was black
in<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.539> dimension<00:04:32.050> you<00:04:32.259> couldn't<00:04:32.710> see<00:04:32.860> it<00:04:32.919> at

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:32.949 
in the dimension you couldn't see it at

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:34.230 
in the dimension you couldn't see it at
all<00:04:33.069> because<00:04:33.250> everything<00:04:33.699> else<00:04:33.789> is<00:04:33.970> black

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
all because everything else is black

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.570 
all because everything else is black
it's<00:04:34.509> white<00:04:34.840> in<00:04:34.960> the<00:04:35.050> dimension<00:04:35.470> for<00:04:35.620> that

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
it's white in the dimension for that

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.119 
it's white in the dimension for that
reason<00:04:36.909> and<00:04:37.599> it<00:04:37.870> will<00:04:38.139> put<00:04:38.319> this<00:04:38.470> rift<00:04:38.800> here

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:39.129 
reason and it will put this rift here

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:41.249 
reason and it will put this rift here
now<00:04:39.400> how<00:04:39.729> you<00:04:39.789> use<00:04:40.330> that<00:04:40.360> rift<00:04:40.810> is<00:04:40.990> you<00:04:41.110> got<00:04:41.229> to

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:41.259 
now how you use that rift is you got to

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:43.770 
now how you use that rift is you got to
put<00:04:41.500> another<00:04:41.919> dimensional<00:04:42.550> door<00:04:42.819> on<00:04:43.090> top<00:04:43.599> of

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
put another dimensional door on top of

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.899 
put another dimensional door on top of
it<00:04:43.900> open<00:04:44.500> it<00:04:44.590> up<00:04:44.740> run<00:04:45.069> and<00:04:45.099> jump<00:04:45.340> through<00:04:45.639> boom

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:45.909 
it open it up run and jump through boom

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:48.450 
it open it up run and jump through boom
you're<00:04:46.449> back<00:04:46.750> in<00:04:47.020> the<00:04:47.319> place<00:04:47.560> that<00:04:47.590> the<00:04:48.190> rift

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
you're back in the place that the rift

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.559 
you're back in the place that the rift
was<00:04:48.819> supposed<00:04:49.150> to<00:04:49.240> take<00:04:49.449> you<00:04:49.629> to<00:04:49.919> now<00:04:50.919> to<00:04:51.759> take

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:52.569 
was supposed to take you to now to take

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:56.040 
was supposed to take you to now to take
away<00:04:53.500> the<00:04:53.800> rift<00:04:54.099> to<00:04:54.340> remove<00:04:55.120> it<00:04:55.419> you<00:04:55.629> need<00:04:55.870> this

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
away the rift to remove it you need this

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.279 
away the rift to remove it you need this
thing<00:04:56.379> called<00:04:56.740> a<00:04:57.009> rift<00:04:57.340> remover<00:04:58.060> now<00:04:58.719> these<00:04:59.080> is

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289 
thing called a rift remover now these is

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:01.499 
thing called a rift remover now these is
this<00:04:59.469> how<00:04:59.650> you<00:04:59.710> craft<00:05:00.069> the<00:05:00.490> rift<00:05:00.969> signature

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:01.509 
this how you craft the rift signature

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:02.879 
this how you craft the rift signature
and<00:05:01.659> others<00:05:01.840> how<00:05:01.960> you<00:05:02.020> graph<00:05:02.319> the<00:05:02.379> rift

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
and others how you graph the rift

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.689 
and others how you graph the rift
remover<00:05:03.520> so<00:05:04.210> we<00:05:04.389> come<00:05:04.539> over<00:05:04.629> here<00:05:04.780> to<00:05:05.199> the<00:05:05.699> rift

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:06.699 
remover so we come over here to the rift

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:07.980 
remover so we come over here to the rift
and<00:05:06.940> you<00:05:07.060> don't<00:05:07.210> want<00:05:07.389> it<00:05:07.479> any<00:05:07.599> more<00:05:07.629> than<00:05:07.810> you

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
and you don't want it any more than you

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.920 
and you don't want it any more than you
just<00:05:08.229> like<00:05:08.469> up<00:05:08.740> with<00:05:09.219> the<00:05:09.370> heck<00:05:09.639> then<00:05:10.569> you<00:05:10.719> just

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
just like up with the heck then you just

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.869 
just like up with the heck then you just
like<00:05:11.080> boom<00:05:11.440> and<00:05:11.770> it'll<00:05:12.219> get<00:05:12.400> rid<00:05:12.550> of<00:05:12.580> the<00:05:12.699> rift

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:12.879 
like boom and it'll get rid of the rift

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:15.029 
like boom and it'll get rid of the rift
just<00:05:13.479> give<00:05:13.599> it<00:05:13.659> a<00:05:13.719> second<00:05:14.080> give<00:05:14.500> it<00:05:14.590> a<00:05:14.620> second

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 
just give it a second give it a second

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:18.659 
just give it a second give it a second
Oh<00:05:15.180> up<00:05:16.180> gone<00:05:16.719> gone<00:05:17.409> forever<00:05:17.680> town<00:05:18.370> forever

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:38.319 
it's not a limited uses now this last

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:40.969 
it's not a limited uses now this last
thing<00:05:38.849> it's<00:05:39.849> called<00:05:40.029> the<00:05:40.090> fabric<00:05:40.509> of<00:05:40.630> reality

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
thing it's called the fabric of reality

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:44.909 
thing it's called the fabric of reality
now<00:05:41.979> what<00:05:42.550> the<00:05:42.669> fabric<00:05:42.940> of<00:05:43.270> reality<00:05:43.560> does<00:05:44.560> is

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
now what the fabric of reality does is

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:48.120 
now what the fabric of reality does is
it<00:05:45.729> acts<00:05:46.300> as<00:05:46.569> an<00:05:46.870> ender<00:05:47.199> pearl<00:05:47.469> but<00:05:47.919> if<00:05:47.979> you<00:05:48.039> do

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
it acts as an ender pearl but if you do

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.100 
it acts as an ender pearl but if you do
that<00:05:48.310> then<00:05:48.580> you<00:05:48.639> will<00:05:48.880> actually<00:05:49.210> you<00:05:49.840> put<00:05:50.020> this

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
that then you will actually you put this

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.930 
that then you will actually you put this
in<00:05:50.229> the<00:05:50.319> crap<00:05:50.469> table<00:05:50.830> you<00:05:50.889> get<00:05:50.979> for<00:05:51.310> unstable

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
in the crap table you get for unstable

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.589 
in the crap table you get for unstable
fabrics<00:05:52.719> and<00:05:52.960> what<00:05:53.800> that<00:05:54.009> does<00:05:54.279> is<00:05:54.550> you<00:05:55.449> can

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:55.599 
fabrics and what that does is you can

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:57.570 
fabrics and what that does is you can
use<00:05:55.750> it<00:05:55.779> as<00:05:56.080> an<00:05:56.289> ender<00:05:56.500> pearl<00:05:56.740> like<00:05:57.039> for<00:05:57.340> these

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
use it as an ender pearl like for these

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.790 
use it as an ender pearl like for these
crafting<00:05:58.060> recipes<00:05:58.449> so<00:05:58.659> instead<00:05:58.960> of<00:05:59.080> one<00:05:59.770> of

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
crafting recipes so instead of one of

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.320 
crafting recipes so instead of one of
these<00:05:59.949> you<00:06:00.129> can<00:06:00.219> get<00:06:00.370> like<00:06:00.520> four<00:06:01.000> of<00:06:01.150> these

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
these you can get like four of these

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.200 
these you can get like four of these
that<00:06:02.289> is<00:06:02.650> quite<00:06:03.069> useful<00:06:03.310> actually<00:06:03.669> now<00:06:03.969> to<00:06:04.029> be

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
that is quite useful actually now to be

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.510 
that is quite useful actually now to be
able<00:06:04.240> to<00:06:04.419> get<00:06:04.509> the<00:06:04.599> fabric<00:06:05.020> of<00:06:05.139> reality<00:06:05.520> you

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
able to get the fabric of reality you

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.869 
able to get the fabric of reality you
have<00:06:06.759> to<00:06:07.029> find<00:06:07.389> random<00:06:07.960> riffs<00:06:08.229> that<00:06:08.379> are

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:08.879 
have to find random riffs that are

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:13.019 
have to find random riffs that are
spread<00:06:09.879> around<00:06:10.409> the<00:06:11.409> Minecraft<00:06:12.340> world<00:06:12.699> that

and like the video because this fabric

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.940 
and like the video because this fabric
of<00:07:01.150> reality<00:07:01.180> does<00:07:02.020> not<00:07:02.200> like<00:07:02.380> to<00:07:02.410> touch<00:07:02.680> snow

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:02.950 
of reality does not like to touch snow

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.160 
of reality does not like to touch snow
and<00:07:03.160> if<00:07:03.220> it<00:07:03.310> does<00:07:03.490> then<00:07:03.820> it<00:07:04.180> might<00:07:04.390> diarrhea<00:07:04.990> in

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:05.170 
and if it does then it might diarrhea in

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:06.990 
and if it does then it might diarrhea in
its<00:07:05.350> own<00:07:05.470> mouth<00:07:05.680> and<00:07:05.980> that's<00:07:06.220> pretty<00:07:06.610> flippin

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.000 
its own mouth and that's pretty flippin
