00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.140 
amplifier by x2 company moto ta 0po it
uses<00:00:12.490> welcome<00:00:13.420> tubes<00:00:13.930> as<00:00:14.550> input<00:00:15.550> stage<00:00:15.790> and

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.150 
uses welcome tubes as input stage and

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.540 
uses welcome tubes as input stage and
the<00:00:17.220> output<00:00:18.220> stage<00:00:18.460> build<00:00:20.009> these<00:00:21.009> discrete

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
the output stage build these discrete

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.460 
the output stage build these discrete
elements<00:00:22.179> it<00:00:22.570> came<00:00:22.839> and<00:00:23.050> big<00:00:23.289> box<00:00:24.060> everything

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
elements it came and big box everything

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.249 
elements it came and big box everything
packed<00:00:26.470> nicely<00:00:27.220> inside

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:28.259 
packed nicely inside

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.580 
packed nicely inside
you'll<00:00:29.259> get<00:00:29.560> power<00:00:30.189> supply<00:00:30.669> unit<00:00:31.590> amplifier

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
you'll get power supply unit amplifier

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.369 
you'll get power supply unit amplifier
itself<00:00:33.010> and<00:00:33.340> two<00:00:34.149> six<00:00:34.989> j1<00:00:35.680> tubes<00:00:36.190> actually

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
itself and two six j1 tubes actually

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.430 
itself and two six j1 tubes actually
stock<00:00:38.379> tubes<00:00:38.739> are<00:00:39.039> so<00:00:39.489> soft<00:00:39.879> so<00:00:40.210> it's<00:00:40.660> better

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
stock tubes are so soft so it's better

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.049 
stock tubes are so soft so it's better
replace<00:00:41.920> it<00:00:42.129> with<00:00:42.309> something<00:00:43.059> else<00:00:43.449> to

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
replace it with something else to

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.900 
replace it with something else to
receive<00:00:46.059> better<00:00:46.300> sound<00:00:46.750> but<00:00:46.960> as<00:00:47.910> beginning

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
receive better sound but as beginning

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.220 
receive better sound but as beginning
option<00:00:49.329> it's<00:00:49.539> pretty<00:00:50.019> nice<00:00:50.670> cube<00:00:52.230> amplifier

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
option it's pretty nice cube amplifier

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.919 
option it's pretty nice cube amplifier
is<00:00:53.980> really<00:00:54.510> not<00:00:55.510> big<00:00:55.890> but<00:00:56.969> powerful<00:00:57.969> it

00:00:58.919 --> 00:00:58.929 
is really not big but powerful it

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:02.299 
is really not big but powerful it
delivers<00:00:59.399> almost<00:01:00.399> eight<00:01:00.640> hundred<00:01:01.079> millivolts

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
delivers almost eight hundred millivolts

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.020 
delivers almost eight hundred millivolts
for<00:01:03.309> 32<00:01:04.030> ohms<00:01:04.239> Lord<00:01:04.750> it<00:01:05.500> tuned<00:01:06.010> nicely<00:01:06.580> so<00:01:06.790> it

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
for 32 ohms Lord it tuned nicely so it

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.330 
for 32 ohms Lord it tuned nicely so it
can<00:01:07.270> work<00:01:07.480> with<00:01:07.780> headphones<00:01:08.050> with<00:01:08.620> impedance

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
can work with headphones with impedance

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.660 
can work with headphones with impedance
from<00:01:09.550> 16<00:01:10.150> to<00:01:10.500> 600<00:01:11.500> ohms<00:01:11.940> but<00:01:13.800> gain<00:01:14.800> is<00:01:14.950> high<00:01:14.980> so

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
from 16 to 600 ohms but gain is high so

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.990 
from 16 to 600 ohms but gain is high so
it's<00:01:16.000> better<00:01:16.240> to<00:01:16.510> use<00:01:16.540> it<00:01:16.750> with<00:01:17.740> some<00:01:18.700> really

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
it's better to use it with some really

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.220 
it's better to use it with some really
power<00:01:19.750> hungry<00:01:20.110> headphones<00:01:20.920> and<00:01:21.870> also<00:01:22.870> it's

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
power hungry headphones and also it's

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.950 
power hungry headphones and also it's
better<00:01:23.470> to<00:01:23.680> choose<00:01:23.950> headphones<00:01:24.910> with<00:01:25.210> bright

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
better to choose headphones with bright

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.899 
better to choose headphones with bright
sound

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
sound

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.020 
sound
for<00:01:28.909> example<00:01:29.439> biodynamic<00:01:30.439> lagravis<00:01:31.189> German

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
for example biodynamic lagravis German

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.109 
for example biodynamic lagravis German
maestro<00:01:32.600> works<00:01:33.560> really<00:01:34.280> nice<00:01:34.610> with<00:01:34.850> this

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
maestro works really nice with this

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.749 
maestro works really nice with this
amplifier<00:01:36.250> sound<00:01:37.250> is<00:01:37.579> smooth<00:01:38.149> it<00:01:38.539> have<00:01:39.759> to

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
amplifier sound is smooth it have to

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.370 
amplifier sound is smooth it have to
blackness<00:01:41.210> and<00:01:42.220> it's<00:01:43.220> pretty<00:01:43.520> musical<00:01:44.270> so<00:01:45.110> if

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
blackness and it's pretty musical so if

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.649 
blackness and it's pretty musical so if
you're<00:01:45.560> looking<00:01:45.679> for<00:01:45.920> something<00:01:46.659> interesting

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
you're looking for something interesting

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.919 
you're looking for something interesting
with<00:01:48.140> tubes<00:01:48.439> to<00:01:48.850> try<00:01:49.850> to<00:01:50.149> Roland<00:01:50.689> and<00:01:51.520> so

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
with tubes to try to Roland and so

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:56.230 
with tubes to try to Roland and so
experiments<00:01:53.929> like<00:01:54.079> this<00:01:54.380> it's<00:01:55.280> really<00:01:55.610> nice

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
experiments like this it's really nice

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.350 
experiments like this it's really nice
solution<00:01:57.460> for<00:01:58.460> that<00:01:58.670> thank<00:01:59.209> you<00:01:59.270> for

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
solution for that thank you for

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.840 
solution for that thank you for
attention
