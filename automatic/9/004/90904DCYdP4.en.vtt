00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.070 
you know actually I don't want to use
this<00:00:09.150> from<00:00:09.360> class<00:00:09.540> I<00:00:09.780> want<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:09.960> use<00:00:10.050> a

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
this from class I want to use a

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.509 
this from class I want to use a
different<00:00:10.559> class<00:00:10.740> because<00:00:10.980> I<00:00:11.099> want<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.340> test

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
different class because I want to test

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.330 
different class because I want to test
stuff<00:00:11.820> like<00:00:12.179> I<00:00:12.420> want<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:12.960> see<00:00:13.170> if<00:00:13.650> I<00:00:13.980> can<00:00:14.190> use

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
stuff like I want to see if I can use

thermal scope on an assault rifle to get
marksmen<00:00:17.340> pro<00:00:17.609> why<00:00:18.359> you<00:00:18.420> would<00:00:18.750> actually<00:00:18.930> want

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
marksmen pro why you would actually want

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.260 
marksmen pro why you would actually want
to<00:00:19.410> do<00:00:19.650> this<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:20.039> don't<00:00:20.189> know<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:20.580> was<00:00:20.970> just<00:00:21.060> kind

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
to do this I don't know I was just kind

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.550 
to do this I don't know I was just kind
of<00:00:21.359> curious<00:00:21.689> about<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.109> nature<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.410> the

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
of curious about the nature of the

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.070 
of curious about the nature of the
challenge<00:00:22.949> so<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.789> pull<00:00:24.330> out<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.660> assault

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
challenge so is pull out the assault

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.589 
challenge so is pull out the assault
rifle<00:00:25.470> with<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.710> thermal<00:00:26.099> scope<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.599> the

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
rifle with a thermal scope and the

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.540 
rifle with a thermal scope and the
thermal<00:00:28.050> doesn't<00:00:28.650> seem<00:00:28.830> quite<00:00:29.099> as<00:00:29.220> good<00:00:29.400> in

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
thermal doesn't seem quite as good in

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.240 
thermal doesn't seem quite as good in
this<00:00:29.640> game<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:30.720> in<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.470> killstreaks<00:00:32.070> and

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
this game it in the killstreaks and

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.970 
this game it in the killstreaks and
anything<00:00:32.730> it's<00:00:33.120> just<00:00:33.450> more<00:00:33.750> blurry<00:00:34.260> it's<00:00:34.620> very

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
anything it's just more blurry it's very

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.100 
anything it's just more blurry it's very
hard<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.399> pick<00:00:35.610> people<00:00:35.820> out<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.450> so<00:00:36.870> if<00:00:37.020> you

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
hard to pick people out and so if you

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.410 
hard to pick people out and so if you
run<00:00:37.260> into<00:00:37.320> people<00:00:37.770> running<00:00:38.010> assassin<00:00:38.700> here

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
run into people running assassin here

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.600 
run into people running assassin here
it's<00:00:39.719> very<00:00:39.930> hard<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.500> see<00:00:40.739> them<00:00:40.860> especially<00:00:41.190> if

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
it's very hard to see them especially if

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.090 
it's very hard to see them especially if
they're<00:00:41.670> standing<00:00:42.120> still<00:00:42.360> so<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:43.500> think<00:00:43.680> that

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
they're standing still so I think that

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.100 
they're standing still so I think that
if<00:00:44.460> you're<00:00:44.670> gonna<00:00:44.820> run<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.210> thermal<00:00:45.719> scope<00:00:45.930> you

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
if you're gonna run a thermal scope you

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.350 
if you're gonna run a thermal scope you
pretty<00:00:46.620> much<00:00:46.829> need<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.309> have<00:00:47.760> quick-draw

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
pretty much need to have quick-draw

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.090 
pretty much need to have quick-draw
there's<00:00:49.020> really<00:00:49.200> no<00:00:49.410> other<00:00:49.530> way<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.739> do<00:00:49.980> it

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
there's really no other way to do it

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.049 
there's really no other way to do it
because<00:00:50.280> you're<00:00:50.489> going<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.700> want<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.879> spend

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
because you're going to want to spend

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.630 
because you're going to want to spend
most<00:00:51.300> your<00:00:51.480> time<00:00:51.600> not<00:00:52.199> scoped<00:00:52.620> dead<00:00:52.860> it's

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
most your time not scoped dead it's

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.310 
most your time not scoped dead it's
hunting<00:00:54.239> for<00:00:54.449> people<00:00:54.750> with<00:00:54.840> thermal<00:00:55.170> vision

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
hunting for people with thermal vision

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.130 
hunting for people with thermal vision
will<00:00:55.649> blurry<00:00:56.010> ward<00:00:56.789> blocking<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.780> actually

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
will blurry ward blocking it actually

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.779 
will blurry ward blocking it actually
it's<00:00:58.260> more<00:00:58.379> gray<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.039> white<00:00:59.250> there<00:00:59.460> really<00:00:59.609> is

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
it's more gray and white there really is

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.840 
it's more gray and white there really is
no<00:00:59.940> dark<00:01:00.539> contrast<00:01:01.170> there<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:02.489> just<00:01:02.760> don't

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
no dark contrast there you just don't

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.070 
no dark contrast there you just don't
want<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.149> spend<00:01:03.239> too<00:01:03.449> much<00:01:03.570> time<00:01:03.629> there<00:01:03.989> but

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
want to spend too much time there but

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.810 
want to spend too much time there but
you<00:01:04.199> see<00:01:04.379> when<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.189> pull<00:01:05.369> up<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.580> scope<00:01:05.790> you

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
you see when you pull up the scope you

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.399 
you see when you pull up the scope you
could<00:01:06.119> hold<00:01:06.299> your<00:01:06.390> breath<00:01:06.630> like<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.080> did<00:01:07.229> there

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
could hold your breath like I did there

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.800 
could hold your breath like I did there
and<00:01:07.590> let's<00:01:08.400> go<00:01:08.549> pretty<00:01:08.820> straight<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.360> you

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
and let's go pretty straight and you

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.240 
and let's go pretty straight and you
know<00:01:09.930> it's<00:01:10.170> not<00:01:10.290> like<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.530> sniper<00:01:10.710> rifle<00:01:10.979> where

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
know it's not like a sniper rifle where

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.160 
know it's not like a sniper rifle where
you<00:01:11.340> just<00:01:11.460> get<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.760> one<00:01:12.030> shot<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.659> get<00:01:13.140> a

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
you just get the one shot you get a

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.719 
you just get the one shot you get a
couple<00:01:13.500> shots<00:01:13.530> off<00:01:13.920> before<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.369> let's<00:01:14.549> go

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
couple shots off before you let's go

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.760 
couple shots off before you let's go
breath<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.390> it's<00:01:15.600> fairly<00:01:16.110> accurate<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.710> do

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
breath and it's fairly accurate I do

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.230 
breath and it's fairly accurate I do
take<00:01:17.280> on<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.610> too<00:01:17.820> as<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.030> might<00:01:18.180> have

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
take on this too as you might have

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.170 
take on this too as you might have
noticed<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.100> fairly<00:01:20.610> precise<00:01:20.970> at

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
noticed and so this is fairly precise at

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.590 
noticed and so this is fairly precise at
longer<00:01:21.360> ranges<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.590> m4<00:01:23.280> it's<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.180> starter

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
longer ranges so m4 it's the starter

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.630 
longer ranges so m4 it's the starter
rifle<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.229> for<00:01:25.920> whatever<00:01:26.070> reason<00:01:26.400> for<00:01:26.549> my

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
rifle and for whatever reason for my

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.060 
rifle and for whatever reason for my
first<00:01:26.850> prestige<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.509> just<00:01:27.810> used<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.470> pretty

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
first prestige I just used this pretty

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.640 
first prestige I just used this pretty
much<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.400> entire<00:01:29.729> time<00:01:29.960> it's<00:01:30.960> like<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.409> good

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
much the entire time it's like a good

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.170 
much the entire time it's like a good
rifle<00:01:31.860> didn't<00:01:32.340> have<00:01:32.460> any<00:01:32.579> problems<00:01:33.000> with<00:01:33.150> it

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
rifle didn't have any problems with it

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.480 
rifle didn't have any problems with it
and<00:01:33.960> what<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.650> think<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:34.979> really<00:01:35.220> liked<00:01:35.400> about

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
and what I think I really liked about

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.280 
and what I think I really liked about
this<00:01:35.729> gun<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.240> slightly<00:01:36.600> higher<00:01:36.960> fire

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
this gun is the slightly higher fire

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.660 
this gun is the slightly higher fire
rate<00:01:37.320> than<00:01:37.680> most<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.159> other<00:01:38.310> assault

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
rate than most of the other assault

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.090 
rate than most of the other assault
rifles<00:01:38.960> translates<00:01:39.960> into<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.259> faster<00:01:40.860> time<00:01:41.070> to

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
rifles translates into a faster time to

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.700 
rifles translates into a faster time to
kill<00:01:41.430> which<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:42.030> really<00:01:42.450> like<00:01:42.630> because<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:43.680> feel

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
kill which I really like because I feel

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.649 
kill which I really like because I feel
like<00:01:44.040> I'm<00:01:44.220> always<00:01:44.490> behind<00:01:44.939> in<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.240> gunfight

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
like I'm always behind in the gunfight

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.630 
like I'm always behind in the gunfight
in<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:45.899> game<00:01:46.079> maybe<00:01:46.409> it's<00:01:46.649> just<00:01:46.740> me<00:01:46.950> well

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
in this game maybe it's just me well

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.940 
in this game maybe it's just me well
maybe<00:01:47.850> it's<00:01:48.060> not<00:01:48.270> everyone<00:01:48.810> at<00:01:48.960> least<00:01:49.079> but<00:01:49.710> I

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
maybe it's not everyone at least but I

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.830 
maybe it's not everyone at least but I
feel<00:01:50.159> like<00:01:50.280> having<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.759> gun<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.090> kills<00:01:51.299> faster

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
feel like having a gun that kills faster

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.450 
feel like having a gun that kills faster
even<00:01:52.290> if<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.680> means<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:52.979> need<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.159> be<00:01:53.280> more

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
even if it means I need to be more

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.789 
even if it means I need to be more
accurate<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:54.180> worth<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.780> for<00:01:54.810> me<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.649> other

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
accurate is worth it for me the other

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.649 
accurate is worth it for me the other
thing<00:01:55.920> about<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.159> thermal<00:01:56.909> assault<00:01:57.329> rifle

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
thing about that thermal assault rifle

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.840 
thing about that thermal assault rifle
is<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.409> ranged<00:01:58.890> weapon<00:01:59.280> so<00:01:59.700> when

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
is that that is a ranged weapon so when

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.420 
is that that is a ranged weapon so when
I<00:01:59.880> get<00:02:00.000> into<00:02:00.299> close<00:02:00.450> quarters<00:02:00.899> inside<00:02:01.430> pulling

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
I get into close quarters inside pulling

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.480 
I get into close quarters inside pulling
out<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:02.850> secondary<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.780> mean<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.860> get<00:02:05.130> almost

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
out that secondary I mean I get almost

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.429 
out that secondary I mean I get almost
as<00:02:05.610> many<00:02:05.729> kills<00:02:06.090> with<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.420> MP<00:02:06.780> 9<00:02:07.020> as<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.380> do

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
as many kills with this MP 9 as I do

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.619 
as many kills with this MP 9 as I do
with<00:02:07.770> my<00:02:07.950> primary<00:02:08.429> weapons<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:09.000> run<00:02:09.300> this<00:02:09.420> on

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
with my primary weapons I run this on

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.090 
with my primary weapons I run this on
almost<00:02:09.899> every<00:02:10.709> single<00:02:10.920> class<00:02:11.250> the

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
almost every single class the

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.010 
almost every single class the
cuz<00:02:12.280> I<00:02:12.670> get<00:02:12.850> into<00:02:13.060> a<00:02:13.090> close-range<00:02:13.570> fight<00:02:13.810> and

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
cuz I get into a close-range fight and

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.530 
cuz I get into a close-range fight and
this<00:02:14.350> is<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.710> gun<00:02:14.920> that<00:02:14.950> I<00:02:15.130> want<00:02:15.430> to<00:02:15.520> have<00:02:15.730> now

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
this is the gun that I want to have now

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.480 
this is the gun that I want to have now
unlike<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.230> assault<00:02:17.650> rifles<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.070> mp9

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
unlike the assault rifles the mp9

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.400 
unlike the assault rifles the mp9
actually<00:02:19.000> has<00:02:19.150> come<00:02:19.300> any<00:02:19.480> slower<00:02:19.990> fire<00:02:20.380> rate

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
actually has come any slower fire rate

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.060 
actually has come any slower fire rate
of<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:21.310> machine<00:02:22.180> pistols<00:02:22.660> but<00:02:23.290> it's<00:02:23.620> still

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
of the machine pistols but it's still

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.010 
of the machine pistols but it's still
faster<00:02:24.460> than<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:25.180> mp4<00:02:26.080> a1<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:28.090> I<00:02:28.120> switched<00:02:28.900> to

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
faster than the mp4 a1 so I switched to

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.360 
faster than the mp4 a1 so I switched to
that<00:02:29.080> one<00:02:29.350> I<00:02:29.380> meant<00:02:29.560> doors<00:02:29.770> the<00:02:30.070> other<00:02:30.190> thing

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
that one I meant doors the other thing

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.310 
that one I meant doors the other thing
is<00:02:30.460> that<00:02:30.490> I<00:02:30.670> get<00:02:30.820> a<00:02:30.850> win<00:02:31.270> more<00:02:31.660> ammo<00:02:32.110> for<00:02:32.290> that

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
is that I get a win more ammo for that

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.350 
is that I get a win more ammo for that
secondary<00:02:32.980> I<00:02:33.250> think<00:02:33.880> I<00:02:33.940> mentioned<00:02:34.150> that<00:02:34.270> in

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
secondary I think I mentioned that in

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.180 
secondary I think I mentioned that in
the<00:02:34.420> previous<00:02:34.690> video<00:02:34.900> but<00:02:35.560> i<00:02:35.710> get<00:02:35.860> so<00:02:35.890> much

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
the previous video but i get so much

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.680 
the previous video but i get so much
ammo<00:02:36.490> for<00:02:36.640> this<00:02:36.700> thing<00:02:36.910> that<00:02:37.120> especially<00:02:37.600> with

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
ammo for this thing that especially with

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.900 
ammo for this thing that especially with
the<00:02:37.750> extended<00:02:38.170> mags<00:02:38.320> give<00:02:38.590> me<00:02:38.710> even<00:02:39.010> more<00:02:39.460> ammo

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
the extended mags give me even more ammo

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.910 
the extended mags give me even more ammo
so<00:02:40.510> when<00:02:40.690> i<00:02:40.720> want<00:02:40.900> to<00:02:40.990> spray<00:02:41.320> from<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.560> hip

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
so when i want to spray from the hip

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.270 
so when i want to spray from the hip
inside<00:02:42.850> that's<00:02:43.600> what<00:02:43.870> you<00:02:43.990> want<00:02:44.200> to<00:02:44.260> do<00:02:44.380> this

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
inside that's what you want to do this

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.920 
inside that's what you want to do this
is<00:02:45.460> the<00:02:45.580> gun<00:02:45.730> i<00:02:45.820> go<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.030> because<00:02:46.360> i<00:02:46.450> don't<00:02:46.630> waste

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
is the gun i go to because i don't waste

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.020 
is the gun i go to because i don't waste
the<00:02:47.140> ammo<00:02:47.440> for<00:02:47.470> my<00:02:47.620> longer<00:02:48.070> range<00:02:48.280> primary<00:02:48.820> oh

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
the ammo for my longer range primary oh

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.960 
the ammo for my longer range primary oh
i<00:02:49.480> think<00:02:50.140> i<00:02:50.380> get<00:02:50.590> almost<00:02:50.890> as<00:02:51.100> many<00:02:51.310> kills<00:02:51.640> with

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
i think i get almost as many kills with

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.570 
i think i get almost as many kills with
my<00:02:52.210> MP<00:02:52.510> 9<00:02:52.660> secondary<00:02:53.200> as<00:02:53.350> my<00:02:53.560> primary<00:02:53.860> that's

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
my MP 9 secondary as my primary that's

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.070 
my MP 9 secondary as my primary that's
because<00:02:55.030> when<00:02:55.210> i<00:02:55.240> get<00:02:55.360> in<00:02:55.450> these<00:02:55.540> eight

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
because when i get in these eight

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.920 
because when i get in these eight
quarters<00:02:56.560> in<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.130> corners<00:02:57.610> inside<00:02:58.060> here<00:02:58.750> and

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
quarters in the corners inside here and

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.960 
quarters in the corners inside here and
I'm<00:02:59.050> expecting<00:02:59.500> enemies<00:02:59.800> close<00:03:00.070> there's<00:03:00.910> a

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
I'm expecting enemies close there's a

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.700 
I'm expecting enemies close there's a
red<00:03:01.150> dot<00:03:01.180> over<00:03:01.540> there<00:03:01.690> it's<00:03:02.170> gonna<00:03:02.320> be<00:03:02.380> within

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
red dot over there it's gonna be within

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.930 
red dot over there it's gonna be within
about<00:03:02.800> twenty<00:03:03.190> thirty<00:03:03.310> feet<00:03:03.550> I'm<00:03:03.760> gonna

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
about twenty thirty feet I'm gonna

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.510 
about twenty thirty feet I'm gonna
switch<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.360> secondary<00:03:04.840> easy<00:03:05.500> kill<00:03:05.860> I'd<00:03:06.340> had

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
switch the secondary easy kill I'd had

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.340 
switch the secondary easy kill I'd had
to<00:03:06.640> scope<00:03:06.910> it<00:03:07.060> even<00:03:07.450> with<00:03:07.570> quick-draw<00:03:08.110> with

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
to scope it even with quick-draw with

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.810 
to scope it even with quick-draw with
that<00:03:08.530> thermal<00:03:08.860> scope<00:03:09.070> that<00:03:09.460> would<00:03:09.610> have<00:03:09.700> been

back and forth all the time as I'm
moving<00:03:24.970> around<00:03:25.300> the<00:03:25.450> map<00:03:25.480> you<00:03:26.350> know<00:03:26.440> I'm<00:03:26.590> a

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
so wanting to swap back and forth means

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.990

is<00:04:55.800> obviously<00:04:56.220> getting<00:04:56.820> fairly<00:04:57.480> close<00:04:57.960> to<00:04:58.260> the

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
is obviously getting fairly close to the

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.440 
is obviously getting fairly close to the
Moab<00:04:58.590> kill<00:04:59.010> streak<00:04:59.310> which<00:05:00.030> is<00:05:00.240> something

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
Moab kill streak which is something

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.600 
Moab kill streak which is something
everyone<00:05:00.870> has<00:05:00.930> equipped<00:05:01.440> and<00:05:01.680> you<00:05:02.190> get<00:05:02.310> after

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
everyone has equipped and you get after

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.490 
everyone has equipped and you get after
25<00:05:03.030> kills<00:05:03.270> without<00:05:03.570> kill<00:05:03.960> strip<00:05:04.139> support

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
25 kills without kill strip support

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.560 
25 kills without kill strip support
probably<00:05:05.100> already<00:05:05.250> heard<00:05:05.460> that<00:05:05.490> look<00:05:06.180> they're

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
probably already heard that look they're

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.860 
probably already heard that look they're
starting<00:05:06.810> to<00:05:06.990> leave<00:05:07.290> their<00:05:07.830> survivals<00:05:08.490> and

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
starting to leave their survivals and

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.870 
starting to leave their survivals and
that<00:05:09.870> makes<00:05:10.139> this<00:05:10.350> that<00:05:11.040> kind<00:05:11.220> of<00:05:11.250> hard<00:05:11.460> to<00:05:11.669> do

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
that makes this that kind of hard to do

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.020 
that makes this that kind of hard to do
when<00:05:12.180> the<00:05:12.360> enemies<00:05:12.660> are<00:05:12.810> leaving<00:05:13.169> so<00:05:13.940> what<00:05:14.940> are

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
when the enemies are leaving so what are

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.280 
when the enemies are leaving so what are
you<00:05:15.120> gonna<00:05:15.180> do<00:05:15.389> I<00:05:15.570> got<00:05:15.720> some<00:05:15.840> more<00:05:15.900> terms<00:05:16.110> of

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
you gonna do I got some more terms of

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.320 
you gonna do I got some more terms of
arrangement<00:05:16.800> I<00:05:17.040> need<00:05:17.610> to<00:05:17.669> put<00:05:17.880> some<00:05:18.000> work<00:05:18.180> into

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
arrangement I need to put some work into

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.909 
arrangement I need to put some work into
that<00:05:18.450> and<00:05:18.690> we'll<00:05:18.870> talk<00:05:19.080> some<00:05:19.290> more<00:05:19.350> about<00:05:19.440> that

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
that and we'll talk some more about that

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.490 
that and we'll talk some more about that
part<00:05:20.340> of<00:05:20.520> that<00:05:20.760> but<00:05:21.720> let<00:05:22.050> me<00:05:22.110> go<00:05:22.229> ahead<00:05:22.290> and

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
part of that but let me go ahead and

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.350 
part of that but let me go ahead and
throw<00:05:22.710> a<00:05:22.740> counter<00:05:23.160> on<00:05:23.280> there<00:05:23.460> just<00:05:23.910> so<00:05:24.120> you<00:05:24.210> can

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
throw a counter on there just so you can

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.210 
throw a counter on there just so you can
follow<00:05:24.630> along<00:05:24.810> and<00:05:25.229> see<00:05:25.440> when<00:05:26.040> I'm<00:05:26.130> getting

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
follow along and see when I'm getting

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.930 
follow along and see when I'm getting
close<00:05:26.639> to<00:05:26.850> that<00:05:26.880> Moab<00:05:27.389> now<00:05:28.229> we<00:05:29.040> don't<00:05:29.460> dominate

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
close to that Moab now we don't dominate

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.120 
close to that Moab now we don't dominate
quite<00:05:30.630> as<00:05:30.810> frequently<00:05:31.020> in<00:05:31.440> this<00:05:31.560> game<00:05:31.830> as<00:05:32.010> we

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
quite as frequently in this game as we

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.490 
quite as frequently in this game as we
did<00:05:32.310> in<00:05:32.400> black<00:05:32.610> ops<00:05:32.880> it's<00:05:33.570> easier<00:05:34.140> to<00:05:34.260> spawn

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
did in black ops it's easier to spawn

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.950 
did in black ops it's easier to spawn
trap<00:05:34.770> here<00:05:34.970> some<00:05:35.970> comments<00:05:36.419> about<00:05:36.450> it<00:05:36.720> not

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
working now it works just about as well

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.690 
working now it works just about as well
as<00:05:39.300> it<00:05:39.419> did<00:05:39.510> modern<00:05:39.780> warfare<00:05:40.050> 2<00:05:40.470> and<00:05:40.710> we've<00:05:41.550> had

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700 
as it did modern warfare 2 and we've had

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.909 
as it did modern warfare 2 and we've had
a<00:05:41.729> lot<00:05:42.000> of<00:05:42.030> luck<00:05:42.240> with<00:05:42.270> that<00:05:42.450> but<00:05:43.440> the<00:05:43.680> thing<00:05:43.890> is

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
a lot of luck with that but the thing is

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.310 
a lot of luck with that but the thing is
when<00:05:44.400> we're<00:05:44.640> down<00:05:44.729> to<00:05:44.880> two<00:05:45.090> it's<00:05:45.450> why<00:05:46.050> would

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
when we're down to two it's why would

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.590 
when we're down to two it's why would
you<00:05:46.470> up<00:05:46.800> or<00:05:47.190> even<00:05:47.250> four<00:05:47.940> in<00:05:48.060> this<00:05:48.150> case<00:05:48.330> why

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
you up or even four in this case why

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.120 
you up or even four in this case why
would<00:05:48.840> you<00:05:48.930> want<00:05:49.080> to<00:05:49.140> prolong<00:05:49.289> the<00:05:49.590> game<00:05:49.770> so

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130 
would you want to prolong the game so

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.710 
would you want to prolong the game so
we're<00:05:50.310> going<00:05:50.430> dominate<00:05:50.940> just<00:05:51.210> try<00:05:51.360> to<00:05:51.419> speed

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
we're going dominate just try to speed

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.260 
we're going dominate just try to speed
things<00:05:51.930> up<00:05:52.200> I<00:05:52.560> think<00:05:53.010> that<00:05:53.610> means<00:05:53.789> I<00:05:53.970> start

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
things up I think that means I start

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.360 
things up I think that means I start
getting<00:05:54.900> a<00:05:55.020> little<00:05:55.229> more<00:05:55.440> antsy<00:05:55.860> and<00:05:56.010> rushing

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
getting a little more antsy and rushing

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.400 
getting a little more antsy and rushing
around<00:05:56.460> the<00:05:56.639> map<00:05:56.820> a<00:05:56.970> little<00:05:57.180> more<00:05:57.360> and<00:05:57.600> being

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
around the map a little more and being

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.260 
around the map a little more and being
less<00:05:58.800> smart<00:05:59.250> about<00:05:59.430> things<00:05:59.639> you<00:05:59.789> also<00:05:59.970> got

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
less smart about things you also got

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.420 
less smart about things you also got
this<00:06:00.450> submachine<00:06:01.380> gun<00:06:01.530> so<00:06:01.770> I'm<00:06:01.919> not<00:06:02.070> swapping

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
this submachine gun so I'm not swapping

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.969 
this submachine gun so I'm not swapping
to<00:06:02.880> the<00:06:03.360> secondary<00:06:03.810> mp9<00:06:04.350> instead<00:06:04.770> I'll<00:06:04.860> just

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
to the secondary mp9 instead I'll just

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.610 
to the secondary mp9 instead I'll just
get<00:06:05.130> kills<00:06:05.340> with<00:06:05.430> this<00:06:05.900> this<00:06:06.900> is<00:06:07.050> an<00:06:07.169> mp5<00:06:07.590> I

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
get kills with this this is an mp5 I

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.520

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:16.530 
the spawn and that's gonna lead to some
