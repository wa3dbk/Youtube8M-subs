yeah<00:01:35.040> because<00:01:35.189> I'm<00:01:35.490> not<00:01:35.820> like<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.240> see

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
yeah because I'm not like that see

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.999 
yeah because I'm not like that see
that's<00:01:36.810> an<00:01:36.990> interesting<00:01:37.380> theory<00:01:37.619> now<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.829> have

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
that's an interesting theory now I have

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.410 
that's an interesting theory now I have
to<00:01:38.100> say<00:01:38.250> from<00:01:38.310> my<00:01:38.490> experience<00:01:39.150> when<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.270> play

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
to say from my experience when I play

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.600 
to say from my experience when I play
video<00:01:39.600> games<00:01:39.810> given<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.470> choice<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:41.040> play<00:01:41.400> as<00:01:41.579> a

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
video games given the choice I play as a

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.520 
video games given the choice I play as a
woman<00:01:42.000> every<00:01:42.509> single<00:01:42.869> time<00:01:43.020> because<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.320> feel

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
woman every single time because I feel

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.200

like<00:01:43.649> if<00:01:43.829> I'm<00:01:44.130> gonna<00:01:44.220> be<00:01:44.369> watching<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.939> cartoon

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
like if I'm gonna be watching a cartoon

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.120 
like if I'm gonna be watching a cartoon
ass<00:01:45.630> run<00:01:45.960> around<00:01:46.049> screen<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.619> might<00:01:46.829> as<00:01:47.009> well

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
ass run around screen it might as well

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.670 
ass run around screen it might as well
be<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> chick's<00:01:47.640> just<00:01:48.630> just<00:01:48.869> being<00:01:48.990> honest<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:49.649> I

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
be a chick's just just being honest so I

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.649 
be a chick's just just being honest so I
wonder<00:01:50.100> though<00:01:50.340> if<00:01:50.549> I've<00:01:50.700> played<00:01:50.970> Mass<00:01:51.210> Effect

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
wonder though if I've played Mass Effect

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.840 
wonder though if I've played Mass Effect
and<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.439> know<00:01:52.560> different<00:01:52.770> RPGs<00:01:53.430> as<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.670> female

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
and you know different RPGs as a female

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.550 
and you know different RPGs as a female
character<00:01:54.000> have<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:54.689> started<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.200> build<00:01:55.350> up

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
character have I started to build up

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.200 
character have I started to build up
this<00:01:55.770> belief<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.430> women<00:01:56.579> are<00:01:56.820> inherently

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
this belief that women are inherently

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.609 
this belief that women are inherently
violent<00:01:57.540> because<00:01:57.990> I'm<00:01:58.110> killing<00:01:58.409> all<00:01:58.500> these

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
violent because I'm killing all these

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.440 
violent because I'm killing all these
monsters<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.490> would<00:01:59.700> be<00:01:59.790> fascinating<00:02:00.119> to

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
monsters that would be fascinating to

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.289 
monsters that would be fascinating to
test<00:02:00.719> out<00:02:00.899> perhaps<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:02.040> as<00:02:02.460> always<00:02:03.060> they're

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
test out perhaps so as always they're

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.819 
test out perhaps so as always they're
gonna<00:02:03.390> be<00:02:03.570> future<00:02:03.840> studies<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.350> would<00:02:04.560> like<00:02:04.710> to

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
gonna be future studies I would like to

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.620 
gonna be future studies I would like to
see<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:05.100> reverse<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.670> would<00:02:05.820> like<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.119> see<00:02:06.329> so

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
see this reverse I would like to see so

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.359 
see this reverse I would like to see so
say<00:02:06.930> black<00:02:07.140> college<00:02:07.409> students<00:02:07.680> playing<00:02:07.920> does

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
say black college students playing does

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.680 
say black college students playing does
this<00:02:08.489> have<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.789> same<00:02:08.940> effect<00:02:09.239> when<00:02:09.330> they<00:02:09.479> play

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
this have the same effect when they play

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.280 
this have the same effect when they play
as<00:02:09.899> white<00:02:10.319> characters<00:02:10.830> we<00:02:11.310> don't<00:02:11.489> know<00:02:11.640> and

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
as white characters we don't know and

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.630 
as white characters we don't know and
be<00:02:12.379> honest<00:02:12.709> not<00:02:12.829> everybody<00:02:13.189> thinks<00:02:13.430> that<00:02:13.459> this

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
be honest not everybody thinks that this

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.979 
be honest not everybody thinks that this
is<00:02:13.700> a<00:02:13.760> particularly<00:02:14.000> good<00:02:14.180> study<00:02:14.540> anyway

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
is a particularly good study anyway

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.479 
is a particularly good study anyway
there's<00:02:15.260> questions<00:02:15.469> about<00:02:15.769> the<00:02:15.950> methodology

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
there's questions about the methodology

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.220 
there's questions about the methodology
and<00:02:16.519> everything<00:02:16.909> and<00:02:17.090> I<00:02:17.450> worry<00:02:17.719> that<00:02:17.870> people

and everything and I worry that people

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.720 
and everything and I worry that people

research out there you can feel free
we're<00:02:24.049> gonna<00:02:24.109> link<00:02:24.409> to<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.799> study<00:02:24.980> in<00:02:25.310> the

we're gonna link to the study in the

you<00:02:27.200> can<00:02:27.349> see<00:02:27.500> if<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:27.709> agree<00:02:27.829> with<00:02:28.129> it

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
you can see if you agree with it

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.369 
you can see if you agree with it
but<00:02:28.609> it<00:02:28.700> is<00:02:28.790> interesting<00:02:29.209> and<00:02:29.659> this<00:02:29.989> does<00:02:30.230> not

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:30.379 
but it is interesting and this does not

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:31.869 
but it is interesting and this does not
mean<00:02:30.709> that<00:02:30.950> playing<00:02:31.129> video<00:02:31.280> games<00:02:31.640> is<00:02:31.760> going

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
mean that playing video games is going

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:32.830 
mean that playing video games is going
to<00:02:31.939> make<00:02:32.090> you<00:02:32.180> shoot<00:02:32.329> up<00:02:32.450> a<00:02:32.510> school<00:02:32.540> or

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
to make you shoot up a school or

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.289 
to make you shoot up a school or
something<00:02:33.200> but<00:02:33.620> it<00:02:33.709> also<00:02:33.920> it<00:02:34.519> could<00:02:34.849> indicate

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
something but it also it could indicate

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.059 
something but it also it could indicate
that<00:02:35.689> perhaps<00:02:36.109> you're<00:02:36.319> being<00:02:36.439> affected<00:02:36.950> by

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
that perhaps you're being affected by

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:38.530 
that perhaps you're being affected by
the<00:02:37.129> things<00:02:37.370> you<00:02:37.519> see<00:02:37.700> in<00:02:37.819> ways<00:02:38.030> that<00:02:38.329> nobody

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
the things you see in ways that nobody

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.149 
the things you see in ways that nobody
would<00:02:39.019> have<00:02:39.109> predicted<00:02:39.590> that's<00:02:39.920> just<00:02:40.099> a
