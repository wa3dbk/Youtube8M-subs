on<00:00:16.000> our<00:00:16.119> tutorial<00:00:16.689> for<00:00:16.720> power<00:00:17.160> under

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.160 
on our tutorial for power under

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.310 
on our tutorial for power under
utilities<00:00:18.460> and<00:00:18.970> we<00:00:19.300> are<00:00:19.420> going<00:00:19.599> to<00:00:19.840> work<00:00:20.050> with

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
utilities and we are going to work with

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.460 
utilities and we are going to work with
now<00:00:20.590> the<00:00:20.650> coal<00:00:21.279> power<00:00:21.669> plant<00:00:22.090> okay<00:00:22.630> so<00:00:23.320> how<00:00:23.380> you

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
now the coal power plant okay so how you

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.029 
now the coal power plant okay so how you
do<00:00:23.560> is<00:00:23.650> grab<00:00:23.829> it<00:00:23.980> from<00:00:24.099> here<00:00:24.400> place<00:00:25.000> it<00:00:25.060> down

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
do is grab it from here place it down

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.470 
do is grab it from here place it down
but<00:00:27.039> general<00:00:27.430> rule<00:00:27.550> of<00:00:27.579> thumb<00:00:27.670> guys<00:00:28.060> keep<00:00:28.390> it

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
but general rule of thumb guys keep it

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.140 
but general rule of thumb guys keep it
away<00:00:28.570> from<00:00:28.689> your<00:00:29.279> residential<00:00:30.279> in<00:00:30.609> this

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
away from your residential in this

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.820 
away from your residential in this
example<00:00:31.509> I'm<00:00:31.810> actually<00:00:32.050> a<00:00:32.259> little<00:00:32.439> too<00:00:32.500> close

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:32.830 
example I'm actually a little too close

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.920 
example I'm actually a little too close
to<00:00:32.860> my<00:00:33.160> residential<00:00:33.580> so<00:00:34.180> let's<00:00:34.360> bulldoze<00:00:34.690> that

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
to my residential so let's bulldoze that

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.509 
to my residential so let's bulldoze that
we're<00:00:37.930> gonna<00:00:38.019> bring<00:00:38.199> it<00:00:38.350> down<00:00:38.500> here<00:00:38.739> okay

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:39.519 
we're gonna bring it down here okay

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:41.160 
we're gonna bring it down here okay
but<00:00:39.670> make<00:00:39.879> sure<00:00:39.910> it's<00:00:40.239> connected<00:00:40.720> by<00:00:40.750> rolled

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
but make sure it's connected by rolled

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.789 
but make sure it's connected by rolled
before<00:00:41.589> you<00:00:41.890> do<00:00:42.040> that<00:00:43.320> there<00:00:44.320> we<00:00:44.409> go<00:00:44.440> okay

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:46.799 
before you do that there we go okay

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:55.500 
before you do that there we go okay
now<00:00:47.799> let's<00:00:48.040> place<00:00:48.190> it<00:00:48.220> down<00:00:48.460> here<00:00:52.110> okay<00:00:53.790> so<00:00:54.790> to

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
now let's place it down here okay so to

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.340 
now let's place it down here okay so to
begin<00:00:55.809> now<00:00:56.769> that<00:00:56.949> we<00:00:57.010> have<00:00:57.220> it<00:00:57.339> here<00:00:58.140> it's<00:00:59.140> not

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
begin now that we have it here it's not

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.689 
begin now that we have it here it's not
gonna<00:00:59.589> start<00:00:59.860> producing<00:01:00.100> power<00:01:00.430> right<00:01:00.670> away

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
gonna start producing power right away

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:02.850 
gonna start producing power right away
although<00:01:01.210> this<00:01:01.449> does<00:01:01.689> say<00:01:01.960> it<00:01:02.110> that's<00:01:02.739> what

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
although this does say it that's what

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:03.390 
although this does say it that's what
it's<00:01:03.010> doing

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
it's doing

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.789 
it's doing
not<00:01:04.269> just<00:01:04.510> yet<00:01:04.689> it<00:01:04.809> has<00:01:04.989> to<00:01:05.140> be<00:01:05.229> manned<00:01:05.530> and

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
not just yet it has to be manned and

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.330 
not just yet it has to be manned and
right<00:01:06.130> now<00:01:06.280> it's<00:01:06.460> closed<00:01:06.760> so<00:01:07.950> let's<00:01:08.950> wait<00:01:09.130> till

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
right now it's closed so let's wait till

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.149 
right now it's closed so let's wait till
we<00:01:09.549> get<00:01:09.670> some<00:01:09.880> employees<00:01:10.330> to<00:01:10.509> run<00:01:10.630> it<00:01:10.950> okay<00:01:11.950> and

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
we get some employees to run it okay and

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:13.920 
we get some employees to run it okay and
there<00:01:12.280> you<00:01:12.369> go<00:01:12.490> guys<00:01:12.700> our<00:01:13.000> power<00:01:13.600> plant<00:01:13.840> is

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
there you go guys our power plant is

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.570 
there you go guys our power plant is
powered<00:01:14.259> so<00:01:14.799> let's<00:01:15.009> take<00:01:15.159> a<00:01:15.189> look<00:01:15.369> at<00:01:15.490> the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
powered so let's take a look at the

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.920 
powered so let's take a look at the
modules<00:01:16.000> and<00:01:16.270> it's<00:01:16.420> just<00:01:16.630> some<00:01:16.780> general

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
modules and it's just some general

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.710 
modules and it's just some general
things<00:01:17.260> to<00:01:17.410> know<00:01:17.530> about<00:01:17.560> coal<00:01:18.520> power<00:01:18.820> first

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
things to know about coal power first

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.430 
things to know about coal power first
things<00:01:19.960> first

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
things first

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.880 
things first
it<00:01:20.650> does<00:01:20.950> produce<00:01:21.430> pollution<00:01:22.440> now<00:01:23.440> currently

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
it does produce pollution now currently

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.680 
it does produce pollution now currently
the<00:01:24.100> air<00:01:24.190> pollution<00:01:24.610> generated<00:01:25.060> is<00:01:25.180> low<00:01:25.420> but

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
the air pollution generated is low but

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.540 
the air pollution generated is low but
that<00:01:25.870> does<00:01:26.140> change<00:01:26.170> over<00:01:26.620> time<00:01:26.890> trust<00:01:27.370> me

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
that does change over time trust me

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.840 
that does change over time trust me
other<00:01:28.480> things<00:01:28.840> that<00:01:29.080> are<00:01:29.200> of<00:01:29.500> note<00:01:29.770> is<00:01:30.670> the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
other things that are of note is the

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.210 
other things that are of note is the
coal<00:01:31.060> burning<00:01:31.330> rates<00:01:31.830> you'll<00:01:32.830> get<00:01:33.040> to<00:01:33.190> know

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
coal burning rates you'll get to know

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.690 
coal burning rates you'll get to know
this<00:01:34.150> with<00:01:34.990> the<00:01:35.110> modules<00:01:35.470> as<00:01:35.620> well<00:01:35.830> but

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
this with the modules as well but

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.500 
this with the modules as well but
understand<00:01:37.630> that<00:01:37.810> coal<00:01:38.110> requires<00:01:38.770> resources

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
understand that coal requires resources

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.370 
understand that coal requires resources
that's<00:01:40.510> probably<00:01:40.750> the<00:01:40.870> biggest<00:01:41.020> thing<00:01:41.260> you

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
that's probably the biggest thing you

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.380 
that's probably the biggest thing you
need<00:01:41.500> to<00:01:41.530> understand<00:01:41.979> when<00:01:42.909> you're<00:01:43.000> running

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
need to understand when you're running

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.940 
need to understand when you're running
this<00:01:43.540> generator<00:01:44.440> or<00:01:44.800> this<00:01:44.979> power<00:01:45.930> like<00:01:46.930> a<00:01:47.229> few

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
this generator or this power like a few

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:48.750 
this generator or this power like a few
others<00:01:48.190> as<00:01:48.400> well

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
others as well

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.790 
others as well
you<00:01:49.300> need<00:01:49.479> to<00:01:49.570> Reese<00:01:49.720> well<00:01:49.990> one<00:01:50.229> other<00:01:50.350> you

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
you need to Reese well one other you

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.380 
you need to Reese well one other you
need<00:01:51.010> resources<00:01:51.430> and<00:01:51.880> in<00:01:52.090> this<00:01:52.210> particular

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
need resources and in this particular

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.590 
need resources and in this particular
case<00:01:52.690> coal<00:01:53.200> so<00:01:54.070> you<00:01:54.610> have<00:01:54.760> two<00:01:54.909> options<00:01:55.090> here

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
case coal so you have two options here

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.050 
case coal so you have two options here
you<00:01:55.750> can<00:01:56.350> accept<00:01:56.770> local<00:01:57.159> coal<00:01:57.370> deliveries<00:01:57.820> and

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
you can accept local coal deliveries and

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.760 
you can accept local coal deliveries and
that<00:01:58.270> generally<00:01:58.720> means<00:01:58.750> if<00:01:59.170> you<00:01:59.260> have<00:01:59.470> if<00:01:59.680> you

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
that generally means if you have if you

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.280 
that generally means if you have if you
produce<00:01:59.920> :<00:02:00.580> in<00:02:00.729> this<00:02:01.030> city<00:02:01.330> that's<00:02:01.659> one<00:02:02.049> way<00:02:02.229> to

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
produce : in this city that's one way to

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.710 
produce : in this city that's one way to
do<00:02:02.470> that<00:02:02.620> also<00:02:03.100> if<00:02:03.549> you<00:02:03.640> produce<00:02:03.820> coal<00:02:04.299> in<00:02:04.600> the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
do that also if you produce coal in the

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.840 
do that also if you produce coal in the
region<00:02:05.080> you'll<00:02:05.560> accept<00:02:06.010> the<00:02:06.159> local<00:02:06.520> coal

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
region you'll accept the local coal

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.660 
region you'll accept the local coal
deliveries<00:02:07.360> first<00:02:08.080> okay<00:02:09.039> if<00:02:09.280> you<00:02:09.369> choose<00:02:09.640> a

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
deliveries first okay if you choose a

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.390 
deliveries first okay if you choose a
set<00:02:09.970> accept<00:02:10.420> global<00:02:11.080> coal<00:02:11.319> deliveries<00:02:11.860> you'll

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
set accept global coal deliveries you'll

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.880 
set accept global coal deliveries you'll
get<00:02:12.610> it<00:02:12.730> from<00:02:12.819> the<00:02:12.970> global<00:02:13.299> market<00:02:13.629> and<00:02:13.890> that's

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
get it from the global market and that's

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.149 
get it from the global market and that's
basically<00:02:15.790> at<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.269> current<00:02:16.690> coal<00:02:16.989> price<00:02:17.379> of

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:18.159 
basically at the current coal price of

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.819 
basically at the current coal price of
four<00:02:18.549> thousand<00:02:19.000> four<00:02:19.150> twenty<00:02:19.480> three<00:02:19.769> so<00:02:20.769> you

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:20.829 
four thousand four twenty three so you

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:22.110 
four thousand four twenty three so you
can<00:02:20.980> click<00:02:21.159> that<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.400> you'll<00:02:21.730> keep<00:02:21.909> getting

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
can click that and you'll keep getting

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.230 
can click that and you'll keep getting
shipments<00:02:22.629> of<00:02:22.719> that<00:02:22.870> we're<00:02:23.049> going

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
shipments of that we're going

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.790 
shipments of that we're going
have<00:02:23.330> to<00:02:23.420> do<00:02:23.510> that<00:02:23.660> because<00:02:23.840> we<00:02:24.080> our<00:02:24.350> region<00:02:24.680> is

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
have to do that because we our region is

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.710 
have to do that because we our region is
not<00:02:24.950> developed<00:02:25.430> so<00:02:25.670> there<00:02:26.300> you<00:02:26.390> go

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
not developed so there you go

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.110 
not developed so there you go
now<00:02:27.230> next<00:02:27.620> thing<00:02:27.860> is<00:02:28.070> the<00:02:28.340> modules<00:02:28.730> for<00:02:28.790> this

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
now next thing is the modules for this

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.960 
now next thing is the modules for this
guy<00:02:29.620> again<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:30.650> with<00:02:31.070> most<00:02:31.370> modules<00:02:31.580> they

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
guy again and with most modules they

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.270 
guy again and with most modules they
have<00:02:32.150> a<00:02:32.180> sign<00:02:32.540> that<00:02:32.780> you<00:02:33.470> can<00:02:33.590> place<00:02:33.800> it<00:02:34.100> does

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
have a sign that you can place it does

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.630 
have a sign that you can place it does
nothing<00:02:34.490> other<00:02:34.940> than<00:02:35.210> provide<00:02:35.920> cosmetic<00:02:36.920> or

aesthetics aesthetics the next one is

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.480 
aesthetics aesthetics the next one is
the<00:02:41.300> dirty<00:02:41.480> coal<00:02:41.720> generator<00:02:42.050> and<00:02:42.370> as<00:02:43.370> the

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
the dirty coal generator and as the

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.610 
the dirty coal generator and as the
information<00:02:43.910> provided<00:02:44.090> does<00:02:44.480> state<00:02:44.780> we're

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
information provided does state we're

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.280 
information provided does state we're
producing<00:02:46.010> 75<00:02:46.700> megawatts<00:02:47.270> and<00:02:47.930> as<00:02:48.080> you<00:02:48.170> can

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
producing 75 megawatts and as you can

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.290 
producing 75 megawatts and as you can
see<00:02:48.500> I<00:02:48.770> have<00:02:49.130> a<00:02:49.160> excess<00:02:49.580> of<00:02:49.760> seventy<00:02:50.150> four

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
see I have a excess of seventy four

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.130 
see I have a excess of seventy four
point<00:02:50.540> seven<00:02:50.900> because<00:02:51.230> I'm<00:02:51.470> using<00:02:51.680> 0.3<00:02:52.960> in<00:02:53.960> my

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
point seven because I'm using 0.3 in my

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.340 
point seven because I'm using 0.3 in my
city<00:02:54.410> so<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:56.090> cost<00:02:56.300> is<00:02:56.480> five<00:02:56.690> thousand<00:02:57.200> and

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
city so the cost is five thousand and

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.540 
city so the cost is five thousand and
then<00:02:57.950> there's<00:02:58.340> a<00:02:58.430> 425<00:02:59.210> 425<00:02:59.870> somalian<00:03:00.680> cost<00:03:01.340> per

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
then there's a 425 425 somalian cost per

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.250 
then there's a 425 425 somalian cost per
hour<00:03:01.760> which<00:03:02.060> is<00:03:02.180> added<00:03:02.510> to<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.690> base<00:03:02.810> cost<00:03:03.110> of

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
hour which is added to the base cost of

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.780 
hour which is added to the base cost of
the<00:03:03.560> running<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:04.040> generator<00:03:04.400> in<00:03:04.520> the<00:03:04.580> first

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
the running the generator in the first

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.150 
the running the generator in the first
place<00:03:05.080> also<00:03:06.080> you<00:03:06.350> have<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:06.590> advanced<00:03:06.860> coal

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
place also you have the advanced coal

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.310 
place also you have the advanced coal
but<00:03:07.370> let's<00:03:07.520> place<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:08.180> dirty<00:03:08.360> coal<00:03:08.600> as<00:03:09.170> you

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
but let's place the dirty coal as you

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.260 
but let's place the dirty coal as you
can<00:03:09.440> see<00:03:09.560> it<00:03:09.650> looks<00:03:09.770> like<00:03:09.890> just<00:03:10.700> like<00:03:10.820> the<00:03:11.120> one

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
can see it looks like just like the one

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.240 
can see it looks like just like the one
you<00:03:11.480> start<00:03:11.810> out<00:03:11.960> with<00:03:12.140> so<00:03:12.680> don't<00:03:13.010> worry<00:03:13.130> about

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
you start out with so don't worry about

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.010 
you start out with so don't worry about
having<00:03:13.400> to<00:03:13.820> place<00:03:14.090> it<00:03:14.270> right<00:03:14.300> up<00:03:14.570> right<00:03:14.810> away

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
having to place it right up right away

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.420 
having to place it right up right away
unless<00:03:15.230> you<00:03:15.470> have<00:03:15.590> a<00:03:15.620> huge<00:03:15.890> city<00:03:16.130> that<00:03:16.310> you're

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
unless you have a huge city that you're

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.060 
unless you have a huge city that you're
trying<00:03:16.700> to<00:03:16.730> power<00:03:17.440> advanced<00:03:18.440> coal<00:03:18.680> generator

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
trying to power advanced coal generator

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.810 
trying to power advanced coal generator
it's<00:03:19.670> just<00:03:19.910> pretty<00:03:20.090> much<00:03:20.180> this<00:03:21.080> one<00:03:21.320> see<00:03:22.160> it

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
it's just pretty much this one see it

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.010 
it's just pretty much this one see it
produces<00:03:23.300> less<00:03:23.690> pollution<00:03:24.220> and<00:03:25.690> let's<00:03:26.690> see

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
produces less pollution and let's see

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.900 
produces less pollution and let's see
the<00:03:27.260> burn<00:03:27.440> rate<00:03:27.710> is<00:03:27.740> eight<00:03:28.070> point<00:03:28.340> six<00:03:28.580> tons

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
the burn rate is eight point six tons

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.770 
the burn rate is eight point six tons
per<00:03:29.090> day<00:03:29.770> pollution<00:03:30.770> is<00:03:30.920> medium<00:03:31.540> whereas<00:03:32.540> this

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
per day pollution is medium whereas this

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.450 
per day pollution is medium whereas this
the<00:03:32.990> lower<00:03:33.170> one<00:03:33.380> is<00:03:33.500> high<00:03:33.680> so<00:03:34.040> as<00:03:34.100> you<00:03:34.220> can<00:03:34.340> see

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:34.460 
the lower one is high so as you can see

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.280 
the lower one is high so as you can see
it<00:03:34.580> does<00:03:34.760> produce<00:03:34.940> or<00:03:35.330> produce<00:03:35.840> less

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
it does produce or produce less

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.850 
it does produce or produce less
pollution<00:03:37.480> okay<00:03:38.480> but<00:03:38.720> it<00:03:38.810> burns<00:03:39.020> coal<00:03:39.590> at<00:03:39.770> a

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
pollution okay but it burns coal at a

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.860 
pollution okay but it burns coal at a
higher<00:03:40.190> rate<00:03:40.460> so<00:03:40.790> if<00:03:41.030> you<00:03:41.300> are<00:03:41.540> trying<00:03:41.780> to

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
higher rate so if you are trying to

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.430 
higher rate so if you are trying to
preserve<00:03:42.280> your<00:03:43.630> production<00:03:44.630> of<00:03:44.720> coal<00:03:44.960> or<00:03:44.990> your

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
preserve your production of coal or your

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.130 
preserve your production of coal or your
you<00:03:45.950> know<00:03:46.070> a<00:03:46.100> level<00:03:46.580> of<00:03:46.820> coal<00:03:47.140> that's

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
you know a level of coal that's

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.480 
you know a level of coal that's
something<00:03:48.500> to<00:03:48.560> take<00:03:48.590> into<00:03:48.770> account<00:03:48.980> and

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
something to take into account and

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.540 
something to take into account and
here's<00:03:49.730> why<00:03:49.940> that<00:03:50.210> matters<00:03:50.390> if<00:03:51.260> you<00:03:52.250> don't

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
here's why that matters if you don't

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.370 
here's why that matters if you don't
produce<00:03:52.730> coal<00:03:53.240> in<00:03:53.450> your<00:03:53.480> local<00:03:53.900> city<00:03:54.050> in<00:03:54.230> this

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
produce coal in your local city in this

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.630 
produce coal in your local city in this
city<00:03:54.620> then<00:03:55.520> the<00:03:55.730> costs<00:03:56.300> that<00:03:56.510> you<00:03:56.870> have<00:03:57.260> to<00:03:57.710> are

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
city then the costs that you have to are

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.210 
city then the costs that you have to are
the<00:03:59.300> charts<00:03:59.780> that<00:03:59.810> you<00:03:59.960> have<00:04:00.050> to<00:04:00.170> pay<00:04:00.380> to

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
the charts that you have to pay to

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.690 
the charts that you have to pay to
import<00:04:01.940> coal<00:04:02.380> will<00:04:03.380> weigh<00:04:03.800> heavily<00:04:03.830> on<00:04:04.220> this

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
import coal will weigh heavily on this

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.330 
import coal will weigh heavily on this
decision<00:04:05.120> here<00:04:05.360> it<00:04:05.930> costs<00:04:06.440> less<00:04:06.590> on<00:04:06.980> your

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
decision here it costs less on your

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.050 
decision here it costs less on your
cities<00:04:07.750> on<00:04:08.750> your<00:04:08.990> city<00:04:09.200> to<00:04:09.890> buy<00:04:10.040> this<00:04:10.100> than<00:04:10.940> it

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
cities on your city to buy this than it

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.240 
cities on your city to buy this than it
does<00:04:11.240> this<00:04:11.480> because<00:04:11.960> if<00:04:12.260> you<00:04:12.290> your<00:04:12.740> coal<00:04:13.010> burn

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
does this because if you your coal burn

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.010 
does this because if you your coal burn
rate<00:04:13.460> is<00:04:13.490> higher<00:04:13.880> you're<00:04:14.540> running<00:04:14.870> through

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
rate is higher you're running through

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.190 
rate is higher you're running through
your<00:04:15.140> coal<00:04:15.350> faster<00:04:15.830> which<00:04:15.980> means<00:04:16.190> your<00:04:17.200> import

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
your coal faster which means your import

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.410 
your coal faster which means your import
deliveries<00:04:18.680> will<00:04:18.890> increase<00:04:19.280> which<00:04:20.120> means

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.420 
deliveries will increase which means

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.830 
deliveries will increase which means
your<00:04:20.780> cash<00:04:21.790> outflow<00:04:22.790> will<00:04:23.120> increase<00:04:23.480> as<00:04:23.660> well

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
your cash outflow will increase as well

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.340 
your cash outflow will increase as well
let's<00:04:24.620> place<00:04:24.800> that

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
let's place that

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.650 
let's place that
there<00:04:27.160> you<00:04:27.220> go<00:04:27.400> the<00:04:27.820> last<00:04:28.030> one<00:04:28.210> which<00:04:28.360> you<00:04:28.480> have

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
there you go the last one which you have

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.110 
there you go the last one which you have
to<00:04:28.780> unlock<00:04:29.080> through<00:04:29.380> the<00:04:29.650> education<00:04:30.220> and<00:04:30.430> when

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
to unlock through the education and when

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.630 
to unlock through the education and when
I<00:04:31.150> say<00:04:31.390> the<00:04:31.540> education<00:04:32.020> that<00:04:32.260> is<00:04:32.640> unlocking

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
I say the education that is unlocking

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.190 
I say the education that is unlocking
first<00:04:34.000> of<00:04:34.060> all<00:04:34.150> having<00:04:34.270> a<00:04:34.420> university<00:04:34.660> in<00:04:35.080> your

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
first of all having a university in your

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.980 
first of all having a university in your
region<00:04:35.500> and<00:04:35.970> also<00:04:36.970> a<00:04:37.180> university<00:04:37.720> with<00:04:37.870> the

region and also a university with the
School<00:04:38.230> of<00:04:38.260> Engineering<00:04:38.670> okay<00:04:39.670> then<00:04:40.240> you<00:04:40.330> have

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
School of Engineering okay then you have

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.420 
School of Engineering okay then you have
to<00:04:40.600> complete<00:04:40.900> the<00:04:40.990> research<00:04:41.290> for<00:04:41.590> it<00:04:41.740> then<00:04:42.310> you

to complete the research for it then you
can<00:04:42.550> place<00:04:42.730> this<00:04:42.910> guy<00:04:43.000> but<00:04:43.390> it<00:04:43.510> is<00:04:43.600> clean

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
can place this guy but it is clean

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.490 
can place this guy but it is clean
energy<00:04:44.520> the<00:04:45.520> air<00:04:45.580> pollution<00:04:45.940> is<00:04:46.210> low<00:04:46.500> burn

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
energy the air pollution is low burn

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.440 
energy the air pollution is low burn
rate<00:04:47.740> is<00:04:47.920> in<00:04:48.100> the<00:04:48.130> middle<00:04:48.610> between<00:04:48.730> these<00:04:49.240> two

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
rate is in the middle between these two

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.010 
rate is in the middle between these two
guys<00:04:49.660> and<00:04:50.880> you're<00:04:51.880> still<00:04:52.090> producing<00:04:52.540> 75

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
guys and you're still producing 75

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.480 
guys and you're still producing 75
megawatts<00:04:53.590> so<00:04:53.680> it's<00:04:53.890> definitely<00:04:54.280> a<00:04:54.340> better

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
megawatts so it's definitely a better

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.670 
megawatts so it's definitely a better
