00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
strobe for actually setting uh I guess

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.789 
strobe for actually setting uh I guess
not<00:01:27.000> setting<00:01:27.270> up<00:01:27.360> but<00:01:27.570> well<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.380> was<00:01:28.530> setting

something<00:02:07.170> along<00:02:07.350> those<00:02:07.590> lines<00:02:07.680> basically

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
something along those lines basically

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.420 
something along those lines basically
like<00:02:08.460> since<00:02:08.700> he<00:02:08.850> didn't<00:02:09.180> hit<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.509> shot<00:02:09.960> um<00:02:10.770> he

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
like since he didn't hit a shot um he

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.800 
like since he didn't hit a shot um he
wasn't<00:02:11.850> actually<00:02:12.120> going<00:02:12.150> for<00:02:12.570> them<00:02:12.720> i<00:02:12.780> guess

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
wasn't actually going for them i guess

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.060 
wasn't actually going for them i guess
was<00:02:13.080> kind<00:02:13.230> of<00:02:13.260> his<00:02:13.380> case<00:02:13.560> i<00:02:13.740> don't<00:02:13.830> tell<00:02:13.980> they

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
was kind of his case i don't tell they

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.620 
was kind of his case i don't tell they
know<00:02:14.160> if<00:02:14.250> I'm<00:02:14.340> saying<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:14.730> right<00:02:14.760> but<00:02:15.450> at<00:02:15.540> least

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
know if I'm saying it right but at least

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.940 
know if I'm saying it right but at least
that's<00:02:15.840> what<00:02:15.960> it<00:02:15.990> seemed<00:02:16.260> like<00:02:16.380> so<00:02:16.620> I<00:02:16.650> don't

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.920 
that's what it seemed like so I don't
know<00:02:17.070> I<00:02:17.460> am<00:02:18.030> happy<00:02:18.240> i<00:02:18.420> guess<00:02:18.690> there<00:02:18.840> is

that they've been hitting I guess since

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.310 
that they've been hitting I guess since
they<00:03:05.160> started<00:03:05.310> going<00:03:05.700> for<00:03:05.940> illcams<00:03:06.660> 50<00:03:07.110> and
