pull everything back up and jump the
next<00:01:55.130> jump<00:01:55.360> most<00:01:56.360> rhythm<00:01:56.659> sections<00:01:57.110> are<00:01:57.590> built

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
next jump most rhythm sections are built

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.010 
next jump most rhythm sections are built
to<00:01:58.159> be<00:01:58.189> used<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:58.700> way<00:01:58.820> they<00:01:59.000> are<00:01:59.149> you're<00:01:59.930> gonna

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
to be used the way they are you're gonna

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.179 
to be used the way they are you're gonna
if<00:02:00.259> you<00:02:00.380> clear<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.710> first<00:02:00.890> one<00:02:01.100> you

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
if you clear the first one you

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:02.530 
if you clear the first one you
definitely<00:02:01.399> clear<00:02:01.880> the<00:02:01.939> second<00:02:02.270> one<00:02:02.360> if<00:02:02.450> you

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
definitely clear the second one if you

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.469 
definitely clear the second one if you
clear<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:02.840> second<00:02:03.110> one<00:02:03.229> it's<00:02:03.409> gonna<00:02:03.649> go<00:02:03.829> so<00:02:04.100> on

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
clear the second one it's gonna go so on

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.600 
clear the second one it's gonna go so on
now<00:02:05.479> once<00:02:05.689> again<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:06.680> importance<00:02:07.100> of<00:02:07.250> rhythm

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
now once again the importance of rhythm

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.880 
now once again the importance of rhythm
sections<00:02:08.030> are<00:02:08.299> if<00:02:09.110> you<00:02:09.320> get<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.590> rhythm<00:02:09.860> down

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
sections are if you get the rhythm down

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.920 
sections are if you get the rhythm down
then<00:02:10.610> you<00:02:10.759> move<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.120> tricks<00:02:11.420> towards<00:02:11.810> the

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
then you move the tricks towards the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.930 
then you move the tricks towards the
rhythm<00:02:12.200> section<00:02:12.489> tricks<00:02:13.489> in<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.790> rhythm

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
rhythm section tricks in the rhythm

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.750 
rhythm section tricks in the rhythm
section<00:02:14.060> are<00:02:14.540> always<00:02:14.840> so<00:02:15.049> good<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:16.610> that's

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
section are always so good and that's

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.539 
section are always so good and that's
basically<00:02:17.209> the<00:02:17.299> elements<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:18.019> rhythm

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
basically the elements to rhythm

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.220 
basically the elements to rhythm
hopefully<00:02:19.549> you<00:02:19.640> guys<00:02:19.730> can<00:02:20.000> try<00:02:20.180> it<00:02:20.329> and<00:02:20.570> get<00:02:21.170> a

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
hopefully you guys can try it and get a

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.160 
hopefully you guys can try it and get a
feel<00:02:21.530> for<00:02:21.560> it<00:02:21.829> for<00:02:22.519> yourselves<00:02:22.850> like<00:02:23.810> I<00:02:23.930> said
