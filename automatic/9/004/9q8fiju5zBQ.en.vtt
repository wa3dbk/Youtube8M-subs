I'll actually cut a stencil that this
isn't<00:00:05.250> been<00:00:05.730> vacuum-formed<00:00:06.420> already<00:00:06.690> and

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839

it's a fun part about stencils is so
once<00:00:25.800> I've<00:00:25.920> got<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.160> drawn<00:00:26.880> on<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.119> stencil<00:00:27.630> I

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
once I've got it drawn on the stencil I

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.330 
once I've got it drawn on the stencil I
got<00:00:28.710> just<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.250> regular<00:00:29.640> old<00:00:29.849> dremel<00:00:30.240> tool<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.689> a

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
got just a regular old dremel tool and a

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.639 
got just a regular old dremel tool and a
small<00:00:32.340> 30<00:00:32.940> mm<00:00:33.540> spin<00:00:33.750> in<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.020> end<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.500> that's

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
small 30 mm spin in the end and that's

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.470 
small 30 mm spin in the end and that's
what<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:34.860> like<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.219> use<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.670> can<00:00:35.850> just<00:00:36.210> kind<00:00:36.390> of

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
what I like to use you can just kind of

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.470 
what I like to use you can just kind of
use<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.870> like<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.579> pencil<00:00:38.579> or<00:00:38.670> whatever<00:00:38.820> and

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
use it like a a pencil or whatever and

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.170 
use it like a a pencil or whatever and
it<00:00:39.690> cuts<00:00:39.960> away<00:00:40.110> just<00:00:40.980> like<00:00:41.129> as<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.520> draw<00:00:41.790> so

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
it cuts away just like as you draw so

00:00:42.180 --> 00:02:18.780 
it cuts away just like as you draw so
I'll<00:00:43.020> go<00:00:43.410> ahead<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.739> start<00:00:43.950> cutting<00:00:44.190> on

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.890 

so<00:02:19.790> it's<00:02:19.909> kinda<00:02:20.150> hard<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.329> see<00:02:20.569> but<00:02:20.750> it's

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
so it's kinda hard to see but it's

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.710 
so it's kinda hard to see but it's
pretty<00:02:21.140> rough<00:02:21.379> right<00:02:21.650> now<00:02:21.680> so<00:02:22.489> I<00:02:22.519> go<00:02:22.790> I<00:02:23.209> usually

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
pretty rough right now so I go I usually

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.619 
pretty rough right now so I go I usually
go<00:02:23.900> in<00:02:24.079> now<00:02:24.349> with<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:24.819> little<00:02:25.819> exacto<00:02:26.390> knife

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
go in now with a little exacto knife

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:32.199 
go in now with a little exacto knife
here<00:02:29.230> try<00:02:30.230> to<00:02:30.290> get<00:02:31.129> some<00:02:31.370> of<00:02:31.489> that<00:02:31.519> the<00:02:32.000> burr

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
here try to get some of that the burr

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.170 
here try to get some of that the burr
the<00:02:32.239> rough<00:02:32.720> edge<00:02:32.959> that<00:02:33.260> comes<00:02:33.530> up<00:02:36.879> pretty<00:02:37.879> hard

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
the rough edge that comes up pretty hard

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.960 
the rough edge that comes up pretty hard
to<00:02:38.329> do<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:39.680> camera<00:02:40.220> button<00:02:42.459> once<00:02:43.459> you<00:02:43.609> do<00:02:43.790> it

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
to do the camera button once you do it

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.640 
to do the camera button once you do it
if<00:02:44.209> you<00:02:44.329> do<00:02:44.569> use<00:02:44.750> a<00:02:44.780> dremel<00:02:45.019> tool<00:02:45.290> you<00:02:45.440> can<00:02:45.560> also

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
if you do use a dremel tool you can also

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.559 
if you do use a dremel tool you can also
use<00:02:45.980> just<00:02:46.010> an<00:02:46.370> exacto<00:02:46.879> knife<00:02:47.030> if<00:02:47.209> you<00:02:47.239> want

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
use just an exacto knife if you want

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.470 
use just an exacto knife if you want
just<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:48.019> cut<00:02:48.290> it<00:02:48.319> out<00:02:48.560> and<00:02:48.829> that's<00:02:49.480> perfectly

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
just to cut it out and that's perfectly

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.440 
just to cut it out and that's perfectly
okay<00:02:50.569> to<00:02:51.220> just<00:02:52.220> sometimes<00:02:52.639> a<00:02:52.760> dremel<00:02:53.090> tool<00:02:53.239> if

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
okay to just sometimes a dremel tool if

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.000 
okay to just sometimes a dremel tool if
you<00:02:53.599> want<00:02:53.840> kind<00:02:54.200> of<00:02:54.290> a<00:02:54.349> rougher<00:02:54.709> looking
