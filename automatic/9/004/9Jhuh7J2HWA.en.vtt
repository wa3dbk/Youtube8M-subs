00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.569 

in<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.570> meeting<00:00:57.930> but<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.680> often<00:00:58.860> times<00:00:59.250> does

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
in the meeting but it often times does

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.270 
in the meeting but it often times does
not<00:00:59.730> include<00:01:00.089> all<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.750> feedings<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.680> so

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
not include all of the feedings and so

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.549 
not include all of the feedings and so
this<00:01:02.519> often<00:01:03.030> occurs<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.540> birds<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:04.500> have

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
this often occurs in birds that have

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.060 
this often occurs in birds that have
really<00:01:05.550> wide<00:01:05.790> ranges<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.720> food<00:01:07.140> resources<00:01:07.170> so

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
really wide ranges of food resources so

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.180 
really wide ranges of food resources so
a<00:01:08.310> lot<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:08.909> plot<00:01:09.710> you<00:01:10.710> know<00:01:10.830> they're<00:01:11.009> out<00:01:11.040> there

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
a lot of plot you know they're out there

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.859 
a lot of plot you know they're out there
gliding<00:01:11.729> around<00:01:11.790> looking<00:01:12.300> for<00:01:12.330> food<00:01:12.509> all<00:01:12.840> day

gliding around looking for food all day

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.080 
gliding around looking for food all day
it's<00:01:13.280> practically<00:01:14.280> impossible<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.850> maintain

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
it's practically impossible to maintain

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.359 
it's practically impossible to maintain
a<00:01:15.270> territory<00:01:15.780> that's<00:01:15.990> large<00:01:16.290> enough<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:17.190> have

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
a territory that's large enough to have

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.700 
a territory that's large enough to have
all<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.030> food<00:01:18.240> resources<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:18.960> there<00:01:19.140> that

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
all of the food resources in there that

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.730 
all of the food resources in there that
a<00:01:20.039> predatory<00:01:20.850> Hawk<00:01:21.149> might<00:01:21.420> meet<00:01:21.720> class<00:01:22.410> is<00:01:22.619> all

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
a predatory Hawk might meet class is all

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.469 
a predatory Hawk might meet class is all
done<00:01:22.920> for<00:01:23.130> today<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.399> I'm<00:01:23.789> back<00:01:24.000> here<00:01:24.240> at<00:01:24.360> my

wore my late 80s Early 90s because those

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.589 
wore my late 80s Early 90s because those
were<00:01:53.069> our<00:01:53.099> school<00:01:53.399> colors<00:01:53.580> so<00:01:54.030> for<00:01:54.300> retro

00:01:54.589 --> 00:01:54.599 
were our school colors so for retro

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:55.910 
were our school colors so for retro
games<00:01:54.780> we<00:01:54.959> get<00:01:55.080> to<00:01:55.200> wear<00:01:55.289> those<00:01:55.470> which<00:01:55.739> is

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
games we get to wear those which is

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.210 
games we get to wear those which is
always<00:01:56.190> fun<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:57.590> online<00:01:58.590> palms<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.280> whatnot

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
always fun and online palms and whatnot

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.440 
always fun and online palms and whatnot
this<00:02:02.220> process<00:02:02.429> actually<00:02:02.789> took<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.090> little<00:02:03.270> bit

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
this process actually took a little bit

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.080 
this process actually took a little bit
less<00:02:04.020> time<00:02:04.259> than<00:02:04.410> usual<00:02:04.649> because<00:02:05.039> there<00:02:05.910> are

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
less time than usual because there are

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.540 
less time than usual because there are
four<00:02:06.539> more<00:02:06.750> uniforms<00:02:07.349> that<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.619> wasn't<00:02:08.190> given

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
four more uniforms that I wasn't given

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.990 
four more uniforms that I wasn't given
this<00:02:08.640> year<00:02:08.989> so<00:02:09.989> since<00:02:10.709> our<00:02:10.830> team<00:02:11.400> was<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:11.760> big

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
this year so since our team was so big

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.630 
this year so since our team was so big
this<00:02:12.150> year<00:02:12.420> we<00:02:13.050> were<00:02:13.319> split<00:02:13.650> in<00:02:13.739> half<00:02:13.950> for

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
this year we were split in half for

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.670 
this year we were split in half for
volleyball<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.420> basketball<00:02:15.840> games<00:02:16.290> so<00:02:16.560> we

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
volleyball and basketball games so we

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.930 
volleyball and basketball games so we
rotated<00:02:17.099> and<00:02:17.900> we<00:02:18.900> like<00:02:19.830> one<00:02:20.400> half<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.760> team

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
rotated and we like one half of the team

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.550 
rotated and we like one half of the team
got<00:02:21.390> certain<00:02:21.750> uniforms<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.349> other<00:02:22.470> have

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
got certain uniforms and the other have

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.530 
got certain uniforms and the other have
a<00:02:22.650> team<00:02:22.800> got<00:02:23.040> sore<00:02:23.250> anymore<00:02:23.400> which<00:02:24.239> is<00:02:24.330> kind<00:02:24.510> of

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
a team got sore anymore which is kind of

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.610 
a team got sore anymore which is kind of
nice<00:02:24.660> because<00:02:24.930> then<00:02:25.110> you<00:02:25.200> have<00:02:25.319> a<00:02:25.349> little<00:02:25.530> bit

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
nice because then you have a little bit

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.170 
nice because then you have a little bit
less<00:02:25.739> to<00:02:25.860> keep<00:02:26.010> track<00:02:26.190> of<00:02:26.250> but<00:02:26.610> it's<00:02:26.879> kind<00:02:27.060> of<00:02:27.090> a

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
less to keep track of but it's kind of a

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.080 
less to keep track of but it's kind of a
bummer<00:02:27.300> because<00:02:27.510> I<00:02:27.690> didn't<00:02:28.440> get<00:02:28.910> handed<00:02:29.910> my

out<00:03:12.190> I<00:03:12.250> had<00:03:12.580> a<00:03:12.610> chance<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:13.270> stunt<00:03:13.690> tonight<00:03:14.410> we

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
out I had a chance to stunt tonight we

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.380 
out I had a chance to stunt tonight we
had<00:03:14.830> open<00:03:15.100> practice<00:03:15.520> and<00:03:15.820> we<00:03:15.880> had<00:03:16.000> it<00:03:16.090> outside

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
had open practice and we had it outside

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.930 
had open practice and we had it outside
which<00:03:16.660> is<00:03:16.810> really<00:03:16.960> nice<00:03:17.140> and<00:03:17.880> there<00:03:18.880> were

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
which is really nice and there were

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:36.180 
which is really nice and there were
definitely<00:03:19.210> some<00:03:19.300> bad<00:03:19.720> stunts

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.290 

but<00:03:37.190> there's<00:03:37.400> also<00:03:37.550> a<00:03:37.640> lot<00:03:37.700> of<00:03:37.790> good<00:03:38.030> stunts

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
but there's also a lot of good stunts

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.720 
but there's also a lot of good stunts
I'm<00:03:39.020> definitely<00:03:39.260> feeling<00:03:39.620> a<00:03:40.040> lot<00:03:40.670> more

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
I'm definitely feeling a lot more

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.200 
I'm definitely feeling a lot more
comfortable<00:03:41.210> with<00:03:41.570> the<00:03:41.690> stunt<00:03:41.960> and<00:03:43.210> even

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.210 
comfortable with the stunt and even

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.090 
comfortable with the stunt and even
though<00:03:44.300> we<00:03:44.390> didn't<00:03:44.630> hit<00:03:44.840> any<00:03:45.080> tonight<00:03:45.530> we

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
though we didn't hit any tonight we

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.520 
though we didn't hit any tonight we
definitely<00:03:46.400> got<00:03:46.520> a<00:03:46.550> lot<00:03:46.730> closer<00:03:47.090> and<00:03:47.540> it<00:03:48.230> feels

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
definitely got a lot closer and it feels

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.430 
definitely got a lot closer and it feels
more<00:03:48.920> natural<00:03:49.280> i<00:03:49.940> guess<00:03:50.150> and<00:03:50.510> i<00:03:50.930> have<00:03:51.140> a<00:03:51.170> much

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
more natural i guess and i have a much

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.870 
more natural i guess and i have a much
better<00:03:51.590> understanding<00:03:51.709> of<00:03:52.250> what<00:03:52.550> i<00:03:52.610> need<00:03:52.850> to

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
better understanding of what i need to

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.780 
better understanding of what i need to
fix<00:03:53.180> in<00:03:53.480> order<00:03:53.900> to<00:03:54.770> make<00:03:54.860> the<00:03:55.040> stunt<00:03:55.280> hit<00:03:55.550> so

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
fix in order to make the stunt hit so

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.280 
fix in order to make the stunt hit so
i'm<00:03:55.880> pretty<00:03:56.000> confident<00:03:56.450> that<00:03:56.540> i<00:03:56.660> will<00:03:56.750> hit<00:03:57.140> at

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
i'm pretty confident that i will hit at

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:19.500 
i'm pretty confident that i will hit at
some<00:03:57.500> point<00:03:57.740> this<00:03:57.860> week<00:04:08.800> i<00:04:09.800> used<00:04:10.280> to<00:04:10.370> have<00:04:10.520> back

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.759 

and<00:04:20.510> sometimes<00:04:21.140> it's<00:04:21.260> good<00:04:21.320> to<00:04:21.440> take<00:04:21.620> a<00:04:21.680> break

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
and sometimes it's good to take a break

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.860 
and sometimes it's good to take a break
and<00:04:22.190> not<00:04:22.640> work<00:04:22.820> on<00:04:22.940> rewinds<00:04:23.419> and<00:04:23.570> just<00:04:23.720> two

and not work on rewinds and just two

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.080 
and not work on rewinds and just two
stunts<00:04:24.200> that<00:04:24.410> you<00:04:25.220> know<00:04:25.340> you<00:04:25.400> can<00:04:25.610> hit<00:04:25.730> an<00:04:25.940> hour

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090
