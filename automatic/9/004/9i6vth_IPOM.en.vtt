00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.810
 You are happy with vector today with mine 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:20.169
 whose character is called to this 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.689
 the criminal and his style team probably 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:25.599
 there will be some kind of team throws 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.089
 movements of this character i am so 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.980
 I suspect 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:33.700
 let's see how much he has changed 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.860
 versus part 9 so let's do 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.440
 bricks 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.160
 on the cup all okay cool head off x 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.530
 tails let's haircut 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.840
 oh oh how painfully chopped chopped up 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.510
 the chest about him and broke 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.820
 the spine is very painful comrades 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.980
 very painful so let's move on 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.510
 directly to the movement itself by 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.560
 ejection in another 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:02.770
 cool so the balloon is called 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.460
 we can do it in the air so 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.460
 Balloon 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:14.220
 oh like a ball that was in the ninth 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.170
 parts as I understand it is necessary to do 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:21.380
 just jump on the pier and no you can 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.380
 on use okay oh strong meter 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:29.430
 hard looking for me fails not 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:34.680
 so good not so easy to do 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.110
 this movement is strong unfortunately not 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.850
 it turns out 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.979
 okay, we go on to our ball well, it's the same 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.979
 Standard shard standard bulb and 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:51.149
 here with a meter as I understand it causes 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.600
 more more demage and so we can 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.700
 keep it flying and letting go but at 9 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.710
 part of something similar was going on 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:04.140
 ball upstairs but this is just the version running 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.250
 also somewhere that was similar , I was part of 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.229
 effort well just 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.459
 I understand more smoke you put and more 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:15.000
 strikes we can strike and then throw 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.610
 blade same movement no it's me nobody 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.940
 I click to throw the blade this movement 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:25.920
 it was also there was an amplified meter 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:29.459
 it turns out 22 of these understandable stranglehold 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.519
 called it as I understand the command 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:35.660
 roll and that's the case a goat Open Path Well 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.660
 like with meter 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.700
 and here I am the rollers changing the movement itself 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:49.290
 it is understandable to give a blow to the ribs 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:53.220
 where the ribs would be it did not understand the blow 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:56.849
 on the ribs called for you constantly 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:00.239
 all but the other way here is a blow to 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:07.890
 ribs wait through the movement where 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:11.849
 grandson noose it as here this noose so 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:16.319
 it you hard noose clear all 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:21.989
 it gets hit in the ribs well y 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:24.660
 a severe blow to the ribs finally the 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.060
 I did well, as I understand more than you really 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.620
 so let's move on to the next style 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.230
 but it too lingered on it 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.750
 style very painfully long so 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.030
 let's see where the mask is the night style 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:40.230
 called the thug probably will he 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:43.380
 cut and shred as I understand it will 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.620
 everyone is very painfully very painful to everyone 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.620
 will be 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.140
 well let's look so balloon 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.580
 was k on the ball there was a ball up there was a blade 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:04:02.209
 blade here are the new movements 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:05.220
 but with the meter you can still want 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:09.000
 the combination we do next throw 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:12.900
 blade was a powerful charge called too 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.090
 some kind of enhancement or restoration 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.370
 life, I principle is not clear 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:22.079
 developers did not bother in the description 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.750
 blows write what it means well 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:28.580
 But in principle, and all the style we have 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:32.840
 let's see the last third style 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:35.010
 which is called as it is called 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.560
 cybernetic will use 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.760
 cybernetics 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.190
 I donâ€™t understand how it will be problems 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:45.380
 implemented now we are with you this 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:48.270
 see how it will all be shown 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:54.590
 so let's see the vase ball was here three 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:54.590
 hitting the eye with a volley of wine and near 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:04.460
 she wears it turns out two blows and no this 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:08.330
 just to fund something we can 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:16.910
 selling on this would be understandable but with a meter 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:18.920
 But with the meter it turns out it's clear how you 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:23.930
 not impressed as combo sentences 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:26.960
 normal laser up is called something 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:30.640
 there is this for arrivals jumping 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:33.590
 rivals can be shot like this 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:37.940
 okay reduce knife throw but it 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:39.620
 sort of was so he up in a different way and 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.410
 speed is much faster in this 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.970
 movement but here are all styles all movements 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.770
 which this character does not have 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.100
 forget to like you was this 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.100
 vector
