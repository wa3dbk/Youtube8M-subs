00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
the jam and so I was originally

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.720 
the jam and so I was originally
intending<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.679> use<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:14.009> second<00:00:14.280> of<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.490> cure

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
intending to use the second of the cure

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.550 
intending to use the second of the cure
from<00:00:14.880> Tuesday's<00:00:15.330> recipe<00:00:15.719> in<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.870> jam<00:00:16.080> but<00:00:16.529> I

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
from Tuesday's recipe in the jam but I
