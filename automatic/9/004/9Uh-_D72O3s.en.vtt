00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
it's definitely one that I really really

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.760 
it's definitely one that I really really
like<00:00:45.149> because<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:45.809> hard<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.289> get<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.649> could

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
know very good so it shouldn't take him

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.920 
know very good so it shouldn't take him
too<00:01:47.549> long<00:01:47.700> once<00:01:47.939> he<00:01:48.060> actually<00:01:48.360> gets<00:01:48.509> started

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
too long once he actually gets started

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.170 
too long once he actually gets started
on<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.259> Edit<00:01:49.560> but<00:01:49.770> yeah<00:01:50.250> like<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.729> said<00:01:50.759> have

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
on the Edit but yeah like I said have

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.940 
on the Edit but yeah like I said have
him<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.390> play<00:01:51.600> too<00:01:51.810> much<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.259> actually<00:01:52.500> need

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
him to play too much so I actually need

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.249 
him to play too much so I actually need
to<00:01:52.979> get<00:01:53.939> on<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.299> get<00:01:54.390> some<00:01:54.509> gameplays<00:01:54.990> because

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
to get on and get some gameplays because

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.959 
to get on and get some gameplays because
I<00:01:55.350> think<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.799> am<00:01:55.920> all<00:01:56.100> out<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.310> gameplays<00:01:56.759> right

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
I think I am all out of gameplays right

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.050 
I think I am all out of gameplays right
here<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:57.960> would<00:01:58.140> have<00:01:58.229> been<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.820> quad<00:01:59.820> feed

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
here this would have been a quad feed

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.039 
here this would have been a quad feed
like<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.390> would<00:02:00.479> have<00:02:00.570> been<00:02:00.659> really<00:02:00.930> solid

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
like it would have been really solid

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.630 
like it would have been really solid
quadri<00:02:01.469> cuz<00:02:01.649> all<00:02:01.740> my<00:02:01.860> shots<00:02:02.040> are<00:02:02.189> pretty<00:02:02.369> quick

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
quadri cuz all my shots are pretty quick

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.300 
quadri cuz all my shots are pretty quick
and<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.689> think<00:02:03.930> getting<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.439> quad<00:02:04.799> feed<00:02:05.040> like<00:02:05.280> a

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
and I think getting a quad feed like a

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.550 
and I think getting a quad feed like a
pretty<00:02:05.969> solid<00:02:06.299> one<00:02:06.630> because<00:02:06.930> it's<00:02:07.110> it's

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
pretty solid one because it's it's

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.229 
pretty solid one because it's it's
almost<00:02:07.740> impossible<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.459> get<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.640> straight-up

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
almost impossible to get a straight-up

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.229 
almost impossible to get a straight-up
solid<00:02:09.929> quad<00:02:10.170> feed<00:02:10.440> non<00:02:10.709> reload<00:02:11.640> cancelling

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
solid quad feed non reload cancelling

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.670
