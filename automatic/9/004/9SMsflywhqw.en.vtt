00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:12.669 
that I would look for in a shampoo it

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:17.010 
that I would look for in a shampoo it
doesn't<00:07:12.999> have<00:07:13.120> sulfates<00:07:14.849> parabens<00:07:16.020> silicon

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.209 
doesn't have sulfates parabens silicon
sports<00:07:17.409> and<00:07:17.680> it<00:07:18.490> is<00:07:18.789> pH<00:07:19.479> balance<00:07:20.199> which<00:07:20.979> is

00:07:21.209 --> 00:07:21.219 
sports and it is pH balance which is

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:23.070 
sports and it is pH balance which is
very<00:07:21.550> important<00:07:21.999> to<00:07:22.060> me<00:07:22.150> because<00:07:22.779> it's<00:07:23.020> my

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.080 
very important to me because it's my

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.019
