00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
first the way I do it is I start with

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.849 
first the way I do it is I start with
just<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.490> half<00:00:26.849> ponytail<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.769> depending<00:00:28.769> on

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
just a half ponytail and depending on

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.259 
just a half ponytail and depending on
how<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.070> want<00:00:29.160> your<00:00:29.340> french<00:00:29.609> braid<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:30.060> look

how you want your french braid to look

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.820 
how you want your french braid to look
you<00:00:30.449> can<00:00:30.570> start<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.929> really<00:00:31.140> low<00:00:31.320> like<00:00:31.590> down

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
you can start it really low like down

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.040 
you can start it really low like down
here<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:32.850> can<00:00:32.969> start<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.239> higher<00:00:33.480> up<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.960> I'm

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
here you can start to higher up and I'm

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.389 
here you can start to higher up and I'm
going<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.260> start<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.530> higher<00:00:34.710> up<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.100> make<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.370> a

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
going to start a higher up to make it a

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.040 
going to start a higher up to make it a
longer<00:00:35.850> french<00:00:36.090> braid<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.510> starting<00:00:36.870> higher

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
longer french braid is starting higher

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:46.910 
longer french braid is starting higher
on<00:00:37.290> her<00:00:37.410> head<00:00:44.809> so<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.899> just<00:00:46.170> gather<00:00:46.379> some<00:00:46.680> hair

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
on her head so you just gather some hair

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.500 
on her head so you just gather some hair
like<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.399> then<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.730> usually<00:00:47.910> comb<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.450> out

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
like this and then I usually comb it out

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.410 
like this and then I usually comb it out
a<00:00:48.570> little<00:00:48.780> bit<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.890> then<00:00:50.730> what<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.000> do<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.149> you

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
a little bit and then what you do is you

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.639 
a little bit and then what you do is you
just<00:00:51.449> start<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.020> like<00:00:52.050> you're<00:00:52.289> going<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.469> do

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
just start it like you're going to do

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.590 
just start it like you're going to do
regular<00:00:53.039> braid<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.760> divide<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.180> into<00:00:54.300> three

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
regular braid you divide it into three

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.099 
regular braid you divide it into three
sections<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.289> then<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:56.010> usually<00:00:56.840> cross<00:00:57.840> it

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
sections and then I usually cross it

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.959 
sections and then I usually cross it
twice<00:00:58.410> before<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:58.949> start<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.430> actual<00:00:59.670> French

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
twice before I start the actual French

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.360 
twice before I start the actual French
braid<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.480> do<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:01.050> know<00:01:01.170> left<00:01:01.649> over<00:01:01.800> right<00:01:01.949> then

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
braid I do you know left over right then

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.050

like you would if you were going to do a

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.740 
like you would if you were going to do a
regular<00:01:33.000> braid<00:01:35.060> then<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.210> grab<00:01:36.390> some<00:01:36.600> hair

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
regular braid then you grab some hair

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.899 
regular braid then you grab some hair
from<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.079> side<00:01:40.159> and<00:01:41.159> what<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.490> do<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.670> you

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
from the side and what you do is you

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.969 
from the side and what you do is you
just<00:01:41.939> get<00:01:42.299> like<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.600> thin<00:01:43.490> walk<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:45.890> usually<00:01:46.890> get

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
just get like a thin walk I usually get

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.969 
just get like a thin walk I usually get
about<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.430> much<00:01:48.350> so<00:01:49.350> what<00:01:49.560> you're<00:01:49.710> doing<00:01:49.740> is

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
about that much so what you're doing is

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.780 
about that much so what you're doing is
you're<00:01:50.040> pulling<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.520> across<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:52.520> mia<00:01:53.520> has

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
you're pulling it across and mia has

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.510 
you're pulling it across and mia has
these<00:01:54.060> weird<00:01:54.710> short<00:01:55.710> strands<00:01:56.189> here<00:01:56.340> they're

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
these weird short strands here they're

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.179 
these weird short strands here they're
getting<00:01:56.880> in<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.000> way<00:01:57.180> but<00:01:57.799> that's<00:01:58.799> how<00:01:59.040> it

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
getting in the way but that's how it

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.679 
getting in the way but that's how it
goes<00:02:01.009> so<00:02:02.009> then<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.280> just<00:02:02.490> add<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.850> again<00:02:03.450> to

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
goes so then you just add that again to

rest of the way down it does help to

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.729 
rest of the way down it does help to
have<00:03:39.120> a<00:03:39.299> comb<00:03:39.510> for<00:03:39.720> this<00:03:39.900> because<00:03:40.290> as<00:03:40.590> you're

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
have a comb for this because as you're

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.009 
have a comb for this because as you're
going<00:03:40.919> you<00:03:41.189> can<00:03:41.340> sort<00:03:41.669> of<00:03:41.790> comb<00:03:42.209> it<00:03:42.419> and<00:03:42.569> that

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
going you can sort of comb it and that

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.780 
going you can sort of comb it and that
gets<00:03:43.260> stray<00:03:43.829> hairs<00:03:44.370> like<00:03:44.579> this<00:03:44.819> neater<00:03:45.180> and

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
gets stray hairs like this neater and

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:54.869 
gets stray hairs like this neater and
then<00:03:47.790> you<00:03:47.939> would<00:03:48.060> just<00:03:48.180> tie<00:03:48.419> it<00:03:48.450> off

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
something like that and it's pretty much

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.400 
something like that and it's pretty much
just<00:04:15.349> the<00:04:15.650> same<00:04:15.859> thing<00:04:16.780> what<00:04:17.780> you<00:04:17.900> would<00:04:18.049> do<00:04:18.199> is

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
just the same thing what you would do is

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.990 
just the same thing what you would do is
you<00:04:18.440> would<00:04:18.560> divide<00:04:18.799> out<00:04:19.190> about<00:04:19.459> half<00:04:19.759> of<00:04:19.880> her

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
you would divide out about half of her

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:29.680 
you would divide out about half of her
hair<00:04:20.239> I<00:04:20.269> usually<00:04:20.840> tie<00:04:21.019> it<00:04:21.079> out<00:04:21.259> of<00:04:21.380> the<00:04:21.470> way<00:04:28.690> and

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
hair I usually tie it out of the way and

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.629 
hair I usually tie it out of the way and
then<00:04:30.080> you<00:04:30.199> do<00:04:30.320> the<00:04:30.440> same<00:04:30.620> thing<00:04:30.889> just<00:04:31.430> like

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
then you do the same thing just like

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.180 
then you do the same thing just like
treat<00:04:32.000> it<00:04:32.090> like<00:04:32.240> you<00:04:32.389> were<00:04:32.509> doing<00:04:32.780> just<00:04:33.740> your

treat it like you were doing just your
regular<00:04:35.229> French<00:04:36.229> braid<00:04:36.320> that<00:04:36.560> I<00:04:36.740> just<00:04:36.979> showed

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
regular French braid that I just showed

since<00:04:40.520> you're<00:04:40.639> doing<00:04:41.259> just<00:04:42.259> half<00:04:42.440> of<00:04:42.590> her<00:04:42.680> hair

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:49.569 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:51.689

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:28.670 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:37.519 

a<00:05:28.730> little<00:05:29.300> bit<00:05:29.450> from<00:05:29.540> the<00:05:29.630> side

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:37.529 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:42.110 

but<00:05:38.159> from<00:05:38.339> outside

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.730 

then<00:05:42.660> you<00:05:42.840> braid<00:05:43.139> it<00:05:43.260> the<00:05:43.380> rest<00:05:43.500> of<00:05:43.620> the<00:05:43.680> way

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
then you braid it the rest of the way

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.000 
then you braid it the rest of the way
down<00:05:44.750> so<00:05:45.750> I<00:05:45.780> just<00:05:45.900> did<00:05:46.050> that<00:05:46.199> really<00:05:46.350> fast<00:05:46.650> but

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
down so I just did that really fast but

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.950 
down so I just did that really fast but
there<00:05:47.729> you<00:05:47.820> go<00:05:47.910> and<00:05:48.300> then<00:05:48.330> you<00:05:48.570> would<00:05:48.810> have<00:05:48.930> a

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
there you go and then you would have a

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.620 
there you go and then you would have a
one<00:05:49.639> pic<00:05:50.639> tail<00:05:50.880> then<00:05:51.090> you<00:05:51.180> repeat<00:05:51.419> on<00:05:51.570> the

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
one pic tail then you repeat on the

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.020 
one pic tail then you repeat on the
other<00:05:51.720> side
