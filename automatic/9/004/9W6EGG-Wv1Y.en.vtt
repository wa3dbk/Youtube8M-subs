00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
and i think this one is possibly the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.039 
and i think this one is possibly the
hardest<00:01:55.710> one<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.340> craft<00:01:56.909> though<00:01:57.210> if<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.869> see

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
hardest one to craft though if you see

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.289 
hardest one to craft though if you see
the<00:01:58.460> requirements<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.939> stuff<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.270> need

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
the requirements the the stuff you need

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.560 
the requirements the the stuff you need
to<00:02:00.509> make<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.409> insane<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:03.030> will<00:02:03.210> take<00:02:03.390> you

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
to make it it is insane it will take you

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.080 
to make it it is insane it will take you
along<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.930> time<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.680> make<00:02:05.250> all<00:02:05.490> this<00:02:05.610> stuff<00:02:05.880> if

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
along the time to make all this stuff if

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.240 
along the time to make all this stuff if
you<00:02:06.299> wanted<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.689> make<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.259> all<00:02:07.350> yourself<00:02:07.439> you

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
you wanted to make it all yourself you

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.460 
you wanted to make it all yourself you
can<00:02:08.550> though<00:02:08.879> in<00:02:09.179> fact<00:02:09.420> just<00:02:09.780> go<00:02:10.020> into<00:02:10.319> the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
can though in fact just go into the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.340 
can though in fact just go into the
sleeping<00:02:10.979> giant<00:02:11.190> in

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
sleeping giant in

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.880 
sleeping giant in
in<00:02:12.500> a<00:02:12.800> river<00:02:13.190> would<00:02:13.400> and<00:02:13.900> every<00:02:14.900> piece<00:02:15.560> of<00:02:15.620> it

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
in a river would and every piece of it

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.730 
in a river would and every piece of it
is<00:02:15.980> in<00:02:16.100> a<00:02:16.160> chest<00:02:16.460> just<00:02:16.700> near<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.060> bar<00:02:17.620> so<00:02:18.620> if

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
is in a chest just near the bar so if

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.130 
is in a chest just near the bar so if
you<00:02:18.830> can<00:02:19.040> bother<00:02:19.310> to<00:02:19.550> go<00:02:19.670> around<00:02:19.880> and<00:02:20.090> pick<00:02:20.990> up

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
you can bother to go around and pick up

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.740 
you can bother to go around and pick up
all<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.770> pieces<00:02:22.220> you<00:02:22.610> need<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:23.210> make<00:02:23.420> it<00:02:23.660> you

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
all the pieces you need to make it you

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.440 
all the pieces you need to make it you
can<00:02:23.900> just<00:02:23.930> do<00:02:24.200> that<00:02:24.320> instead<00:02:24.730> I'd<00:02:25.730> like<00:02:26.090> to<00:02:26.300> try

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
can just do that instead I'd like to try

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.330 
can just do that instead I'd like to try
and<00:02:26.690> craft<00:02:27.200> this<00:02:27.350> myself<00:02:27.740> but<00:02:27.830> it'd<00:02:28.130> probably

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
and craft this myself but it'd probably

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.760 
and craft this myself but it'd probably
take<00:02:28.460> a<00:02:28.730> long<00:02:29.060> ass<00:02:29.120> time<00:02:29.300> so<00:02:30.200> this<00:02:30.470> is<00:02:30.530> the

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
take a long ass time so this is the

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.200 
take a long ass time so this is the
light<00:02:31.010> armor<00:02:31.460> version<00:02:31.820> i<00:02:31.880> think<00:02:32.090> we're

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
light armor version i think we're

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.940
