00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.680

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.860
 titled what youtube to climbs

 hot if like me when you look 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:18.270
 videos on youtube you are a little 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:20.970
 the kind of super session I do not throw 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.470
 to say that I do it then this video 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.240
 was a lot who does all the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.460
 products that youtube had been booked 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.080
 neither and and I told you about it media 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.609
 why I bought them is what 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.109
 so I send you that after you 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.000
 invite to watch the rest of the video 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.130
 very first product had to buy 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.719
 thanks to youtube stops in the 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.129
 Brush category that has very first 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.899
 that I had bought was the brushes 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.280
 sigma which you surely know 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.870
 this brand as we really hear 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.480
 a lot a lot a lot a lot 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.670
 spoken on youtube and so I had them 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.640
 bought I had paid his 80 bucks 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.020
 near the leaves and I am very disappointed with 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.420
 his brushes so the aisles buy 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.570
 by watching amelie mats videos 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.859
 so i love this ue buzz but it's 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.719
 true that his brushes there I wanted 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.430
 strongly discourages they lose their 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.979
 hairs found that they are expensive and that 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.600
 it's a very very low quality 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.950
 then second round of brush 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.049
 I was going to buy and a sherbet 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.360
 techniques without looking at the videos of 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.250
 pixi sisters or and those there I adore them 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.049
 so it's the little colored brushes in 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.729
 have them bought on the high dress site 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.110
 so these insults actually you have 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.430
 full of foreign brands 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.320
 and that's because it's really 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.150
 great in quality 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.830
 practicality are delivered in the 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.560
 small pockets you can easily 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.870
 take them on a journey they are from where they 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.850
 are precious 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.920
 I really love his brushes and finally 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.140
 last perso I bought through 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.630
 youtube it's by watching the videos of 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.620
 betty cali she had actually bought 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.880
 the same on the site and elsewhere 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.800
 she had bought the echo brushes 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.940
 tools that are these little mini brushes 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.410
 big is beautiful - I told myself they 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.890
 are going to be super convenient to bring in 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.080
 trip 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.730
 and in addition they seemed to have a 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.220
 good quality of what she says is 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.990
 so I bought them and I love them there 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.480
 has none that loses its hair they are 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.100
 always they are always such as I 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.780
 I bought them and I like them a lot 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.250
 the same I advise you strongly 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.140
 then we will stay in the makeup 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.430
 I will tell you about two rooms being 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.290
 I was going to buy through youtube 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.690
 so first of all the discoveries the 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.370
 clickquot mark on youtube i 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.370
 discovered about a year ago 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.110
 I was not told nathan carolina 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.910
 who counts does not like the super step 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.530
 why are not you going to do that? 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.120
 in comparison to one a month I had bought 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.530
 those above but I bought several 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.790
 and then even all the varnish then the 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.990
 marquis that in general I have them 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.390
 discovered more particularly in 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.360
 watching 715 make sun videos 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.280
 up who often do halls and often 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.260
 roles that co and I look forward to this 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.940
 mark I tell you very often about them 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.320
 headlights are super pigmented hold 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.209
 well they do not go in folds and that's 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.590
 then another brand that I have 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.840
 discovered on youtube it's the brand 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.459
 slick so no more particularly the 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.410
 palettes made of eyeshadow 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.370
 which I bought this palette 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.570
 is called in sauce fishermen that's it yes 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.950
 she's like that this one wanted 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.590
 actually buy that it's been a long time 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.360
 that it made me an eye but I 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.090
 really cracked when I saw the 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.830
 command cops of cynthia dulude on 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.510
 youtube tears that's also had 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.760
 cracked we cracked together we say 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.880
 how are they used and ordered and 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.370
 expect adore her ends are not of 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.380
 so good quality that kiko that irb 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.860
 said they're sewing them but they 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.800
 are very very pigmented and 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.600
 frankly 10 euros or $ 10 or 10 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.970
 books tools years 10 euros 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.320
 laval frankly it would be wrong to 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.210
 to deprive it so I 'm going to order 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.850
 directly on the test si.com and I 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.200
 I am delighted I discovered also the colors 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.090
 tattoo from maybelline 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.190
 so I also bought from elsewhere 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.320
 the number chanel illusion looking at 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.020
 nathalie videos I had bought the 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.970
 illusionary mergers of darkness and I was 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.070
 frankly disappointed with the 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.600
 color etc and compared to prices 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.010
 that they were very very high and 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.740
 then always watching the videos 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.440
 715 sun make up I discovered that 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.100
 the tattoo glue was doing a very very 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.440
 beautiful job 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.900
 so I let myself try I have 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.350
 bought several there I have 2 g lab and 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:04.050
 tons al gore and there going bronze 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:06.600
 and I love these cohorts to all there I 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.110
 found that for eye shadows 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.760
 cream 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.040
 they are fine and she is going 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.570
 largely channel so maybe that 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.310
 some will not be of this opinion the 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.169
 I think it's the same thing 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.329
 even to finish with makeup 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.450
 I recently bought the volume 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.070
 rocket in Medellin so this one 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.200
 we talked a little tired all about 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.520
 youtube so I will not be telling you who 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.290
 finally if I can tell you actually the 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.330
 times when I said to myself that's big there 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:35.040
 the buy is when you see a picture 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:38.430
 on instagram of 1.2 julie de julie who 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.419
 wore who wore this mascara and so 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.740
 I asked him where is he 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.580
 came she told me this is the rocket of 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.080
 at maybelline 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.729
 he's great is the friends and 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.870
 make up is separated his two daughters who 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.540
 make videos on youtube and they 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.890
 are super nice and so mascara it 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.900
 keep his promises I find him he 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.729
 is great to separate the six 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.140
 of them and give them volume and 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.910
 never had as much volume as ever since 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.340
 that I use this mascara has it so I 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.500
 am really happy and thank you j we're going 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.380
 now go to care so never 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.080
 buy the prodigious oil from nuxe 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.570
 because nathalie praising the merits 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.660
 or summers to him that it smelled 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:15.780
 super good this is super sweet people 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.430
 et cetera so I bought them this is 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.690
 true that it smells super good I love this 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.080
 smell besides his daughter was going to buy 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:24.060
 perfume it was just amazing 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.070
 but on the other hand on the legs I find 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.520
 not that to the effect that they last in 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.470
 time 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.390
 jeans but it smells good it shines 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.130
 attractive but after that not last any 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.470
 the evening of which I am a little bit disappointed 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.970
 of this product but otherwise they go away 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.580
 jeans but also in the hair 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.660
 now and but it's just because 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.240
 that he feels good I do not think he has 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.550
 effects or less pleasant 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.530
 always in the smells I discovered 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.539
 the mark victoria secret's finally I 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.650
 had to know her but not so much I 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:52.020

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.340
 tell me must you buy there and 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.490

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.240
