00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 This is the Samsung Galaxy S4 value 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.230
 edition and now you will think this looks 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.940
 just look like a samsung galaxy s4 and 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.500
 that is in principle also only the 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.490
 veluwe dish and that actually stands for 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.670
 a bit of it 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.710
 modernized version of the s4 he 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.050
 namely has a major software update 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.970
 they had software in this device that is 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.590
 new there from the original s4 he 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.970
 are running with on android 4 point two 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.010
 And he would also come again in the coming 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.630
 Get an Android 5 point update every month 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.070
 zero and for the rest to device 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.570
 look we see that it really just yes 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.309
 same as the s4 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.719
 see a nice backside nicely finished 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.840
 have the black version here 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.950
 we also see the chrome rim on the 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.840
 side yes 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.129
 gives a bit of a premium look 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.899
 he is also nice in the hand he 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.579
 is not too big he is 5 inches but me 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.320
 find him fine in one hand too 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.090
 and so I was sure that the 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.930
 black version but it is also in it 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.579
 available in white 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.410
 so I also have the white version here 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.210
 then you can choose which color you want 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.590
 you prefer that you can go then 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.730
 use 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.289
 well then on to the device itself 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.270
 go look like I said a 5 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.649
 inch screen and super amoled screen 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.090
 that actually means as with 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.559
 you are used to samsung that colors 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.880
 the really splashing out 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.680
 brightness is also very good and the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.479
 black values ​​are very deep 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.340
 so yes for that matter you have real ones 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.619
 big and beautiful to look at 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.720
 so full hd screen that also means that 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.979
 nice all screen is displayed 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.299
 you notice it mainly at what 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.799
 smaller texts like you for example 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.720
 website reading am somewhat smaller 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.820
 text then you can really do without 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.080
 problems still read well though 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.880
 for the rest we find all sorts 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.310
 applications also that samsung 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.240
 Standard flour evert it down 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.119
 you should think of, for example 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.280
 the s application helps your make-up 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.170
 for example, count your steps but also 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.049
 For example, keep track of how much water you have 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.390
 you don't need to drink or eat enough 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.159
 eat too much et cetera so you can already 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.229
 so your calories count there 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.820
 application are in an improved form 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.960
 in again 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.060
 also takes things like 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.380
 for example, s travel 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.909
 some suggestions for certain 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.500
 destinations and then you can go through 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.820
 See tripadvisor immediately 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.860
 destinations that are and where you 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.659
 possibly book a hotel and for 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.320
 the rest you will find many more options you 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.850
 find here for example 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.119
 You will find all kinds of notification screen 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.220
 options such as a multi window 'the k2 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.530
 apps also exist at the same time and 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.480
 for example that he automatically 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.800
 stay awake say it stays on 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.030
 screen when you go to the screen 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.230
 watching are the can 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.640
 all also completely by themselves 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.380
 set the way you want 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.850
 he turns my must be 4 point two and you 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.560
 sees that things are going quite smoothly 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.360
 they have 1.9 gigahertz quadcore processor 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.250
 has thereby against you when it 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.400
 ram memory as support and 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.319
 internal storage that is 16 gigabytes so you 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.040
 can have quite a few videos and photos on it 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.510
 lost 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.860
 become and has wants to expand it is also possible 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.209
 without problems through a 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.830
 micro sd card 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.319
 well find a camera of course 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.760
 at the front and at the back 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.620
 We start with the back to 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.690
 find a 13 megapixel camera with one 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.769
 single LED flash to the flash is fine 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.660
 for example if you go in the evenings 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.830
 want to take portrait photo we don't have to 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.300
 Expect a really big one 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.970
 highlight the object well 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.260
 but that in itself makes sense 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.690
 on the front we find a 2 megapixel 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.300
 camera and let's take a look 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.739
 to the software of this you can find the 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.760
 camera software that has a small one 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.959
 had an update 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.489
 find different modes where you 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.620
 you can scroll through and find you 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.090
 automatic mode but you really still have 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.709
 different modes and from which can 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.760
 choosing can make a photo true sound 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.160
 behind 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.690
 after it can you can hardly be silly 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.400
 remember there is a modes for 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.260
 In addition, we want you to be right 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.760
 can apply filters at the bottom 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.410
 so you ca n't immediately choose one 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.630
 filter if you click on it then it becomes 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.769
 filter also immediately applied a photo 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.360
 which of course makes it very easy for you 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.440
 by simply pressing the photo button 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.940
 you also need much more 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.590
 settings that can change if you get there 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.850
 Once you want to go deep, you can 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.739
 also without problems 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.570
 he really looks like good photos that 13 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.160
 megapixel camera in the dark I think 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.420
 they also pretty good 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.549
 only you will of course see how 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.750
 darken by the more you noise the 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.709
 get into it 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.390
 of course you also have the camera 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.400
 on the front side 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.980
 well that in itself makes great photos that 2 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.690
 Megapixel camera is also more than 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.370
 enough to be able to do something nice yourself 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.049
 of course you can also make and film 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.600
 with that you do the maximum resolution of 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.769
 1080 p or full hd 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.380
 in addition, you will also find the battery 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.870
 in this case in the device a 620 100 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.120
 Million per hour battery is a battery that 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.709
 sufficiently heavy to just use your phone 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.329
 provide power all day long 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.700
 and you can also find it here again in the 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.560
 options at the top and extra power 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.970
 saving mode you can also do wemo yourself 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.410
 but then think the 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.280
 for example, your e-mail less often 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.659
 cetera 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.790
 so you just go with less power 

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:22.920
 consume now you want more yes 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.230
 Information about the Samsung Galaxy S4 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.120
 value edition or maybe again 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.670
 immediately order a go then go to
