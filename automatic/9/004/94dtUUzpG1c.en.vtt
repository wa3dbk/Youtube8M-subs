and then basically got caught up in
things<00:04:08.820> and<00:04:09.180> then<00:04:09.360> I<00:04:09.390> was<00:04:09.630> like<00:04:09.660> wow<00:04:09.990> now<00:04:10.770> I

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
need to upload and then I try to upload

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.630 
need to upload and then I try to upload
in<00:04:12.780> that<00:04:12.870> minecraft<00:04:13.320> video<00:04:13.590> and<00:04:13.890> google

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
in that minecraft video and google

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.250 
in that minecraft video and google
chrome<00:04:14.880> kept<00:04:15.150> on<00:04:15.300> getting<00:04:15.510> it<00:04:15.750> stuck<00:04:15.959> at<00:04:16.140> like

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
chrome kept on getting it stuck at like

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.020 
chrome kept on getting it stuck at like
twenty<00:04:16.560> six<00:04:16.770> percent<00:04:16.830> upload<00:04:17.430> I'm<00:04:17.520> like<00:04:17.670> okay

twenty six percent upload I'm like okay

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.090 
twenty six percent upload I'm like okay
guess<00:04:18.270> I<00:04:18.390> can't<00:04:18.570> do<00:04:18.660> that<00:04:18.840> so<00:04:19.410> that<00:04:19.620> was<00:04:19.770> to

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
guess I can't do that so that was to

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.250 
guess I can't do that so that was to
render<00:04:20.400> or<00:04:20.669> two<00:04:20.970> uploads<00:04:21.419> wasted<00:04:21.930> so<00:04:22.080> then<00:04:22.229> I

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
render or two uploads wasted so then I

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.960 
render or two uploads wasted so then I
went<00:04:22.470> to<00:04:22.620> Firefox<00:04:23.250> and<00:04:23.460> it<00:04:23.550> took<00:04:23.729> like

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
went to Firefox and it took like

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.330 
went to Firefox and it took like
40<00:04:24.300> minutes<00:04:24.660> to<00:04:24.780> upload<00:04:24.960> because<00:04:25.800> it's<00:04:25.980> really

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
40 minutes to upload because it's really

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.310 
40 minutes to upload because it's really
bad<00:04:26.550> weather<00:04:26.850> around<00:04:27.180> here<00:04:27.330> my<00:04:27.690> connection<00:04:28.230> is

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
bad weather around here my connection is

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.440 
bad weather around here my connection is
taken<00:04:28.680> a<00:04:28.740> poop<00:04:28.950> on<00:04:29.160> me<00:04:29.340> and<00:04:29.520> there's<00:04:29.970> like<00:04:30.090> four

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.400 
no reason so I think somebody just got
dds<00:04:34.890> spect<00:04:35.250> out<00:04:35.570> down<00:04:36.570> the<00:04:36.780> street<00:04:37.080> and<00:04:37.230> that's

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
dds spect out down the street and that's

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.260 
dds spect out down the street and that's
that's<00:04:37.710> never<00:04:38.070> good<00:04:38.400> because<00:04:38.730> then<00:04:38.940> what<00:04:39.180> if

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
that's never good because then what if

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.940 
that's never good because then what if
they<00:04:39.360> come<00:04:39.510> from<00:04:39.690> me<00:04:39.840> and<00:04:40.020> they<00:04:40.080> TB<00:04:40.620> me<00:04:40.800> when

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
they come from me and they TB me when

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.500
