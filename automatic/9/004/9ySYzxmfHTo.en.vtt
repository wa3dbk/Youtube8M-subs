00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:16.309
 education 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.510
 I've always sung since I was a little girl 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:22.199
 singing at the age of 8 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.250
 all the work done with passion she had qualified in q1 adele adkins 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:29.199
 gave birth to another 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.560
 a disc called at the time Saturday the lines 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.749

00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:37.280
 - never left 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.370
 so I always have more or less site with local groups 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.640

 with stÃ©phane casalta if during a tour and what gave me what gave me 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.620
 desire 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.640
 yesterday m 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.710
 very strong to launch in a solo adventure 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.630
 so I started with first parts 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.640
 yesterday m cabaret 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.230
 and introduce myself to different castings regardless of the musical 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.740
 christine tellier and one day I participated in a menu 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.530
 to what is called new star show on m6 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.170
 which makes a 20 kg course finish fifth after thirteen weeks of 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.970
 praline 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.550
 and then lightweight packaging and I always went on with the ones that 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.050
 the goal was a day will come out on 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.830
 it's like all those an album that looks like me as it's a 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.670
 long-term work 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.759
 to know that one must find one's anger one needs a place 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.550
 you have to have bits of texts and melodies so it does not happen in one 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.290
 day 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.700
 currently I'm working on this album that will see the day I hope 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.390
 end of 2009 anyway I work for a team that wins 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.780
 very professional people 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.729
 that I was able to meet yesterday here in Corsican who assured with siding 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.540
 the new star experience 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.000
 traveling and g i also and especially reindeer in all this passion for the 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.320
 early Corsican singing 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.540
 through the almost total shock and anthony sentences with which I was able to help 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.389
 to achieve something magical is to say 

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:10.059
 new encounter with m 

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:13.059

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:16.799

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.899
 who was really very close to my child it is surely someone 

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:20.729

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:49.199
