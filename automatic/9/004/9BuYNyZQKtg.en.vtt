00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.970
 another video of me 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.820
 today it is about a very high quality 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.710
 2.0 speaker system that reminds me 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.300
 particularly like the learn her 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.599
 after the intro I wish you much 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.599
 fun 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.980
 this is the system 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.090
 called cube from the house wavemaster 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.010
 the whole is delivered in this 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.170
 send packaging here are 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.050
 in addition to the actual speaker boxes 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.719
 another speaker cable 3.5 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.730
 Millimeter cables open a cinch 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.129
 clinton adapter and of course one 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.960
 detailed manual now chance 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.890
 stereo speakers in detail something 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.410
 more exactly 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.430
 the design is very simple and 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.020
 minimalistic in what we here 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.850
 I really like it too 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.280
 manufacturer relies on one 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.989
 acoustic muffled of the mdf housing 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.059
 a well-founded surface 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.890
 this is kept matt black the 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.109
 processing the cube is here too 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.969
 very high quality worn or worn 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.430
 I could damage during my 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.439
 no period of notice 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.770
 dimensions are here in each case at 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.990
 17 5 centimeters in width 24 5 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.950
 centimeters in height and 20 centimeters 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.659
 in the deep 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.250
 So this can be loud shrill system 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.710
 ideal as a desk or 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.420
 Shelf speakers are used before 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.840
 but you can use the speakers 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.040
 You must do this with the help of the enclosed 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.580
 speakers until interconnected 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.600
 become 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.520
 but that is really a lot of work 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.159
 quickly filling up on the claim 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.140
 for all two regulators here itself 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.820
 on the right, on the one hand, the system 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.250
 turn on and at the same time the 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.409
 volume control via the left-hand control 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.060
 can the audio input select because 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.890
 one has the possibility over three here 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.689
 different inputs swell the loud 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.430
 screamers to connect so you can 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.380
 cube either via bluetooth to 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.159
 Example with the smartphone or tablet 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.040
 connect or over 35mm cable cable 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.509
 or of course via cinch thus 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.939
 should be the right one for every purpose 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.189
 be available for connection the respective 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.869
 audio inputs for this one feels on 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.270
 the back of the right speaker 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.790
 the most important thing with a speaker 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.409
 Of course that sounded that high 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.869
 Sounds are over a 25 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.819
 millimeter sides calotte reproduced 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.720
 the low and midrange features over 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.760
 a cell 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.090
 - when burning at a diameter of 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.550
 13 centimeters the frequency range of this 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.080
 2.0 speaker system with integrated 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.850
 2 channel amplifier is 45 to 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.920
 22,000 heart thus can be thereby 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.730
 even with no problems, small rooms are good 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.110
 beschallen 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.300
 I'm really from the sound 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.370
 excited about the cube this one is 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.140
 extremely clear and not too bass heavy 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.660
 but almost perfect and be natural 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.970
 for the optimum sound can be on 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.220
 the back of the heights and the bass 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.070
 individually adapt the should also in 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.390
 really great and tragic feature 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.610
 Coals to a small sound 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.440
 It is important to note that the 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.270
 Sound quite a microphone due to indices 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.860
 of the video and the commentary from 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.440
 youtube as well as your speaker or 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.209
 headphones deviates from reality 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.209
 nevertheless here now a sound test 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.920
 only me already my conclusion 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.540
 arrived you get with this 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.120
 speaker system really a right one 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.590
 good overall package especially enthusiastic 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.530
 As I said, I am of the very good one 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.090
 sound you get the best sound quality 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.000
 of course, via a wired 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.470
 I find music reproduction very positive 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.569
 also that one between here 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.579
 three input sources can choose 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.709
 the only thing I noticed 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.329
 That's the length of the power cable this one 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.319
 could in my opinion something else 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.200
 be longer 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:15.180
 for a price of 179 euro 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.010
 here at the still a really extreme 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.930
 good price performance ratio 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.160
 i can put this speaker systems on 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.419
 recommend each case 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.150
 for the desk or as 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.960
 shelf speakers find that perfect 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.729
 otherwise that's it again 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.440
 from my video as always if it's you 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:30.300
 has fallen then the video could be happy 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.949
 give a thumbs up or me 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.810
 subscribe below for no further 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.729
 I miss videos 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.020
 again for watching how else then 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:39.020
 again in the next video
