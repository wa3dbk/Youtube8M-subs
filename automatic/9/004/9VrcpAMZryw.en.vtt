evz so kind of happy to get back on the
zvz<00:00:33.750> side<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.110> things<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:37.850> let's<00:00:38.850> see<00:00:38.940> which<00:00:39.059> I

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
zvz side of things so let's see which I

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.459 
zvz side of things so let's see which I
builds<00:00:39.450> both<00:00:39.660> players<00:00:39.930> going<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.140> go<00:00:40.260> for<00:00:40.410> this

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
builds both players going to go for this

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.560 
builds both players going to go for this
game<00:00:41.329> I<00:00:42.980> think<00:00:43.980> they're<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.700> couple<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.420> times

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
game I think they're the couple of times

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.500 
game I think they're the couple of times
I've<00:00:45.750> seen<00:00:45.930> destiny<00:00:46.289> play<00:00:46.469> ZBZ<00:00:47.210> recently<00:00:48.210> he

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
I've seen destiny play ZBZ recently he

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.720 
I've seen destiny play ZBZ recently he
likes<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.350> go<00:00:49.440> for<00:00:49.710> like<00:00:49.800> two<00:00:50.129> banelings<00:00:50.610> with

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
likes to go for like two banelings with

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.689 
likes to go for like two banelings with
roaches<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.420> then<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.870> think<00:00:52.410> expand<00:00:52.890> if<00:00:53.370> he

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
roaches and then I think expand if he

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:54.799 
roaches and then I think expand if he
was<00:00:53.820> just<00:00:53.910> doing<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.149> one<00:00:54.360> day<00:00:54.449> or<00:00:54.570> whatever

out here from machine first player to

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.980 
out here from machine first player to
change<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.250> up<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.460> little<00:01:11.490> bit<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.030> looks<00:01:12.869> like

pool come up here pretty soon from

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.310 
pool come up here pretty soon from
machine<00:01:23.540> see<00:01:24.540> we're<00:01:24.689> both<00:01:24.720> players<00:01:25.110> both

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
machine see we're both players both

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.510 
machine see we're both players both
players<00:01:25.560> are<00:01:25.680> pretty<00:01:25.830> much<00:01:25.920> deciding<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.369> in

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
players are pretty much deciding this in

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.859 
players are pretty much deciding this in
their<00:01:26.610> overloads<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.090> exact<00:01:27.330> same<00:01:27.540> spots

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
their overloads to the exact same spots

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.789 
their overloads to the exact same spots
I<00:01:30.320> don't<00:01:31.320> know<00:01:31.380> where<00:01:31.470> they're<00:01:31.560> going<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.740> go

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
I don't know where they're going to go

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:32.929 
I don't know where they're going to go
this<00:01:31.950> maybe<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.369> front<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.610> each<00:01:32.700> other's

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
this maybe to the front of each other's

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.249 
this maybe to the front of each other's
base<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.299> would<00:01:33.390> assume<00:01:33.570> after<00:01:33.780> they<00:01:33.990> scouted

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
base I would assume after they scouted

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.190 
base I would assume after they scouted
each<00:01:34.380> other<00:01:34.560> out<00:01:35.869> destiny<00:01:36.869> going<00:01:37.079> with<00:01:37.170> a

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
each other out destiny going with a

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.100 
each other out destiny going with a
little<00:01:37.590> bit<00:01:37.829> sooner<00:01:38.130> spawning<00:01:38.939> pool<00:01:39.210> going

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
little bit sooner spawning pool going

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.380 
little bit sooner spawning pool going
for<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.380> sort<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.979> Sim<00:01:41.159> City<00:01:41.340> here<00:01:41.549> as<00:01:41.700> they're

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
for a sort of a Sim City here as they're

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.550 
for a sort of a Sim City here as they're
gonna<00:01:42.540> have<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.869> many<00:01:43.079> buildings<00:01:43.380> to

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
gonna have that many buildings to

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.770 
gonna have that many buildings to
simcity<00:01:43.799> with<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.460> they<00:01:44.820> do<00:01:45.270> with<00:01:45.420> what<00:01:45.659> they

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
simcity with so they do with what they

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.940 
simcity with so they do with what they
can<00:01:47.570> so<00:01:48.570> gas<00:01:48.810> going<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.110> go<00:01:49.170> first<00:01:49.500> for

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
can so gas going to go first for

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.230 
can so gas going to go first for
machine's<00:01:50.490> going<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.759> start<00:01:50.909> getting<00:01:51.149> that

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
machine's going to start getting that

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.300 
machine's going to start getting that
gas<00:01:51.619> excuse<00:01:52.619> me<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.829> going<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.009> have<00:01:53.100> three

gas excuse me is going to have three
drones<00:01:53.520> inside<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.659> extractor<00:01:55.200> we'll

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
drones inside that extractor we'll

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.690 
drones inside that extractor we'll
probably<00:01:55.470> see<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.680> speedling<00:01:56.250> opening<00:01:56.579> from

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
probably see a speedling opening from

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.330 
probably see a speedling opening from
him<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.229> gas<00:01:58.229> up<00:01:58.409> here<00:01:58.619> for<00:01:58.799> destiny<00:01:59.130> as<00:01:59.219> well

be<00:02:37.390> able<00:02:37.450> to<00:02:37.570> deal<00:02:37.720> some<00:02:37.960> damage<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:38.500> he's

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
be able to deal some damage and he's

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.020 
be able to deal some damage and he's
also<00:02:38.800> sending<00:02:39.100> a<00:02:39.190> drone<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:39.460> he's<00:02:39.610> probably

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
also sending a drone I he's probably

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.370 
also sending a drone I he's probably
going<00:02:40.210> to<00:02:40.270> expand<00:02:40.660> this<00:02:40.990> is<00:02:41.080> going<00:02:41.230> to<00:02:41.290> apply

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
going to expand this is going to apply

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.870 
going to expand this is going to apply
some<00:02:41.590> pressure<00:02:41.680> with<00:02:41.950> these<00:02:42.070> zerglings<00:02:42.460> try

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
some pressure with these zerglings try

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.580 
some pressure with these zerglings try
and<00:02:42.970> do<00:02:43.030> a<00:02:43.060> little<00:02:43.270> bit<00:02:43.420> of<00:02:43.480> damage<00:02:43.660> while<00:02:44.290> he's

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
and do a little bit of damage while he's

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.950 
and do a little bit of damage while he's
going<00:02:44.680> to<00:02:44.830> throw<00:02:44.890> up<00:02:44.950> an<00:02:45.070> expansion<00:02:45.520> and<00:02:45.960> maybe

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
going to throw up an expansion and maybe

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.150 
going to throw up an expansion and maybe
just<00:02:47.110> buy<00:02:47.320> him<00:02:47.440> a<00:02:47.500> little<00:02:47.680> bit<00:02:47.740> of<00:02:47.860> advantage

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
just buy him a little bit of advantage

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.250 
just buy him a little bit of advantage
if<00:02:48.370> he<00:02:48.430> was<00:02:48.550> here<00:02:48.840> destiny<00:02:49.840> throwing<00:02:50.170> I

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
if he was here destiny throwing I

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.170 
if he was here destiny throwing I
actually<00:02:50.440> there's<00:02:51.400> that<00:02:51.580> bailing<00:02:51.880> now<00:02:52.030> so

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
actually there's that bailing now so

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.430 
actually there's that bailing now so
yeah<00:02:52.300> he<00:02:52.450> is<00:02:52.540> doing<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.810> same<00:02:52.960> build<00:02:53.200> I<00:02:53.290> saw

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
yeah he is doing the same build I saw

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.710 
yeah he is doing the same build I saw
him<00:02:53.530> do<00:02:53.650> in<00:02:53.860> his<00:02:54.010> stream<00:02:54.430> just<00:02:55.090> likes<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:55.540> get<00:02:55.660> a

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.469 
least you know deal some damage with
these<00:04:43.590> roaches<00:04:43.940> maybe<00:04:44.940> just<00:04:45.090> kill<00:04:45.330> these

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
these roaches maybe just kill these

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:46.430 
these roaches maybe just kill these
workers<00:04:45.660> and<00:04:45.870> then<00:04:45.960> one<00:04:46.110> straight<00:04:46.290> to<00:04:46.350> the

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
job here he's gonna go straight into the

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.670 
job here he's gonna go straight into the
base<00:04:51.060> and<00:04:51.330> he<00:04:51.840> does<00:04:51.990> have<00:04:52.050> that<00:04:52.169> spine<00:04:52.410> crawler

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680
