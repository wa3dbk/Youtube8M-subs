city question for city building a really

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.580 
city question for city building a really
cool<00:00:54.329> function<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.989> game<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.289> they<00:00:55.379> kind

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
cool function of the game that they kind

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.810 
cool function of the game that they kind
of<00:00:55.649> added<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.129> make<00:00:56.280> things<00:00:56.460> go<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.670> little

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
of added to make things go a little

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.529 
of added to make things go a little
smoother<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.600> way<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.890> set<00:00:59.030> roads<00:01:00.030> and

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
smoother is the way you set roads and

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.070 
smoother is the way you set roads and
set<00:01:00.960> zones<00:01:01.500> are<00:01:01.949> all<00:01:02.219> kind<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.760> links<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:03.870> if

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
set zones are all kind of links so if

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.080 
set zones are all kind of links so if
you<00:01:04.199> make<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.409> road<00:01:04.769> it'll<00:01:05.040> make<00:01:05.369> it'll<00:01:05.850> show

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
you make a road it'll make it'll show

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.390 
you make a road it'll make it'll show
you<00:01:06.150> how<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.479> make<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.689> grid<00:01:07.080> with<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.979> road<00:01:08.159> so

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
you how to make a grid with the road so

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.500 
you how to make a grid with the road so
you<00:01:08.430> can<00:01:08.580> keep<00:01:08.700> things<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.000> little<00:01:09.090> bit<00:01:09.210> more

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
you can keep things a little bit more

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.760 
you can keep things a little bit more
organized<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.140> couldn't<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.439> old<00:01:10.619> ones

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
organized and you couldn't the old ones

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.929 
organized and you couldn't the old ones
we<00:01:10.890> kind<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.159> just<00:01:11.280> had<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.490> do<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.670> off<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.820> top

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
we kind of just had to do it off the top

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.030 
we kind of just had to do it off the top
of<00:01:11.970> your<00:01:12.090> head<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:13.170> once<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.500> start<00:01:13.890> building

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
of your head so once you start building

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.550 
of your head so once you start building
a<00:01:14.280> road<00:01:14.520> it'll<00:01:14.820> show<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.630> grid<00:01:16.170> whether<00:01:16.350> it

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
a road it'll show you a grid whether it

a road it'll show you a grid whether it
be<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:17.009> know<00:01:17.130> 10<00:01:17.610> spaces<00:01:17.909> wide<00:01:18.240> or<00:01:18.570> five<00:01:18.750> faces

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
why whatever it kind of kind of hub gets

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.330 
why whatever it kind of kind of hub gets
adjusted<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.500> what<00:01:22.650> you're<00:01:22.799> doing<00:01:22.830> at<00:01:23.220> the

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.010 
go from there and you plot your
residentials<00:01:27.270> now<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.420> can't<00:01:27.689> just<00:01:27.840> pop<00:01:27.990> your

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
residentials now you can't just pop your

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.690 
residentials now you can't just pop your
residentials<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.799> your<00:01:28.890> industrials<00:01:29.400> and

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
residentials and your industrials and

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.609 
residentials and your industrials and
commercials<00:01:30.240> anywhere<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.720> want<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.290> has<00:01:31.470> to

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
commercials anywhere you want it has to

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.980 
commercials anywhere you want it has to
be<00:01:31.680> snapped<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.220> road<00:01:32.520> which<00:01:33.180> means<00:01:33.450> it's<00:01:33.810> a

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
be snapped to a road which means it's a

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.660 
be snapped to a road which means it's a
little<00:01:34.380> less<00:01:34.500> freedom<00:01:34.740> like<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.549> going

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
little less freedom like this is going

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.149 
little less freedom like this is going
to<00:01:35.729> be<00:01:35.820> an<00:01:35.909> ongoing<00:01:36.060> theme<00:01:36.570> but<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.710> does<00:01:38.009> make

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
to be an ongoing theme but it does make

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.679 
to be an ongoing theme but it does make
things<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.490> little<00:01:38.640> more<00:01:38.820> organized<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.479> makes

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
things a little more organized and makes

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.210 
things a little more organized and makes
easier<00:01:40.049> for<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.259> average<00:01:40.409> user<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.860> get<00:01:41.009> into

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
easier for the average user to get into

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.340 
easier for the average user to get into
which<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.579> really<00:01:41.880> enjoyed<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.450> like<00:01:42.780> both<00:01:43.079> the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
which I really enjoyed I like both the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.410 
which I really enjoyed I like both the
complicated<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.280> SimCity<00:01:44.640> but<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:45.090> sim<00:01:45.270> city

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
complicated of SimCity but this sim city

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.730 
complicated of SimCity but this sim city
is<00:01:45.540> really<00:01:45.840> appealing<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.259> just<00:01:46.439> jump<00:01:46.649> right

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
is really appealing to just jump right

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.149 
is really appealing to just jump right
in<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.070> go<00:01:47.280> which<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.060> definitely<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> big<00:01:48.659> plus

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
in and go which is definitely a big plus

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.069 
in and go which is definitely a big plus
now<00:01:50.159> starting<00:01:50.640> off<00:01:50.790> in<00:01:50.820> your<00:01:51.060> city<00:01:51.329> it's<00:01:51.659> just

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
now starting off in your city it's just

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.420 
now starting off in your city it's just
like<00:01:52.200> any<00:01:52.350> other<00:01:52.439> sim<00:01:52.740> city<00:01:52.920> where<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.159> gotta

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
like any other sim city where you gotta

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.660

and<00:02:43.230> water<00:02:43.430> sewage<00:02:44.430> also<00:02:44.819> comes<00:02:45.030> into<00:02:45.209> play

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
and water sewage also comes into play

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.110 
and water sewage also comes into play
and<00:02:45.660> you'll<00:02:46.080> need<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.319> manage<00:02:46.470> that<00:02:46.590> as<00:02:46.890> well

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120

and you'll need to manage that as well
but<00:02:48.120> not<00:02:48.360> to<00:02:48.569> worry<00:02:48.600> as<00:02:49.019> those<00:02:49.380> initially

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
but not to worry as those initially

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.280 
but not to worry as those initially
don't<00:02:50.670> matter<00:02:50.940> too<00:02:51.360> much<00:02:51.390> what<00:02:51.989> you<00:02:52.080> got<00:02:52.200> to
