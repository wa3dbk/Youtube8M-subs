these<00:00:41.440> symptoms<00:00:41.739> occurring<00:00:43.410> Cushing's<00:00:44.410> is

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
these symptoms occurring Cushing's is

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.919 
these symptoms occurring Cushing's is
directly<00:00:44.980> caused<00:00:45.309> by<00:00:45.579> an<00:00:46.090> increased

00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:46.929 
directly caused by an increased

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:49.770 
directly caused by an increased
production<00:00:47.829> of<00:00:48.160> cortisol<00:00:48.820> from<00:00:49.059> the<00:00:49.629> adrenal

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
production of cortisol from the adrenal

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.459 
production of cortisol from the adrenal
gland

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
gland

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:52.590 
gland
now<00:00:51.339> the<00:00:51.399> adrenal<00:00:51.760> glands<00:00:52.030> are<00:00:52.149> located<00:00:52.570> right

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
now the adrenal glands are located right

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.169 
now the adrenal glands are located right
near<00:00:52.839> the<00:00:52.989> kidneys<00:00:53.350> and<00:00:54.190> sometimes<00:00:54.999> you'll

00:00:55.169 --> 00:00:55.179 
near the kidneys and sometimes you'll

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:57.750 
near the kidneys and sometimes you'll
get<00:00:55.329> a<00:00:55.390> benign<00:00:55.870> growth<00:00:56.140> on<00:00:56.890> the<00:00:57.129> adrenal<00:00:57.550> gland

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
get a benign growth on the adrenal gland

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.889 
get a benign growth on the adrenal gland
that<00:00:58.420> will<00:00:58.570> produce<00:00:58.780> a<00:00:59.230> lot<00:01:00.010> of<00:01:00.039> cortisol<00:01:00.609> and

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
that will produce a lot of cortisol and

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.040 
that will produce a lot of cortisol and
cortisol<00:01:01.899> has<00:01:02.589> these<00:01:02.980> effects<00:01:03.429> on<00:01:03.760> the<00:01:04.629> on<00:01:04.809> the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
cortisol has these effects on the on the

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.880 
cortisol has these effects on the on the
body<00:01:05.260> and<00:01:05.470> cause<00:01:05.860> these<00:01:06.100> symptoms<00:01:07.890> cortisol

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
body and cause these symptoms cortisol

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.700 
body and cause these symptoms cortisol
can<00:01:09.100> also<00:01:09.460> cause<00:01:10.210> issues<00:01:10.780> with<00:01:10.990> the<00:01:11.380> liver

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
can also cause issues with the liver

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.560 
can also cause issues with the liver
I<00:01:11.860> think<00:01:12.160> cortisol<00:01:12.670> is<00:01:12.820> a<00:01:12.850> steroid<00:01:13.210> it's<00:01:13.450> a

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
I think cortisol is a steroid it's a

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.000 
I think cortisol is a steroid it's a
natural<00:01:13.960> steroid<00:01:14.290> and<00:01:14.380> we<00:01:14.530> need<00:01:14.680> it

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
natural steroid and we need it

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.330 
natural steroid and we need it
but<00:01:15.640> in<00:01:15.820> excess<00:01:16.330> it<00:01:16.570> can<00:01:16.600> cause<00:01:16.930> some

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
but in excess it can cause some

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.220 
but in excess it can cause some
potential<00:01:18.340> liver<00:01:18.520> damage<00:01:18.730> and<00:01:19.230> sometimes

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.230 
potential liver damage and sometimes

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.140 
potential liver damage and sometimes
your<00:01:20.950> veterinarian<00:01:21.490> may<00:01:21.640> pick<00:01:21.850> up<00:01:22.000> the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
your veterinarian may pick up the

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.840 
your veterinarian may pick up the
Cushing's<00:01:22.740> diagnosis<00:01:23.740> based<00:01:24.160> on<00:01:24.460> some

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
Cushing's diagnosis based on some

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.370 
Cushing's diagnosis based on some
routine<00:01:25.210> blood<00:01:25.420> work<00:01:25.510> let's<00:01:25.900> be<00:01:26.050> done<00:01:26.200> on<00:01:26.350> your

dog now another way you can get

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.920 
dog now another way you can get
increased<00:01:30.130> cortisol<00:01:30.460> besides<00:01:31.120> an<00:01:31.450> adrenal

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
increased cortisol besides an adrenal

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.550 
increased cortisol besides an adrenal
gland<00:01:32.170> growth<00:01:32.650> is<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:34.270> growth<00:01:34.540> on<00:01:34.870> the

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
gland growth is a growth on the

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.320 
gland growth is a growth on the
pituitary<00:01:35.890> gland<00:01:36.130> the<00:01:36.430> pituitary<00:01:36.700> gland<00:01:36.910> is

pituitary gland the pituitary gland is

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.380 
pituitary gland the pituitary gland is
at<00:01:37.780> the<00:01:37.870> base<00:01:38.020> of<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.290> brain<00:01:38.500> and<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.880> produces

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
at the base of the brain and it produces

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.180 
at the base of the brain and it produces
a<00:01:40.420> hormone<00:01:40.690> called<00:01:40.900> ACTH<00:01:42.330> ACTH<00:01:43.330> acts<00:01:44.290> on<00:01:45.040> the

a hormone called ACTH ACTH acts on the
adrenal<00:01:45.280> gland<00:01:45.700> to<00:01:46.480> produce<00:01:46.660> cortisol<00:01:47.640> so

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
adrenal gland to produce cortisol so

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.120 
adrenal gland to produce cortisol so
it's<00:01:48.790> either<00:01:48.940> a<00:01:49.230> pituitary<00:01:50.230> gland<00:01:50.500> growth<00:01:50.770> or

it's either a pituitary gland growth or

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.370 
it's either a pituitary gland growth or
an<00:01:51.610> adrenal<00:01:52.150> gland<00:01:52.510> growth<00:01:52.930> that's<00:01:53.170> causing

both these samples were checking for
cortisol<00:02:26.450> if<00:02:27.020> we<00:02:27.740> get<00:02:27.920> a<00:02:27.950> huge<00:02:28.910> rise<00:02:29.420> in<00:02:29.450> the

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
cortisol if we get a huge rise in the

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.190 
cortisol if we get a huge rise in the
cortisol<00:02:30.140> level<00:02:30.500> in<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:31.100> second<00:02:31.460> sample<00:02:32.200> then

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
cortisol level in the second sample then

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.870 
cortisol level in the second sample then
that<00:02:33.410> gives<00:02:33.620> us<00:02:33.770> a<00:02:33.860> diagnosis<00:02:34.400> of<00:02:34.520> Cushing's

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
that gives us a diagnosis of Cushing's

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.230 
that gives us a diagnosis of Cushing's
disease<00:02:34.940> now<00:02:35.930> there<00:02:36.140> are<00:02:36.290> some<00:02:36.800> other<00:02:37.240> tests

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
disease now there are some other tests

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.570 
disease now there are some other tests
that<00:02:38.330> we<00:02:38.450> can<00:02:38.480> use<00:02:38.750> a<00:02:38.780> one<00:02:39.710> called<00:02:39.980> a<00:02:40.100> low<00:02:40.370> dose

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
that we can use a one called a low dose

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.640 
that we can use a one called a low dose
dexamethasone<00:02:40.820> test<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:42.080> one<00:02:42.230> called<00:02:42.500> the

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
dexamethasone test and one called the

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.700 
dexamethasone test and one called the
high<00:02:42.800> dose<00:02:43.100> dexamethasone<00:02:43.790> tests<00:02:44.710> sometimes

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
high dose dexamethasone tests sometimes

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.260 
high dose dexamethasone tests sometimes
these<00:02:45.860> are<00:02:46.040> used<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.310> diagnose<00:02:46.700> Cushing's<00:02:47.120> and

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
these are used to diagnose Cushing's and

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.580 
these are used to diagnose Cushing's and
sometimes<00:02:47.930> these<00:02:48.110> are<00:02:48.170> used<00:02:48.470> to

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
sometimes these are used to

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.040 
sometimes these are used to
differentiate<00:02:49.010> between<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:50.510> adrenal<00:02:50.870> gland

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
differentiate between the adrenal gland

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.780 
differentiate between the adrenal gland
growth<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:52.730> pituitary<00:02:52.970> growth<00:02:54.670> now<00:02:55.670> how

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
growth and the pituitary growth now how

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.300 
growth and the pituitary growth now how
do<00:02:55.850> we<00:02:56.030> treat<00:02:56.330> Cushing's<00:02:56.950> generally<00:02:57.950> we<00:02:58.070> treat

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
do we treat Cushing's generally we treat

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.430 
do we treat Cushing's generally we treat
Cushing's<00:02:58.730> by<00:02:58.970> giving<00:02:59.360> medications<00:02:59.990> that<00:03:00.200> can

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
Cushing's by giving medications that can

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.590 
Cushing's by giving medications that can
decrease<00:03:00.740> the<00:03:01.700> activity<00:03:02.180> on<00:03:02.300> the<00:03:02.330> adrenal

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
decrease the activity on the adrenal

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.720 
decrease the activity on the adrenal
gland<00:03:02.960> they<00:03:03.770> have<00:03:03.920> some<00:03:04.130> medications<00:03:04.640> out

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
gland they have some medications out

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.190 
gland they have some medications out
there<00:03:04.790> that<00:03:05.060> can<00:03:05.210> decrease<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.780> action<00:03:06.080> on

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
there that can decrease the action on

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.990 
there that can decrease the action on
the<00:03:06.230> pituitary<00:03:06.530> gland<00:03:06.740> as<00:03:07.040> well<00:03:07.220> but

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
the pituitary gland as well but

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.640 
the pituitary gland as well but
generally<00:03:08.660> that's<00:03:08.750> how<00:03:08.990> we<00:03:09.050> treat<00:03:09.380> it<00:03:09.500> and

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
generally that's how we treat it and

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.280 
generally that's how we treat it and
then<00:03:10.040> we<00:03:10.160> monitor<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:11.060> progress<00:03:11.570> with<00:03:12.020> these

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
then we monitor the progress with these

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.340 
then we monitor the progress with these
diagnostic<00:03:13.220> tests<00:03:13.460> that<00:03:13.550> we<00:03:13.670> did<00:03:13.790> before<00:03:14.350> the

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
diagnostic tests that we did before the

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.580 
diagnostic tests that we did before the
ACTH<00:03:15.620> test<00:03:16.220> for<00:03:16.400> example<00:03:16.820> to<00:03:17.330> see<00:03:17.540> if<00:03:17.780> the

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
ACTH test for example to see if the

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.110 
ACTH test for example to see if the
cortisol<00:03:19.250> levels<00:03:19.610> have<00:03:19.730> been<00:03:19.850> brought<00:03:20.090> down

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
cortisol levels have been brought down

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.010 
cortisol levels have been brought down
to<00:03:20.330> normal<00:03:20.870> and<00:03:21.110> you<00:03:21.860> should<00:03:22.100> see<00:03:22.370> the

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
to normal and you should see the

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.180 
to normal and you should see the
symptoms<00:03:24.020> resolved<00:03:24.410> as<00:03:24.560> well<00:03:24.710> and<00:03:24.890> that's<00:03:25.010> a

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
symptoms resolved as well and that's a

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.730 
symptoms resolved as well and that's a
way<00:03:25.700> at<00:03:25.880> home<00:03:26.090> you<00:03:26.300> can<00:03:26.620> understand<00:03:27.620> there

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
way at home you can understand there

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.890 
way at home you can understand there
whether<00:03:27.980> or<00:03:28.130> not<00:03:28.250> your<00:03:28.460> pet<00:03:28.730> has<00:03:28.940> resolved<00:03:29.750> its

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
whether or not your pet has resolved its
