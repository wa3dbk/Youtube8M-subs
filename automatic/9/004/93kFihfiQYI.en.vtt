00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
so I don't know I'll just have to wait

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.559 
so I don't know I'll just have to wait
and<00:02:17.569> see<00:02:18.219> see<00:02:19.219> what<00:02:19.400> that<00:02:19.579> does<00:02:19.790> if<00:02:20.120> that<00:02:20.299> fixes

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569
