00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
are usually very accurate but in my

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.009 
are usually very accurate but in my
experience<00:02:22.620> they<00:02:22.830> tend<00:02:23.099> to<00:02:23.220> run<00:02:23.430> slow<00:02:24.019> however

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019

this<00:02:25.230> one<00:02:25.500> tends<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.069> run<00:02:26.310> on<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:26.640> fast<00:02:26.940> side

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
this one tends to run on the fast side

my<00:02:28.800> man<00:02:29.129> by<00:02:29.310> fast<00:02:29.640> I<00:02:29.910> mean<00:02:30.120> it<00:02:30.269> only<00:02:30.390> gains

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810

my man by fast I mean it only gains
about<00:02:31.170> maybe<00:02:31.550> I'm<00:02:32.550> thinking<00:02:32.819> maybe<00:02:33.180> three<00:02:33.540> or

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
about maybe I'm thinking maybe three or

about maybe I'm thinking maybe three or
four<00:02:33.690> seconds<00:02:34.349> a<00:02:34.410> month<00:02:34.700> so<00:02:35.700> it's<00:02:36.569> very

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
four seconds a month so it's very

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.110 
four seconds a month so it's very
accurate<00:02:37.200> plus<00:02:37.709> it<00:02:37.920> runs<00:02:38.130> faster<00:02:38.790> rather<00:02:38.910> than

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
slow and for me a watch that runs slow

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.420 
slow and for me a watch that runs slow
is<00:02:42.030> pretty<00:02:42.299> much<00:02:42.480> useless<00:02:42.930> so<00:02:43.410> I<00:02:43.739> really<00:02:44.250> like

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430
