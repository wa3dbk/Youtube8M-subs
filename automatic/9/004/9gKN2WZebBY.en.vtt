00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 very good youtube I am here but another 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.540
 video of minecraft showing them how 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.769
 installing timing is a mode where 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.530
 we can make large buildings in 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.780
 little time and in a way not 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.520
 conventional in the good main craft 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.109
 we are going to need the force the links 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.689
 are in the description the forum is 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.119
 install by double clicking we are going to 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.220
 install accept and ready we have to 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.380
 take the mold that we unload that 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.140
 call tiny to the mods folder of 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.570
 minecraft if you do not have it create it and 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.310
 they put the mode 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.530
 opening the minecraft remember that 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.579
 they have to make a new profile 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:43.640
 selecting the force and giving it play 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.920
 I'm going to show you how to create 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.000
 our machine and here we have the 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.710
 necessary systems 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.710
 let's grab one thing 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.890
 and ready we're going to need a 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.890
 chest 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.660
 and I make a block to put them to this 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.660
 we put the chest as a base 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:16.050
 the machine is on the chest 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:18.780
 and these legs in each of the exits 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.440
 of this huge machine thing like the 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.260
 they call 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.120
 two of these 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.830
 and one 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.190
 and there we have our machine ready 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.380
 this is all that the machine and then 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.600
 in the description or can search in 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.840
 google how is each of these manufactured 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.840
 parts 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.469
 the machine works with coal but it is 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.579
 this item if you're creative for 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:47.579
 have infinite resources 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:55.180
 and that inside the chest we put our 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.670
 ita and we look at how to build what is 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.280
 fast and just like that they discover it 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.150
 you since it is difficult medium 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.700
 excuse me that I have a cold and we 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:07.780
 putting a shit but good with this 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.570
 we enlarge the body a bit 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.480
 construction and with this we enlarge the 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.730
 wide with this we climb from the three 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.150
 levels and levels are the floors that 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.250
 will be building the house or here 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.610
 we can put a ten-story house 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.820
 how can be a house of only the base 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.950
 a floor and if for example we put the house 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.980
 of ten floors with this one we move between 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.870
 the floors thousand one up to the day 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.220
 these are to copy the floor below 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.989
 from above if I'm not wrong like this and with 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.370
 this we build with this we copy the 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.890
 blocks to the left of the right 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.050
 top down and well let's start 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.450
 see if something comes out 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:53.890
 I will use a house a mini cabin 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.620
 we must build 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.030
 and there we have our first floor in 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.870
 actually this would be the base so what 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.390
 I will complete 100% I showed it 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.220
 villeta now what do we go to the floor 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.990
 above 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.060
 there is being built as we can 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:13.260
 see on the right 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.890
 perfect we're going to be the same all day 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.890
 let's go to the riva 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.130
 and we continue to build 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.709
 we create another floor we go up and in this 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.709
 we close 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.960
 let's be able to see - construction nothing 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:42.760
 still and talk about start the sierra then 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.400
 as you can see here we were made 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.709
 the little house that we made in two 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.420
 seconds in here and you can 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.599
 may be that we have too much to be 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.379
 it can be faster manually but not 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.379
 you can do this 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:03.549
 but this is something that can not be done 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.549
 for example on the left 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.209
 or the open 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.569
 we have 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:17.780
 64 houses equal to this towards the 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.389
 left of the map 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.780
 fuck 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:24.960
 just as this can be done towards 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.960
 right 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.669
 heat 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.260
 all right 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.170
 Well I hope you liked the 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:44.210
