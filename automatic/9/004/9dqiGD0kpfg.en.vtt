00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:08.069
 hello here it is said 50 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:11.370
 and i want to with this video 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:15.000
 continue this series with lace 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.970
 lines carbines and knots and there have 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.310
 I once two of his lying here since 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:27.359
 let's start as against a 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:29.939
 i'm talking about dynamic over here 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:34.649
 dynamic kernmantel line the two 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.500
 use wheels or be off I know there 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.450
 opinions differ 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:45.690
 some say absolutely state 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:48.329
 others I am the supporter of me 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.850
 climb ropes and me only from 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:55.079
 dynamic times 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:57.920
 we have now had half the 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:04.520
 distinguish half-time and easy 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.520
 that must be identified here 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:13.579
 is a black circle with a half what 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.590
 is a half-sentence this rope may only in the 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:19.049
 Double strand are used 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.240
 it does not help if the serbia 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:26.549
 Hook in carbine 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:31.579
 I have to be doubly live half 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:35.990
 use ropes only in double strand like that 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:39.929
 now what about the construction of the ropes 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.360
 Being a dynamic core coat is our name 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:47.039
 Have a coat what we have here 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:52.610
 see the yellow blue oranges and inside 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:58.140
 a woven baskets 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:02:00.179
 plastic fibers this lack is here 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.890
 only there to the core before 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:02.659
 contamination and damage 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.049
 protect 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:12.690
 So he brings nothing gets nothing 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:15.660
 but only the core carries dynamic 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.060
 hurry so the abseil and the 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.200
 scroll if something happens that one 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.750
 This rope takes through its 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.040
 dynamics a great deal of the fall 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.870
 energy on before this on the body 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.700
 meets 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.549
 if that were not the case, the fall would 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:39.019
 100% energy on the whole 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:42.290
 body work and what would be severe 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:47.040
 injuries result 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:52.730
 as I said a half-time only in the 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.730
 use double strand and 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:03.510
 it should be dynamic now I have 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:06.200
 this being here blue if we times 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:10.050
 this is an easy one to watch 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:14.730
 marked here in front by this 1 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:16.620
 innkreis this rope is easy 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.600
 Steps in the easy beach used 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:24.930
 will also be a kernmantel rope 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:27.890
 Almond dynamics protects the kernel 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.890
 soiling and damage 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.860
 we only use that we have to 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:40.140
 be sure to notice only dynamic column 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:44.450
 the only ones static 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:47.880
 use there are cavers 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:51.570
 Cavers with a lot of 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:55.260
 Steighilfen work and there are 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:57.720
 statically its advantage because you are there 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:02.820
 not by the weight of this strain 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:05.400
 pull out and state sailer is 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:11.780
 used to hurt people in apples 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:18.080
 to rescue bodies through the rescue of the heights 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:18.080
 yes, what else is there to say 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:26.780
 We take care that the rope always 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:32.699
 is clean 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:35.490
 You can do that with a light soap 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:39.360
 Solution but do not clean in the sun 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:44.550
 dry and not on the stove that dries 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:49.379
 confirms the rope that are standard size 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:53.009
 They have 50 meters and they are there 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:05:00.330
 also as meterware that is the same 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:05:02.460
 Quality like some line whether easy 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:07.460
 his or double ropes or semi 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:12.770
 what you need to call a certain 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:17.900
 Number of edges fall survive 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:21.810
 The rope is laid over a ridge 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:26.400
 and fall with a standardized weight 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:28.759
 produces and five rush must each 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.889
 at least endure rope 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:36.750
 then there are those who hold even more 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:40.680
 out of those are then multi overthrow of his and 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:44.729
 we realize we have a fall into the 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:46.740
 rope is then made over a ridge 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:49.440
 this rope will not change 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.900
 more you have kattas and cut 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.520
 can make a small stretch out of it the man 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:06:00.139
 continuing to use things would be useful 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:03.270
 but can not for climbing so 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:05.729
 at least five falls with one 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:08.460
 Standardized weight edges cities need 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:11.599
 both of these occurred holding double-stranded 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.599
 this a few rays 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:18.830
 Now to the mood I have am 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.780
 at the beginning said that they are dynamic 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.990
 that have the pure conscience when you are 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.730
 inside puts the strain on the ropes 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.460
 whether that's the half-wayroom or that 

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:36.770
 being awake is between 5 and 7 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:39.200
 percent would like that blood is not 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:42.620
 expansion I'll repeat myself 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.580
 there would be the entire crash energy 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.610
 to affect the body 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:48.890
 and that can be deadly 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.270
 that gives regulations bruises and 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:53.330
 such things 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:56.540
 very important always dynamic line 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:07:01.640
 so we use what I have to 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:05.450
 We'll talk next time 

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:08.210
 talking about knots and rappelling 

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:09.530
 I thank you for seeing if I have 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.880
 I'm not that bored 

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.880
 Until next time
