with<00:03:09.760> that<00:03:09.910> and<00:03:10.180> I<00:03:10.270> like<00:03:10.480> that<00:03:10.690> but<00:03:12.270> honestly<00:03:13.270> I

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
with that and I like that but honestly I

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.650 
with that and I like that but honestly I
felt<00:03:13.720> that<00:03:13.840> making<00:03:14.320> it<00:03:14.470> free<00:03:14.860> isn't<00:03:15.730> possibly

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
felt that making it free isn't possibly

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.690 
felt that making it free isn't possibly
the<00:03:16.780> best<00:03:16.930> option<00:03:17.440> but<00:03:17.830> it's<00:03:18.160> definitely<00:03:18.459> a

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
the best option but it's definitely a

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.670 
the best option but it's definitely a
bunch<00:03:19.239> of<00:03:19.390> new<00:03:19.480> tactics<00:03:19.959> will<00:03:20.140> be<00:03:20.230> coming<00:03:20.530> out

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680

so<00:03:20.950> have<00:03:21.459> to<00:03:21.610> see<00:03:21.730> how<00:03:21.790> those<00:03:21.970> play<00:03:22.150> out<00:03:22.239> as<00:03:22.450> you

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600

of his ramp I personally feel that they

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.870 
of his ramp I personally feel that they
could<00:03:41.470> have<00:03:41.560> just<00:03:41.590> decreased<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.370> price<00:03:42.610> of

could have just decreased the price of

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.610 
could have just decreased the price of
the<00:03:43.090> hallucination<00:03:43.780> upgrade<00:03:44.140> or<00:03:44.290> something

the hallucination upgrade or something

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.470 
the hallucination upgrade or something
because<00:03:44.799> now<00:03:45.130> it's<00:03:45.400> just<00:03:45.610> free<00:03:45.850> scouting<00:03:46.330> for

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480
