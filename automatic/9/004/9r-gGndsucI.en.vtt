live<00:00:03.270> code<00:00:03.959> of<00:00:04.259> UK<00:00:04.740> won't<00:00:05.670> go<00:00:05.790> down<00:00:05.819> that<00:00:06.109> road

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
live code of UK won't go down that road

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.230 
live code of UK won't go down that road
but<00:00:07.410> you<00:00:07.799> know<00:00:07.919> evolution<00:00:08.820> is<00:00:08.910> what<00:00:09.090> was

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
but you know evolution is what was

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.180 
but you know evolution is what was
required<00:00:09.599> and<00:00:09.990> I<00:00:10.349> guess<00:00:10.590> in<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:10.830> sense<00:00:10.860> of

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
required and I guess in a sense of

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.100 
required and I guess in a sense of
interval<00:00:11.639> that<00:00:11.670> he'd<00:00:11.940> found<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.570> evolution

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
interval that he'd found the evolution

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.160 
interval that he'd found the evolution
of<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.320> Hogan<00:00:13.799> sort<00:00:14.070> of<00:00:14.130> era<00:00:14.460> in<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.790> warrior

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
of the Hogan sort of era in the warrior

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.750 
of the Hogan sort of era in the warrior
that<00:00:16.170> area<00:00:16.470> was<00:00:16.560> coming<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.949> close<00:00:17.220> 10

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
that area was coming to a close 10

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.760 
that area was coming to a close 10
minutes<00:00:18.119> remaining<00:00:18.539> warrior<00:00:19.410> had<00:00:19.740> a

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
minutes remaining warrior had a

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.410 
minutes remaining warrior had a
connection<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.760> was<00:00:20.910> different<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.330> the

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
connection that was different to the

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.750 
connection that was different to the
connection<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:21.869> Hogan<00:00:22.500> had<00:00:22.650> with<00:00:22.830> fans<00:00:23.100> but

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
connection that Hogan had with fans but

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.490 
connection that Hogan had with fans but
I<00:00:23.789> think<00:00:24.060> Hogan<00:00:24.539> was<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.689> lot<00:00:24.869> better<00:00:25.140> in

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
I think Hogan was a lot better in

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.880 
I think Hogan was a lot better in
knowing<00:00:25.920> how<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:27.000> don't<00:00:27.990> know<00:00:28.199> just<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.619> guess

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
knowing how to I don't know just a guess

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.980 
knowing how to I don't know just a guess
be<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.189> just<00:00:29.460> be<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.609> performer<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.420> think<00:00:30.660> Hogan

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
be it just be a performer I think Hogan

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.540 
be it just be a performer I think Hogan
was<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.109> better<00:00:31.380> performer<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.250> think<00:00:32.430> he

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
was a better performer and I think he

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.459 
was a better performer and I think he
outmatched<00:00:33.059> warrior<00:00:33.510> in<00:00:33.780> lots<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.410> different

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
outmatched warrior in lots of different

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.500 
outmatched warrior in lots of different
ways<00:00:34.739> particularly<00:00:35.309> what<00:00:35.790> he<00:00:35.910> did<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.180> scoop

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
ways particularly what he did to scoop

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.330 
ways particularly what he did to scoop
the<00:00:36.809> heat<00:00:36.989> back<00:00:37.230> for<00:00:37.410> himself<00:00:37.559> at<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:37.950> end<00:00:38.190> of

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
the heat back for himself at the end of

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.270 
the heat back for himself at the end of
the<00:00:38.550> title<00:00:39.360> switch<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.840> just<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:40.950> just<00:00:40.980> think

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
the title switch I just I just think

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.880 
the title switch I just I just think
hurry<00:00:41.690> hurry<00:00:42.690> up<00:00:42.840> warrior<00:00:43.379> don't<00:00:43.649> get<00:00:43.800> me

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
hurry hurry up warrior don't get me

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.740 
hurry hurry up warrior don't get me
wrong<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.100> guy<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.760> know<00:00:44.850> had<00:00:45.149> had<00:00:45.719> a

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
wrong the guy you know had had a

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.299 
wrong the guy you know had had a
connection<00:00:46.140> he<00:00:46.590> had<00:00:46.710> there<00:00:46.890> was<00:00:46.980> something

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
connection he had there was something

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.279 
connection he had there was something
there<00:00:47.340> with<00:00:47.730> him<00:00:47.940> but<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.420> think<00:00:48.510> he<00:00:49.050> was

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
there with him but I think he was

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.930 
there with him but I think he was
definitely<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.950> right<00:00:49.980> guy<00:00:50.520> at<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.879> right

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
definitely the right guy at the right

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.600 
definitely the right guy at the right
place<00:00:51.329> in<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.539> right<00:00:51.629> time<00:00:52.079> more<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.039> than<00:00:53.309> I

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
place in the right time more so than I

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.189 
place in the right time more so than I
don't<00:00:53.850> know<00:00:53.940> I'm<00:00:54.090> not<00:00:54.120> sure<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.690> don't<00:00:54.930> know<00:00:55.020> but

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
don't know I'm not sure I don't know but

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.590 
don't know I'm not sure I don't know but
I<00:00:55.260> i<00:00:55.350> think<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.430> was<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.550> think<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.120> wasn't<00:00:57.449> just

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
I i think it was I think it wasn't just

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.930 
I i think it was I think it wasn't just
his<00:00:57.780> politics<00:00:58.260> backstage<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.579> caused<00:00:59.730> him

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
his politics backstage that caused him

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.400 
his politics backstage that caused him
problems<00:01:00.059> i<00:01:00.390> think<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.690> was<00:01:00.750> his<00:01:00.870> inability<00:01:01.079> to

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
problems i think it was his inability to

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.770 
problems i think it was his inability to
be<00:01:01.500> able<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.890> work<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> level<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.480> would

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
be able to work to a level that would

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.719 
be able to work to a level that would
have<00:01:03.899> carried<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.260> company<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.920> also<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
have carried the company and also the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.219 
have carried the company and also the
fact<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.150> time<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.479> change<00:01:06.720> him<00:01:06.900> yeah<00:01:07.200> i

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
fact that the time to change him yeah i

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.780 
fact that the time to change him yeah i
mean<00:01:07.320> i<00:01:07.530> think<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.860> definitely<00:01:08.100> from<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.580> work

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
mean i think that definitely from a work

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.670 
mean i think that definitely from a work
perspective<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.630> way<00:01:09.750> he<00:01:09.960> did<00:01:10.170> his<00:01:10.350> business

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
perspective in a way he did his business

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.280 
perspective in a way he did his business
in<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.070> ring<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.400> indeed<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.420> mic<00:01:12.600> was

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
in the ring and indeed on the mic was

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.510 
in the ring and indeed on the mic was
certainly<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.680> reason<00:01:13.950> why<00:01:14.070> i<00:01:14.100> think<00:01:14.250> in

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
certainly the reason why i think in

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.730 
certainly the reason why i think in
later<00:01:14.760> years<00:01:14.909> he<00:01:15.210> was<00:01:15.659> unable<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.930> rediscover

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
later years he was unable to rediscover

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.380 
later years he was unable to rediscover
that<00:01:16.830> drawing<00:01:17.430> power<00:01:17.759> i<00:01:17.909> mean<00:01:18.090> i<00:01:18.150> think<00:01:18.210> when

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
that drawing power i mean i think when

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.020 
that drawing power i mean i think when
he<00:01:18.450> came<00:01:18.570> back<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.960> 96<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.280> dodo<00:01:20.520> EF<00:01:20.729> and

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
he came back in 96 to the dodo EF and

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.910 
he came back in 96 to the dodo EF and
again<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.450> WCW<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.619> 1998<00:01:23.280> with<00:01:24.500> in<00:01:25.500> sort<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.830> a

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
again in WCW in 1998 with in sort of a

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.080 
again in WCW in 1998 with in sort of a
couple<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.250> weeks<00:01:26.400> i<00:01:26.520> think<00:01:26.549> he<00:01:26.729> drew<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.909> big

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
couple of weeks i think he drew a big

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.910 
couple of weeks i think he drew a big
rating<00:01:27.420> at<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.540> start<00:01:27.869> but<00:01:28.140> then<00:01:28.590> as<00:01:28.710> soon<00:01:28.799> as

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
rating at the start but then as soon as

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.109 
rating at the start but then as soon as
people<00:01:29.070> actually<00:01:29.400> had<00:01:29.490> seen<00:01:29.700> him<00:01:29.939> and

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
people actually had seen him and

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.450 
people actually had seen him and
realized<00:01:30.720> oh<00:01:31.229> that's<00:01:31.680> why<00:01:31.799> we<00:01:32.009> didn't<00:01:32.250> really

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
realized oh that's why we didn't really

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.920 
realized oh that's why we didn't really
like<00:01:32.729> him<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.030> well<00:01:33.299> that's<00:01:33.450> why<00:01:33.600> he<00:01:33.720> wasn't

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
like him that well that's why he wasn't

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.440 
like him that well that's why he wasn't
a<00:01:34.110> bigger<00:01:34.770> star<00:01:35.070> they<00:01:35.729> were<00:01:35.820> kind<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.030> right

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
a bigger star they were kind of right

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.840 
a bigger star they were kind of right
okay<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.020> then<00:01:37.259> stop<00:01:37.560> watching<00:01:37.950> him<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.189> think

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
okay and then stop watching him I think

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.510 
okay and then stop watching him I think
I<00:01:39.030> tend<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.810> think<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.079> there's<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> sense<00:01:40.650> you

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
I tend to think that there's a sense you

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.010 
I tend to think that there's a sense you
brought<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:41.970> actually<00:01:42.329> touched<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.899> there

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
brought you actually touched on it there

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.190 
brought you actually touched on it there
with<00:01:43.140> Hogan<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.250> way<00:01:44.549> kind<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.200> took

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
with Hogan and the the way kind of took

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.200 
with Hogan and the the way kind of took
back<00:01:46.530> all<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.250> attention<00:01:47.850> at

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
back all of the attention at

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.789 
back all of the attention at
WrestleMania<00:01:48.750> six<00:01:48.960> when<00:01:49.140> he'd<00:01:49.259> supposedly

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
WrestleMania six when he'd supposedly

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.980 
WrestleMania six when he'd supposedly
put<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.220> warrior<00:01:50.490> /<00:01:50.610> clean<00:01:50.970> there's<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.840> lot<00:01:51.960> of

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
put the warrior / clean there's a lot of

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.319 
put the warrior / clean there's a lot of
that's<00:01:52.170> that's<00:01:52.740> kind<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.640> staked<00:01:53.970> on<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.299> I

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
that's that's kind of staked on that I

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.429 
that's that's kind of staked on that I
think<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.570> lot<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.720> people<00:01:54.810> look<00:01:55.140> at<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.320> and

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
think a lot of people look at that and

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.289 
think a lot of people look at that and
think<00:01:55.590> that's<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.950> really<00:01:56.189> important<00:01:56.640> moment

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
think that's a really important moment

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.319 
think that's a really important moment
in<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.960> Warriors<00:01:58.200> career<00:01:59.100> and<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.149> think

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
in the Warriors career and I think

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.700 
in the Warriors career and I think
Hogan's<00:02:00.600> even<00:02:00.810> admitted<00:02:01.229> now<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.409> actually

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
Hogan's even admitted now to actually

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.620 
Hogan's even admitted now to actually
having<00:02:02.130> done<00:02:02.399> that<00:02:02.430> deliberately<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.450> take

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
having done that deliberately to take

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.270 
having done that deliberately to take
off<00:02:03.810> take<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.200> shine<00:02:04.380> off<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.770> wind<00:02:04.950> from<00:02:05.130> the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
off take the shine off the wind from the

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.410 
off take the shine off the wind from the
warrior<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:05.850> everyone<00:02:06.030> was<00:02:06.210> still

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
warrior so that everyone was still

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.800 
warrior so that everyone was still
looking<00:02:06.570> at<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.380> sympathetic<00:02:08.129> Hogan<00:02:08.599> yeah<00:02:09.599> I

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
looking at the sympathetic Hogan yeah I

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.479 
looking at the sympathetic Hogan yeah I
tend<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.200> think<00:02:10.289> though<00:02:10.560> that<00:02:10.590> actually<00:02:11.160> after

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
tend to think though that actually after

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.700 
tend to think though that actually after
that<00:02:11.640> Hogan<00:02:12.270> warrior<00:02:12.900> had<00:02:13.110> it<00:02:13.230> even

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
that Hogan warrior had it even

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.770 
that Hogan warrior had it even
more<00:02:14.070> difficult<00:02:14.550> in<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.730> sense<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:15.030> his

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
more difficult in the sense that his

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.930 
more difficult in the sense that his
next<00:02:16.380> big<00:02:16.650> match<00:02:16.920> his<00:02:17.190> next<00:02:17.400> big<00:02:17.490> pay-per-view

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
next big match his next big pay-per-view

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.030 
next big match his next big pay-per-view
match<00:02:18.120> anyway<00:02:18.540> was<00:02:19.320> lined<00:02:19.530> up<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:19.950> was

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
match anyway was lined up and it was

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.040 
match anyway was lined up and it was
Rick<00:02:20.250> Rude<00:02:20.460> he'd<00:02:21.060> already<00:02:21.210> repeated

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
Rick Rude he'd already repeated

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.050 
Rick Rude he'd already repeated
conquered<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:22.980> was<00:02:23.130> like<00:02:23.280> it<00:02:23.400> wasn't<00:02:23.550> any<00:02:23.820> kind

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
conquered it was like it wasn't any kind

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.700 
conquered it was like it wasn't any kind
of<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.180> threat<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.690> warrior<00:02:24.960> that<00:02:25.290> was<00:02:25.500> when

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710

there<00:03:41.070> I<00:03:41.280> just<00:03:41.970> it<00:03:42.060> was<00:03:42.150> a<00:03:42.210> magical<00:03:42.570> time<00:03:42.810> for

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
there I just it was a magical time for

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.810 
there I just it was a magical time for
me<00:03:43.140> but<00:03:43.320> if<00:03:43.410> I<00:03:43.530> look<00:03:43.740> back<00:03:43.950> I<00:03:43.980> do<00:03:44.160> recall<00:03:44.490> the

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
me but if I look back I do recall the

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.510 
me but if I look back I do recall the
thing<00:03:45.030> that<00:03:45.180> was<00:03:45.240> most<00:03:45.380> heavily<00:03:46.380> promoted<00:03:46.920> was

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
thing that was most heavily promoted was

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.610 
thing that was most heavily promoted was
the<00:03:47.670> return<00:03:47.940> of<00:03:47.970> Hogan<00:03:48.510> and<00:03:48.720> not<00:03:49.110> really<00:03:49.350> that

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
the return of Hogan and not really that

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.290 
the return of Hogan and not really that
much<00:03:49.680> so<00:03:50.100> it<00:03:50.310> was<00:03:50.430> almost<00:03:50.550> like<00:03:50.820> you're<00:03:50.970> saying

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
much so it was almost like you're saying

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.790 
much so it was almost like you're saying
that<00:03:51.330> match<00:03:51.630> was<00:03:51.660> an<00:03:51.930> afterthought<00:03:52.380> with<00:03:52.590> rude

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
that match was an afterthought with rude

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.310 
that match was an afterthought with rude
in<00:03:53.010> a<00:03:53.340> strange<00:03:53.610> way<00:03:53.790> yeah<00:03:54.120> and<00:03:54.660> that's<00:03:54.870> it<00:03:55.020> just

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
in a strange way yeah and that's it just

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.440 
in a strange way yeah and that's it just
seemed<00:03:55.500> like<00:03:55.530> he<00:03:55.980> was<00:03:56.160> they<00:03:56.670> never<00:03:56.880> really<00:03:57.150> got

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
seemed like he was they never really got

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.910 
seemed like he was they never really got
behind<00:03:57.600> him<00:03:57.900> even<00:03:58.170> after<00:03:58.290> he<00:03:58.440> became<00:03:58.770> the

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920
