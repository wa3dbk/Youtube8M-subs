this book a 4 out of 5 stars because I

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.920 
this book a 4 out of 5 stars because I
really<00:01:38.100> liked<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.790> book<00:01:39.240> itself<00:01:39.479> but<00:01:39.840> the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
really liked the book itself but the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.550 
really liked the book itself but the
writing<00:01:40.200> was<00:01:40.590> not<00:01:41.100> as<00:01:41.340> good<00:01:42.150> app<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.170> par<00:01:43.350> like

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
writing was not as good app to par like

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.499 
writing was not as good app to par like
the<00:01:43.979> research<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.520> everything<00:01:44.820> like<00:01:44.939> the

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
the research and everything like the

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.600 
the research and everything like the
factual<00:01:46.020> information<00:01:46.259> was<00:01:46.680> really<00:01:46.890> good<00:01:47.070> but

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
factual information was really good but

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.639 
factual information was really good but
the<00:01:48.060> gist<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.659> writing<00:01:48.930> style<00:01:49.170> were<00:01:49.470> just

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
the gist the writing style were just

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.950 
the gist the writing style were just
kind<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.860> boring<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.909> weird<00:01:51.360> which<00:01:51.810> is

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
kind of boring and weird which is

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.100 
kind of boring and weird which is
actually<00:01:52.310> okay<00:01:53.310> because<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.729> found<00:01:54.149> out<00:01:54.750> that

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
actually okay because I found out that

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.740 
actually okay because I found out that
the<00:01:55.290> author<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.759> like<00:01:56.759> Norwegian<00:01:57.630> or

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
the author is like Norwegian or

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.510 
the author is like Norwegian or
something<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.350> was<00:01:58.469> translated<00:01:59.310> which

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
something so it was translated which

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.179 
something so it was translated which
makes<00:01:59.759> so<00:01:59.969> much<00:02:00.090> sense<00:02:00.149> now<00:02:00.570> but<00:02:01.350> even<00:02:01.500> still<00:02:02.009> I

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
makes so much sense now but even still I

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.069 
makes so much sense now but even still I
don't<00:02:02.430> look<00:02:02.820> like<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.090> writing<00:02:03.360> style<00:02:03.630> even

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
don't look like the writing style even

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.539 
don't look like the writing style even
if<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.320> was<00:02:04.469> translated<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.219> that's<00:02:05.369> the

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
if it was translated and that's the

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.700 
if it was translated and that's the
reason<00:02:05.640> why<00:02:06.000> this<00:02:06.299> book<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.810> awesome<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.530> be<00:02:07.680> a

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
don't know it's just hard to flip

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.070 
don't know it's just hard to flip
through<00:02:38.790> for<00:02:39.000> me<00:02:39.090> even<00:02:39.450> though<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.750> print<00:02:39.960> is

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
through for me even though the print is

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.830 
through for me even though the print is
so<00:02:40.200> tiny<00:02:40.410> in<00:02:40.620> these<00:02:40.800> it's<00:02:41.190> still<00:02:41.820> bigger<00:02:42.450> I

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
so tiny in these it's still bigger I

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.470 
so tiny in these it's still bigger I
guess<00:02:43.410> so<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.910> only<00:02:45.060> problem<00:02:45.240> with<00:02:45.390> this

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
guess so the only problem with this

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.760 
guess so the only problem with this
copies<00:02:45.870> i<00:02:45.990> won't<00:02:46.140> be<00:02:46.200> able<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.410> take<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:46.590> with
