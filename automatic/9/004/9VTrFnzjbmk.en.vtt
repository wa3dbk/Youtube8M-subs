was<00:00:29.880> half<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.090> reason<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.600> picked<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:30.930> off<00:00:31.050> the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
was half the reason I picked it off the

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.330 
was half the reason I picked it off the
shelf<00:00:31.440> in<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.680> bookstore<00:00:32.129> but<00:00:34.160> one<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.190> the

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
shelf in the bookstore but one of the

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.770 
shelf in the bookstore but one of the
reasons<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.699> picked<00:00:35.910> this<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.150> the<00:00:36.270> first<00:00:36.540> book

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
reasons I picked this is the first book

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
to review is that it's in

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:42.269 
post-apocalyptic fiction meaning that

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:44.509 
post-apocalyptic fiction meaning that

that's<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.949> nuclear<00:00:47.370> war<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.720> seems<00:00:48.960> that

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:49.019 
that's a nuclear war and it seems that

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
it's really the best book to pick is the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.840 
it's really the best book to pick is the
first<00:01:25.409> one<00:01:25.649> it's<00:01:26.159> definitely<00:01:26.670> not<00:01:26.789> a

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
first one it's definitely not a

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.300 
first one it's definitely not a
difficult<00:01:27.359> read<00:01:27.539> but<00:01:27.990> since<00:01:28.259> it's<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:28.500> good<00:01:28.859> if

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
difficult read but since it's so good if

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.310 
difficult read but since it's so good if
you<00:01:29.520> pick<00:01:29.729> up<00:01:29.820> any<00:01:30.000> other<00:01:30.210> books<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.049> genre

you pick up any other books in the genre
they're<00:01:32.310> probably<00:01:32.609> not<00:01:32.820> gonna<00:01:32.969> come<00:01:33.090> close<00:01:33.539> to

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
they're probably not gonna come close to

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.990 
they're probably not gonna come close to
being<00:01:33.990> as<00:01:34.109> powerful<00:01:34.590> as<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:34.859> is<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.340> would<00:01:35.670> go

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
being as powerful as this is I would go

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.510 
being as powerful as this is I would go
so<00:01:36.390> far<00:01:36.420> just<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.960> say<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.439> it's<00:01:37.979> it's

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
so far just to say that it's it's

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.789 
so far just to say that it's it's
probably<00:01:38.880> literature<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.990> doesn't<00:01:40.289> get

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
probably literature and it doesn't get

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.830 
probably literature and it doesn't get
the<00:01:40.859> recognition<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.729> deserves<00:01:42.179> because<00:01:42.450> it's

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
the recognition it deserves because it's

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.520 
the recognition it deserves because it's
science<00:01:43.649> fiction<00:01:44.750> but<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.869> books<00:01:46.079> broken
