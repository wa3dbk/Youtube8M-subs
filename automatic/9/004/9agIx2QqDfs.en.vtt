00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.280 
filled it up now I guess that I'm doing

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.529 
filled it up now I guess that I'm doing
three<00:00:10.669> pounds<00:00:11.440> and<00:00:12.639> you<00:00:13.639> guys<00:00:13.909> will<00:00:14.389> probably

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:14.539 
three pounds and you guys will probably

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:16.540 
three pounds and you guys will probably
not<00:00:14.839> be<00:00:14.900> doing<00:00:15.169> three<00:00:15.349> pounds<00:00:15.740> and<00:00:15.889> less<00:00:16.070> like

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
not be doing three pounds and less like

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.830 
not be doing three pounds and less like
me<00:00:16.820> you<00:00:17.030> have<00:00:17.060> a<00:00:17.210> whole<00:00:17.360> watch<00:00:17.450> people<00:00:17.750> are

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
me you have a whole watch people are

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.980 
me you have a whole watch people are
going<00:00:17.930> to<00:00:18.020> be<00:00:18.080> beating<00:00:19.330> so<00:00:20.330> understand<00:00:20.870> that

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
going to be beating so understand that

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.940 
going to be beating so understand that
my<00:00:22.780> amount<00:00:23.780> i'm<00:00:24.110> using<00:00:24.380> them<00:00:24.470> everything<00:00:24.800> is

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:24.950 
my amount i'm using them everything is

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.860 
my amount i'm using them everything is
based<00:00:25.400> on<00:00:25.520> the<00:00:25.610> fact<00:00:25.790> number<00:00:25.970> three<00:00:26.300> pounds<00:00:26.600> i

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:26.870 
based on the fact number three pounds i

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:34.780 
based on the fact number three pounds i
also<00:00:27.410> have<00:00:27.790> two<00:00:28.790> quarts<00:00:29.210> of<00:00:29.360> water<00:00:32.320> and<00:00:33.790> I

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
also have two quarts of water and I

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.190 
also have two quarts of water and I
think<00:00:35.090> for<00:00:35.210> three<00:00:35.450> pounds<00:00:35.750> of<00:00:35.840> probably<00:00:36.079> going

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
think for three pounds of probably going

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.170 
think for three pounds of probably going
to<00:00:36.260> go<00:00:36.320> with<00:00:36.440> three<00:00:37.190> or<00:00:37.250> four<00:00:37.610> courts<00:00:38.030> though

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.809 

I<00:02:46.450> that<00:02:47.200> two<00:02:47.380> quarts<00:02:47.680> of<00:02:47.770> water<00:02:47.830> I'm<00:02:48.460> doing
