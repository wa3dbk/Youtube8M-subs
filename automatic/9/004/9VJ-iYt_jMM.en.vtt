00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
to do is you will need to dig a hole

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.830 
to do is you will need to dig a hole
that<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.420> twice<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.710> depth<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.910> twice<00:00:30.359> the

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
that is twice the depth and twice the

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.830 
that is twice the depth and twice the
width<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:32.250> container<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:33.090> the

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
width of the container that the

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.130 
width of the container that the
particular<00:00:34.440> tree<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.160> in<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.480> reason<00:00:36.630> for

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
particular tree is in and the reason for

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.069 
particular tree is in and the reason for
this<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.219> can<00:00:38.250> backfill<00:00:39.090> with<00:00:39.809> a

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
this so that you can backfill with a

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.670 
this so that you can backfill with a
combination<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.160> swirl<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.730> dug<00:00:42.000> and

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
combination of a swirl that you dug and

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.430 
combination of a swirl that you dug and
compost<00:00:43.940> so<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:44.969> already<00:00:45.510> have<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.050> soil

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
compost so I already have the soil

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.490 
compost so I already have the soil
removed<00:00:47.340> from<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:47.760> hole<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.780> did<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.020> dry

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
removed from this hole and I did a dry

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.250 
removed from this hole and I did a dry
run<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.829> tested<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.730> see<00:00:50.760> if<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:52.110> was<00:00:52.199> the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
run I tested to see if it was the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.080 
run I tested to see if it was the
appropriate<00:00:52.890> dimensions<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.699> as<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.940> can

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
appropriate dimensions and as you can

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.750 
appropriate dimensions and as you can
see<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.920> next<00:00:56.309> step<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.520> you're

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
see it is the next step that you're

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.910 
see it is the next step that you're
going<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.030> need<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.360> do<00:00:57.480> in<00:00:57.660> any<00:00:57.989> type<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.440> train

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
going to need to do in any type of train

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.619 
going to need to do in any type of train
whether<00:00:59.160> it's<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.670> tree<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.210> got<00:01:00.359> for<00:01:00.570> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
whether it's a tree you got for the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.020 
whether it's a tree you got for the
holidays<00:01:01.140> it's<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.500> fruit<00:01:01.890> tree<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
holidays it's a fruit tree the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.780 
holidays it's a fruit tree the
decorative<00:01:03.390> landscape<00:01:04.049> tree<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:05.400> will<00:01:05.519> need

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
decorative landscape tree you will need

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.690 
decorative landscape tree you will need
to<00:01:06.060> actually<00:01:06.240> scrape<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.560> sides<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.159> inside

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
to actually scrape the sides of inside

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.179 
to actually scrape the sides of inside
the<00:01:08.939> hole<00:01:09.180> now<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:10.049> prevents<00:01:10.560> what's<00:01:10.890> called

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
the hole now this prevents what's called

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.760 
the hole now this prevents what's called
glazing<00:01:11.939> which<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.750> when<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.049> have<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> soil

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
glazing which is when you have a soil

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.550 
glazing which is when you have a soil
that<00:01:13.950> has<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.250> high<00:01:14.670> clay<00:01:15.150> content<00:01:15.560> what

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
that has a high clay content what

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.740 
that has a high clay content what
happens<00:01:17.009> does<00:01:17.220> those<00:01:17.400> sides<00:01:17.759> become<00:01:18.240> smooth

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
happens does those sides become smooth

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.260 
happens does those sides become smooth
and<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.619> roots<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.130> tree<00:01:20.460> cannot<00:01:20.880> break

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
and the roots of the tree cannot break

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.219 
and the roots of the tree cannot break
through<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
through the

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.940 
through the
very<00:01:22.549> simply<00:01:23.549> taking<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.119> rake<00:01:24.329> and<00:01:24.950> scratching

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
very simply taking a rake and scratching

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.870 
very simply taking a rake and scratching
the<00:01:26.670> inside<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.509> hole<00:01:27.780> will<00:01:28.500> prevent<00:01:29.159> that

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
the inside of the hole will prevent that

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:37.279 
the inside of the hole will prevent that
glazing

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.620 

now<00:01:38.289> the<00:01:38.829> next<00:01:39.039> step<00:01:39.399> that<00:01:39.429> you<00:01:39.640> need<00:01:39.819> to<00:01:40.149> do<00:01:40.329> is

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
now the next step that you need to do is

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.039 
now the next step that you need to do is
you<00:01:41.259> need<00:01:41.469> to<00:01:41.979> see<00:01:42.340> how<00:01:42.999> much<00:01:43.210> you<00:01:43.479> need<00:01:43.749> to

you need to see how much you need to
fill<00:01:44.350> in<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.920> hole<00:01:45.159> now<00:01:45.939> a<00:01:46.240> tree<00:01:46.659> garlis<00:01:47.649> of

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
fill in the hole now a tree garlis of

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:50.010 
fill in the hole now a tree garlis of
the<00:01:47.920> type<00:01:48.130> should<00:01:48.789> not<00:01:49.000> be<00:01:49.240> planted<00:01:49.780> any

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
the type should not be planted any

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.010 
the type should not be planted any
deeper<00:01:50.799> than<00:01:51.280> the<00:01:51.459> soil<00:01:51.850> level<00:01:52.209> it<00:01:52.390> is<00:01:52.420> in<00:01:52.899> the

swirl that came out of the ground in

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.589 
swirl that came out of the ground in
conference

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.319 

now<00:02:14.109> because<00:02:14.499> this<00:02:14.829> swill<00:02:15.189> has<00:02:15.489> a<00:02:15.519> high<00:02:15.939> clay

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.329 
now because this swill has a high clay

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:19.619 
now because this swill has a high clay
content<00:02:16.629> it<00:02:17.590> tends<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.249> clump<00:02:18.969> a<00:02:19.239> little<00:02:19.510> bit

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
content it tends to clump a little bit

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:35.070 
content it tends to clump a little bit
just<00:02:20.079> break<00:02:20.349> up

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.100 

and<00:02:35.410> then<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:35.950> a<00:02:35.980> driver<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.670> again<00:02:37.000> if<00:02:37.960> you

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
and then to a driver and again if you

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.440 
and then to a driver and again if you
need<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.320> add<00:02:38.620> any<00:02:38.920> additional<00:02:39.040> soil

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
need to add any additional soil

00:02:41.450 --> 00:03:00.640 
need to add any additional soil
and<00:02:41.569> I<00:02:41.990> need<00:02:42.170> to<00:02:42.260> add<00:02:42.380> just<00:02:42.410> a<00:02:42.709> little<00:02:43.010> bit<00:02:43.130> more

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.100 

then<00:03:01.250> you<00:03:01.459> need<00:03:01.700> to<00:03:01.849> do<00:03:01.970> another<00:03:02.180> try

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:17.920 

one<00:03:07.320> more<00:03:07.620> skin

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.630 

the<00:03:18.319> next<00:03:18.650> step<00:03:18.859> you<00:03:18.890> need<00:03:19.189> to<00:03:19.340> do<00:03:19.459> this

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
the next step you need to do this

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.940 
the next step you need to do this
process<00:03:20.150> if<00:03:20.299> you<00:03:20.420> need<00:03:20.629> to<00:03:20.840> remove<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.650> tree

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
process if you need to remove the tree

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.080 
process if you need to remove the tree
its<00:03:22.430> container

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
its container

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.440 
its container
now<00:03:23.719> you<00:03:23.780> can't<00:03:24.230> cut<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:25.400> plastic<00:03:25.879> container

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
now you can't cut the plastic container

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.140 
now you can't cut the plastic container
or<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:28.140> can<00:03:28.819> grab<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:31.290> track<00:03:31.640> and<00:03:32.640> release<00:03:32.760> it

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
or you can grab the track and release it

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.369 
or you can grab the track and release it
like<00:03:33.300> that<00:03:34.370> now<00:03:35.370> if<00:03:36.180> you<00:03:36.450> allow<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.840> tree<00:03:37.349> to

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
like that now if you allow the tree to

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.860 
like that now if you allow the tree to
stay<00:03:37.830> in<00:03:38.040> this<00:03:38.190> shape<00:03:38.550> what<00:03:38.760> will<00:03:38.940> happen<00:03:39.420> is

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
stay in this shape what will happen is

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.960 
stay in this shape what will happen is
the<00:03:40.080> roots<00:03:40.290> will<00:03:40.470> just<00:03:40.680> continue<00:03:41.040> to<00:03:41.250> grow<00:03:41.400> in

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
the roots will just continue to grow in

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:42.770 
the roots will just continue to grow in
a<00:03:42.090> circle

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
a circle

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.290 
a circle
it<00:03:43.050> will<00:03:43.230> never<00:03:43.440> grow<00:03:43.769> out<00:03:43.980> so<00:03:44.849> what<00:03:45.000> you<00:03:45.120> need

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
it will never grow out so what you need

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.009 
it will never grow out so what you need
to<00:03:45.390> do<00:03:45.709> to<00:03:46.709> prevent<00:03:47.069> this<00:03:47.340> is<00:03:48.209> you<00:03:48.420> just<00:03:48.599> need

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
to do to prevent this is you just need

00:03:49.019 --> 00:04:20.750 
to do to prevent this is you just need
two<00:03:49.980> TVs

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.439 

yeah<00:04:21.300> next<00:04:22.020> up<00:04:22.230> like<00:04:23.130> a<00:04:23.430> tree

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:25.449 
yeah next up like a tree

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:28.529 
yeah next up like a tree
in<00:04:25.689> the<00:04:25.840> ground<00:04:26.080> again<00:04:26.490> checking<00:04:27.490> to<00:04:27.639> see<00:04:27.879> the

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
in the ground again checking to see the

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:30.580 
in the ground again checking to see the
level

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
level

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.220 
level
the<00:04:31.190> levels<00:04:31.580> not<00:04:31.910> appropriate<00:04:32.900> you<00:04:33.110> can

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
the levels not appropriate you can

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.430 
the levels not appropriate you can
create<00:04:34.120> either<00:04:35.120> adding<00:04:35.660> or<00:04:35.780> taking<00:04:36.050> away

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
create either adding or taking away

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.850 
create either adding or taking away
sweat

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
sweat

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:46.370 
sweat
Oh

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.260 

guard<00:04:47.380> you<00:04:48.160> will<00:04:48.280> actually<00:04:48.460> need<00:04:48.910> to<00:04:49.090> create

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
guard you will actually need to create

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.960 
guard you will actually need to create
berm<00:04:49.900> around<00:04:50.259> it<00:04:50.949> to<00:04:51.669> a<00:04:51.960> lot<00:04:52.960> more<00:04:53.229> damage<00:04:53.970> also

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
berm around it to a lot more damage also

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.140 
berm around it to a lot more damage also
to<00:04:55.300> provide<00:04:55.900> a<00:04:55.930> mulch<00:04:56.259> and<00:04:56.650> to<00:04:57.370> also<00:04:57.490> create<00:04:57.880> a

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
to provide a mulch and to also create a

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.620 
to provide a mulch and to also create a
well<00:04:58.860> moisture<00:04:59.970> being<00:05:00.970> in<00:05:01.180> this<00:05:01.330> landscape

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
well moisture being in this landscape

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:12.360 
well moisture being in this landscape
fed<00:05:08.940> now<00:05:10.319> once<00:05:11.319> you<00:05:11.470> have<00:05:11.500> this<00:05:11.860> spill<00:05:12.160> then

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
fed now once you have this spill then

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.460 
fed now once you have this spill then
the<00:05:13.120> last<00:05:13.330> step<00:05:13.599> you<00:05:13.660> mentioned<00:05:14.110> is<00:05:14.199> you<00:05:14.289> need

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
the last step you mentioned is you need

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.860 
the last step you mentioned is you need
to<00:05:14.560> remove<00:05:14.860> the<00:05:15.130> tag<00:05:15.430> so<00:05:16.210> this<00:05:16.360> is<00:05:16.509> a<00:05:16.539> step<00:05:16.840> a

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
to remove the tag so this is a step a

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.430 
to remove the tag so this is a step a
lot<00:05:17.139> of<00:05:17.320> people<00:05:17.650> don't<00:05:17.919> think<00:05:18.220> about<00:05:18.729> but<00:05:19.440> come

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
lot of people don't think about but come

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.219 
lot of people don't think about but come
the<00:05:20.770> growing<00:05:21.130> season<00:05:21.750> these<00:05:22.750> needles<00:05:23.139> are

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
the growing season these needles are

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:25.589 
the growing season these needles are
going<00:05:23.410> to<00:05:23.470> start<00:05:23.740> growing<00:05:24.190> and<00:05:24.370> the<00:05:25.060> tag<00:05:25.389> is

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 
going to start growing and the tag is

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:27.480 
going to start growing and the tag is
going<00:05:25.690> to<00:05:26.050> cause<00:05:26.289> that<00:05:26.530> particular<00:05:26.889> student<00:05:27.310> a

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
going to cause that particular student a

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.700 
going to cause that particular student a
girl<00:05:27.699> and<00:05:28.210> the<00:05:28.479> same<00:05:28.720> with<00:05:28.900> the<00:05:28.990> decoration

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
girl and the same with the decoration

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.029 
girl and the same with the decoration
the<00:05:30.310> decorations<00:05:30.849> be<00:05:31.000> perfectly<00:05:31.570> fine<00:05:32.039> into

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 
the decorations be perfectly fine into

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:37.050 
the decorations be perfectly fine into
spring<00:05:33.400> so<00:05:33.909> this<00:05:34.060> plant<00:05:34.389> starts<00:05:34.870> up<00:05:35.490> a<00:05:36.490> creek

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
spring so this plant starts up a creek

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.270 
spring so this plant starts up a creek
so<00:05:38.020> until<00:05:38.320> we<00:05:38.470> need<00:05:38.620> in<00:05:38.770> the<00:05:38.860> garden<00:05:39.190> again

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
so until we need in the garden again

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.860 
so until we need in the garden again
this<00:05:40.000> is<00:05:40.210> the<00:05:40.360> mindy<00:05:40.780> from<00:05:40.990> the<00:05:41.229> weekend<00:05:41.620> guard
