00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.310
 Incidentally, here in my schooldays I often also regularly sprinted 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.310
 to have in every break 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.150
 So slowly with this athletics-wm not interesting 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.820
 where slow is the wrong word some run as fast as if they were 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.199
 that of a different style dell star 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.580
 yes well, now the rumor that some children their charges equal 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:28.119
 to lead after the starting shot 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.640
 Doping control and fact is already at the finish 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.110
 but the competition is already in the starting blocks but it was said to participate 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.570
 which can no longer be stopped by us humans 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.980
 and that's how you see here at least seven kilometers per hour 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.350
 Now, they actually only need to learn to stand 30 feet from the target 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.890
 laugh and cheer 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.450
 Incidentally, that did not sound like her team as if at the 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.460
 Athletics of a 0 2 went spin No that also has a lot to do with self-discipline 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.460
 Do not do alcohol, for example, you should not even with medications 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.809
 otherwise you still have a bit of action like this young man 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.329
 which moves only very slowly and carefully in the 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.370
 It's frightening that he'll know who else knows 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.130
 but fortunately, the psychiatrist in the short film can pull his patients 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.730
 This very vividly described fear is not exactly a movie for 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.330
 Children in contrast to bring the del 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.800
 a very inspiring and oscarnominated animated film from the 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.230
 In addition, Jan 1968 and falls have been laying sound recordings of their little ones 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.980
 Taken daughters and then chattering the imagination in her mother 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.479
 Favorites translated into pictures where I also have to go here 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.640
 What children think up so often is unsuitable for children 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.460
 yes I have to say luckily there are still people with whom not everything 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.510
 even fast men have to go fast 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.410
 ManUtd take the time to take a closer look, for example the 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.539
 Street artist Cellist Little Money asked drivers on House Venne stream 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:51.759
 and at the same time quite cleverly existing objects and above all 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.450
 However, shadow casting involves an almost even tighter eye 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.059
 Photographer nothing here on the 10 be keen on colors shapes and above all 

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:04.229
 strange pictures in everyday situations is phenomenal one should absolutely 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.450
 take the time to complete the photo gallery on its website once 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.549
 Checking on him gets you back to the museum 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:15.659
 Tönnies and Nils do not have to be frustrated by the way 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.329
 because there are contact lenses 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:19.370
 and soon maybe some like this one here 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.270
 a concept of the designer Christopher Kümmerer in which the contact lens the 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.309
 Reality can completely adapt to the emotions or wishes of the wearer 

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:31.229
 Jackets sometimes you just do not want to believe in reality 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:34.229
 probably a petty criminal in California hoped and that's why 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:38.519
 trying to sell this flat screen TV alone in a parking lot 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.309
 Hook that was a call doors 

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:43.649
 but who probably did not notice the many cooking programs 

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:45.859
 it always depends on the right packaging 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:47.930
 You can also tell that from the main altar 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.620
 and that's why there are old ones here 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.959
 Bows for packaging for just about every purpose and every tinker 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.970
 Iceland and practically print it can be from what at by one namely 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.150
 self-assembled online magazine 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.880
 For example, you might think of interesting articles from a few 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.780
 web pages and then makes just a push of a kind of mini newspaper 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.240
 on it the publishers will be thrilled and become the film studios 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.050
 be amazed by Hollywood Player one against Weiz since around the topic 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.720
 Cinema with lots of fun at a game with which you know his movie 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.090
 can prove or multiply and in the animated video 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.200
 Poses you can not lose one parts in the future becomes the meaning 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.239
 that's her mustard I'm Christ limited 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.109
 Here with the oven door is not so cool 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:31.089
 which at dislocations
