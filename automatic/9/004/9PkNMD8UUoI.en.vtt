of the first year of the reboot to

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.640 
of the first year of the reboot to
bionicle<00:00:26.010> now<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:26.939> obviously<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:28.109> ki-moon

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
bionicle now this is obviously a ki-moon

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.990 
bionicle now this is obviously a ki-moon
now<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.609> know<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:31.040> some<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.219> pieces<00:00:32.460> on

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
now I know that some of the pieces on

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.639 
now I know that some of the pieces on
this<00:00:33.329> or<00:00:34.320> wrong<00:00:34.680> some<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:36.649> different

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
this or wrong some of the different

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.180 
this or wrong some of the different
pieces<00:00:38.210> should<00:00:39.210> not<00:00:39.450> be<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.860> colors<00:00:41.160> that

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
pieces should not be in the colors that

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.369 
pieces should not be in the colors that
they<00:00:41.489> are<00:00:41.670> some<00:00:42.360> pieces<00:00:42.570> should<00:00:42.870> not<00:00:43.050> even<00:00:43.230> be

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
they are some pieces should not even be

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.940 
they are some pieces should not even be
the<00:00:43.800> pieces<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.460> they<00:00:44.489> are<00:00:45.379> the<00:00:46.379> mask<00:00:46.590> is

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
the pieces that they are the mask is

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.790 
the pieces that they are the mask is
obviously<00:00:47.460> not<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.270> right<00:00:48.420> mask<00:00:48.719> because<00:00:49.230> the

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
obviously not the right mask because the

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.460 
obviously not the right mask because the
real<00:00:50.010> one<00:00:50.250> just<00:00:50.610> doesn't<00:00:50.789> exist<00:00:51.390> yet

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
real one just doesn't exist yet

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.050 
real one just doesn't exist yet
and<00:00:55.440> yeah<00:00:56.440> it's<00:00:56.590> for<00:00:56.740> the<00:00:56.860> audience<00:00:57.190> all<00:00:57.460> of

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.060 
and yeah it's for the audience all of

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.990 
and yeah it's for the audience all of
the<00:00:58.330> new<00:00:58.870> parts<00:00:59.320> don't<00:00:59.770> exist<00:01:00.310> yet<00:01:00.400> but<00:01:00.820> I

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
the new parts don't exist yet but I

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.380 
the new parts don't exist yet but I
think<00:01:01.060> that<00:01:01.570> this<00:01:02.020> is<00:01:02.370> nearly<00:01:03.370> perfect<00:01:04.210> it's

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
think that this is nearly perfect it's

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.860 
think that this is nearly perfect it's
not<00:01:04.570> entirely<00:01:05.110> perfect<00:01:05.710> I<00:01:06.220> do<00:01:07.060> think<00:01:07.510> that<00:01:07.570> the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
not entirely perfect I do think that the

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.810 
not entirely perfect I do think that the
shoulder<00:01:08.320> armor<00:01:08.590> pieces<00:01:08.800> are<00:01:09.130> supposed<00:01:09.460> to<00:01:09.580> be

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
shoulder armor pieces are supposed to be

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.160 
shoulder armor pieces are supposed to be
in<00:01:10.120> the<00:01:10.600> new<00:01:10.780> style<00:01:11.230> or<00:01:11.530> in<00:01:11.770> the<00:01:13.020> style<00:01:14.020> that

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
in the new style or in the style that

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.980 
in the new style or in the style that
was<00:01:14.560> shown<00:01:14.920> with<00:01:15.310> the<00:01:15.340> ultra<00:01:16.120> build<00:01:16.330> lists<00:01:16.810> of

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990

on<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.070> real<00:02:27.220> thing<00:02:28.980> now<00:02:29.980> it<00:02:30.670> was<00:02:30.880> a

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
on the real thing now it was a

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.420 
on the real thing now it was a
disappointment<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.840> see<00:02:32.080> that<00:02:32.350> chemo<00:02:32.950> is<00:02:33.130> not

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
disappointment to see that chemo is not

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.059 
disappointment to see that chemo is not
going<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:33.790> be<00:02:33.970> tight<00:02:34.299> subside

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
going to be tight subside

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.449 
going to be tight subside
I<00:02:35.129> mean<00:02:36.049> from<00:02:37.049> the<00:02:37.260> animation<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:38.159> kind<00:02:38.400> of

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
I mean from the animation it kind of

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.190 
I mean from the animation it kind of
looked<00:02:38.670> like<00:02:38.760> he<00:02:39.030> was<00:02:39.150> typing<00:02:39.599> sighs<00:02:39.780> and

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
looked like he was typing sighs and

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.489 
looked like he was typing sighs and
based<00:02:40.499> upon<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:41.280> fact<00:02:41.519> that<00:02:41.670> well<00:02:42.499> he's

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:43.499 
based upon the fact that well he's

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:46.699 
based upon the fact that well he's
supposed<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.069> be<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.999> reboot<00:02:45.599> version<00:02:46.439> of

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
supposed to be the reboot version of

supposed to be the reboot version of
Mata<00:02:47.489> Nui<00:02:47.700> from<00:02:48.389> the<00:02:48.599> first<00:02:49.109> generation<00:02:49.920> I

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
Mata Nui from the first generation I

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.550 
Mata Nui from the first generation I
would<00:02:51.239> really<00:02:51.480> expect<00:02:51.989> him<00:02:52.109> to<00:02:52.200> be<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:52.349> lot

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
would really expect him to be a lot

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.429 
would really expect him to be a lot
bigger<00:02:52.829> well<00:02:53.280> of<00:02:53.489> course<00:02:53.549> mata<00:02:54.420> nui<00:02:54.599> from<00:02:55.290> the

bigger well of course mata nui from the
original<00:02:56.250> run<00:02:56.579> was<00:02:57.060> not<00:02:57.540> a<00:02:57.569> Titan<00:02:58.260> while<00:02:58.769> fate

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
original run was not a Titan while fate

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.369 
original run was not a Titan while fate
they<00:02:59.790> did<00:03:00.090> give<00:03:00.299> him<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.510> Titan<00:03:00.900> release<00:03:01.169> in

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
they did give him a Titan release in

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.129 
they did give him a Titan release in
2009<00:03:02.250> but<00:03:02.579> the<00:03:02.730> original<00:03:02.909> version<00:03:03.359> of<00:03:03.750> Mata

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:04.139 
2009 but the original version of Mata

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:08.149 
2009 but the original version of Mata
Nui<00:03:04.169> was<00:03:05.069> just<00:03:05.819> about<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.150> size<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:07.500> TOA

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 
Nui was just about the size of a TOA

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.259 
Nui was just about the size of a TOA
ignite<00:03:08.819> guy<00:03:09.090> atoa<00:03:10.019> indica<00:03:10.709> aalto<00:03:11.669> api<00:03:12.060> cool

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.970 
ignite guy atoa indica aalto api cool
about<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:12.810> be<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.109> same<00:03:13.290> size<00:03:14.930> and<00:03:15.980> actually

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
about to be the same size and actually

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.309 
about to be the same size and actually
that<00:03:17.669> is<00:03:17.879> understandable<00:03:18.329> considering<00:03:18.989> that

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
that is understandable considering that

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.849 
that is understandable considering that
he<00:03:19.650> is<00:03:19.919> not<00:03:20.340> in<00:03:20.760> his<00:03:21.359> original<00:03:21.510> state<00:03:22.349> and<00:03:22.680> that

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
he is not in his original state and that

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.699 
he is not in his original state and that
he<00:03:23.099> had<00:03:23.400> been<00:03:23.430> weakened<00:03:24.120> but<00:03:24.299> for<00:03:24.930> Teemu<00:03:25.500> i

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
he had been weakened but for Teemu i

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.439 
he had been weakened but for Teemu i
just<00:03:26.129> do<00:03:26.310> not<00:03:26.340> think<00:03:26.790> that<00:03:26.849> this<00:03:27.090> is<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.419> right

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:27.449 
just do not think that this is the right

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:29.689 
just do not think that this is the right
size<00:03:27.870> for<00:03:27.900> him<00:03:28.379> that's<00:03:29.010> just<00:03:29.370> what<00:03:29.489> i<00:03:29.609> am

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:29.699 
size for him that's just what i am

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:33.679 
size for him that's just what i am
saying<00:03:30.090> i<00:03:30.739> might<00:03:31.739> get<00:03:32.069> used<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.609> the<00:03:32.760> idea<00:03:32.939> by

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:33.689 
saying i might get used to the idea by

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:37.009 
saying i might get used to the idea by
the<00:03:33.750> time<00:03:34.199> that<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.650> set<00:03:34.889> is<00:03:35.189> released<00:03:36.019> just

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
the time that the set is released just

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.890 
the time that the set is released just
saying<00:03:37.349> i<00:03:37.650> just<00:03:38.189> do<00:03:38.400> not<00:03:38.430> think<00:03:39.000> that<00:03:39.120> is<00:03:39.479> right

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
saying i just do not think that is right

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.979 
saying i just do not think that is right

the<00:03:56.900> protector<00:03:57.650> maybe<00:03:58.550> there's<00:03:58.940> an

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
the protector maybe there's an

the protector maybe there's an
explanation<00:03:59.330> as<00:03:59.900> to<00:03:59.989> why<00:04:00.230> he<00:04:00.560> is<00:04:00.770> the<00:04:01.280> size<00:04:01.550> of

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
explanation as to why he is the size of

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.110 
explanation as to why he is the size of
her<00:04:01.880> protector<00:04:02.510> in<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:02.870> set<00:04:03.110> like<00:04:03.380> maybe<00:04:04.120> when

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
her protector in the set like maybe when

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.870 
her protector in the set like maybe when
the<00:04:05.300> mask<00:04:05.540> was<00:04:05.989> taken<00:04:06.530> off<00:04:06.680> like<00:04:07.280> maybe<00:04:07.640> the

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
the mask was taken off like maybe the

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.940 
the mask was taken off like maybe the
blast<00:04:08.150> from<00:04:08.420> the<00:04:08.630> mask<00:04:08.930> of<00:04:09.319> ultimate<00:04:09.920> power

maybe<00:04:10.580> just<00:04:10.940> weakened<00:04:11.540> him<00:04:11.780> and<00:04:12.050> just<00:04:12.530> brought

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
maybe just weakened him and just brought

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.680 
maybe just weakened him and just brought
him<00:04:12.920> to<00:04:12.950> this<00:04:13.310> size<00:04:13.670> of<00:04:13.910> that<00:04:14.060> maybe<00:04:14.360> he

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
him to this size of that maybe he

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.780 
him to this size of that maybe he
originally<00:04:15.380> was<00:04:15.650> the<00:04:16.639> size<00:04:16.940> of<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:17.329> Titan

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
originally was the size of the Titan

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.280 
originally was the size of the Titan
maybe<00:04:19.790> they<00:04:20.180> will<00:04:20.329> come<00:04:20.540> up<00:04:20.690> with<00:04:20.840> that<00:04:21.019> for

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
maybe they will come up with that for

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.240 
maybe they will come up with that for
the<00:04:21.320> story<00:04:21.769> later<00:04:22.280> on<00:04:22.460> though<00:04:23.150> in<00:04:23.480> the

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
the story later on though in the

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.830 
the story later on though in the
animation<00:04:25.250> that<00:04:25.700> shows<00:04:25.730> the<00:04:26.150> protectors

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
animation that shows the protectors

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.640 
animation that shows the protectors
putting<00:04:27.650> a<00:04:27.830> chemo<00:04:28.310> into<00:04:28.790> a<00:04:28.820> cockpit<00:04:29.330> it<00:04:30.290> really

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
putting a chemo into a cockpit it really

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.740 
putting a chemo into a cockpit it really
did<00:04:30.860> look<00:04:30.889> like<00:04:31.130> he<00:04:31.370> was<00:04:31.580> a<00:04:31.729> bit<00:04:32.030> bigger<00:04:32.419> at

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
did look like he was a bit bigger at

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.870 
did look like he was a bit bigger at
least<00:04:32.990> as<00:04:33.229> far<00:04:33.740> as<00:04:33.919> I<00:04:34.070> remember<00:04:34.100> it<00:04:34.639> though

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
least as far as I remember it though

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.300 
least as far as I remember it though
maybe<00:04:35.240> if<00:04:35.450> I<00:04:35.600> see<00:04:35.930> it<00:04:35.960> again<00:04:36.229> it<00:04:36.770> may<00:04:36.889> turn<00:04:36.950> out

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
maybe if I see it again it may turn out

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.900 
maybe if I see it again it may turn out
to<00:04:37.370> be<00:04:37.850> that<00:04:38.300> he<00:04:38.450> is<00:04:38.660> the<00:04:39.080> same<00:04:39.320> size<00:04:39.620> but<00:04:40.040> I'm

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
to be that he is the same size but I'm

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.120 
to be that he is the same size but I'm
just<00:04:41.150> saying<00:04:41.479> I<00:04:41.720> think<00:04:41.930> that<00:04:42.470> he<00:04:43.100> should

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
just saying I think that he should

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.740 
just saying I think that he should
deserve<00:04:43.700> a<00:04:44.060> lot<00:04:44.360> more<00:04:44.389> parts<00:04:45.290> a<00:04:45.560> lot<00:04:46.130> more

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
deserve a lot more parts a lot more

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.270 
deserve a lot more parts a lot more
bigness<00:04:50.290> yeah<00:04:51.290> I<00:04:51.320> know<00:04:51.440> that<00:04:51.860> people<00:04:52.040> are

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
bigness yeah I know that people are

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.100 
bigness yeah I know that people are
probably<00:04:52.760> disappointed<00:04:53.600> that<00:04:53.780> he's<00:04:53.960> not

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
probably disappointed that he's not

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.080 
probably disappointed that he's not
going<00:04:54.440> to<00:04:54.500> be<00:04:54.560> wearing<00:04:55.040> the<00:04:55.190> mask<00:04:55.460> of<00:04:55.700> creation

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
going to be wearing the mask of creation

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.360 
going to be wearing the mask of creation
and<00:04:56.630> set<00:04:56.960> but<00:04:57.169> i<00:04:57.320> think<00:04:57.650> that<00:04:57.860> the<00:04:57.979> mask<00:04:58.190> of

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
and set but i think that the mask of

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.610 
and set but i think that the mask of
creation<00:04:58.550> is<00:04:59.090> going<00:04:59.570> to<00:04:59.690> be<00:04:59.780> in<00:04:59.900> the<00:05:00.050> sad<00:05:00.350> and

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
creation is going to be in the sad and

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.210 
creation is going to be in the sad and
fans<00:05:00.890> can<00:05:01.250> switch<00:05:01.700> out<00:05:01.910> the<00:05:02.090> masks

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
fans can switch out the masks

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.360 
fans can switch out the masks
if<00:05:03.550> they<00:05:04.150> want<00:05:04.420> to<00:05:04.510> I<00:05:04.900> just<00:05:05.260> may<00:05:05.470> do<00:05:05.530> that<00:05:05.980> once

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
if they want to I just may do that once

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.090 
if they want to I just may do that once
