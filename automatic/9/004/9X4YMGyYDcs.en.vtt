alright there's our image you can see
the<00:00:53.000> circle<00:00:53.720> of<00:00:53.809> the<00:00:53.930> Sun<00:00:54.140> with<00:00:54.470> the<00:00:54.500> little

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:54.830 
the circle of the Sun with the little

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.460 
the circle of the Sun with the little
piece<00:00:55.089> basically<00:00:56.089> cut<00:00:56.720> out<00:00:56.900> where<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.260> moon

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 
piece basically cut out where the moon

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.130 
piece basically cut out where the moon
is<00:00:57.500> passing<00:00:58.190> in<00:00:58.309> front<00:00:58.430> of<00:00:58.580> the<00:00:58.699> Sun<00:00:58.909> now<00:00:59.809> if<00:01:00.019> I

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
is passing in front of the Sun now if I

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.140 
is passing in front of the Sun now if I
move<00:01:00.290> the<00:01:00.470> paper<00:01:00.650> further<00:01:01.159> away<00:01:01.580> that<00:01:01.610> should

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.150 
move the paper further away that should

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.079 
move the paper further away that should
get<00:01:02.299> bigger<00:01:02.540> but<00:01:02.989> a<00:01:03.049> little<00:01:03.229> bit<00:01:03.350> fainter<00:01:04.089> if

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
get bigger but a little bit fainter if

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.250 
get bigger but a little bit fainter if
we<00:01:05.239> come<00:01:05.420> down<00:01:05.449> here<00:01:05.740> smaller<00:01:06.740> but<00:01:07.040> brighter

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
we come down here smaller but brighter

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.780 
we come down here smaller but brighter
but<00:01:09.260> without<00:01:09.560> looking<00:01:09.950> at<00:01:10.100> the<00:01:10.520> Sun<00:01:10.760> and

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
but without looking at the Sun and

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.810 
but without looking at the Sun and
damaging<00:01:11.510> your<00:01:11.600> eyes<00:01:11.780> this<00:01:12.320> is<00:01:12.380> a<00:01:12.560> way<00:01:12.799> you<00:01:13.610> can

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
damaging your eyes this is a way you can

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.139 
damaging your eyes this is a way you can
watch<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:14.510> solar<00:01:14.780> eclipse<00:01:15.759> now<00:01:16.759> we<00:01:16.820> have<00:01:17.030> the

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
watch the solar eclipse now we have the

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.510 
watch the solar eclipse now we have the
binocular<00:01:17.659> and<00:01:17.689> you<00:01:17.960> can<00:01:18.170> see<00:01:18.439> well<00:01:18.920> briefly

binocular and you can see well briefly

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.660 
binocular and you can see well briefly
here<00:01:19.969> there<00:01:20.840> is<00:01:21.229> the<00:01:21.710> solar<00:01:21.950> eclipse<00:01:22.130> there's

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
here there is the solar eclipse there's

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.370 
here there is the solar eclipse there's
a<00:01:22.759> nice<00:01:22.969> view<00:01:23.359> of<00:01:23.420> the<00:01:23.750> Sun<00:01:24.020> and<00:01:24.289> you<00:01:24.350> can

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
a nice view of the Sun and you can

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.429 
a nice view of the Sun and you can
actually<00:01:24.680> see<00:01:25.219> some<00:01:25.780> sunspots<00:01:26.780> the<00:01:27.109> black

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
actually see some sunspots the black

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.760 
actually see some sunspots the black
spots<00:01:27.829> there<00:01:28.189> on<00:01:28.399> the<00:01:28.609> Sun<00:01:28.850> are<00:01:29.770> cooler

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
spots there on the Sun are cooler

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.749 
spots there on the Sun are cooler
temperature<00:01:32.649> eruptions<00:01:33.649> of<00:01:33.799> gas<00:01:34.009> that<00:01:34.490> look

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
temperature eruptions of gas that look

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:36.219 
temperature eruptions of gas that look
dark<00:01:35.030> against<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:35.509> bright<00:01:35.630> surface<00:01:36.020> of<00:01:36.170> the

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
dark against the bright surface of the

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.219 
dark against the bright surface of the
Sun<00:01:36.409> so<00:01:36.500> you<00:01:36.560> actually<00:01:36.740> seen<00:01:37.039> sunspots<00:01:37.729> and

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
Sun so you actually seen sunspots and

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.099 
Sun so you actually seen sunspots and
the<00:01:39.229> partial<00:01:40.189> solar<00:01:40.609> eclipse<00:01:40.759> all<00:01:41.719> at<00:01:41.990> the

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:42.109 
the partial solar eclipse all at the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:47.770 
the partial solar eclipse all at the
same<00:01:42.289> time<00:01:42.560> very<00:01:43.899> nice<00:01:45.969> okay<00:01:46.969> now<00:01:47.179> never<00:01:47.509> look

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
same time very nice okay now never look

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.169 
same time very nice okay now never look
at<00:01:47.929> the<00:01:48.049> Sun<00:01:48.079> unless<00:01:48.950> you<00:01:49.159> have<00:01:49.369> a<00:01:49.399> proper
