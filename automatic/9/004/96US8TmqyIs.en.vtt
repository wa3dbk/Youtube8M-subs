00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.970
 hello and welcome to the blog point fr for a vigil the little village and 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.770
 on the losson wrinkles youth takes place three 2010 where we are in 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.700
 this moment 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.830
 behind me is the famous new carrick was announced at the 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.910
 conference a roland sentence obviously visually it's really 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.660
 beautiful it's probably even one of the most beautiful games I've seen for the 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.370
 moment is to tell you in any case this style of fabrics 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.650
 very very 2d malaga chelsea and india like that is really really very 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.850
 successful it takes close in the animations and then if behind me you 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.200
 have people who are playing co-ops that are played little 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.170
 fectively to two players so it's pretty classic 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.970
 that is to say with the wiimote horizontally as for a game of 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.240
 traditional platforms we play with the cross buttons one to attack not 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.260
 to jump 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.910
 and all the rest and the creativity of the levels and the and the design of this everything 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.370
 new 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.730
 so we'll be able to catch buttons from the closures 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.140
 lightning change a little bit and influenced like that the sets for 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.680
 discover things passed behind the stuffs 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.980
 esther terraz and two-player both years can catch each other 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.630
 and get started as objects or even merged to form a time that 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.200
 is able to beat a boss we could also see including 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.200
 a dragon boss to these gorgeous wholly made in yarn like that 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.760
 violaines valeo was aiming the mans it's very successful there is a game pretty little 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.260
 gameplay that is presented here you have to pick up buttons for example 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.380
 to other things like that and and the levels seem pretty common on 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.160
 will be able to chain them quickly it will be necessary to see a little more before 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.070
 the whole structure of the game that is not unveiled here just these 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.670
 cooperative parties and then how it goes is a little bit solo 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.750
 what exactly are the same levels 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.660
 to the point of talking about it very very soon anyway for this 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.450
 real mans to sion where there is one of the most beautiful games in 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.210
