00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
Punk just pretty much left raw he like

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.370 
Punk just pretty much left raw he like
two<00:00:35.760> hours<00:00:36.030> before<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.420> match<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:37.079> show

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
two hours before the match the show

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.080 
two hours before the match the show
actually<00:00:37.559> started<00:00:38.129> he<00:00:38.190> just<00:00:38.430> grabbed<00:00:38.940> his

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
actually started he just grabbed his

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.250 
actually started he just grabbed his
things<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.600> left<00:00:39.840> now<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:41.899> thought<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.079> he

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
things and left now I thought that he

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.110 
things and left now I thought that he
might<00:00:43.350> have<00:00:43.469> been<00:00:43.559> angry<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.250> left<00:00:44.280> because

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
might have been angry and left because

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.150 
might have been angry and left because
you<00:00:45.149> know<00:00:45.480> he<00:00:46.260> just<00:00:46.350> didn't<00:00:46.680> feel<00:00:46.860> up<00:00:46.890> that

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
you know he just didn't feel up that

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.740 
you know he just didn't feel up that
night<00:00:47.340> but<00:00:47.850> apparently<00:00:48.270> he<00:00:48.360> just<00:00:48.539> actually

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
night but apparently he just actually

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.990 
night but apparently he just actually
did<00:00:49.230> quit<00:00:49.710> like<00:00:50.280> leave<00:00:50.820> now<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.500> like<00:00:53.000> 99%

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
did quit like leave now this is like 99%

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.229 
did quit like leave now this is like 99%
sure<00:00:54.079> that<00:00:55.079> he<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.430> gone<00:00:57.199> okay<00:00:58.699> he<00:00:59.699> was<00:00:59.969> not

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.599 
sure that he is gone okay he was not
really<00:01:00.870> i<00:01:01.109> think<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.829> main<00:01:02.010> reason<00:01:02.039> why<00:01:02.430> he

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
really i think the main reason why he

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.420 
really i think the main reason why he
left<00:01:02.820> was<00:01:03.059> he<00:01:03.600> wasn't<00:01:03.989> really<00:01:04.199> down<00:01:04.589> with<00:01:04.619> how

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
left was he wasn't really down with how

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.730 
left was he wasn't really down with how
