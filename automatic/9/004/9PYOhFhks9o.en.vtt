00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
now you're going back to the energy

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.250 
now you're going back to the energy
energy<00:00:57.750> rings<00:00:58.940> no<00:00:59.940> I'm<00:01:00.210> gonna<00:01:00.390> try<00:01:00.629> every

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
energy rings no I'm gonna try every

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.200 
energy rings no I'm gonna try every
entering<00:01:01.770> here<00:01:02.039> on<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:03.510> vision<00:01:04.320> wheel<00:01:05.210> it's

the grand cetus

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.370 
the grand cetus
energy<00:01:09.240> ring<00:01:09.450> fits<00:01:10.350> pretty<00:01:10.950> well<00:01:11.990> that<00:01:12.990> kind

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
energy ring fits pretty well that kind

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
energy ring fits pretty well that kind
of<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.890> don't<00:01:14.310> remember<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.880> name<00:01:15.979> come<00:01:16.979> on<00:01:17.159> go

like attack type so I will be taking
this<00:01:49.920> low<00:01:51.380> spin<00:01:52.380> track<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.979> believe<00:01:53.670> some<00:01:54.560> 100

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
this low spin track I believe some 100

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.950 
this low spin track I believe some 100
yeah<00:01:56.189> 100<00:01:57.020> so<00:01:58.020> we're<00:01:59.119> okay<00:02:00.119> now<00:02:00.149> for<00:02:00.509> the

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
bottom we have here this kind of

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.469 
bottom we have here this kind of
abilities<00:02:06.780> defense<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.619> this<00:02:08.479> actually

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
abilities defense and this actually

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.030 
abilities defense and this actually
