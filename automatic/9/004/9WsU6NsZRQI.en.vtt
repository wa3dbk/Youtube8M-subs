00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:46.530
 last until November 1 probably yes even 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:50.039
 so that is, on November 1, I will sum up 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.390
 this draw and the most important thing is that 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.530
 need to do to participate 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.250
 in the competition 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.710
 these are simple things the first is to subscribe 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.780
 on my YouTube channel is a must 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.420
 condition without this, I donâ€™t give the tablet 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.119
 I will play you if you win 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.350
 then I will not give you this tablet if you 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.570
 not subscribed to my channel 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.390
 the second is to leave as much as you like 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.250
 comments on this video write something 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.820
 there are as many comments as possible 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.130
 video 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.140
 no matter how much you leave there 100 in 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.990
 you will not leave the day important 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.970
 leave comments and I will be 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.159
 to choose 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.710
 who's the winner with some 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.000
 sites or by the way on yutyube very 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.079
 there was a useful thing 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.090
 the most active users of the channel itself 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.200
 act that is those people who put 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.299
 most likes more 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.430
 comment there somehow discuss something they 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.710
 Immediately I have displayed so I can 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.720
 and give the tablet to one of the most 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.490
 active users so I still 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.149
 I'll think about it, but most likely we naturally 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:54.509
 play it all through random.org 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.770

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.130
 of course participate in this competition 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.869
 because the prize is quite expensive it 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.540
 samsung galaxy tab even smart 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.920
 yuzany but still the winner if you 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.160

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.300
 somewhere and I will give it to you personally 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.380
 the tablet is not a problem anywhere there 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.480
 intersect 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.090
 if you live there in Russia or in 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.099
 another country started this all mail and 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.280
 mail will be paid most likely 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.110
 just by you, because if the mail 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.360
 should not be the norm that himself and crying 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.350
