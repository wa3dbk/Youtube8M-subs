00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
course I don't want to just trust the

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.309 
course I don't want to just trust the
translation<00:02:18.330> so<00:02:18.480> I<00:02:18.540> went<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.110> other

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
translation so I went to the other

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.410 
translation so I went to the other
translation<00:02:20.220> which<00:02:20.849> I'll<00:02:21.000> show<00:02:21.180> you<00:02:21.239> in<00:02:21.390> a

minute

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.410 

so<00:02:32.050> what<00:02:32.200> I<00:02:32.260> did<00:02:32.470> is<00:02:32.680> I<00:02:32.800> got<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:33.700> original

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
so what I did is I got the original

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.900 
so what I did is I got the original
document<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.170> I<00:02:35.290> sent<00:02:35.590> it<00:02:35.769> to<00:02:35.800> my<00:02:36.160> team<00:02:36.550> who

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
document and I sent it to my team who

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:44.470 
document and I sent it to my team who
had<00:02:37.030> a<00:02:37.060> quick<00:02:37.330> look<00:02:37.360> over

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.750 

five<00:02:45.020> Donny's<00:02:45.349> broken<00:02:45.770> down<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.010> basics<00:02:46.610> of

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
five Donny's broken down the basics of

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:55.850 
five Donny's broken down the basics of
the<00:02:47.270> sword<00:02:47.569> court<00:02:47.840> here

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.220 

now<00:02:56.860> this<00:02:57.189> book<00:02:57.430> is<00:02:57.489> said<00:02:57.909> to<00:02:58.090> be<00:02:58.299> written<00:02:59.079> by

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
now this book is said to be written by

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.949 
now this book is said to be written by
Yamamoto<00:03:00.040> kansuke<00:03:00.459> but<00:03:00.760> it<00:03:00.909> wasn't<00:03:01.420> guys<00:03:01.599> it

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
Yamamoto kansuke but it wasn't guys it

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.990 
Yamamoto kansuke but it wasn't guys it
was<00:03:02.200> not<00:03:02.500> written<00:03:02.709> by<00:03:02.950> Yamamoto<00:03:03.430> conjugate

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
was not written by Yamamoto conjugate

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.059 
was not written by Yamamoto conjugate
the<00:03:04.360> reason<00:03:04.840> for<00:03:05.019> this<00:03:05.110> is<00:03:05.290> because<00:03:05.319> in<00:03:05.799> this

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
the reason for this is because in this

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.910 
the reason for this is because in this
book<00:03:06.370> it<00:03:06.579> says<00:03:06.879> talks<00:03:07.720> about<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.049> coal<00:03:08.379> yo<00:03:08.590> gun

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
book it says talks about the coal yo gun

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.309 
book it says talks about the coal yo gun
cam<00:03:09.159> now<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:09.549> choreo<00:03:10.090> gun<00:03:10.329> can<00:03:10.569> is<00:03:10.689> a<00:03:10.720> document

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
cam now the choreo gun can is a document

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.589 
cam now the choreo gun can is a document
that<00:03:11.379> was<00:03:11.680> written<00:03:12.459> after<00:03:12.790> yamamoto

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
that was written after yamamoto

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.229 
that was written after yamamoto
conjugate<00:03:14.170> died<00:03:14.349> so<00:03:14.769> unless<00:03:15.159> that<00:03:15.220> was<00:03:15.430> edited

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
conjugate died so unless that was edited

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.470 
conjugate died so unless that was edited
later<00:03:17.400> it's<00:03:18.400> impossible<00:03:19.000> for<00:03:19.120> it<00:03:19.150> to<00:03:19.239> be<00:03:19.329> in

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
later it's impossible for it to be in

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.440 
later it's impossible for it to be in
him<00:03:19.689> but<00:03:20.230> I<00:03:20.260> did<00:03:20.650> think<00:03:20.950> that<00:03:21.069> fujibayashi<00:03:21.700> who

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
him but I did think that fujibayashi who

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.479 
him but I did think that fujibayashi who
wrote<00:03:22.689> book<00:03:22.959> of<00:03:23.140> the<00:03:23.260> ninja<00:03:23.650> read<00:03:24.250> this

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
wrote book of the ninja read this

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:25.979 
wrote book of the ninja read this
because<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:25.000> think<00:03:25.060> there's<00:03:25.420> a<00:03:25.480> section<00:03:25.900> of

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
because I think there's a section of

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.959 
because I think there's a section of
that<00:03:26.049> in<00:03:26.319> the<00:03:26.409> ban<00:03:26.620> Sun<00:03:26.920> shoot

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:33.439 
which something I'll go into another

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:35.440 
which something I'll go into another

the samurai oh well I used to think I

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.440 
the samurai oh well I used to think I
know<00:06:05.870> he's<00:06:06.440> not<00:06:06.710> always<00:06:06.920> correct<00:06:07.550> we<00:06:08.420> have

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450 
know he's not always correct we have

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.590 
know he's not always correct we have
this<00:06:08.840> mash<00:06:09.170> where<00:06:09.380> the<00:06:09.470> Edo<00:06:09.650> period<00:06:09.940> just<00:06:10.940> for

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600 
this mash where the Edo period just for

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.020 
this mash where the Edo period just for
the<00:06:11.720> later<00:06:12.020> Edo<00:06:12.500> period<00:06:12.530> just<00:06:13.190> filters<00:06:13.850> out

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.030 
the later Edo period just filters out

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.300 
the later Edo period just filters out
and<00:06:14.300> and<00:06:14.480> deletes<00:06:14.900> the<00:06:15.200> stuff<00:06:15.500> from<00:06:15.650> before<00:06:16.130> it

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310 
and and deletes the stuff from before it

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.010 
and and deletes the stuff from before it
because<00:06:16.550> everything<00:06:17.030> gets<00:06:17.270> regimented<00:06:17.990> and

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
because everything gets regimented and

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.010 
because everything gets regimented and
for<00:06:18.440> formulaic<00:06:19.340> so<00:06:19.940> it<00:06:20.060> means<00:06:20.300> that<00:06:20.570> for<00:06:20.870> me

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
for formulaic so it means that for me

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.910 
for formulaic so it means that for me
that<00:06:21.290> one<00:06:22.030> document<00:06:23.030> on<00:06:23.240> its<00:06:23.660> own<00:06:23.930> says<00:06:24.710> that

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:24.920

that one document on its own says that
anybody<00:06:25.370> who<00:06:25.490> says<00:06:25.730> you<00:06:25.880> must<00:06:26.120> draw<00:06:26.390> in<00:06:26.660> this

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:26.840 
anybody who says you must draw in this

to<00:06:37.310> the<00:06:37.610> right<00:06:37.850> yeah<00:06:38.840> so<00:06:39.320> for<00:06:39.950> me<00:06:40.220> this<00:06:41.180> idea

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:41.630 
to the right yeah so for me this idea

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.360 
to the right yeah so for me this idea
everybody<00:06:42.080> does<00:06:42.440> this<00:06:42.590> one<00:06:42.860> drawer<00:06:43.160> in<00:06:43.340> the

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:43.370 
everybody does this one drawer in the

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.010 
everybody does this one drawer in the
same<00:06:43.670> way<00:06:43.910> and<00:06:44.090> it's<00:06:44.210> always<00:06:44.390> very<00:06:44.660> very

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020 
same way and it's always very very

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.470 
same way and it's always very very
formulaic<00:06:45.860> and<00:06:46.010> static<00:06:46.490> he's<00:06:46.910> just<00:06:47.150> not<00:06:47.300> good

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:47.480 
formulaic and static he's just not good

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.000 
formulaic and static he's just not good
enough<00:06:47.510> for<00:06:47.750> me<00:06:47.840> it<00:06:47.960> doesn't<00:06:48.200> explain<00:06:48.680> what's

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.010 
enough for me it doesn't explain what's

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.860 
enough for me it doesn't explain what's
actually<00:06:49.220> going<00:06:49.610> on<00:06:49.790> because<00:06:50.450> you've<00:06:50.570> got<00:06:50.750> to

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:50.870 
actually going on because you've got to

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.100 
actually going on because you've got to
look<00:06:51.050> at<00:06:51.200> yeah<00:06:51.440> I<00:06:51.500> probably<00:06:52.070> now<00:06:52.900> properly<00:06:53.900> he

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.110 
look at yeah I probably now properly he

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.070 
look at yeah I probably now properly he
is<00:06:54.650> actually<00:06:54.860> quick<00:06:55.550> response<00:06:56.150> actions<00:06:56.420> so

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080 
is actually quick response actions so

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.050 
is actually quick response actions so
usually<00:06:57.860> when<00:06:57.980> you<00:06:58.070> come<00:06:58.250> across<00:06:58.340> an<00:06:58.640> enemy<00:06:58.940> on

00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.060 
usually when you come across an enemy on

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.720 
usually when you come across an enemy on
you're<00:06:59.270> on<00:06:59.420> a<00:06:59.450> mission<00:07:00.260> of<00:07:00.500> vendetta<00:07:01.040> then

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:01.730 
you're on a mission of vendetta then
