00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
kind of basic glide around the world so

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.120 
kind of basic glide around the world so
we're<00:01:52.690> all<00:01:52.810> a<00:01:52.840> bit<00:01:52.990> verticality<00:01:53.530> it's<00:01:53.800> back<00:01:53.979> in

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
we're all a bit verticality it's back in

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.109 
we're all a bit verticality it's back in
a<00:01:54.190> big<00:01:54.340> way<00:01:54.369> you've<00:01:54.640> got<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:54.850> edge<00:01:54.940> of<00:01:54.970> the

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
a big way you've got the edge of the

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:56.550 
a big way you've got the edge of the
tower<00:01:55.300> over<00:01:55.509> there<00:01:55.630> you<00:01:55.810> can<00:01:55.960> hope<00:01:56.140> Terra<00:01:56.380> here

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
tower over there you can hope Terra here

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.800 
tower over there you can hope Terra here
which<00:01:56.680> is<00:01:56.770> actually<00:01:56.890> higher<00:01:57.190> and<00:01:57.940> and<00:01:58.660> then

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
which is actually higher and and then

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.359 
which is actually higher and and then
these<00:01:59.140> towers<00:01:59.530> also<00:01:59.830> grow<00:02:00.040> and<00:02:00.250> more

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
these towers also grow and more

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:01.800 
these towers also grow and more
efficiently<00:02:00.729> during<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.030> game<00:02:01.180> so<00:02:01.210> not<00:02:01.690> to

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
efficiently during the game so not to

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.330 
efficiently during the game so not to
tell<00:02:01.990> you<00:02:02.050> about<00:02:02.200> that<00:02:02.259> how<00:02:02.530> that<00:02:02.890> happens

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
tell you about that how that happens

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.920 
tell you about that how that happens
that's<00:02:03.490> where<00:02:03.610> players<00:02:03.789> to<00:02:03.970> discover<00:02:04.360> but

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
that's where players to discover but

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.080 
that's where players to discover but
we've<00:02:05.080> got<00:02:05.259> things<00:02:05.500> like<00:02:05.740> wingsuit<00:02:06.490> stone

rings and so all the toybox lmc expected

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.020 
rings and so all the toybox lmc expected
a<00:02:10.390> crackdown<00:02:10.570> are<00:02:10.840> back<00:02:10.989> in<00:02:11.140> a<00:02:11.230> big<00:02:11.410> scale<00:02:12.030> and

like what have you improved on and I
think<00:02:31.540> one<00:02:32.140> of<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.350> things<00:02:32.410> we<00:02:32.709> heard<00:02:32.890> from

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
think one of the things we heard from

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.490 
think one of the things we heard from
the<00:02:33.100> fans<00:02:33.340> was<00:02:33.610> that<00:02:33.880> you<00:02:34.420> know<00:02:34.510> we<00:02:35.230> didn't

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
the fans was that you know we didn't

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.259 
the fans was that you know we didn't
have<00:02:35.590> a<00:02:35.620> story<00:02:35.920> and<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.489> way<00:02:36.580> we<00:02:36.760> take<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.120> is

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
have a story and the way we take that is

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.460 
have a story and the way we take that is
actually<00:02:37.510> we<00:02:37.570> did<00:02:37.750> of<00:02:37.840> a<00:02:37.900> story<00:02:38.140> we<00:02:38.290> just

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
actually we did of a story we just

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.870 
actually we did of a story we just
didn't<00:02:38.709> tell<00:02:38.830> us<00:02:38.890> you<00:02:39.220> know<00:02:39.519> we<00:02:39.610> just<00:02:39.760> did<00:02:39.850> a

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
didn't tell us you know we just did a

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.520 
didn't tell us you know we just did a
crap<00:02:40.090> job<00:02:40.120> at<00:02:40.390> Hamlet<00:02:40.660> but<00:02:40.780> we're<00:02:41.110> not<00:02:41.200> a<00:02:41.230> story

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
crap job at Hamlet but we're not a story

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.140 
crap job at Hamlet but we're not a story
based<00:02:41.709> game<00:02:42.010> so<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.400> way<00:02:42.489> we<00:02:42.610> wants<00:02:42.850> to<00:02:42.940> answer

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
based game so the way we wants to answer

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.180 
based game so the way we wants to answer
that<00:02:43.239> would<00:02:43.360> give<00:02:43.510> people<00:02:44.049> a<00:02:44.230> facility<00:02:45.160> to

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
that would give people a facility to

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.400 
that would give people a facility to
explore<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:45.880> story<00:02:46.090> in<00:02:46.330> their<00:02:46.900> way<00:02:47.019> so<00:02:47.079> we've

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
explore the story in their way so we've

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.930 
explore the story in their way so we've
used<00:02:47.590> orbs<00:02:47.980> rep<00:02:48.160> mechanics<00:02:48.579> you've<00:02:48.760> now<00:02:48.910> got

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
used orbs rep mechanics you've now got

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.970 
used orbs rep mechanics you've now got
story<00:02:49.329> orbs<00:02:49.690> as<00:02:49.810> well<00:02:49.989> and<00:02:50.200> so<00:02:50.799> you<00:02:50.860> can

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
story orbs as well and so you can

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.530 
story orbs as well and so you can
collect<00:02:51.100> those<00:02:51.340> stores<00:02:51.850> and<00:02:52.060> discover<00:02:52.360> more

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
collect those stores and discover more

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.479 
collect those stores and discover more

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
about the scaling of that if I'm a

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.960 
about the scaling of that if I'm a
little<00:06:04.260> one<00:06:04.410> your<00:06:04.680> level<00:06:04.920> three<00:06:05.340> how<00:06:05.820> does

little one your level three how does

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.790 
little one your level three how does
that<00:06:06.000> scale<00:06:06.330> how<00:06:06.510> do<00:06:06.570> I<00:06:06.660> not<00:06:06.870> do<00:06:07.230> i<00:06:07.290> do<00:06:07.470> I<00:06:07.500> throw

that scale how do I not do i do I throw

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.020 
that scale how do I not do i do I throw
off<00:06:07.950> the<00:06:08.070> dance<00:06:08.250> of<00:06:08.430> your<00:06:08.550> missions<00:06:08.880> how's

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
off the dance of your missions how's

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
that all gonna work we don't dynamically

somebody<00:06:15.930> wants<00:06:16.350> they<00:06:16.650> die<00:06:16.830> if<00:06:17.220> all<00:06:17.520> of<00:06:17.550> a

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:17.669 
somebody wants they die if all of a

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.070 
somebody wants they die if all of a
sudden<00:06:17.910> you<00:06:17.970> shoot<00:06:18.150> somebody<00:06:18.360> wants<00:06:18.780> and<00:06:18.990> they

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
sudden you shoot somebody wants and they

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.500 
sudden you shoot somebody wants and they
don't<00:06:19.200> die<00:06:19.410> no<00:06:20.190> messing<00:06:21.180> with<00:06:21.300> the<00:06:21.360> players

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:21.510 
don't die no messing with the players

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.990 
don't die no messing with the players
perception<00:06:22.080> so<00:06:22.230> the<00:06:22.770> game<00:06:22.919> doesn't<00:06:23.100> scale<00:06:23.400> at

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 
perception so the game doesn't scale at

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.700 
perception so the game doesn't scale at
that<00:06:24.180> stage<00:06:24.450> but<00:06:24.660> we<00:06:24.750> have<00:06:24.930> a<00:06:25.200> number<00:06:25.590> of

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
that stage but we have a number of

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.440 
that stage but we have a number of
difficulty<00:06:26.220> levels<00:06:26.520> so<00:06:27.000> depending<00:06:27.330> on<00:06:27.390> how

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:27.450 
difficulty levels so depending on how

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:28.820 
difficulty levels so depending on how
you<00:06:27.510> start<00:06:27.750> the<00:06:27.840> game<00:06:28.050> with<00:06:28.080> us<00:06:28.380> that's

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
you start the game with us that's

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.200 
you start the game with us that's
difficult<00:06:29.010> to<00:06:29.220> you<00:06:29.400> okay<00:06:29.700> that<00:06:29.970> makes<00:06:30.000> sense

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
difficult to you okay that makes sense

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.210 
difficult to you okay that makes sense
and<00:06:30.510> then<00:06:30.630> let's<00:06:30.780> talk<00:06:30.960> about<00:06:31.110> i<00:06:31.230> believe<00:06:32.070> it

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:32.220 
and then let's talk about i believe it

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.130 
and then let's talk about i believe it
was<00:06:32.280> maybe<00:06:32.669> rocket<00:06:32.970> AG<00:06:33.270> is<00:06:33.570> what<00:06:33.840> we<00:06:33.930> were

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:34.140 
was maybe rocket AG is what we were

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.230 
was maybe rocket AG is what we were
taught<00:06:34.440> in<00:06:34.620> impacts<00:06:35.550> let's<00:06:35.760> talk<00:06:35.910> about<00:06:36.030> that

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
taught in impacts let's talk about that

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.550 
taught in impacts let's talk about that
particular<00:06:36.480> mode<00:06:36.930> and<00:06:37.169> then<00:06:37.230> let's<00:06:37.440> talk

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
particular mode and then let's talk

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.690 
particular mode and then let's talk
about<00:06:37.650> almost<00:06:37.980> here<00:06:38.190> that's<00:06:38.400> actually<00:06:38.640> I'm

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:38.700 
about almost here that's actually I'm

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.580 
about almost here that's actually I'm
again<00:06:38.940> sort<00:06:39.510> of<00:06:39.570> that<00:06:39.690> yeah<00:06:39.900> rocket<00:06:40.230> tag<00:06:40.380> was

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:40.590 
again sort of that yeah rocket tag was

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.200 
again sort of that yeah rocket tag was
the<00:06:40.740> penguin<00:06:41.040> impacts<00:06:41.310> everybody<00:06:41.700> loved<00:06:42.030> that
