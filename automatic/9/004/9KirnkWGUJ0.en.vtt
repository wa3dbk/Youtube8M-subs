00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.230 
secret isn't believable I think that
fashion<00:04:34.800> and<00:04:35.250> fragrance<00:04:35.820> go<00:04:36.030> together

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
fashion and fragrance go together

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.839 
fashion and fragrance go together
because<00:04:36.690> fragrance<00:04:37.440> is<00:04:37.590> a<00:04:37.620> statement<00:04:38.039> of

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:38.849 
because fragrance is a statement of

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:41.089 
because fragrance is a statement of
