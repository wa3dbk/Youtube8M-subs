 first 6 strings and then divided by 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.680
 chord 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.650

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.890
 slow 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:20.280
 understood the following C Major chord c

 playing 5 6 bass 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.380
 farther and m also 5 6 sending

 and chord c h 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:41.620

 all circle meat is nothing 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.920
 not generally 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.920
 in desert 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.400
 and 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.709
 but some doctors knew 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:22.980
 the months of winter and even the weight of couplets the border 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:22.980
 the chorus is played the same way further 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.539
 forever 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.800
 still 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:49.420
