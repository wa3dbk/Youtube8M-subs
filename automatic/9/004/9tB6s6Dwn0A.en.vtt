00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
go like this I want to get one where

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:58.960 
go like this I want to get one where
it's<00:04:57.620> like<00:04:57.740> a<00:04:57.770> singular<00:04:58.310> but<00:04:58.460> I<00:04:58.520> highly<00:04:58.729> doubt

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
it's like a singular but I highly doubt

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.770 
it's like a singular but I highly doubt
that's<00:04:59.150> going<00:04:59.240> to<00:04:59.330> happen<00:05:00.430> is<00:05:01.430> that<00:05:01.669> all<00:05:02.180> the

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
that's going to happen is that all the

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.110 
that's going to happen is that all the
Nick<00:05:02.990> full<00:05:03.229> seven<00:05:03.650> touchdowns<00:05:04.099> so<00:05:04.400> not<00:05:04.639> bad<00:05:04.820> um

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
Nick full seven touchdowns so not bad um

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.740 
Nick full seven touchdowns so not bad um
