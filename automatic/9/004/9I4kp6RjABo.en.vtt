00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 November 11 was killed for 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.790
 hand of a policeman gabriele sandri 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.589
 Lazio fan and it was 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.179
 inevitable that the mind would return 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.790
 death of police inspector Filippo 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.799
 raciti took place on February 2nd during 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.990
 the clashes between Catania fans and 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.820
 Palermo but for gabriele football 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.590
 public opinion has not been affirmed 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.750
 it is split as if we were talking about 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.090
 good versus bad with a reality is 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.529
 very different and if you didn't want to 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.090
 stop the games as a sign of 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.109
 respect then it was necessary to use at least 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.560
 a bit of common sense 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:42.070
 knowing where it would come from 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:44.300
 [Music] 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.710
 are years that I attend the stadiums of 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.200
 all of Italy and as far as I was 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.180
 also possible European ones in Italy 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.400
 I happened to be escorted by 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.440
 police inside the stadiums to avoid 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.239
 clashes with the opposing supporters 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.500
 I'm hiding from the bushes 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.450
 to escape the charges of forces 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.230
 of the order started without any 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.210
 motivation 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.950
 while I was strolling quietly I 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.780
 argued with boys for stupidity 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.040
 threw a stone a bottle of 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.040
 plastic unleashing hell 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.100
 I had to rescue my little sister 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.110
 for what without any reason from an agent 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.820
 of the finance guard who instead of 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.350
 indicate to the river of fans the road 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.480
 for the gates he beat with the 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.370
 truncheon aimed so the crowd I have 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.770
 seen police people devastate scooters 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.180
 parked near the stadium I saw 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.250
 young people loot motorway stops 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.050
 while we went away 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.280
 I suffered the unjustified office of the 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.810
 police of the carabinieri in front 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.450
 to the revenue agency 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.100
 11 March 2005 when to demonstrate 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.320
 we were a handful of boys and many 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.530
 so many elderly people finished at the hospital in 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.540
 how many years that you look like reduced 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.420
 with chalk on the arm to the eye that 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.050
 cha hit his head but I don't know 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.050
 points here 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.790
 I ran away from the stadium sometimes 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.380
 tear gas trying to avoid the 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.850
 clashes 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.620
 I suffered the threats of a carabiniere 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.870
 that we put the baton ready to 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.730
 use it I saw police officers 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.130
 drag a boy to stop between two 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.410
 trucks smashed I dodged stones 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.970
 small bottles thrown from some demented 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.940
 I heard groups of policemen not 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.230
 to know why there was a charge 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:43.830
 while in Europe it never happened 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:45.209
 nothing but I can also say known 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.980
 boys engaged in forces 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.050
 kind and available order 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.910
 I saw from the big fans 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.250
 manifestations of solidarity and loyalty 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.690
 I have seen in various travels ultras 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.700
 behave like a real person 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.770
 order service that put in line 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.020
 who wandered and was not very respectful 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.340
 I know the violence of some boys but 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.080
 I also know very well about that of the 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.209
 law and order is good and evil 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.770
 from both sides 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.360
 to me anyway if I attended e 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.520
 attends the stadiums make propose to 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.140
 law enforcement that the ultras by 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.090
 which I have often been protected 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.830
 I don't understand how a single 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.840
 behavior of an individual of one 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.299
 small group can unleash a whole 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.350
 law enforcement department 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.150
 triggering a spiral of violence in 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.950
 all the other fans when it would be enough 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.820
 simply block the authors of 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.160
 violent gesture 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.350
 and to think that we pay them for this 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.000
 or defend the four delinquents 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.760
 that you can meet in any 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.290
 place for law enforcement 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.000
 maybe every fan wants you 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.620
 delinquent also that old woman 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.450
 massacre in front of agencies of 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.860
 revenue 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.800
 I fear them that they don't stop in front 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:56.020
 to nobody 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:56.020
