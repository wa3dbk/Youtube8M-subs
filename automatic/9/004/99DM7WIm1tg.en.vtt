of like concerned about well first
making<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:14.019> the<00:03:14.469> build<00:03:14.650> I<00:03:14.859> was<00:03:14.980> like<00:03:15.099> where<00:03:15.939> am

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
making the the build I was like where am

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.909 
making the the build I was like where am
I<00:03:16.060> gonna<00:03:16.120> put<00:03:16.299> my<00:03:16.329> stuff<00:03:16.750> so<00:03:17.049> that<00:03:17.650> people<00:03:17.829> are

want revenge so you have to know this
builds<00:03:36.939> not<00:03:37.120> gonna<00:03:37.269> be<00:03:37.449> super<00:03:37.689> super<00:03:38.340> tanky<00:03:39.340> by

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
builds not gonna be super super tanky by

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:43.439 
builds not gonna be super super tanky by
any<00:03:39.790> means<00:03:39.939> it's<00:03:40.239> a<00:03:40.329> lot<00:03:41.229> more<00:03:41.379> squishy<00:03:42.449> it's

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:43.449 
any means it's a lot more squishy it's

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:45.599 
any means it's a lot more squishy it's
not<00:03:43.659> as<00:03:43.810> squishy<00:03:44.049> as<00:03:44.349> if<00:03:44.739> I<00:03:44.859> went<00:03:45.009> crit<00:03:45.340> which

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
not as squishy as if I went crit which

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:47.129 
not as squishy as if I went crit which
I'm<00:03:45.759> planning<00:03:46.060> on<00:03:46.120> making<00:03:46.209> a<00:03:46.419> variant<00:03:46.840> of<00:03:46.989> this

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.139 
I'm planning on making a variant of this

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:49.259 
I'm planning on making a variant of this
build<00:03:47.379> I'll<00:03:48.099> probably<00:03:48.400> upload<00:03:48.669> it<00:03:48.909> at<00:03:49.030> some

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
build I'll probably upload it at some

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.050 
build I'll probably upload it at some
point<00:03:49.509> it's<00:03:49.750> focused<00:03:50.139> around<00:03:50.519> critic<00:03:51.519> and<00:03:51.849> a

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
point it's focused around critic and a

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.020 
point it's focused around critic and a
lot<00:03:52.209> more<00:03:52.239> burst<00:03:52.629> versus<00:03:53.019> the<00:03:53.169> dot<00:03:53.319> thing<00:03:54.030> so

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
lot more burst versus the dot thing so

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.729 
lot more burst versus the dot thing so
I'll<00:03:55.359> look<00:03:55.479> into<00:03:55.659> getting<00:03:55.870> that<00:03:55.959> up<00:03:56.229> but<00:03:56.530> first

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
I'll look into getting that up but first

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:57.899 
I'll look into getting that up but first
I'm<00:03:56.859> just<00:03:56.919> gonna<00:03:57.069> make<00:03:57.280> a<00:03:57.340> bill<00:03:57.489> for<00:03:57.669> this<00:03:57.729> one

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
I'm just gonna make a bill for this one

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:59.219 
I'm just gonna make a bill for this one
and<00:03:58.120> everything<00:03:58.419> because<00:03:58.599> I<00:03:58.659> really<00:03:58.930> enjoy

00:03:59.219 --> 00:03:59.229 
and everything because I really enjoy

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:01.020 
and everything because I really enjoy
the<00:03:59.439> dot<00:03:59.620> damage<00:03:59.979> I<00:04:00.040> think<00:04:00.069> it<00:04:00.340> suits<00:04:00.609> this

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
the dot damage I think it suits this

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.240 
the dot damage I think it suits this
build<00:04:01.299> a<00:04:01.419> lot<00:04:01.569> more<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:02.620> it<00:04:02.709> goes<00:04:03.040> with<00:04:03.189> the

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
build a lot more and it goes with the

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.369 
build a lot more and it goes with the
theme<00:04:03.370> of<00:04:03.549> being<00:04:03.639> a<00:04:03.729> spider<00:04:04.019> so<00:04:05.019> I'm<00:04:05.259> just

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:06.479 
theme of being a spider so I'm just
gonna<00:04:05.500> end<00:04:05.590> it<00:04:05.799> off<00:04:05.889> here<00:04:05.919> with<00:04:06.220> one<00:04:06.340> of<00:04:06.370> my

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:13.479 
at the bottom ate a base right down

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:15.390 
at the bottom ate a base right down
there<00:04:13.659> it's<00:04:14.439> weird<00:04:14.650> it's<00:04:14.829> got<00:04:14.949> an<00:04:15.040> a<00:04:15.159> on<00:04:15.189> it

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.029 
there it's weird it's got an a on it
actually<00:04:15.729> I<00:04:15.790> didn't<00:04:15.939> realize<00:04:16.180> that<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:17.440> then

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
actually I didn't realize that and then

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:20.159 
actually I didn't realize that and then
you<00:04:18.130> can<00:04:18.310> come<00:04:18.519> up<00:04:18.699> here<00:04:18.820> and<00:04:19.359> it's<00:04:19.630> like<00:04:20.139> a

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
you can come up here and it's like a

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.529 
you can come up here and it's like a
perfect<00:04:20.440> lair<00:04:20.859> really<00:04:21.280> this<00:04:22.090> one's<00:04:22.270> not<00:04:22.389> as

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
perfect lair really this one's not as

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:23.430 
perfect lair really this one's not as
good<00:04:22.690> as<00:04:22.779> the<00:04:22.900> one<00:04:23.020> on<00:04:23.050> the<00:04:23.229> other<00:04:23.260> side

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
good as the one on the other side

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.930 
good as the one on the other side
because<00:04:23.800> they<00:04:23.919> can<00:04:24.070> kind<00:04:24.250> of<00:04:24.310> see<00:04:24.460> you<00:04:24.490> but<00:04:24.789> the

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
because they can kind of see you but the

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.149 
because they can kind of see you but the
guy<00:04:25.060> wasn't<00:04:25.300> really<00:04:25.479> paying<00:04:25.630> attention<00:04:26.159> but

00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:27.159 
guy wasn't really paying attention but

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:28.540 
guy wasn't really paying attention but
you<00:04:27.250> can<00:04:27.370> watch<00:04:27.550> this<00:04:27.760> spawn<00:04:28.029> right

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
you can watch this spawn right

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:29.980 
you can watch this spawn right
you<00:04:28.580> can<00:04:28.670> see<00:04:28.850> when<00:04:28.970> they're<00:04:29.090> coming<00:04:29.420> so<00:04:29.960> I
