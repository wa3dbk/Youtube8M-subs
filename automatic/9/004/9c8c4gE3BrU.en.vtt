00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
episode and then this episode I've said

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.290 
episode and then this episode I've said
to<00:00:05.160> feature<00:00:05.279> dis<00:00:05.609> the<00:00:06.120> holden<00:00:06.390> monaro<00:00:06.480> cv8<00:00:07.200> and

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:08.300 
to feature dis the holden monaro cv8 and

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.970 
to feature dis the holden monaro cv8 and
this<00:00:09.300> is<00:00:09.510> a<00:00:09.840> carrot<00:00:10.260> it<00:00:10.380> has<00:00:10.620> literally

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
this is a carrot it has literally

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.580 
this is a carrot it has literally
changed<00:00:11.070> my<00:00:11.400> view<00:00:11.670> on<00:00:11.730> drifting<00:00:12.120> literally<00:00:12.870> so

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
changed my view on drifting literally so

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.589 
changed my view on drifting literally so
after<00:00:14.280> I've<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.730> knit<00:00:14.940> it<00:00:15.150> managed<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.480> look

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
after I've to knit it managed to look

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.359 
after I've to knit it managed to look
like<00:00:15.719> this<00:00:15.929> now<00:00:16.289> this<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.470> again<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:16.859> stanica

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
like this now this is again a stanica

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.279 
like this now this is again a stanica
which<00:00:17.580> is<00:00:17.760> actually<00:00:18.180> my<00:00:18.480> biggest<00:00:18.900> down<00:00:19.080> flaw

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
which is actually my biggest down flaw

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.510 
which is actually my biggest down flaw
with<00:00:19.439> this<00:00:19.560> thing<00:00:19.740> like<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:20.070> wish<00:00:20.279> this<00:00:20.460> thing

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
with this thing like I wish this thing

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.519 
with this thing like I wish this thing
was<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:21.000> was<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.660> premium<00:00:22.050> character<00:00:22.350> so<00:00:22.470> I

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
was it was the premium character so I

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.900 
was it was the premium character so I
can<00:00:22.680> make<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.859> look<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.160> little<00:00:23.189> bit<00:00:23.400> nicer<00:00:23.519> but

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
can make a look a little bit nicer but

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.670 
can make a look a little bit nicer but
since<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.810> standard<00:00:25.170> car<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.380> can't<00:00:25.590> do

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
since it is a standard car I can't do

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.380 
since it is a standard car I can't do
much<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.369> can't<00:00:26.550> even<00:00:26.640> need<00:00:26.849> go<00:00:27.150> into

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
much to it and I can't even need go into

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.300 
much to it and I can't even need go into
galera<00:00:27.689> view<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.080> actually<00:00:28.410> view<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.070> car

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
galera view to actually view the car

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.600 
galera view to actually view the car
properly<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:30.119> kind<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.720> improvise<00:00:31.170> anyway

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
properly so I kind of improvise anyway

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.400 
properly so I kind of improvise anyway
in<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.850> tuning<00:00:33.120> options<00:00:33.210> as<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.780> can<00:00:33.930> see<00:00:34.170> it

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
in the tuning options as you can see it

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.860 
in the tuning options as you can see it
has<00:00:34.770> 650<00:00:35.640> brake<00:00:35.910> horsepower<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.390> down<00:00:36.630> tune

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
has 650 brake horsepower I down tune

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.280 
has 650 brake horsepower I down tune
this<00:00:37.050> or<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.350> detuned<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.399> down<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.510> 650<00:00:40.020> brake

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
this or a detuned it down to 650 brake

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.229 
this or a detuned it down to 650 brake
horsepower<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.770> has<00:00:41.780> 1332<00:00:42.860> kilos<00:00:44.180> now<00:00:45.180> the

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
horsepower and has 1332 kilos now the

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.200 
horsepower and has 1332 kilos now the
suspension<00:00:45.960> settings<00:00:46.170> are<00:00:46.860> probably<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
suspension settings are probably the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.490 
suspension settings are probably the
things<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.660> I've<00:00:48.750> changed<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.140> most<00:00:49.350> on

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
things that I've changed the most on

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.439 
things that I've changed the most on
this<00:00:49.649> on<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.250> care<00:00:50.610> compared<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.300> rest

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
this on this care compared to the rest

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.700 
this on this care compared to the rest
of<00:00:51.600> my<00:00:51.660> records<00:00:52.020> if<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.230> don't<00:00:52.379> check<00:00:52.530> those

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
of my records if you don't check those

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.189 
of my records if you don't check those
out<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.850> camber<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.719> spring<00:00:55.050> rate

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
out the camber the spring rate

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.479 
out the camber the spring rate
everything<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.649> different<00:00:55.800> i<00:00:56.039> decide<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.370> go

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
everything is different i decide to go

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.430 
everything is different i decide to go
for<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:57.120> little<00:00:57.210> bit<00:00:57.390> more<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.989> realistic

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
for a little bit more of a realistic

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.869 
for a little bit more of a realistic
yeah<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.399> guess<00:01:00.350> tune<00:01:01.350> on<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:01.739> thing<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.129> so

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
yeah I guess tune on this thing and so

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.219 
yeah I guess tune on this thing and so
because<00:01:03.480> I've<00:01:03.600> said<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:03.870> my<00:01:03.960> previous

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
because I've said it in my previous

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.750 
because I've said it in my previous
video<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.559> I'm<00:01:04.739> slowly<00:01:04.949> trying<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.430> make<00:01:05.580> my

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
video that I'm slowly trying to make my

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.980 
video that I'm slowly trying to make my
cars<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:07.229> know<00:01:07.790> tuned<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.270> be<00:01:09.450> just<00:01:09.930> like

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
cars and you know tuned to be just like

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.830 
cars and you know tuned to be just like
actual<00:01:10.530> drift<00:01:10.799> hairs<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.310> I've<00:01:11.689> given<00:01:12.689> the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
actual drift hairs so I've given the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.260 
actual drift hairs so I've given the
this<00:01:13.409> care<00:01:13.650> specifically<00:01:14.189> less<00:01:14.549> camber<00:01:15.060> and

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
this care specifically less camber and

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.469 
this care specifically less camber and
less<00:01:15.450> toe<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.009> I've<00:01:17.009> made<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.090> sort<00:01:18.420> of

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
less toe and I've made it so it sort of

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.140 
less toe and I've made it so it sort of
drives<00:01:18.869> well<00:01:19.710> if<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.369> use<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.640> steering<00:01:21.119> wheel

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
drives well if you use a steering wheel

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.690 
drives well if you use a steering wheel
so<00:01:21.450> I'm<00:01:21.540> trying<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.810> adapt<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.490> so<00:01:23.490> my

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
so I'm trying to adapt to that so my

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.210 
so I'm trying to adapt to that so my
tunes<00:01:24.090> kind<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.450> work<00:01:25.110> on<00:01:25.380> both<00:01:25.799> platforms

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
tunes kind of work on both platforms

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.800 
tunes kind of work on both platforms
like<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.060> controller<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.630> on<00:01:27.720> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
like on the controller and on the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.580 
like on the controller and on the
steering<00:01:28.020> wheel<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.380> I'm<00:01:29.250> trying<00:01:29.670> my<00:01:29.880> best<00:01:29.909> to

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
steering wheel so I'm trying my best to

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.069 
steering wheel so I'm trying my best to
to<00:01:31.729> to<00:01:32.729> play<00:01:32.909> with<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.119> controller<00:01:33.540> just<00:01:33.869> like

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
to to play with a controller just like

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.690 
to to play with a controller just like
I'd<00:01:34.320> play<00:01:34.590> with<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.770> steering<00:01:35.130> wheel<00:01:35.159> basically

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
I'd play with a steering wheel basically

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.370 
I'd play with a steering wheel basically
so<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.479> little<00:01:36.659> bit<00:01:36.810> difficult<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.229> do

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
so it is a little bit difficult to do

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.109 
so it is a little bit difficult to do
that<00:01:37.560> but<00:01:37.799> I'm<00:01:37.950> as<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.460> said<00:01:38.729> I'm<00:01:38.820> trying<00:01:39.030> my

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
that but I'm as I said I'm trying my
