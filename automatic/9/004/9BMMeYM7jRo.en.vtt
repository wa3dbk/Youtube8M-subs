of course there's several ways to strike
a<00:00:25.740> door<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.100> mean<00:00:26.310> one<00:00:26.490> way<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.910> baseball<00:00:27.660> style

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
a door I mean one way is baseball style

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.850 
a door I mean one way is baseball style
this<00:00:28.290> way<00:00:28.560> another<00:00:29.460> way<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:30.320> sort<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.350> hatchet

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:31.860 
this way another way is sort of hatchet

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.119 
this way another way is sort of hatchet
style<00:00:32.189> this<00:00:32.669> way<00:00:32.910> or<00:00:33.270> sideways<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.590> way<00:00:34.800> and

style this way or sideways that way and

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.180 
style this way or sideways that way and
then<00:00:35.940> another<00:00:35.969> way<00:00:36.420> would<00:00:36.629> be<00:00:36.809> like<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:37.950> if

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
then another way would be like this if

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.030 
then another way would be like this if
you're<00:00:38.340> trying<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.640> push<00:00:39.030> through<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.450> door

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
see what kind of noise we get put some

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.340 
see what kind of noise we get put some
damage<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.430> door<00:01:11.640> there<00:01:12.110> it's<00:01:13.110> pretty

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
damage in the door there it's pretty

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.530 
damage in the door there it's pretty
loud<00:01:13.590> it's<00:01:14.040> probably<00:01:14.430> louder<00:01:14.700> than<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.270> hear

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
loud it's probably louder than you hear

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.110 
loud it's probably louder than you hear
it<00:01:15.630> on<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:15.930> microphone<00:01:16.409> because<00:01:17.010> this<00:01:17.850> has<00:01:18.090> a

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
it on this microphone because this has a

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.270 
it on this microphone because this has a
limiter<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.229> doesn't<00:01:19.560> overload<00:01:20.070> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
limiter so it doesn't overload the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.609 
limiter so it doesn't overload the
microphone<00:01:20.880> but<00:01:21.420> it's<00:01:21.570> pretty<00:01:21.840> loud<00:01:24.619> that's

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
microphone but it's pretty loud that's

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.300 
microphone but it's pretty loud that's
pretty<00:01:25.920> loud<00:01:28.400> now<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.750> sounded<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.960> me

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
pretty loud now that sounded to me

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.890 
pretty loud now that sounded to me
something<00:01:32.310> like<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.490> gunshot<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.360> if<00:01:33.510> I<00:01:33.659> was

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
something like a gunshot and if I was

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.400 
here while I was down there firing shots
and<00:02:58.790> using<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.239> bat<00:02:59.420> against<00:02:59.840> the<00:02:59.959> door<00:03:00.170> and

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
and using the bat against the door and

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.070 
and using the bat against the door and
I'll<00:03:00.860> tell<00:03:01.100> you<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.459> difference<00:03:01.910> is<00:03:02.480> not<00:03:02.720> as

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
I'll tell you the difference is not as

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.449 
I'll tell you the difference is not as
great<00:03:03.350> as<00:03:03.680> you<00:03:03.709> would<00:03:04.040> think

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
great as you would think

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:05.710 
great as you would think
I<00:03:04.549> think<00:03:04.819> you'll<00:03:05.000> hear<00:03:05.269> that<00:03:05.450> on<00:03:05.630> the

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
I think you'll hear that on the

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:28.559 
I think you'll hear that on the
recording<00:03:06.200> here<00:03:06.380> with<00:03:06.500> a<00:03:06.530> microphone

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.920 

if<00:03:29.409> you<00:03:29.709> if<00:03:30.010> you<00:03:30.280> shot<00:03:30.580> one<00:03:30.939> I<00:03:31.330> mean<00:03:31.750> if<00:03:31.840> you

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
if you if you shot one I mean if you

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.050 
if you if you shot one I mean if you
shot<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.349> gun<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:32.890> then<00:03:32.950> hit<00:03:33.189> the<00:03:33.370> bat<00:03:33.579> and<00:03:33.909> I

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
shot the gun and then hit the bat and I

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.640 
shot the gun and then hit the bat and I
said<00:03:34.329> which<00:03:34.510> was<00:03:34.720> a<00:03:34.750> gun<00:03:34.989> of<00:03:35.140> which<00:03:35.260> was<00:03:35.470> the

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
said which was a gun of which was the

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.089 
said which was a gun of which was the
bat<00:03:36.030> I<00:03:37.030> think<00:03:37.450> you<00:03:37.540> could<00:03:37.689> tell<00:03:37.870> but<00:03:38.860> if<00:03:38.980> you

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
bat I think you could tell but if you

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.850 
bat I think you could tell but if you
didn't<00:03:39.459> hear<00:03:39.700> them<00:03:39.849> to<00:03:40.090> compare<00:03:40.689> them<00:03:41.019> you

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
didn't hear them to compare them you

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.839 
didn't hear them to compare them you
would<00:03:42.010> have<00:03:42.159> a<00:03:42.189> very<00:03:42.280> difficult<00:03:42.819> time<00:03:43.530> just

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
would have a very difficult time just

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.740 
would have a very difficult time just
understanding<00:03:45.849> that<00:03:45.909> the<00:03:46.150> bat<00:03:46.450> strike

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
understanding that the bat strike

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.750 
understanding that the bat strike
against<00:03:47.470> the<00:03:47.590> door<00:03:47.829> is<00:03:48.099> not<00:03:48.250> a<00:03:48.310> gun<00:03:48.549> shot

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
against the door is not a gun shot

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.030 
against the door is not a gun shot
because<00:03:49.599> when<00:03:49.959> you<00:03:50.079> hear<00:03:50.319> that<00:03:50.470> it<00:03:50.709> makes<00:03:50.890> a

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
because when you hear that it makes a

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.520 
because when you hear that it makes a
definite<00:03:51.519> crack<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.569> bat<00:03:52.810> against<00:03:53.200> the<00:03:53.290> door

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
definite crack the bat against the door

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.699 
definite crack the bat against the door
makes<00:03:53.860> a<00:03:54.040> definite<00:03:54.579> crack<00:03:54.930> that<00:03:55.930> you<00:03:56.409> could

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
makes a definite crack that you could

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.309 
makes a definite crack that you could
think<00:03:56.890> as<00:03:57.099> a<00:03:57.129> gunshot<00:03:57.609> and<00:03:58.510> especially<00:03:58.900> if<00:03:59.200> you

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
think as a gunshot and especially if you

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.319 
think as a gunshot and especially if you
couldn't<00:03:59.709> compare<00:04:00.310> it<00:04:00.489> you<00:04:00.700> have<00:04:00.970> to<00:04:01.120> hear

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
couldn't compare it you have to hear

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.270 
couldn't compare it you have to hear
them<00:04:01.510> both<00:04:01.810> to<00:04:02.260> know<00:04:02.290> the<00:04:02.590> difference<00:04:03.040> and

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
them both to know the difference and

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.690 
them both to know the difference and
without<00:04:04.209> a<00:04:04.239> comparison<00:04:05.019> that<00:04:05.220> bat<00:04:06.220> strike

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
without a comparison that bat strike

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.520 
without a comparison that bat strike
even<00:04:07.389> at<00:04:07.540> 180<00:04:08.440> meters<00:04:09.690> up<00:04:10.690> here<00:04:10.989> sounds<00:04:11.470> like

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
even at 180 meters up here sounds like

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:22.560 
even at 180 meters up here sounds like
it<00:04:12.190> could<00:04:12.340> be<00:04:12.370> a<00:04:12.489> gunshot

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.630
