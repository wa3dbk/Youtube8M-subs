00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
introduction to latex series this video

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.559 
introduction to latex series this video
is<00:00:05.040> about<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.250> very<00:00:05.549> important<00:00:05.970> subject<00:00:06.420> of

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
is about the very important subject of

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.960 
is about the very important subject of
environments<00:00:07.230> in<00:00:07.350> latex<00:00:07.799> in<00:00:08.580> this<00:00:08.730> video

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
environments in latex in this video

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.339 
environments in latex in this video
we're<00:00:09.150> going<00:00:09.240> to<00:00:09.300> learn<00:00:09.450> about<00:00:09.510> environments

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
we're going to learn about environments

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.870 
we're going to learn about environments
in<00:00:10.440> general<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:10.980> how<00:00:11.040> their<00:00:11.219> syntax<00:00:11.610> works

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
in general and how their syntax works

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.490 
in general and how their syntax works
and<00:00:12.210> then<00:00:12.840> we're<00:00:12.929> gonna<00:00:13.019> see<00:00:13.290> some

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
and then we're gonna see some

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.560 
and then we're gonna see some
environments<00:00:14.400> that<00:00:14.549> change<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.150> formatting

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
environments that change the formatting

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.260 
environments that change the formatting
of<00:00:15.719> text<00:00:15.780> such<00:00:16.410> as<00:00:16.440> centering<00:00:17.100> flush<00:00:17.820> left<00:00:18.119> and

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
of text such as centering flush left and

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.660 
of text such as centering flush left and
flush<00:00:18.480> right<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.369> environments<00:00:20.369> that<00:00:20.460> change

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
flush right and environments that change

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.230 
flush right and environments that change
the<00:00:20.850> size<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.359> text<00:00:22.490> so<00:00:23.490> an<00:00:23.609> environment<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.210> a

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
the size of text so an environment is a

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.150 
the size of text so an environment is a
block<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.869> latex<00:00:25.230> document<00:00:25.769> that's<00:00:25.920> being

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
block of a latex document that's being

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.099 
block of a latex document that's being
instructed<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.910> behave<00:00:27.180> in<00:00:27.420> some<00:00:27.660> kind<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:27.960> way

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
instructed to behave in some kind of way

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.990 
instructed to behave in some kind of way
that<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.890> fundamentally<00:00:29.460> different<00:00:29.490> from<00:00:29.880> the

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
that is fundamentally different from the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.120 
that is fundamentally different from the
rest<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.480> document<00:00:30.990> for<00:00:31.590> example<00:00:31.949> if<00:00:32.040> I

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
rest of the document for example if I

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.590 
rest of the document for example if I
had<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.279> block<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.730> text<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.300> wanted

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
had a block of text that I wanted

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.180 
had a block of text that I wanted
centered<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.380> would<00:00:34.739> need<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.950> have<00:00:35.070> an

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
centered I would need to have an

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.160 
centered I would need to have an
environment<00:00:35.760> for<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.870> will<00:00:36.989> turn<00:00:37.110> out

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
environment for that it will turn out

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.959 
environment for that it will turn out
that<00:00:37.440> if<00:00:37.500> we<00:00:37.559> want<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.890> have<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.100> column<00:00:38.910> of

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
that if we want to have a column of

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.840 
that if we want to have a column of
equations<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:40.200> are<00:00:40.260> all<00:00:40.739> aligned<00:00:41.309> by<00:00:41.640> their

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
equations that are all aligned by their

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.520 
equations that are all aligned by their
equal<00:00:42.210> sign<00:00:42.420> won't<00:00:42.660> eat<00:00:42.840> an<00:00:42.930> environment<00:00:43.440> for

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
equal sign won't eat an environment for

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.979 
equal sign won't eat an environment for
that<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.160> so<00:00:44.910> environments<00:00:45.660> show<00:00:45.750> up<00:00:45.840> very

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
that and so environments show up very

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.479 
that and so environments show up very
often<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.410> latex<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.010> they<00:00:47.100> all<00:00:47.219> have<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
often in latex and they all have the

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.729 
often in latex and they all have the
same<00:00:47.700> basic<00:00:47.760> syntax<00:00:48.690> we<00:00:49.200> have<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.440> have<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> way

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
same basic syntax we have to have a way

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.010 
same basic syntax we have to have a way
of<00:00:49.890> telling<00:00:50.100> latex<00:00:51.059> when<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.360> environment<00:00:51.930> is

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
of telling latex when the environment is

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.020 
of telling latex when the environment is
beginning<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.680> when<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.100> ending<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.910> we

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
beginning and when it is ending and we

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.689 
beginning and when it is ending and we
do<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.329> by<00:00:54.449> typing<00:00:54.660> slash<00:00:55.350> begin<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.399> then

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
do that by typing slash begin and then

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.250 
do that by typing slash begin and then
in<00:00:56.789> curly<00:00:56.940> braces<00:00:57.239> give<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.780> name<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.050> the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
in curly braces give the name of the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.619 
in curly braces give the name of the
environment<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.250> then<00:00:59.760> entering<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.390> stuff

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
environment and then entering the stuff

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.479 
environment and then entering the stuff
that<00:01:00.750> we<00:01:00.840> want<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.140> environment<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.010> then

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
that we want in the environment and then

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.119 
that we want in the environment and then
tell<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.879> end<00:01:03.059> by<00:01:03.420> typing<00:01:03.780> slash<00:01:04.229> end<00:01:04.589> and

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
tell it to end by typing slash end and

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.130 
tell it to end by typing slash end and
then<00:01:05.580> curly<00:01:05.850> braces<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.420> then<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.960> name<00:01:07.110> of

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
then curly braces and then the name of

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.570 
then curly braces and then the name of
the<00:01:07.260> environment<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:07.950> then<00:01:08.040> close<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.430> curly

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
the environment and then close the curly

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.700 
the environment and then close the curly
braces<00:01:08.880> off<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:10.290> when<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.470> think<00:01:10.530> about

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
braces off and so when you think about

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.929 
braces off and so when you think about
that<00:01:11.010> you've<00:01:11.369> actually<00:01:11.549> become<00:01:11.909> very

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
that you've actually become very

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.670 
that you've actually become very
familiar<00:01:12.570> with<00:01:12.630> one<00:01:12.900> basic<00:01:13.380> kind<00:01:13.619> of

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
familiar with one basic kind of

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.480 
familiar with one basic kind of
environment<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:15.680> that<00:01:16.680> environment<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
environment and that environment is the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.999 
environment and that environment is the
document<00:01:18.030> environment<00:01:18.600> we<00:01:19.200> know<00:01:19.320> all<00:01:19.560> latex

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
document environment we know all latex

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.920 
document environment we know all latex
documents<00:01:20.610> after<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.060> preamble<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.689> done

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
documents after the preamble is done

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.469 
documents after the preamble is done
start<00:01:22.380> with<00:01:22.560> begin<00:01:23.100> document<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.970> end<00:01:24.270> with

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
start with begin document and end with

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.740 
start with begin document and end with
end<00:01:24.840> document<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:26.100> document<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.150> one<00:01:27.450> kind<00:01:27.630> of

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
end document so document is one kind of

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.990 
end document so document is one kind of
environment<00:01:28.320> there<00:01:28.950> are<00:01:28.979> others<00:01:29.490> let's<00:01:29.880> take

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
environment there are others let's take

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.700 
environment there are others let's take
a<00:01:30.030> look<00:01:30.240> at<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.360> few<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.049> then<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.380> next<00:01:31.590> few

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
a look at a few and then the next few

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.200 
a look at a few and then the next few
videos<00:01:31.860> are<00:01:32.250> going<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.430> focus<00:01:32.579> in<00:01:32.820> on<00:01:32.909> even

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
videos are going to focus in on even

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.560 
videos are going to focus in on even
more<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:34.920> center<00:01:35.310> environment<00:01:35.850> places<00:01:36.210> text

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
more the center environment places text

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.960 
more the center environment places text
centered<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.350> page<00:01:37.560> for<00:01:38.369> example<00:01:38.460> if<00:01:38.880> I

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
centered on the page for example if I
