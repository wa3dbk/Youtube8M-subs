176 scale now this is actually an old
reboxed<00:00:19.080> matchbox<00:00:20.070> set<00:00:21.050> so<00:00:22.070> it's<00:00:23.070> pretty<00:00:23.279> old

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
reboxed matchbox set so it's pretty old

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:33.049 
reboxed matchbox set so it's pretty old
and<00:00:25.400> the<00:00:26.400> parts<00:00:26.939> are<00:00:28.880> here<00:00:31.279> and<00:00:32.279> the

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
and the parts are here and the

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.350 
and the parts are here and the
instructions<00:00:33.780> are<00:00:33.989> there<00:00:34.190> interest<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.399> found

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:46.180 

rather<00:00:41.000> bad<00:00:42.000> actually

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:01:00.250 

that's<00:00:47.190> two<00:00:47.550> pots<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:52.969> looks<00:00:53.969> like<00:00:54.890> this<00:00:58.940> so

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
that's two pots and looks like this so

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.590 
that's two pots and looks like this so
but<00:01:01.260> I'll<00:01:01.739> probably<00:01:02.840> get<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:05.330> to<00:01:06.330> look

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
but I'll probably get to it and to look

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.340 
but I'll probably get to it and to look
at<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.810> parts<00:01:07.970> we<00:01:08.970> could<00:01:09.210> take<00:01:09.510> this<00:01:09.689> brew<00:01:10.110> with

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
at it parts we could take this brew with

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:18.590 
at it parts we could take this brew with
British<00:01:11.130> itself<00:01:11.790> first<00:01:14.810> pot<00:01:15.810> seems<00:01:17.180> very<00:01:18.180> nice

detail of course sometimes hard to see
where<00:01:22.040> pots<00:01:23.040> begin<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.080> big<00:01:25.619> hard<00:01:25.920> to

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
where pots begin so it is big hard to

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.819 
where pots begin so it is big hard to
get<00:01:28.610> in<00:01:29.610> it

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
get in it

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:36.950

it's<00:01:31.829> nicely<00:01:32.340> detailed<00:01:34.610> kit<00:01:35.610> actually<00:01:36.210> like

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
it's nicely detailed kit actually like

it's nicely detailed kit actually like
we<00:01:37.530> get<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.770> dirt<00:01:38.070> there

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
we get it dirt there

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.420 
we get it dirt there
it's<00:01:39.150> an<00:01:39.299> ejector<00:01:39.780> pin<00:01:40.049> mock<00:01:41.150> just<00:01:42.150> tearing

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
it's an ejector pin mock just tearing

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.569 
it's an ejector pin mock just tearing
this<00:01:44.430> plastic<00:01:45.030> mulling<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.720> best<00:01:46.020> but

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
this plastic mulling is the best but

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.600 
this plastic mulling is the best but

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
hull looks nicely detailed and this a

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.910 
hull looks nicely detailed and this a
lot<00:01:55.829> hole<00:01:56.070> no<00:01:57.979> detail<00:01:58.979> under<00:01:59.540> unfortunately

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
some bags and the we use

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.190 
some bags and the we use
there's<00:02:07.280> some<00:02:07.580> jerrycans<00:02:08.180> I<00:02:08.330> think<00:02:11.200> there's

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
there's some jerrycans I think there's

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.290 
there's some jerrycans I think there's
some<00:02:12.380> more<00:02:12.800> flows<00:02:13.160> with<00:02:13.370> that<00:02:13.520> only<00:02:13.730> that's

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
some more flows with that only that's

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.710 
some more flows with that only that's
that<00:02:14.990> will<00:02:15.170> be<00:02:15.350> on<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.560> inside<00:02:16.180> so<00:02:17.180> that<00:02:17.300> looks

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
that will be on the inside so that looks

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.320 
that will be on the inside so that looks
pretty<00:02:18.010> nice<00:02:19.010> and<00:02:20.620> yeah<00:02:21.620> you<00:02:21.680> have<00:02:21.890> like<00:02:22.430> a

can endure a box remove whose beams and

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.590 
can endure a box remove whose beams and
then<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:03.050> beam<00:03:03.350> and<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:04.070> price<00:03:04.580> itself<00:03:05.239> of

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
then the beam and the price itself of

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.250 
then the beam and the price itself of
all<00:03:05.870> match<00:03:06.440> box<00:03:06.770> sets<00:03:07.780> idea<00:03:08.780> around<00:03:08.959> that<00:03:09.170> base

all match box sets idea around that base

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.880 
all match box sets idea around that base
this<00:03:12.260> will<00:03:12.709> be<00:03:12.860> the<00:03:13.010> switch<00:03:13.580> like<00:03:13.820> a<00:03:13.850> start<00:03:14.600> of

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
this will be the switch like a start of

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.699 
this will be the switch like a start of
destroyed<00:03:15.890> bridge<00:03:16.280> what<00:03:16.640> part<00:03:17.000> of<00:03:17.150> stern<00:03:17.709> beam

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
destroyed bridge what part of stern beam

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.210 
destroyed bridge what part of stern beam
sticking<00:03:19.100> up<00:03:19.250> there<00:03:19.750> with<00:03:20.750> its<00:03:20.900> anklets<00:03:21.440> over

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
sticking up there with its anklets over

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.850 
sticking up there with its anklets over
there<00:03:22.690> and<00:03:23.690> some<00:03:23.959> craters<00:03:25.120> this<00:03:26.120> is<00:03:26.299> about<00:03:26.860> the

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
there and some craters this is about the

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.220 
there and some craters this is about the
legs<00:03:28.250> it's<00:03:28.580> pretty<00:03:28.850> small<00:03:29.090> but<00:03:30.280> yet<00:03:31.280> very<00:03:31.430> fast

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
legs it's pretty small but yet very fast

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.820 
legs it's pretty small but yet very fast
and<00:03:33.230> then<00:03:33.410> you<00:03:33.530> have<00:03:33.709> the<00:03:33.920> tracks<00:03:34.880> made<00:03:35.209> out<00:03:35.420> of

and then you have the tracks made out of

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:42.670 
and then you have the tracks made out of
winning<00:03:38.049> they<00:03:39.049> are<00:03:40.060> are<00:03:41.060> easily<00:03:41.720> destroyed
