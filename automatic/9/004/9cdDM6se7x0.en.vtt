pretty<00:03:03.010> much<00:03:03.190> all<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.550> way<00:03:03.670> to<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.150> top<00:03:05.580> baits

a<00:03:06.880> two<00:03:06.940> so<00:03:07.540> not<00:03:07.720> all<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:07.900> way<00:03:07.960> to<00:03:08.020> the<00:03:08.170> top<00:03:08.350> but

a two so not all the way to the top but

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.680 
a two so not all the way to the top but
enough<00:03:08.710> to<00:03:08.830> get<00:03:08.950> to<00:03:09.040> that<00:03:09.190> first<00:03:09.880> level<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:10.510> I

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
enough to get to that first level and I

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.180 
enough to get to that first level and I
probably<00:03:11.050> compacted<00:03:11.740> them<00:03:11.830> down<00:03:12.010> a<00:03:12.040> little

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
probably compacted them down a little

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.700

bit<00:03:12.400> I<00:03:12.670> could<00:03:13.180> make<00:03:13.930> it<00:03:14.050> appear<00:03:14.380> that<00:03:14.410> there's

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
bit I could make it appear that there's

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.400 
bit I could make it appear that there's
more<00:03:14.890> so<00:03:15.400> that<00:03:15.700> is<00:03:15.910> uh<00:03:15.940> first<00:03:16.840> time<00:03:16.990> I<00:03:17.140> ever<00:03:17.200> had
