let's check it out looks like 186
dollars<00:01:16.310> and<00:01:16.759> 37<00:01:17.209> cents<00:01:17.689> is<00:01:17.810> what<00:01:17.990> it's<00:01:18.139> worth

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:18.429 
dollars and 37 cents is what it's worth

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:20.770 
dollars and 37 cents is what it's worth
now<00:01:19.429> of<00:01:19.639> course<00:01:19.909> he'll<00:01:20.149> give<00:01:20.299> me<00:01:20.420> a<00:01:20.450> little<00:01:20.600> bit

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.289 
now of course he'll give me a little bit
less<00:01:20.990> than<00:01:21.200> that<00:01:21.350> because<00:01:21.939> he's<00:01:22.939> got<00:01:23.119> to<00:01:23.209> make

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
less than that because he's got to make

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.449 
less than that because he's got to make
a<00:01:23.359> profit<00:01:23.659> as<00:01:23.929> well<00:01:23.959> but<00:01:24.950> then<00:01:25.130> he'll<00:01:25.310> turn

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
very true it is more volatile but this

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.529 
very true it is more volatile but this
is<00:01:44.479> why<00:01:44.799> there's<00:01:45.799> today's<00:01:46.130> current<00:01:46.819> gold<00:01:47.029> and

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
is why there's today's current gold and

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:50.410 
is why there's today's current gold and
silver<00:01:47.869> prices<00:01:48.139> okay<00:01:49.039> so<00:01:49.819> let's<00:01:50.029> just<00:01:50.090> take<00:01:50.389> a

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
silver prices okay so let's just take a

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.429 
silver prices okay so let's just take a
quick<00:01:51.020> look<00:01:51.289> at<00:01:51.499> that<00:01:52.119> gold<00:01:53.119> right<00:01:53.359> now<00:01:53.439> per

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
quick look at that gold right now per

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:55.319 
quick look at that gold right now per
ounce

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
ounce

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:00.159 
ounce
16:56<00:01:56.329> and<00:01:56.689> Silver's<00:01:57.560> 29.95<00:01:58.399> and<00:01:59.179> this<00:01:59.869> is<00:02:00.020> the

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:00.169 
16:56 and Silver's 29.95 and this is the

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:02.469 
16:56 and Silver's 29.95 and this is the
reason<00:02:00.499> that<00:02:00.529> I<00:02:00.679> switched<00:02:01.009> around<00:02:01.329> because<00:02:02.329> if

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
reason that I switched around because if

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.739 
reason that I switched around because if
I<00:02:02.630> buy<00:02:02.869> silver<00:02:03.529> right<00:02:03.919> now<00:02:04.159> at<00:02:04.490> $30<00:02:05.479> an<00:02:05.630> ounce

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:05.749 
I buy silver right now at $30 an ounce

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:08.050 
I buy silver right now at $30 an ounce
is<00:02:06.109> there<00:02:06.979> a<00:02:07.009> possibility<00:02:07.549> in<00:02:07.819> the<00:02:07.909> near

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
is there a possibility in the near

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.330 
is there a possibility in the near
future<00:02:08.270> that<00:02:08.479> it<00:02:08.750> could<00:02:08.899> double<00:02:09.050> at<00:02:09.440> 60<00:02:10.310> bucks

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
future that it could double at 60 bucks

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.559 
future that it could double at 60 bucks
I<00:02:10.989> think<00:02:11.989> so<00:02:12.230> I<00:02:12.470> mean<00:02:12.620> we<00:02:13.220> hit<00:02:13.370> almost<00:02:13.849> $50

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
I think so I mean we hit almost $50

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.229 
I think so I mean we hit almost $50
within<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.620> last<00:02:15.860> couple<00:02:16.250> years<00:02:16.280> sure<00:02:17.090> it'll

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
within the last couple years sure it'll

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.809 
within the last couple years sure it'll
go<00:02:17.360> up<00:02:17.510> and<00:02:17.720> down<00:02:17.840> but<00:02:18.140> I'll<00:02:18.980> hold<00:02:19.160> on<00:02:19.370> to<00:02:19.400> it<00:02:19.610> it

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.620 
go up and down but I'll hold on to it it
can<00:02:20.150> hit<00:02:20.360> 16<00:02:20.810> it<00:02:20.930> will<00:02:21.080> hit<00:02:21.260> 60<00:02:21.680> soon<00:02:22.310> now<00:02:23.300> can<00:02:23.540> I

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
economy that I don't see it it's harder

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.260 
economy that I don't see it it's harder
for<00:02:42.560> a<00:02:42.770> huge<00:02:43.130> number<00:02:43.160> like<00:02:43.580> that<00:02:43.730> to<00:02:43.940> double

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
for a huge number like that to double

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.510 
for a huge number like that to double
than<00:02:44.810> it<00:02:44.930> is<00:02:45.080> for<00:02:45.260> silver<00:02:45.620> to<00:02:45.740> double<00:02:46.010> and

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520
