about in earlier videos you do want to

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.500 
about in earlier videos you do want to

molds with silicone release to get the

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.070 
molds with silicone release to get the
same<00:02:46.580> effect<00:02:46.970> because<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.450> water's<00:02:47.720> gonna<00:02:47.840> be

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
same effect because the water's gonna be

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.410 
same effect because the water's gonna be
leaving<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.590> part<00:02:48.920> in<00:02:49.580> this<00:02:49.670> case<00:02:49.940> we<00:02:50.180> have<00:02:50.390> a

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
leaving the part in this case we have a

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.410 
leaving the part in this case we have a
polyurethane<00:02:50.959> mold<00:02:51.500> of<00:02:51.650> a<00:02:51.709> human<00:02:51.980> face<00:02:52.420> and

polyurethane mold of a human face and

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.050 
polyurethane mold of a human face and
this<00:02:54.050> one<00:02:54.530> over<00:02:54.680> here<00:02:54.770> we<00:02:55.250> have<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.400> split<00:02:55.760> mold

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
this one over here we have a split mold

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.180 
this one over here we have a split mold
of<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.870> 9<00:02:57.050> millimeter<00:02:57.350> that<00:02:57.860> we<00:02:57.980> had

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
of the 9 millimeter that we had

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.210 
of the 9 millimeter that we had
demonstrated<00:02:58.790> earlier<00:02:59.950> so<00:03:00.950> what<00:03:01.070> we're<00:03:01.160> gonna

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
demonstrated earlier so what we're gonna

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.070 
demonstrated earlier so what we're gonna
do<00:03:01.430> is<00:03:01.489> give<00:03:01.670> it<00:03:01.730> a<00:03:01.820> light<00:03:02.030> coat<00:03:02.330> of<00:03:02.360> silicone

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
do is give it a light coat of silicone

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.699 
do is give it a light coat of silicone
spray

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.470 

I'll<00:03:09.709> let<00:03:09.860> the<00:03:09.980> molds<00:03:10.280> dry<00:03:10.550> for<00:03:10.910> maybe<00:03:11.060> one<00:03:11.390> or

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
I'll let the molds dry for maybe one or

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.910 
I'll let the molds dry for maybe one or
two<00:03:11.600> minutes<00:03:11.930> before<00:03:12.170> we<00:03:12.500> put<00:03:12.830> the

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
two minutes before we put the

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.800 
two minutes before we put the
hydrospanner<00:03:13.250> 400<00:03:13.880> into<00:03:14.150> it<00:03:14.270> we're<00:03:14.720> gonna

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
hydrospanner 400 into it we're gonna

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.140 
hydrospanner 400 into it we're gonna
show<00:03:14.989> you<00:03:15.019> how<00:03:15.140> to<00:03:15.230> mix<00:03:15.380> that<00:03:15.620> up<00:03:15.730> okay<00:03:16.730> so<00:03:16.790> now

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
show you how to mix that up okay so now

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.250 
show you how to mix that up okay so now
we're<00:03:17.390> going<00:03:17.480> to<00:03:17.540> demonstrate<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:17.989> product

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
we're going to demonstrate the product

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.470 
we're going to demonstrate the product
hider<00:03:18.530> span<00:03:18.830> 400<00:03:19.340> to<00:03:19.459> you<00:03:19.489> in<00:03:19.880> this<00:03:20.030> case<00:03:20.269> we've

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
hider span 400 to you in this case we've

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.850 
hider span 400 to you in this case we've
chosen<00:03:20.510> to<00:03:20.930> shrink<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.290> part<00:03:21.530> to<00:03:22.280> 30%<00:03:23.239> or<00:03:23.860> 70%

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
chosen to shrink the part to 30% or 70%

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.550 
chosen to shrink the part to 30% or 70%
less<00:03:25.519> than<00:03:25.820> the<00:03:25.910> volume<00:03:26.060> of<00:03:26.360> the<00:03:26.480> master<00:03:26.959> in

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
less than the volume of the master in

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.680 
less than the volume of the master in
this<00:03:27.650> case<00:03:27.920> if<00:03:28.430> it<00:03:28.549> were<00:03:28.580> like<00:03:28.880> a<00:03:28.940> 9<00:03:29.209> inch<00:03:29.390> tall

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
this case if it were like a 9 inch tall

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.199 
this case if it were like a 9 inch tall
image<00:03:30.620> it<00:03:30.920> would<00:03:31.040> shrink<00:03:31.310> down<00:03:31.459> to<00:03:31.549> 3<00:03:31.940> inches

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
image it would shrink down to 3 inches

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.210 
image it would shrink down to 3 inches
tall<00:03:32.480> so<00:03:32.750> I'll<00:03:33.200> get<00:03:33.320> my<00:03:33.470> water<00:03:33.650> ready<00:03:33.920> and<00:03:34.190> I

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
tall so I'll get my water ready and I

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.740 
tall so I'll get my water ready and I
want<00:03:34.370> to<00:03:34.430> use<00:03:34.549> ice-cold<00:03:35.000> water<00:03:35.299> to<00:03:35.420> give<00:03:35.540> me<00:03:35.660> as

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
want to use ice-cold water to give me as

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.690 
want to use ice-cold water to give me as
much<00:03:35.900> working<00:03:36.320> time<00:03:36.500> as<00:03:36.620> possible<00:03:37.130> so<00:03:37.580> have

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
much working time as possible so have

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.390 
much working time as possible so have
four<00:03:37.970> parts<00:03:38.209> water<00:03:38.390> here<00:03:38.810> by<00:03:38.989> weight<00:03:39.200> and<00:03:39.470> I

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
four parts water here by weight and I

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.490 
four parts water here by weight and I
have<00:03:40.549> my<00:03:40.700> Hydra<00:03:40.970> span<00:03:41.239> here<00:03:41.600> it's<00:03:42.380> already

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
have my Hydra span here it's already

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.170 
have my Hydra span here it's already
pre-measured<00:03:42.980> so<00:03:43.400> I'm<00:03:43.489> going<00:03:43.670> to<00:03:43.730> pour<00:03:43.940> this

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
pre-measured so I'm going to pour this

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.449 
pre-measured so I'm going to pour this
into<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:44.690> water<00:03:44.900> mix<00:03:45.590> with<00:03:45.860> a<00:03:45.890> flat<00:03:46.160> spatula

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
into the water mix with a flat spatula

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.490 
into the water mix with a flat spatula
not<00:03:47.060> a<00:03:47.090> round<00:03:47.360> or<00:03:47.510> square<00:03:47.600> and<00:03:48.350> then

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
not a round or square and then

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.440 
not a round or square and then
immediately<00:03:48.769> pour<00:03:49.340> this<00:03:49.489> into<00:03:49.730> my<00:03:49.970> molds

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
immediately pour this into my molds

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.110 
immediately pour this into my molds
taking<00:03:50.870> care<00:03:51.110> to<00:03:51.380> make<00:03:52.250> sure<00:03:52.670> that<00:03:52.790> I<00:03:52.850> get<00:03:52.970> it

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
taking care to make sure that I get it

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.460 
taking care to make sure that I get it
in<00:03:53.299> there<00:03:53.450> as<00:03:53.540> soon<00:03:53.750> as<00:03:53.870> possible<00:03:54.380> because

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
in there as soon as possible because

00:03:54.470 --> 00:05:34.540 
in there as soon as possible because
it's<00:03:54.799> fast<00:03:55.040> setting

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:38.539 
fast they set up in that case I used

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:40.809 
fast they set up in that case I used

dehydrator<00:07:07.250> would<00:07:07.759> work<00:07:07.969> as<00:07:08.120> well<00:07:08.360> too

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 
dehydrator would work as well too

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.600 
dehydrator would work as well too
but<00:07:09.319> if<00:07:09.409> you<00:07:09.500> do<00:07:09.590> it<00:07:09.710> too<00:07:09.860> fast<00:07:09.889> you<00:07:10.310> might<00:07:10.460> get

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:10.610 
but if you do it too fast you might get

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.519 
but if you do it too fast you might get
some<00:07:10.789> surface<00:07:11.150> cracking<00:07:11.569> so<00:07:12.020> the<00:07:12.139> best<00:07:12.349> thing

00:07:12.519 --> 00:07:12.529 
some surface cracking so the best thing

some surface cracking so the best thing
to<00:07:12.560> do<00:07:12.800> is<00:07:13.069> let<00:07:13.490> them<00:07:13.639> dehydrator<00:07:14.389> their<00:07:14.569> own

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:14.690 
to do is let them dehydrator their own
