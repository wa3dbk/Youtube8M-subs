hangar<00:03:16.930> does<00:03:17.110> we<00:03:17.800> have<00:03:17.980> it<00:03:18.070> set<00:03:18.220> up<00:03:18.280> here<00:03:18.520> on<00:03:18.610> a

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
hangar does we have it set up here on a

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.520 
hangar does we have it set up here on a
little<00:03:18.850> tree<00:03:19.060> up<00:03:19.270> about<00:03:19.570> it's<00:03:20.050> probably<00:03:20.350> a

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
little tree up about it's probably a

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.230 
little tree up about it's probably a
little<00:03:20.590> bit<00:03:20.770> about<00:03:20.920> waist<00:03:21.160> high<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:21.700> it's

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
little bit about waist high and it's

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.000 
little bit about waist high and it's
angled<00:03:22.570> back<00:03:22.720> towards<00:03:22.990> our<00:03:23.080> food<00:03:23.290> plot<00:03:23.560> so<00:03:23.920> it

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
angled back towards our food plot so it

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.890 
angled back towards our food plot so it
can<00:03:24.190> cover<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.550> whole<00:03:24.670> area<00:03:24.700> get<00:03:25.600> a<00:03:25.630> broad

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
can cover the whole area get a broad

view<00:03:26.580> also<00:03:27.580> what's<00:03:27.970> cool<00:03:28.180> about<00:03:28.240> this<00:03:28.480> is<00:03:28.540> you

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
view also what's cool about this is you

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.270 
view also what's cool about this is you
can<00:03:28.810> mount<00:03:29.080> it<00:03:29.170> up<00:03:29.290> higher<00:03:29.500> and<00:03:29.530> angle<00:03:30.010> it<00:03:30.070> down

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
can mount it up higher and angle it down

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.800 
can mount it up higher and angle it down
because<00:03:30.520> of<00:03:30.670> the<00:03:30.820> little<00:03:31.000> ball<00:03:31.240> system<00:03:31.690> that

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
because of the little ball system that

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.630 
because of the little ball system that
it's<00:03:31.930> got<00:03:32.110> where<00:03:32.260> if<00:03:32.350> you<00:03:32.470> loosen<00:03:32.830> it<00:03:32.950> you<00:03:33.490> can

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
it's got where if you loosen it you can

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.310 
it's got where if you loosen it you can
lean<00:03:33.820> it<00:03:33.970> either<00:03:34.060> way<00:03:34.330> an<00:03:34.600> don't<00:03:34.990> know<00:03:35.110> if<00:03:35.170> it

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
lean it either way an don't know if it

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.510 
lean it either way an don't know if it
picks<00:03:35.470> it<00:03:35.620> up<00:03:35.740> or<00:03:35.890> not<00:03:35.980> but<00:03:36.160> this<00:03:36.250> is<00:03:36.370> actually

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
picks it up or not but this is actually

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.450 
picks it up or not but this is actually
a<00:03:36.730> crooked<00:03:37.150> tree<00:03:37.420> so<00:03:38.050> we<00:03:38.800> actually<00:03:38.950> that<00:03:39.310> come

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:39.460 
a crooked tree so we actually that come

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.730 
a crooked tree so we actually that come
in<00:03:39.550> handy<00:03:39.730> because<00:03:39.820> we<00:03:40.060> had<00:03:40.150> to<00:03:40.210> use<00:03:40.270> the

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
in handy because we had to use the

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.410 
in handy because we had to use the
stakeout<00:03:41.740> system<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:42.430> sort<00:03:42.820> of<00:03:42.880> rotate<00:03:43.270> it

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
stakeout system and sort of rotate it

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:50.809 
stakeout system and sort of rotate it
back<00:03:43.600> so<00:03:43.900> it'd<00:03:44.020> be<00:03:44.170> level

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.239 

now<00:03:51.569> this<00:03:51.719> is<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:51.930> stakeouts<00:03:52.499> ticket<00:03:52.980> model

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:53.249 
now this is the stakeouts ticket model

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:55.160 
now this is the stakeouts ticket model
it<00:03:53.370> sneaks<00:03:53.700> down<00:03:53.909> on<00:03:53.999> the<00:03:54.060> ground<00:03:54.269> this<00:03:55.019> is

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
it sneaks down on the ground this is

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.899 
it sneaks down on the ground this is
perfect<00:03:55.379> if<00:03:55.680> you<00:03:55.739> don't<00:03:55.920> have<00:03:56.040> any<00:03:56.189> trees<00:03:56.489> next
