00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.470 
hey hey good morning everybody about
eight<00:00:10.679> o'clock<00:00:10.920> in<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.160> morning<00:00:11.519> here<00:00:12.349> I

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
eight o'clock in the morning here I

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.640 
eight o'clock in the morning here I
think<00:00:15.480> that<00:00:15.599> finally<00:00:15.839> kicked<00:00:16.199> any<00:00:16.379> bit<00:00:16.619> of

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
think that finally kicked any bit of

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.099 
think that finally kicked any bit of
what<00:00:17.520> might<00:00:17.670> have<00:00:17.760> been<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:17.940> residual<00:00:18.690> attempt

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
what might have been a residual attempt

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.439 
what might have been a residual attempt
for<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.289> flew<00:00:19.699> over<00:00:20.699> with<00:00:20.730> even<00:00:21.300> though<00:00:21.359> I've

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
for a flew over with even though I've

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.540 
for a flew over with even though I've
had<00:00:21.570> my<00:00:21.689> shot<00:00:21.949> you<00:00:22.949> still<00:00:23.160> always<00:00:23.310> get<00:00:23.519> a

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
had my shot you still always get a

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.240 
had my shot you still always get a
little<00:00:23.699> sick<00:00:23.970> around<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.240> time<00:00:24.449> here<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:25.470> did

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
little sick around the time here I did

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.290 
little sick around the time here I did
start<00:00:26.550> doing<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:28.250> start<00:00:29.250> building<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.789> SERR

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
start doing the start building the SERR

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.269 
start doing the start building the SERR
one<00:00:30.599> last<00:00:30.840> night<00:00:31.050> because<00:00:31.439> after<00:00:31.800> all<00:00:31.890> this<00:00:32.099> is

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
one last night because after all this is

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.639 
one last night because after all this is
the<00:00:32.309> first<00:00:32.700> in<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.930> build<00:00:34.140> series<00:00:34.469> which

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
the first in the build series which

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.319 
the first in the build series which
actually<00:00:35.250> looking<00:00:35.579> at<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.850> it's<00:00:36.000> gonna<00:00:36.120> be<00:00:36.210> a

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
actually looking at it it's gonna be a

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.970 
actually looking at it it's gonna be a
rather<00:00:36.690> short<00:00:37.140> build<00:00:37.469> series<00:00:37.710> because

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
rather short build series because

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.470 
rather short build series because
there's<00:00:38.129> not<00:00:38.309> really<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.850> much<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.120> this

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
there's not really that much to this

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.380 
there's not really that much to this
vehicle<00:00:39.960> itself<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:40.790> I'm<00:00:41.790> really<00:00:42.090> gonna<00:00:42.300> have

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
vehicle itself so I'm really gonna have

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.240 
vehicle itself so I'm really gonna have
to<00:00:42.510> stretch<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.960> out<00:00:43.079> but<00:00:43.410> last<00:00:43.649> night<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:43.920> did

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
to stretch it out but last night I did

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.690 
to stretch it out but last night I did
get<00:00:44.399> steps<00:00:44.760> 1<00:00:45.210> through<00:00:45.239> 4<00:00:45.780> completed<00:00:46.230> which

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
get steps 1 through 4 completed which

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.410 
get steps 1 through 4 completed which
the<00:00:47.700> end<00:00:47.910> result<00:00:48.300> gives<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:50.180> you<00:00:51.180> have<00:00:51.300> your

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
the end result gives you you have your

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.540 
the end result gives you you have your
chassis<00:00:52.280> these<00:00:53.280> are<00:00:53.430> your<00:00:53.610> link<00:00:53.850> mounts<00:00:54.300> you

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
chassis these are your link mounts you

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.950 
chassis these are your link mounts you
assemble<00:00:56.550> your<00:00:56.579> link<00:00:56.940> mounts<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.719> then<00:00:57.870> of

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
assemble your link mounts and then of

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.700 
assemble your link mounts and then of
course<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.230> attach<00:00:58.500> them<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.039> frame<00:00:59.309> and

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
course you attach them to the frame and

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.439 
course you attach them to the frame and
I<00:01:01.710> get<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.920> phone<00:01:02.219> call<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:02.760> we're<00:01:02.940> clipping

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
I get a phone call so we're clipping

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.450 
I get a phone call so we're clipping
this<00:01:03.600> one<00:01:03.780> right<00:01:04.019> here<00:01:06.860> through<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.010> magic<00:01:08.340> of

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
this one right here through the magic of

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.679 
this one right here through the magic of
editing<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:09.950> can<00:01:10.950> simultaneously<00:01:11.520> pop<00:01:12.240> back<00:01:12.450> to

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
editing I can simultaneously pop back to

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.670 
editing I can simultaneously pop back to
after<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.110> phone<00:01:13.320> call<00:01:14.840> anyways<00:01:15.840> I've<00:01:16.409> gone

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
after the phone call anyways I've gone

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.520 
after the phone call anyways I've gone
through<00:01:16.740> steps<00:01:17.460> one<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.939> four<00:01:18.240> which<00:01:19.229> took

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
through steps one to four which took

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.410 
through steps one to four which took
over<00:01:19.830> an<00:01:20.070> hour<00:01:20.189> just<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.640> do<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.909> because<00:01:21.270> of

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
over an hour just to do that because of

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.760 
over an hour just to do that because of
the<00:01:21.540> multiple<00:01:21.810> things<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.350> one<00:01:22.470> thing<00:01:22.650> I'm

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
the multiple things the one thing I'm

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.700 
the multiple things the one thing I'm
noticing<00:01:22.950> already<00:01:23.490> about<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.729> CRO<00:01:24.090> one<00:01:24.420> is

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
noticing already about the CRO one is

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.260 
noticing already about the CRO one is
it's<00:01:25.710> got<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> lot<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.250> plastic<00:01:26.520> parts<00:01:26.880> in<00:01:27.150> it

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
it's got a lot of plastic parts in it

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.700 
it's got a lot of plastic parts in it
like<00:01:27.479> here's<00:01:27.780> your<00:01:27.840> battery<00:01:28.200> tray<00:01:28.470> and

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
like here's your battery tray and

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.899 
like here's your battery tray and
imagining<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.610> where<00:01:29.759> you're<00:01:29.850> gonna

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
imagining this is where you're gonna

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.560 
imagining this is where you're gonna
mount<00:01:30.180> your<00:01:30.360> receiver<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:30.930> you're<00:01:32.329> all<00:01:33.329> that

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
mount your receiver and you're all that

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.039 
mount your receiver and you're all that
good<00:01:33.780> stuff<00:01:33.810> but<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:35.640> good<00:01:35.820> side<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.390> we<00:01:36.900> do

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
good stuff but the good side is we do

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.050 
good stuff but the good side is we do
have<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.290> twin<00:01:37.799> vertical<00:01:38.250> plate<00:01:38.430> chassis<00:01:38.909> which

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
have a twin vertical plate chassis which

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.649 
have a twin vertical plate chassis which
is<00:01:39.090> good<00:01:39.829> the<00:01:40.829> bad<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.340> it's<00:01:41.700> in<00:01:41.880> plastic<00:01:42.090> but

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
is good the bad is it's in plastic but

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.870 
is good the bad is it's in plastic but
as<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:42.990> can<00:01:43.110> see<00:01:43.340> there's<00:01:44.340> not<00:01:44.579> really<00:01:44.790> that

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
as you can see there's not really that

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.710 
as you can see there's not really that
many<00:01:45.149> plastic<00:01:45.750> pieces<00:01:46.170> for<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:47.479> pan<00:01:48.479> over

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
many plastic pieces for it a pan over

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.980 
many plastic pieces for it a pan over
here<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:49.140> there<00:01:49.470> here's<00:01:49.920> your<00:01:50.130> full

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
here to there here's your full

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.749 
here to there here's your full
differential<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.110> everything<00:01:52.460> this<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.729> a

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
differential and everything this is a

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.609 
differential and everything this is a
massive<00:01:54.299> improvement<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.840> must<00:01:55.079> say<00:01:55.229> over<00:01:55.530> the

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
massive improvement I must say over the

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.310 
massive improvement I must say over the
f3<00:01:56.009> 50s<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.850> f-350<00:01:57.509> transmission<00:01:58.110> when<00:01:58.290> I

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
f3 50s the f-350 transmission when I

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.740 
f3 50s the f-350 transmission when I
built<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.950> first<00:01:59.250> time<00:01:59.490> took<00:02:00.299> me<00:02:00.479> well

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
built it the first time took me well

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.510 
built it the first time took me well
over<00:02:01.110> an<00:02:01.200> hour<00:02:01.439> just<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.920> put<00:02:02.070> all<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.340> damn

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
over an hour just to put all the damn

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.740 
over an hour just to put all the damn
gears<00:02:02.850> together<00:02:03.500> but<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:05.000> digress<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.659> I'm

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
gears together but I digress and I'm

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.499 
gears together but I digress and I'm
getting<00:02:06.990> off<00:02:07.110> topic<00:02:07.140> already<00:02:08.060> we<00:02:09.060> don't<00:02:09.270> have

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
getting off topic already we don't have
