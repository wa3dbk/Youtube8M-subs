00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:04.350
 Today we all right in this video I do not want to comment on 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.010
 video game as I usually make clear should probably put in pictures of 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.740
 video game in the background thing and such but what I want to do here is to give my 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.840
 contribution to peace my opinion 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.070
 to this controversy interpress and executions 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.170
 for games 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.400
 if you are not familiar with the theme is the following there is a whole debate 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.359
 about what was better 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.689
 what is the best application you can give your money if you want to play 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.080
 videogame or you buy a consortium type ps3 conventional axn votes 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.730
 or you buy a pc a computer facing gaming 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.130
 What I want to do here to do is sort of make my fabric defense 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.210
 insist that they let me understand that everything I say here is contextual I am 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.670
 thinking here 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.140
 with which the best alternative to play I played in the Brazilian context 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:51.379
 You always have to think of everything. 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.879
 second in the context in which you are inserted own firm in science 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.530
 social reasons for the college only for this I did two subjects and social you do not 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.100
 know 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.190
 I learned a lot even in the social context but at last I will pass 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.280
 are afraid that now 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.040
 I separated 5 points 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.550
 I attach the things that indicate to me the principals who tend to believe that ps is 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.170
 a better option than the videogame that consolidates it is to play order 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.040
 let's go there first arrested 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.320
 in Brazil with very expensive sônia that is the question and you will already have 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.350
 that having a computer in your home no one lives today if a computer 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.390
 you already have to have a computer 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.250
 the contest is constant more men around to have a little more 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.150
 of a thousand reais only the device you can simply get the money you already 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.210
 the trip will already apply a computer you need a 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.159
 puts it on top of it plus those thousand reais even less 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.990
 what is your computer for playing video games and why? 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.820
 leaders often require a bit better honored than yesterday. 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:49.979
 computer that 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.810
 It's only used for the internet. It will dictate the clue. 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.110
 so you can have on a gaming computer in your house for the same price 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.670
 or bottom of the spout even if you 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.770
 would spend 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.420
 to have a computer and a video game 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.400
 This is my first thing and it can not even be in the Brazilian context. 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.250
 that consolidates it is expensive 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.920
 the second in terms of functionality why you want to spend that much on 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.419
 pc is a bit more expensive 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:17.719
 because it will gives you much more features of a console 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:20.999
 note for example if you give a pass to goal almost automatically 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:25.499
 you have a precedent for vittek to protest in favor of brother to edit 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:27.110
 video in high definition 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.750
 if you have several other things not only that but a good part of 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.350
 functionality of consulates 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.990
 withdrawal because you do not have all the multimedia options you 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.129
 Do you have and out of Brazil? 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.740
 Of course the benfica has now arrived in brazil you can be saved different 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.700
 by his consolidas he is not so good American tale 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.260
 and you do not have all the other all other entertainment options that the 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.199
 Americans have 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:53.619
 so I can ask you too I think this tce has an advantage 

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:54.870
 in relation to this 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.209
 and of course the extract of functionality you have all other things you 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.370
 can cause this 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.909
 for example records game if you want to make videos on the internet and thrashed 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.769
 easy you can have a game test I will give the freight something that is the program 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.060
 integrated played on me 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.140
 the ati hectares plus this functionality that one with turn alone can not 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.939
 to offer 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:16.599
 so I'll move on to the time that the third point that the inter was 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.910
 I do not understand if they have more interfaces 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.550
 the you have the option to play with the controller has a lot of game now that runs 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.070
 with the control of the pecém for the first time in the history of the pc you have a 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.930
 standardized control that control of assets is now also the control 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.549
 of standardized pc 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.720
 good part of the game already comes pre-configured price control not 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:37.980
 there is more that business that has to install configure control later 

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:39.019
 calibrate everything not 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.469
 it is only you plug the peak the control of users bocceli already work in ps that 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:45.650
 there is a game that only works with this control 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.490
 so for the first time we have a standardized control 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.980
 this is no longer an advantage that video games have in relation to which 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:52.750
 never happened 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.219
 that the consuls temper computer interface 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:59.209
 not only that but the computer you have is also the keyboard and mouse to avoid 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.700
 many people is the best option to play first-person game the game of 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:04.439
 shooting or any other type of game 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:07.879
 so I think he's the pc has this advantage relation 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:11.269
 in this part of the inter was nothing interfax interaction with it in relation to the 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:11.919
 functions 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:13.699
 The consortium has only control 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:16.680
 on pc now you have control you have the option too 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.850
 the attitude 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.340
 keyboard and mouse and of course I'm not going to put a 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.970
 Sort of because I think if you go to war of color to be assembled on Tuesday 21 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.610
 kinect or swaying a hard control Sunday then anyway 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.830
 ah think points also hamburg passes by port which is the last day is the sex 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.050
 of the speech teresina there was the modification modifications in the games 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.169
 citing a test you have this advantage games can be modified by the 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:45.849
 users even if it is not officially 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:47.750
 they are modified 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.780
 and this has caused an interesting phenomenon that is 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.590
 even those who do not have grinding support they end up creating content 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.050
 infinite generated for him because if you are very fan of the game 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:01.289
 you could on the internet search 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.599
 even after you play you have gone sad you should look for the 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:06.860
 modifications people make with the game 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.620
 the game became an almost 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.150
 indefinite in terms of time in a sentinel tv but actions is as follows 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.889
 you buy a game once you know the case of the molise community 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.610
 about being popular to this community you will always have new content to 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:22.370
 play well him 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.340
 and this is an advantage that only consolidate conceived a pc 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.600
 in relation to the consolidation of the consortium 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.960
 at least as far as I know 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.410
 And now I'm going to last if I miss a thorn, or I'll change my 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.659
 general that the purchase of games by download which is the following in porn 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:42.919
 europe clear you now have virtual markets d'bear sides consoles 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:46.669
 thing and such but do not think it's the place itself yeah you can do it 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:50.159
 all your games download and what is the advantage of systems like this like 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:53.770
 extinct not only are they cheap if you have several deals if you can 

00:05:53.769 --> 00:05:57.740
 take advantage but you pay same launch the same price in the game that 

00:05:57.739 --> 00:05:59.039
 An American is paying 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:03.169
 exactly the same the same present they have a team can standardization of 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:03.680
 prices 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.360
 to the whole world 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.930
 then nothing from you buy for example a real 200 launch in the store when 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.650
 US blackout 50 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.669
 united states wing 50 dollars 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:18.050
 if you have posted $ 50 pramerica in the estendal you will pay 50 dollars 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.729
 and this is a big advantage over functions because 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:24.569
 nowadays everyone wants to play original game because it has the issue of 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:27.169
 online gameplay and such and such 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:29.169
 and not with too expensive request 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:32.870
 on the pc it gets much cheaper off the promotions that the scheme hurts volpi 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.090
 - you can buy several games for a very low price then there are those 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.800
 are my opinions because what I think today in the Brazilian context 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.180
 it's worth having a game pc 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.949
 than a video of him to play 

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:47.590
 of the consoli q1 consoli was on the floor with salin violins retarded olinda is 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.649
 all for the game itself 

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:52.739
 leave this opinion in the comments think if you will agree with me 

00:06:52.739 --> 00:06:53.760
 disagree 

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.600
 Everyone has the right to have their opinion this is my face told 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.599
 holiday nobody if you prefer consolidate ressacada 

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:03.139
 if you got money to buy everybody better still lucky just so I wanted 

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:04.439
 so much that its place 

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:06.669
 more than 75 solar 

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:11.029
 but anyway I'll stay here till the next we do not forget to have 

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:14.029
 did you like this active video in your favorites and 

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:20.340
 Thanks guys until the next rudder.
