00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
base that will make it you know like say

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.910 
base that will make it you know like say
opaque<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.610> then<00:02:12.030> add<00:02:12.510> your<00:02:12.540> turquoise

way you want and let it sit this this
titanium<00:02:26.340> white<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:26.989> the<00:02:27.989> same<00:02:28.200> thing<00:02:28.410> with

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
titanium white and the same thing with

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.240 
titanium white and the same thing with
this<00:02:29.120> graphite<00:02:30.120> here<00:02:30.620> they<00:02:31.620> don't<00:02:31.920> seem<00:02:32.190> to

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
this graphite here they don't seem to

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.760 
this graphite here they don't seem to
totally<00:02:32.880> dissolve<00:02:33.270> and<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:34.170> powder<00:02:34.410> will

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
totally dissolve and the powder will

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.120 
totally dissolve and the powder will
drop<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.370> bottom<00:02:35.520> of<00:02:35.900> your<00:02:36.900> mix<00:02:37.319> so<00:02:37.739> you

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
drop to the bottom of your mix so you

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.500 
drop to the bottom of your mix so you
know<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:38.310> just<00:02:38.550> let<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:38.790> sit<00:02:38.880> in<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.150> cup<00:02:39.360> for

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
know you just let it sit in that cup for

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.960 
know you just let it sit in that cup for
a<00:02:39.569> little<00:02:39.660> while<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.170> it'll<00:02:40.640> it'll<00:02:41.640> get<00:02:41.819> down

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
a little while and it'll it'll get down

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.420 
a little while and it'll it'll get down
here<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.239> the<00:02:42.300> bottom<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.900> just<00:02:43.709> don't<00:02:44.130> pour

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
here to the bottom and just don't pour

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.449 
here to the bottom and just don't pour
it<00:02:44.550> all<00:02:44.640> into<00:02:44.910> your<00:02:45.239> into<00:02:45.930> your<00:02:45.959> mold<00:02:46.310> you<00:02:47.310> can

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
it all into your into your mold you can

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.840 
it all into your into your mold you can
see<00:02:47.610> here<00:02:47.790> this<00:02:47.940> this<00:02:48.709> well<00:02:49.709> okay<00:02:49.950> this<00:02:50.310> never

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
see here this this well okay this never

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.340 
see here this this well okay this never
mind<00:02:51.060> forget<00:02:51.600> I<00:02:51.660> said<00:02:51.750> then<00:02:54.110> anyway<00:02:55.110> but<00:02:55.230> yeah

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
you will let that sit and then come over

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.360 
you will let that sit and then come over
here<00:02:57.360> get<00:02:57.810> your<00:02:57.959> graphite<00:02:58.380> black<00:02:58.620> you're<00:02:59.280> not

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
here get your graphite black you're not

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.770 
here get your graphite black you're not
going<00:02:59.489> to<00:02:59.549> make<00:02:59.640> it<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.819> whole<00:03:00.330> lot<00:03:00.360> of<00:03:00.630> this

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
going to make it a whole lot of this

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.729 
going to make it a whole lot of this
just<00:03:01.769> just<00:03:02.340> enough<00:03:02.580> to<00:03:02.700> make<00:03:02.730> a<00:03:02.850> thin<00:03:03.120> layer

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
just just enough to make a thin layer

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.120 
just just enough to make a thin layer
across<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:04.980> top<00:03:05.160> of<00:03:05.190> your<00:03:05.430> black<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.910> so<00:03:07.130> once

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
across the top of your black and so once

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.160 
across the top of your black and so once
this<00:03:08.250> is<00:03:08.459> made<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:09.360> this<00:03:09.390> is<00:03:09.690> made<00:03:09.900> your

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
this is made and this is made your

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.259 
this is made and this is made your
turquoise<00:03:10.470> is<00:03:10.709> everything<00:03:11.130> good<00:03:11.370> you're

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
going to go ahead and add your catalyst

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.349 
going to go ahead and add your catalyst
and<00:03:14.840> stir<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:15.870> up<00:03:16.019> real<00:03:16.200> gently<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:16.920> then<00:03:17.359> and

and stir it up real gently and then and

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:19.640 
and stir it up real gently and then and
here's<00:03:18.600> something<00:03:18.750> I<00:03:18.870> got<00:03:18.989> to<00:03:19.049> apologize<00:03:19.200> for

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.110 
here's something I got to apologize for
two<00:03:19.829> I<00:03:20.070> don't<00:03:20.400> remember<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.790> name<00:03:20.910> of<00:03:20.970> this

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
two I don't remember the name of this

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.030 
two I don't remember the name of this
stuff<00:03:21.390> if<00:03:21.630> you're<00:03:22.200> working<00:03:22.500> with<00:03:22.590> resin<00:03:22.890> right

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
stuff if you're working with resin right

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.509 
stuff if you're working with resin right
now<00:03:23.190> you<00:03:23.730> probably<00:03:24.829> have<00:03:25.829> some<00:03:26.130> sort<00:03:26.370> of<00:03:26.430> idea

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
now you probably have some sort of idea

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.720 
now you probably have some sort of idea
of<00:03:26.790> what<00:03:26.940> this<00:03:27.060> crap<00:03:27.359> is<00:03:27.540> it's<00:03:27.750> purple<00:03:28.579> you<00:03:29.579> add

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
of what this crap is it's purple you add

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.490 
of what this crap is it's purple you add
like<00:03:29.940> two<00:03:30.090> or<00:03:30.209> three<00:03:30.239> drops<00:03:30.720> and<00:03:31.079> that's

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
like two or three drops and that's

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.740 
like two or three drops and that's
probably<00:03:31.880> begging<00:03:32.880> for<00:03:33.030> trouble<00:03:33.180> I<00:03:33.390> mean<00:03:33.540> just

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
probably begging for trouble I mean just

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.009 
probably begging for trouble I mean just
it<00:03:34.380> heats<00:03:34.890> your<00:03:35.070> mix<00:03:35.250> up<00:03:35.430> real<00:03:35.670> quick<00:03:35.910> and<00:03:36.150> it's

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
it heats your mix up real quick and it's

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.220 
it heats your mix up real quick and it's
a<00:03:37.140> super<00:03:37.560> accelerator<00:03:38.100> I<00:03:38.810> camera<00:03:39.810> what<00:03:40.019> it<00:03:40.109> is

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
a super accelerator I camera what it is

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.069 
a super accelerator I camera what it is
but<00:03:40.790> once<00:03:41.790> you've<00:03:41.940> added<00:03:42.030> your<00:03:42.239> catalyst<00:03:42.840> I

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
but once you've added your catalyst I

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.710 
but once you've added your catalyst I
don't<00:03:43.709> know<00:03:43.829> if<00:03:43.950> you<00:03:44.130> even<00:03:44.459> need<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.299> catalyst

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
don't know if you even need the catalyst

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.699 
don't know if you even need the catalyst
if<00:03:45.810> you're<00:03:45.900> going<00:03:45.989> to<00:03:46.049> use<00:03:46.200> this<00:03:46.350> but<00:03:46.500> I<00:03:46.530> always

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
if you're going to use this but I always

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.759 
if you're going to use this but I always
used<00:03:46.980> it<00:03:47.100> anyway<00:03:47.430> how<00:03:48.209> did<00:03:48.390> this<00:03:48.540> add<00:03:48.989> two<00:03:49.680> or

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
used it anyway how did this add two or

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.050 
used it anyway how did this add two or
three<00:03:49.920> drops<00:03:50.160> of<00:03:50.310> this<00:03:50.459> because<00:03:50.670> I<00:03:50.790> wanted<00:03:51.000> to

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
three drops of this because I wanted to

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.430 
three drops of this because I wanted to
get<00:03:51.180> hot<00:03:51.420> quick<00:03:51.720> so<00:03:51.870> I'm<00:03:51.959> not<00:03:52.079> sitting<00:03:52.290> around

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
get hot quick so I'm not sitting around

you've got that black the layer of black
on<00:05:07.110> the<00:05:07.140> top<00:05:07.350> you're<00:05:07.620> going<00:05:07.710> to<00:05:07.800> go<00:05:08.760> ahead<00:05:08.850> and

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
on the top you're going to go ahead and

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.770 
on the top you're going to go ahead and
cut<00:05:09.300> into<00:05:09.690> this<00:05:09.900> thing<00:05:10.140> and<00:05:11.330> you<00:05:12.330> can<00:05:12.510> and<00:05:12.750> just

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
cut into this thing and you can and just

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.420 
cut into this thing and you can and just
cut<00:05:13.230> through<00:05:13.440> and<00:05:13.800> I<00:05:13.920> like<00:05:14.100> using<00:05:14.250> this

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
cut through and I like using this

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.220 
cut through and I like using this
because<00:05:14.700> I<00:05:14.730> can<00:05:14.970> spin<00:05:15.300> this<00:05:15.510> as<00:05:15.780> I'm<00:05:15.960> cutting

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
because I can spin this as I'm cutting

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.590 
because I can spin this as I'm cutting
and<00:05:16.530> I<00:05:16.560> can<00:05:16.710> change<00:05:16.920> directions<00:05:17.370> and<00:05:17.910> still

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
and I can change directions and still

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.780 
and I can change directions and still
have<00:05:18.810> like<00:05:19.020> a<00:05:19.050> leading<00:05:19.500> edge<00:05:19.710> even<00:05:19.890> though<00:05:20.130> I'm

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
have like a leading edge even though I'm

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.940 
have like a leading edge even though I'm
you<00:05:21.060> know<00:05:21.180> and<00:05:21.480> I'm<00:05:21.810> like<00:05:21.990> tearing<00:05:22.680> stuff

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
you know and I'm like tearing stuff

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.430 
you know and I'm like tearing stuff
behind<00:05:23.220> it<00:05:23.550> which<00:05:24.270> is<00:05:24.480> you<00:05:25.050> know<00:05:25.080> going<00:05:25.350> to

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
behind it which is you know going to

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.860 
behind it which is you know going to
create<00:05:25.740> a<00:05:25.830> nice<00:05:26.040> effect<00:05:26.250> and<00:05:26.760> you<00:05:27.630> know<00:05:27.720> maybe

circles make sure that you come in from

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:33.800 
circles make sure that you come in from
other<00:05:32.520> directions<00:05:32.790> to<00:05:33.060> coming<00:05:33.390> to<00:05:33.420> the<00:05:33.540> side

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
other directions to coming to the side

have a big layer of black on the top you
know<00:06:52.530> and<00:06:52.710> that's<00:06:52.830> what<00:06:53.009> this<00:06:53.129> was<00:06:53.400> this<00:06:53.580> was<00:06:53.639> a

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:05.220 
on the bottom from all the powder

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.159 
on the bottom from all the powder
dropping<00:07:05.729> so<00:07:06.090> you<00:07:06.180> know<00:07:06.479> your<00:07:06.659> sweet<00:07:06.930> spots

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 
going to be in the middle so the deeper

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.460 
going to be in the middle so the deeper
is<00:07:08.460> what<00:07:08.639> you<00:07:08.759> use<00:07:09.000> in<00:07:09.150> the<00:07:09.240> better<00:07:09.419> that<00:07:10.379> way
