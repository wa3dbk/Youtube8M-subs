00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
personally it wouldn't work because as

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.940 
personally it wouldn't work because as
most<00:02:00.359> of<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.599> know<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.779> like<00:02:01.169> to<00:02:01.380> do<00:02:01.560> what<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.829> do

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
most of you know I like to do what I do

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.789 
most of you know I like to do what I do
the<00:02:02.459> best<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.969> can<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.929> like<00:02:04.139> to<00:02:04.289> try<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.740> be

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
the best I can and I like to try and be

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.639 
the best I can and I like to try and be
the<00:02:05.579> best<00:02:05.939> at<00:02:06.240> whatever<00:02:06.539> I'm<00:02:06.869> doing<00:02:06.899> so

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
the best at whatever I'm doing so

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.740 
the best at whatever I'm doing so
basically<00:02:08.250> i<00:02:08.280> had<00:02:08.490> to<00:02:08.580> optimize<00:02:09.090> all<00:02:09.119> my<00:02:09.450> stuff

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
basically i had to optimize all my stuff

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.660 
basically i had to optimize all my stuff
and<00:02:11.720> there<00:02:12.720> isn't<00:02:13.019> even<00:02:13.170> any<00:02:13.530> actual<00:02:14.159> theory

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
and there isn't even any actual theory

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.880 
and there isn't even any actual theory
or<00:02:14.819> crafting<00:02:15.299> behind<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:16.260> stuff<00:02:16.560> that<00:02:16.799> I'm

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
or crafting behind the stuff that I'm

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:17.340 
or crafting behind the stuff that I'm
trying<00:02:17.129> to

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
trying to

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.990 
trying to
search<00:02:17.530> for<00:02:17.560> which<00:02:18.430> makes<00:02:18.670> it<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:18.850> lot<00:02:18.940> harder

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
search for which makes it a lot harder

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.730 
search for which makes it a lot harder
so<00:02:19.480> I've<00:02:19.630> been<00:02:19.840> arguing<00:02:20.380> with<00:02:20.500> a<00:02:20.530> lot<00:02:20.710> of

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
so I've been arguing with a lot of

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.590 
so I've been arguing with a lot of
people<00:02:21.130> back<00:02:21.520> and<00:02:21.700> forth<00:02:21.790> what<00:02:22.210> we<00:02:22.300> should<00:02:22.480> be

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
people back and forth what we should be

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.560 
people back and forth what we should be
doing<00:02:22.630> and<00:02:23.050> blah<00:02:23.590> blah<00:02:23.620> blah<00:02:23.800> but<00:02:24.220> anyways

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
doing and blah blah blah but anyways

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.730 
doing and blah blah blah but anyways
that's<00:02:25.570> beyond<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.020> point<00:02:26.080> that's<00:02:26.440> going<00:02:26.680> to

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
that's beyond the point that's going to

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.520
