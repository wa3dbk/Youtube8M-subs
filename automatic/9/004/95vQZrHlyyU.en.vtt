00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.910
 for us to once again do matter of 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.990
 Um, an interned thing with a videogame. 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.120
 It's always that there's something very 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.009
 interesting the nerd universe some 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.100
 something that I think is worth 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.350
 to produce a candy why do you look at it here? 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:23.789
 It's a drone plus a different owner . 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.439
 imagine the group of scientists in the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.109
 engineers 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.359
 they developed a drone that gives to 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.040
 you first put a steal on 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.930
 up actually made large 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.969
 as a prototype and saw that you can 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.510
 put there as if it were some sort of 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.270
 a shop and physically speaking and 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.789
 developed the gigantic drone that 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:49.829
 it fits a person sitting up like this 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.760
 As the stormtroopers I already said that 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.559
 it 's no excuse 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.120
 guys, I did not leave the video because 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.510
 use it in the star wars group is just the 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.820
 The little black girl remembers the one they fly in 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.320
 a kind of motorcycle spoke csa and never 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.180
 There's going to be that guy. 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.740
 the first one to be a normal game is 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.049
 to the gigantic space of a 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.200
 helicopter but they did not get the 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.750
 drone propellers and join and leave until 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.860
 one superimposes the other is to speak is that 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.020
 business does not fly 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.020
 I have this video here myself 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.119
 engineer flying in this two best 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.670
 They do not fly because they put the ropes on the ground. 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.409
 It 's possible that the business had a 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.159
 easy to control 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.970
 but even this one is the prototype 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.880
 he did 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.409
 the quiet drone shows he can handle 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.320
 a certain weight even civil and with the 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.909
 robozinho on up then to the part 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.210
 aerodynamics john person sitting on top 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:49.409
 is possible according to the prototype and 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.090
 they also have until you see the image of the 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.880
 face of truth 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.940
 sitting on that prototype he made 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.330
 gigantic a flying motorbike 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:03.120
 here looks're just seeing this prototype 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:07.880
 has the strength to pull a raised face 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:12.150
 actually flying practically flying 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.790
 O alibi from below assuring only these 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.060
 strings causing it to not reach the 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.460
 very cool heights are we the fashion 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.410
 Take something that bothered me a little. 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.880
 because it is not symmetrical because of the 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.130
 to have one on top of the other 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.080
 and it looks like business will be crooked when 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.290
 Imagine a flying motorcycle imagines 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.600
 whole symmetrical topless mass and was 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.930
 to cause one on top of the other 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.840
 it is possible according to him to leave this 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.910
 method has another on the 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.770
 internet experiments with only two 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.120
 a party a little behind but I think 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.120
 would not give as much stability as this. 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.000
 a bit
