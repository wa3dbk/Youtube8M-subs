00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
screen right now no it's WB no it's

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.299 
screen right now no it's WB no it's
pointed<00:00:41.340> out<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.640> I'm<00:00:42.800> that<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.950> know<00:00:44.070> that

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
pointed out that I'm that you know that

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.110 
pointed out that I'm that you know that
this<00:00:44.700> wall<00:00:45.360> was<00:00:45.870> like<00:00:46.129> behind<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.820> render

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
this wall was like behind the render

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.490 
this wall was like behind the render
distance<00:00:48.239> so<00:00:48.629> you'd<00:00:48.750> like<00:00:48.930> there's<00:00:49.320> like<00:00:49.469> a

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
distance so you'd like there's like a

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.990 
distance so you'd like there's like a
black<00:00:49.860> line<00:00:50.190> here<00:00:50.219> even<00:00:50.730> though<00:00:50.820> there

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
black line here even though there

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000 
black line here even though there
shouldn't<00:00:51.210> be<00:00:51.300> because<00:00:51.660> clearly<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.649> is

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
shouldn't be because clearly this is

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.950 
shouldn't be because clearly this is
like<00:00:53.250> very<00:00:53.610> close<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.059> camera<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.690> that

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
like very close to the camera and that

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.600 
like very close to the camera and that
it<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.530> know<00:00:55.620> it's<00:00:55.770> like<00:00:55.800> it's<00:00:56.039> not<00:00:56.160> properly

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
it you know it's like it's not properly

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.520 
it you know it's like it's not properly
arranged<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.750> thought<00:00:57.930> well<00:00:58.199> yeah<00:00:58.379> that's

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
arranged and I thought well yeah that's

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.040 
arranged and I thought well yeah that's
actually<00:00:58.800> quite<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.190> case<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.820> that's<00:01:00.750> true

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
actually quite the case and that's true

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.630 
actually quite the case and that's true
you<00:01:01.079> know<00:01:01.260> let's<00:01:01.559> solve<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.309> thought

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
you know let's solve that so I thought

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.600 
you know let's solve that so I thought
that<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.850> make<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> little<00:01:03.359> episode<00:01:04.549> for<00:01:05.549> you

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
that I make a little episode for you

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.039 
that I make a little episode for you
guys<00:01:05.670> hopefully<00:01:06.630> without<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.350> know<00:01:07.470> carving

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
guys hopefully without you know carving

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.140 
guys hopefully without you know carving
on<00:01:10.049> how<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.320> actually<00:01:10.590> basically<00:01:11.549> position

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
on how to actually basically position

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.420 
on how to actually basically position
these<00:01:12.270> walls<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:12.750> front<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.950> render

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
these walls in front of the render

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.950 
these walls in front of the render
distance<00:01:15.049> limiter<00:01:16.049> alrighty<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:16.830> um<00:01:17.960> let's

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
distance limiter alrighty so um let's

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.660 
distance limiter alrighty so um let's
let's<00:01:19.080> jump<00:01:19.500> into<00:01:19.740> our<00:01:19.770> render<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.310> our

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
let's jump into our render that our

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.090 
let's jump into our render that our
render<00:01:21.090> 3d<00:01:21.570> class<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.229> always<00:01:22.380> say<00:01:22.619> render<00:01:22.920> dot

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
render 3d class I always say render dot

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.980 
render 3d class I always say render dot
3d<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.490> don't<00:01:23.700> know<00:01:23.790> even<00:01:24.060> know<00:01:24.180> why<00:01:24.509> but<00:01:24.840> um

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
3d I don't know even know why but um

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.170 
3d I don't know even know why but um
render<00:01:25.710> 3d<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.159> basically<00:01:26.790> you'll<00:01:27.000> say<00:01:27.150> that

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
render 3d and basically you'll say that

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.359 
render 3d and basically you'll say that
in<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.900> in<00:01:28.259> his<00:01:28.380> floor<00:01:28.650> method<00:01:28.979> we've<00:01:29.130> not

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
in this I in his floor method we've not

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.749 
in this I in his floor method we've not
like<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:29.700> whole<00:01:29.970> like<00:01:30.299> wall<00:01:31.110> stuff<00:01:31.439> and

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
like this whole like wall stuff and

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.660 
like this whole like wall stuff and
let's<00:01:32.759> grab<00:01:33.090> all<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.420> this<00:01:33.720> card<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.650> up<00:01:35.159> until

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
let's grab all of this card so up until

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.249 
let's grab all of this card so up until
the<00:01:35.820> last<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.450> Kelly<00:01:36.659> bracket<00:01:37.079> parentheses

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
the last and Kelly bracket parentheses

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.399 
the last and Kelly bracket parentheses
whatever<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.070> want<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.250> call<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.900> so<00:01:39.900> you're

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
whatever you want to call it so you're

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.960 
whatever you want to call it so you're
copping<00:01:40.590> from<00:01:40.890> random<00:01:41.280> random<00:01:41.610> equals<00:01:41.850> new

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
copping from random random equals new

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.420 
copping from random random equals new
random<00:01:42.259> and<00:01:43.259> from<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:44.070> will<00:01:44.189> basically

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
random and from that that will basically

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.010 
random and from that that will basically
all<00:01:44.700> all<00:01:44.970> over<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.180> wall<00:01:45.390> code<00:01:45.630> let's<00:01:45.869> just

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
all all over the wall code let's just

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.969 
all all over the wall code let's just
cut<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.259> control<00:01:46.710> X<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:48.530> let's<00:01:49.530> close<00:01:49.740> up<00:01:49.860> this

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
cut a control X and let's close up this

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.550 
cut a control X and let's close up this
method<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:50.579> if<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.850> put<00:01:51.630> your<00:01:51.750> cursor<00:01:52.259> thing

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
method so if you put your cursor thing

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.980 
method so if you put your cursor thing
that<00:01:52.770> you'll<00:01:53.369> see<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.790> that<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.540> floor

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
that you'll see that that is the floor

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.209 
that you'll see that that is the floor
method<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:56.960> let's<00:01:57.960> just<00:01:58.229> type<00:01:58.560> public<00:01:59.040> void

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
method and let's just type public void

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.980 
method and let's just type public void
so<00:01:59.640> by<00:01:59.729> making<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.060> new<00:02:00.240> method<00:02:00.600> just<00:02:00.750> for<00:02:00.930> the

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
so by making a new method just for the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.469 
so by making a new method just for the
wall<00:02:01.170> stuff<00:02:01.439> public<00:02:01.860> void<00:02:02.130> walls<00:02:02.520> ago<00:02:03.119> school

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
wall stuff public void walls ago school

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.059 
wall stuff public void walls ago school
walls<00:02:04.640> with<00:02:05.640> no<00:02:05.790> parameters<00:02:06.270> we<00:02:06.689> have<00:02:07.069> game

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
walls with no parameters we have game

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.729 
walls with no parameters we have game
game<00:02:08.369> here<00:02:08.610> because<00:02:08.759> we<00:02:09.030> actually<00:02:09.149> use<00:02:09.739> game

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
game here because we actually use game

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.920 
game here because we actually use game

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.850 
nanny
anything<00:02:14.010> also<00:02:14.460> just<00:02:15.000> leave<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.710> space<00:02:16.710> in

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
anything also just leave the space in

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.060 
anything also just leave the space in
there<00:02:17.010> blank<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.990> paste<00:02:18.990> all<00:02:19.380> of<00:02:19.440> this<00:02:19.830> code

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
there blank and paste all of this code

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.410 
there blank and paste all of this code
so<00:02:20.960> our<00:02:21.960> wall<00:02:23.000> I'm<00:02:24.000> sorry

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
so our wall I'm sorry

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.550 
so our wall I'm sorry
now<00:02:25.140> walls<00:02:25.590> method<00:02:26.180> now<00:02:27.180> has<00:02:27.510> all<00:02:27.960> of<00:02:28.020> our<00:02:28.350> wall

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
now walls method now has all of our wall

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.200 
now walls method now has all of our wall
code<00:02:28.770> in<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:29.100> okay<00:02:29.310> so<00:02:29.370> right<00:02:30.030> off<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.120> bat

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
code in it okay so right off the bat

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.040 
code in it okay so right off the bat
we've<00:02:30.420> got<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.540> problem

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
we've got a problem

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.930 
we've got a problem
forward<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.100> know<00:02:32.190> can't<00:02:32.430> be<00:02:32.520> results<00:02:32.820> well

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
forward you know can't be results well

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.730 
forward you know can't be results well
variable<00:02:33.330> because<00:02:33.630> it<00:02:33.930> is<00:02:34.170> inside<00:02:34.500> this

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
variable because it is inside this

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.440 
variable because it is inside this
method<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.310> we<00:02:35.670> can't<00:02:35.880> use<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.060> that<00:02:36.270> way<00:02:36.300> so

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
method and we can't use it that way so

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.540 
method and we can't use it that way so
it's<00:02:37.320> where<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.710> solve<00:02:37.920> that<00:02:38.040> is<00:02:38.220> just<00:02:38.370> go

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
it's where to solve that is just go

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.600 
it's where to solve that is just go
public<00:02:39.650> he<00:02:40.650> doesn't<00:02:40.860> even<00:02:40.920> have<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.130> be<00:02:41.190> public

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
public he doesn't even have to be public

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.500 
public he doesn't even have to be public
it<00:02:42.300> can<00:02:42.390> be<00:02:42.450> private<00:02:42.680> private<00:02:43.680> double<00:02:44.510> forward

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
it can be private private double forward

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.790 
it can be private private double forward
and<00:02:45.690> I'm<00:02:45.810> just<00:02:45.900> going<00:02:46.050> to<00:02:46.080> call<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:46.320> forward

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
and I'm just going to call it forward

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.970 
and I'm just going to call it forward
global<00:02:47.610> because<00:02:48.300> well<00:02:48.960> you<00:02:49.170> know<00:02:49.290> it's<00:02:49.470> it's

global because well you know it's it's

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.190 
global because well you know it's it's
global<00:02:50.640> for<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:50.880> class<00:02:51.120> not<00:02:51.630> just<00:02:51.870> for<00:02:52.050> the

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
global for the class not just for the

we<00:02:54.600> weren't<00:02:54.870> actually<00:02:54.990> a<00:02:55.170> sign<00:02:55.350> into<00:02:55.530> anything

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
we weren't actually a sign into anything

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.000 
we weren't actually a sign into anything
let's<00:02:56.850> just<00:02:56.880> go<00:02:57.120> here<00:02:57.360> and<00:02:57.710> where<00:02:58.710> we<00:02:58.830> see

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
let's just go here and where we see

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.770 
let's just go here and where we see
forward<00:02:59.580> under<00:02:59.760> fold<00:03:00.240> literature<00:03:00.570> type

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
forward under fold literature type

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.660 
forward under fold literature type
forward<00:03:01.770> global<00:03:03.320> equals<00:03:04.320> forward<00:03:04.770> so<00:03:05.520> we're

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
forward global equals forward so we're

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.430 
forward global equals forward so we're
assigning<00:03:08.240> forward<00:03:09.240> so<00:03:09.810> we're<00:03:09.930> signing<00:03:10.170> on

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
assigning forward so we're signing on

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.650 
assigning forward so we're signing on
global<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.550> whatever<00:03:11.910> forward<00:03:12.360> is<00:03:12.450> at<00:03:12.600> the

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
global to whatever forward is at the

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.600 
global to whatever forward is at the
moment<00:03:12.980> and<00:03:14.900> yeah<00:03:16.040> and<00:03:17.040> that<00:03:17.220> should<00:03:17.370> be<00:03:17.430> fine

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
moment and yeah and that should be fine

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.730 
moment and yeah and that should be fine
and<00:03:17.850> let's<00:03:18.390> just<00:03:18.540> grab<00:03:18.900> that<00:03:19.050> copy<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:19.500> paste

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
and let's just grab that copy and paste

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.530 
and let's just grab that copy and paste
that<00:03:19.950> into<00:03:20.250> all<00:03:20.790> these<00:03:21.030> ones<00:03:21.270> so<00:03:21.360> we're

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
that into all these ones so we're

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.080 
that into all these ones so we're
changing<00:03:21.690> forward<00:03:22.140> global<00:03:22.230> to<00:03:22.620> forward<00:03:23.090> sorry

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
changing forward global to forward sorry

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.360 
changing forward global to forward sorry
which<00:03:24.210> as<00:03:24.360> you<00:03:24.480> forward<00:03:24.750> to<00:03:24.960> forward<00:03:25.260> global

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
which as you forward to forward global

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.340 
which as you forward to forward global
so<00:03:26.370> that<00:03:26.520> now<00:03:26.640> we<00:03:26.700> we<00:03:27.420> get<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.720> actual<00:03:28.020> data

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
so that now we we get the actual data

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.840 
so that now we we get the actual data
that<00:03:28.500> we<00:03:28.680> need<00:03:30.380> all<00:03:31.380> right<00:03:31.410> I<00:03:32.130> should<00:03:32.490> say<00:03:32.610> this

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
that we need all right I should say this

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.760 
that we need all right I should say this
way<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.060> solve<00:03:33.300> it<00:03:33.420> in<00:03:33.810> my<00:03:33.990> opinion<00:03:34.170> anyway

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
way to solve it in my opinion anyway

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.040 
way to solve it in my opinion anyway
okay<00:03:35.190> so<00:03:35.220> if<00:03:35.700> we<00:03:35.880> run<00:03:36.150> this<00:03:36.360> let's<00:03:36.660> just<00:03:36.810> ah

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
okay so if we run this let's just ah

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.530 
okay so if we run this let's just ah
actually<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.460> probably<00:03:38.760> won't<00:03:38.880> display<00:03:39.060> okay

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
actually it probably won't display okay

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.000 
actually it probably won't display okay
it's<00:03:39.690> not<00:03:39.750> saying<00:03:40.050> I<00:03:40.170> wall<00:03:42.230> okay<00:03:43.230> so<00:03:43.290> now<00:03:43.650> what

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
it's not saying I wall okay so now what

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.940 
it's not saying I wall okay so now what
we've<00:03:44.160> essentially<00:03:44.610> done<00:03:44.910> is<00:03:45.500> it's<00:03:46.500> put<00:03:46.770> all

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
we've essentially done is it's put all

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.140 
we've essentially done is it's put all
of<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.190> wall<00:03:47.400> code<00:03:47.700> into<00:03:48.270> a<00:03:48.380> into<00:03:49.380> a<00:03:50.150> walls

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
of the wall code into a into a walls

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.420 
of the wall code into a into a walls
method<00:03:51.630> so<00:03:52.200> now<00:03:52.350> let's<00:03:52.530> go<00:03:52.680> into<00:03:52.860> our<00:03:52.890> screen

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
method so now let's go into our screen

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.190 
method so now let's go into our screen
class<00:03:53.700> because<00:03:54.090> remember<00:03:54.300> the<00:03:54.540> screen<00:03:54.810> java

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
class because remember the screen java

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.600 
class because remember the screen java
class<00:03:55.470> is<00:03:55.620> what<00:03:55.800> actually<00:03:55.950> renders<00:03:56.460> this

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
class is what actually renders this

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.400 
class is what actually renders this
stuff<00:03:56.850> and<00:03:57.290> let's<00:03:58.290> just<00:03:58.380> go<00:03:58.470> ahead<00:03:58.500> and<00:03:58.830> say

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
stuff and let's just go ahead and say

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.270 
stuff and let's just go ahead and say
render<00:04:01.410> dot<00:04:02.160> walls<00:04:02.910> and<00:04:03.470> now<00:04:04.470> if<00:04:04.650> we<00:04:04.710> hit<00:04:04.920> ctrl

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
render dot walls and now if we hit ctrl

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.500 
render dot walls and now if we hit ctrl
else<00:04:05.460> you'll<00:04:05.640> say<00:04:05.820> that<00:04:05.850> those<00:04:06.120> walls<00:04:06.360> are

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
else you'll say that those walls are

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.140 
else you'll say that those walls are
generating<00:04:07.050> and<00:04:07.200> they're<00:04:07.530> actually<00:04:08.150> in

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
generating and they're actually in

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.660 
generating and they're actually in
france<00:04:09.810> of<00:04:10.080> the<00:04:10.530> thing<00:04:10.709> and<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.280> reason<00:04:11.400> is

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
france of the thing and the reason is

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.030 
france of the thing and the reason is
that<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:12.810> code<00:04:13.020> works<00:04:13.380> like<00:04:13.620> this<00:04:13.770> right

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
that the code works like this right

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.300 
that the code works like this right
you've<00:04:14.310> got<00:04:14.720> you've<00:04:15.720> got<00:04:15.770> this<00:04:16.770> happening

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
you've got you've got this happening

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.420 
you've got you've got this happening
first<00:04:17.580> so<00:04:18.239> it's<00:04:18.390> rendering<00:04:18.720> the<00:04:18.870> floor<00:04:19.470> then

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
first so it's rendering the floor then

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.610 
first so it's rendering the floor then
the<00:04:20.459> render<00:04:21.299> distance<00:04:21.390> limiter<00:04:21.960> and<00:04:22.140> then<00:04:22.440> the

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
the render distance limiter and then the

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.050 
the render distance limiter and then the
wall<00:04:22.800> so<00:04:23.070> if<00:04:23.160> we<00:04:23.280> grab<00:04:23.490> the<00:04:23.640> walls<00:04:23.850> and

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
wall so if we grab the walls and

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.270 
wall so if we grab the walls and
actually<00:04:24.330> put<00:04:24.540> them<00:04:24.720> in<00:04:24.930> in<00:04:25.410> France<00:04:25.770> so

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
actually put them in in France so

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.500 
actually put them in in France so
beforehand<00:04:27.060> the<00:04:27.180> reddit

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
beforehand the reddit

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.780 
beforehand the reddit
since<00:04:27.720> limiter<00:04:28.050> and<00:04:28.230> hit<00:04:29.100> control<00:04:29.400> s<00:04:29.430> which<00:04:29.730> I

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
since limiter and hit control s which I

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.190 
since limiter and hit control s which I
will<00:04:29.910> in<00:04:30.000> a<00:04:30.060> second<00:04:30.390> you<00:04:30.810> know<00:04:30.840> it<00:04:31.080> will

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
will in a second you know it will

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.630 
will in a second you know it will
actually<00:04:31.470> render<00:04:31.680> those<00:04:32.010> walls<00:04:33.110> in<00:04:34.110> front

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
actually render those walls in front

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.900 
actually render those walls in front
hang<00:04:35.640> on

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
hang on

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.940 
hang on
it'll<00:04:36.420> render<00:04:36.630> sorry<00:04:37.140> it'll<00:04:37.290> render<00:04:37.590> this

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
it'll render sorry it'll render this

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.250 
it'll render sorry it'll render this
thing<00:04:38.220> because<00:04:38.820> it<00:04:39.030> works<00:04:39.510> in<00:04:39.900> chronological

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
thing because it works in chronological

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.830 
thing because it works in chronological
order<00:04:40.650> right<00:04:40.950> it<00:04:41.490> renders<00:04:41.880> this<00:04:42.090> first<00:04:42.390> then

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
order right it renders this first then

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.060 
order right it renders this first then
this<00:04:43.110> then<00:04:43.590> this

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
this then this

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.340 
this then this
so<00:04:44.160> it'll<00:04:44.370> render<00:04:44.640> it'll<00:04:45.450> render<00:04:45.630> our<00:04:45.960> render

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
so it'll render it'll render our render

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.730 
so it'll render it'll render our render
distance<00:04:46.530> limiter<00:04:47.840> after<00:04:48.840> the<00:04:49.230> walls<00:04:49.440> so<00:04:49.710> we

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
distance limiter after the walls so we

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.020 
distance limiter after the walls so we
don't<00:04:49.980> want<00:04:50.100> that<00:04:50.190> so<00:04:50.250> if<00:04:50.430> we<00:04:50.520> hit<00:04:50.610> ctrl<00:04:50.910> s

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
don't want that so if we hit ctrl s

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.610 
don't want that so if we hit ctrl s
you'll<00:04:51.240> see<00:04:51.360> that<00:04:51.450> they're<00:04:51.630> actually<00:04:51.810> you

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
you'll see that they're actually you

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.410 
you'll see that they're actually you
know<00:04:52.740> the<00:04:53.340> walls<00:04:53.520> are<00:04:53.640> behind<00:04:54.030> the<00:04:54.210> render

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
know the walls are behind the render

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.850 
know the walls are behind the render
distance<00:04:54.540> limiter<00:04:54.990> so<00:04:55.200> let's<00:04:55.380> just<00:04:55.500> grab<00:04:55.680> that

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
distance limiter so let's just grab that

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
distance limiter so let's just grab that
and<00:04:56.240> move<00:04:57.240> it<00:04:57.360> after<00:04:57.840> and<00:04:58.020> you<00:04:58.950> will<00:04:59.100> say<00:04:59.370> that

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
and move it after and you will say that

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.540 
and move it after and you will say that
well<00:05:00.510> as<00:05:00.750> you<00:05:00.870> saw<00:05:00.990> before<00:05:01.220> they<00:05:02.220> are<00:05:02.280> now<00:05:02.400> in

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
well as you saw before they are now in

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.280 
well as you saw before they are now in
front<00:05:02.640> of<00:05:02.790> the<00:05:02.880> things<00:05:03.270> in<00:05:03.810> front<00:05:03.870> of<00:05:04.140> the

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
front of the things in front of the

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.170 
front of the things in front of the
render<00:05:05.040> distance<00:05:05.160> limiter<00:05:05.580> and<00:05:05.730> they

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
render distance limiter and they

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.670 
render distance limiter and they
actually<00:05:06.330> look<00:05:06.660> like<00:05:06.690> they're<00:05:07.020> well<00:05:07.410> you<00:05:07.560> know

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
actually look like they're well you know

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.670 
actually look like they're well you know
close<00:05:07.890> to<00:05:07.920> the<00:05:08.070> camera<00:05:08.250> time<00:05:08.550> okay<00:05:09.300> that's<00:05:09.680> the

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
close to the camera time okay that's the

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.730 
close to the camera time okay that's the
that's<00:05:11.130> how<00:05:11.400> you<00:05:11.460> solve<00:05:11.760> that<00:05:11.820> um<00:05:12.590> and<00:05:13.590> the

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
that's how you solve that um and the

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:14.810 
that's how you solve that um and the
other<00:05:13.770> thing<00:05:14.040> is<00:05:14.160> someone<00:05:14.370> pointed<00:05:14.670> out<00:05:14.730> in

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
other thing is someone pointed out in

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.460 
other thing is someone pointed out in
the<00:05:14.910> comments<00:05:15.180> as<00:05:15.240> well<00:05:15.360> that<00:05:15.540> like<00:05:15.720> having

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
the comments as well that like having

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:17.690 
the comments as well that like having
different<00:05:16.590> methods<00:05:16.980> is<00:05:17.070> really<00:05:17.280> good<00:05:17.460> because

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
different methods is really good because

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.560 
different methods is really good because
what<00:05:17.880> you<00:05:17.940> can<00:05:18.000> do<00:05:18.210> is<00:05:18.360> you<00:05:18.420> can<00:05:18.540> just

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
what you can do is you can just

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.510 
what you can do is you can just
basically<00:05:19.230> minimize<00:05:19.530> the<00:05:19.950> method<00:05:20.280> like<00:05:20.370> you

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
basically minimize the method like you

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.610 
basically minimize the method like you
can<00:05:20.640> hide<00:05:20.880> it<00:05:21.030> you<00:05:21.240> can<00:05:21.570> collapse<00:05:21.900> it<00:05:22.140> so<00:05:22.320> that

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
can hide it you can collapse it so that

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.560 
can hide it you can collapse it so that
you<00:05:23.040> know<00:05:23.160> this<00:05:23.340> walls<00:05:23.640> thing<00:05:23.910> this<00:05:24.150> is<00:05:24.300> almost

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
you know this walls thing this is almost

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.390 
you know this walls thing this is almost
a<00:05:24.720> hundred<00:05:24.840> lines<00:05:25.200> of<00:05:25.320> code<00:05:25.380> right<00:05:25.740> here<00:05:25.950> and

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
a hundred lines of code right here and

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.310 
a hundred lines of code right here and
that's<00:05:26.760> heaps<00:05:27.060> like<00:05:27.360> we<00:05:27.510> don't<00:05:27.600> want<00:05:27.840> that<00:05:27.930> in

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
that's heaps like we don't want that in

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.200 
that's heaps like we don't want that in
the<00:05:28.530> way<00:05:28.680> of<00:05:28.800> stuff<00:05:29.070> so<00:05:29.250> if<00:05:29.340> we<00:05:29.460> just<00:05:29.610> hit<00:05:29.940> that

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
the way of stuff so if we just hit that

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.970 
the way of stuff so if we just hit that
and<00:05:30.450> we<00:05:31.080> can<00:05:31.230> sort<00:05:31.410> of<00:05:31.500> like<00:05:31.650> it<00:05:31.770> for<00:05:31.890> this

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:31.980 
and we can sort of like it for this

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.650 
and we can sort of like it for this
minus<00:05:32.400> and<00:05:32.520> plus<00:05:32.610> sign<00:05:33.060> here<00:05:33.240> we<00:05:33.390> can<00:05:33.510> actually

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
minus and plus sign here we can actually

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.500 
minus and plus sign here we can actually
like<00:05:34.370> easily<00:05:35.370> select<00:05:35.670> sort<00:05:35.970> through<00:05:36.150> our<00:05:36.300> code

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
like easily select sort through our code

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.180 
like easily select sort through our code
so<00:05:36.660> we<00:05:36.750> could<00:05:36.870> say<00:05:36.990> okay<00:05:37.230> well<00:05:37.380> there's<00:05:37.560> three

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
so we could say okay well there's three

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.500 
so we could say okay well there's three
different<00:05:38.280> components<00:05:38.880> being<00:05:39.120> rated<00:05:39.270> in<00:05:39.480> the

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
different components being rated in the

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.990 
different components being rated in the
rendered<00:05:39.840> or<00:05:39.930> 3d<00:05:40.140> class<00:05:40.410> that's<00:05:40.650> floor<00:05:41.220> again

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
rendered or 3d class that's floor again

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.460 
rendered or 3d class that's floor again
I<00:05:42.030> said<00:05:42.180> rounded<00:05:42.600> off<00:05:42.720> ready<00:05:42.960> in<00:05:43.170> the<00:05:43.230> render

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
I said rounded off ready in the render

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.890 
I said rounded off ready in the render
3d<00:05:43.620> class<00:05:43.950> which<00:05:44.190> is<00:05:44.340> the<00:05:44.910> the<00:05:45.330> floor<00:05:45.540> the

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
3d class which is the the floor the

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.720 
3d class which is the the floor the
walls<00:05:46.140> and<00:05:46.470> the<00:05:46.590> limiter<00:05:46.920> and<00:05:47.130> we<00:05:47.370> if<00:05:47.520> we<00:05:47.700> want

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:47.730 
walls and the limiter and we if we want

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.640 
walls and the limiter and we if we want
to<00:05:47.910> operate<00:05:48.090> on<00:05:48.210> the<00:05:48.420> actual<00:05:48.780> floor<00:05:49.230> and<00:05:49.500> the

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
to operate on the actual floor and the

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.650 
to operate on the actual floor and the
rendering<00:05:49.830> logic<00:05:50.280> we<00:05:50.400> can<00:05:50.430> use<00:05:50.670> that<00:05:50.820> if<00:05:51.150> we

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
rendering logic we can use that if we

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:52.820 
rendering logic we can use that if we
just<00:05:51.810> want<00:05:51.930> to<00:05:51.990> touch<00:05:52.110> the<00:05:52.260> walls<00:05:52.440> we<00:05:52.590> can<00:05:52.710> use

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
just want to touch the walls we can use

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.040 
just want to touch the walls we can use
walls<00:05:53.070> and<00:05:53.370> so<00:05:53.790> on<00:05:53.910> and<00:05:54.030> so<00:05:54.150> forth<00:05:54.390> so<00:05:54.570> we<00:05:54.600> don't

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
walls and so on and so forth so we don't

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.140 
walls and so on and so forth so we don't
need<00:05:55.140> to<00:05:55.200> say<00:05:55.350> all<00:05:55.470> of<00:05:55.590> it<00:05:55.680> at<00:05:55.860> the<00:05:56.130> at<00:05:56.910> the<00:05:57.030> one

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
need to say all of it at the at the one

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.290 
need to say all of it at the at the one
time<00:05:57.360> I'll<00:05:57.570> just<00:05:57.720> open<00:05:57.810> that<00:05:58.050> up<00:05:58.320> there<00:05:58.560> and

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
time I'll just open that up there and

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.760 
time I'll just open that up there and
yeah<00:06:00.300> so<00:06:00.510> that's<00:06:00.600> it<00:06:00.810> that's<00:06:00.990> really<00:06:01.470> quick

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
yeah so that's it that's really quick

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.590 
yeah so that's it that's really quick
thing<00:06:02.400> I<00:06:02.490> wanted<00:06:02.700> to<00:06:02.760> point<00:06:02.820> out<00:06:03.090> on<00:06:03.270> how<00:06:03.540> to

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
thing I wanted to point out on how to

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.870 
thing I wanted to point out on how to
actually<00:06:04.020> get<00:06:04.170> rid<00:06:04.200> of<00:06:04.680> that<00:06:05.430> render<00:06:05.790> distance

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 
actually get rid of that render distance

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.210 
actually get rid of that render distance
limiter<00:06:06.390> in<00:06:06.510> front<00:06:06.870> and<00:06:07.110> yeah<00:06:07.770> there<00:06:08.010> we<00:06:08.070> go

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
limiter in front and yeah there we go

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.160 
limiter in front and yeah there we go
answering<00:06:08.640> your<00:06:08.700> question<00:06:09.060> and<00:06:09.210> I'll<00:06:09.930> see<00:06:10.110> you
