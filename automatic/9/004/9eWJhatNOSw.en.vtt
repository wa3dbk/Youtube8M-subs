to open that in Camera Raw you'd

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.440 
to open that in Camera Raw you'd
actually<00:00:49.960> have<00:00:50.170> to<00:00:50.290> close<00:00:50.800> it<00:00:51.070> first<00:00:51.370> and<00:00:51.670> then

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
actually have to close it first and then

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.330 
actually have to close it first and then
tell<00:00:53.170> it<00:00:53.200> reopen<00:00:54.160> in<00:00:54.340> Camera<00:00:54.850> Raw<00:00:54.900> so<00:00:55.900> a<00:00:56.680> lot<00:00:57.220> of

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
tell it reopen in Camera Raw so a lot of

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.100 
tell it reopen in Camera Raw so a lot of
times<00:00:57.520> it<00:00:57.700> kind<00:00:57.850> of<00:00:57.940> destruct<00:00:58.390> disrupts<00:00:58.990> the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
times it kind of destruct disrupts the

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.960 
times it kind of destruct disrupts the
workflow<00:00:59.560> because<00:01:00.220> you<00:01:00.580> may<00:01:00.700> have<00:01:00.820> already

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
workflow because you may have already

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.550 
workflow because you may have already
started<00:01:01.180> creating<00:01:01.720> layers<00:01:01.930> you<00:01:02.290> may<00:01:02.440> have

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:02.560 
started creating layers you may have

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.140 
started creating layers you may have
already<00:01:02.710> started<00:01:02.980> doing<00:01:03.130> them<00:01:03.580> things<00:01:03.880> to<00:01:04.059> the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
already started doing them things to the

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.060 
already started doing them things to the
image<00:01:04.420> and<00:01:04.570> now<00:01:04.659> you<00:01:05.229> want<00:01:05.530> to<00:01:05.560> open<00:01:05.770> in<00:01:05.860> Camera

Raw<00:01:06.250> and<00:01:06.340> it<00:01:06.520> becomes<00:01:06.790> that<00:01:06.850> much<00:01:07.000> more

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
Raw and it becomes that much more

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.330 
Raw and it becomes that much more
difficult<00:01:07.360> well<00:01:08.350> luckily<00:01:08.560> that<00:01:08.920> all<00:01:09.100> goes

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
difficult well luckily that all goes

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.669 
difficult well luckily that all goes
away<00:01:09.640> in<00:01:09.820> Photoshop<00:01:10.299> CC<00:01:10.539> because<00:01:11.380> in

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
Photoshop CC you can actually use Camera

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.130 
Photoshop CC you can actually use Camera
Raw<00:01:15.130> as<00:01:15.429> a<00:01:16.270> filter<00:01:17.049> on<00:01:17.259> any<00:01:17.829> layer<00:01:18.579> in<00:01:18.939> any<00:01:19.659> file

Raw as a filter on any layer in any file
type<00:01:20.469> so<00:01:21.399> as<00:01:21.789> before<00:01:22.060> it<00:01:22.659> was<00:01:22.840> limited<00:01:23.350> to<00:01:23.380> raw

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:23.859

TIFF<00:01:24.759> JPEG<00:01:25.179> and<00:01:25.780> some<00:01:26.140> versions<00:01:26.770> of<00:01:26.859> PSD<00:01:27.399> now

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
TIFF JPEG and some versions of PSD now

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.929 
TIFF JPEG and some versions of PSD now
it<00:01:28.630> is<00:01:28.840> open<00:01:29.499> to<00:01:29.590> any<00:01:29.770> layer<00:01:30.070> so<00:01:30.549> let's<00:01:30.729> take<00:01:30.909> a

look I've got an image open here and
it's<00:01:34.509> an<00:01:34.600> image<00:01:34.810> I<00:01:34.929> shot<00:01:35.200> back<00:01:35.229> in<00:01:35.439> 2009<00:01:36.249> now<00:01:36.549> I

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
it's an image I shot back in 2009 now I

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:38.639 
it's an image I shot back in 2009 now I
do<00:01:36.729> have<00:01:37.210> the<00:01:37.450> raw<00:01:37.659> version<00:01:37.960> of<00:01:38.229> this<00:01:38.380> but<00:01:38.619> I

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
do have the raw version of this but I

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.120 
do have the raw version of this but I
went<00:01:38.829> ahead<00:01:38.950> and<00:01:39.280> saved<00:01:39.640> this<00:01:39.880> as<00:01:39.939> a<00:01:40.179> PSD<00:01:41.130> with

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
went ahead and saved this as a PSD with

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.359 
went ahead and saved this as a PSD with
no<00:01:42.819> layers<00:01:43.060> so<00:01:43.479> it's<00:01:43.630> pretty<00:01:43.810> flat<00:01:44.170> and<00:01:44.499> what<00:01:45.340> I

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
no layers so it's pretty flat and what I

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.639 
no layers so it's pretty flat and what I
would<00:01:45.549> like<00:01:45.700> to<00:01:45.819> do<00:01:45.969> first<00:01:46.359> is<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:47.139> beauty<00:01:47.619> of

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
would like to do first is the beauty of

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.919 
would like to do first is the beauty of
Camera<00:01:48.069> Raw<00:01:48.249> is<00:01:48.310> that<00:01:48.639> its<00:01:48.929> non-destructive

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
Camera Raw is that its non-destructive

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:52.559 
Camera Raw is that its non-destructive
so<00:01:50.109> I<00:01:50.560> want<00:01:50.829> that<00:01:51.009> same<00:01:51.369> thing<00:01:51.819> when<00:01:52.149> I<00:01:52.179> apply

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:52.569 
so I want that same thing when I apply

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:54.510 
so I want that same thing when I apply
it<00:01:52.630> as<00:01:52.810> a<00:01:52.840> filter<00:01:53.319> and<00:01:53.530> in<00:01:54.009> order<00:01:54.280> to<00:01:54.310> achieve

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
it as a filter and in order to achieve

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.069 
it as a filter and in order to achieve
that<00:01:54.999> I'm<00:01:55.210> just<00:01:55.420> going<00:01:55.539> to<00:01:55.600> go<00:01:55.689> to<00:01:55.749> the<00:01:55.869> filter

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
that I'm just going to go to the filter

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.889 
that I'm just going to go to the filter
menu<00:01:56.319> before<00:01:56.770> I<00:01:57.159> go<00:01:57.369> to<00:01:57.429> Camera<00:01:57.819> Raw<00:01:57.969> I'm<00:01:58.659> going

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
menu before I go to Camera Raw I'm going

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.440 
menu before I go to Camera Raw I'm going
to<00:01:58.960> say<00:01:59.139> convert<00:01:59.619> for<00:01:59.979> Smart<00:02:00.009> Filters<00:02:00.450> what

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
to say convert for Smart Filters what

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.020 
to say convert for Smart Filters what
that<00:02:01.630> will<00:02:01.840> do<00:02:02.079> is<00:02:02.380> make<00:02:02.740> anything<00:02:03.310> I<00:02:03.639> do<00:02:03.700> to

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
that will do is make anything I do to

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.949 
that will do is make anything I do to
that<00:02:04.209> layer<00:02:04.539> but<00:02:04.899> it<00:02:05.020> just<00:02:05.259> converted

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
that layer but it just converted

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:08.850 
that layer but it just converted
non-destructive<00:02:07.959> so<00:02:08.140> I<00:02:08.289> can<00:02:08.440> always<00:02:08.590> go<00:02:08.830> back

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
non-destructive so I can always go back

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.700 
non-destructive so I can always go back
and<00:02:09.220> make<00:02:09.670> adjustments<00:02:10.260> now<00:02:11.260> that<00:02:11.440> I've<00:02:11.530> done

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
that so I can go to my filter menu come

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.290 
that so I can go to my filter menu come
to<00:02:14.320> Camera<00:02:14.650> Raw<00:02:14.800> as<00:02:14.860> a<00:02:14.950> filter<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:15.580> again

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.970 
very flat dull I was actually kind of
disappointed<00:02:32.240> when<00:02:32.840> I<00:02:32.900> got<00:02:33.050> this<00:02:33.260> out<00:02:33.470> of<00:02:33.920> the

camera and luckily with camera rock and
bring<00:02:37.400> it<00:02:37.490> back<00:02:37.520> so<00:02:38.510> first<00:02:38.780> thing<00:02:38.990> is<00:02:39.020> the

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
bring it back so first thing is the

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.710 
bring it back so first thing is the
blacks<00:02:39.680> need<00:02:40.010> to<00:02:40.130> be<00:02:40.280> blacker<00:02:40.910> so<00:02:41.390> let's<00:02:41.570> go

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
blacks need to be blacker so let's go

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.480 
blacks need to be blacker so let's go
ahead<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:42.020> darken<00:02:42.410> those<00:02:42.860> I<00:02:43.130> can<00:02:43.250> go<00:02:43.370> all<00:02:43.430> the

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
ahead and darken those I can go all the

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.650 
ahead and darken those I can go all the
way<00:02:43.580> down<00:02:43.880> but<00:02:44.600> I<00:02:44.630> need<00:02:44.840> to<00:02:44.930> go<00:02:45.050> quite<00:02:45.350> that<00:02:45.380> far

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
way down but I need to go quite that far

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.650 
way down but I need to go quite that far
next<00:02:47.660> I<00:02:47.750> want<00:02:47.900> to<00:02:47.960> increase<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:48.380> contrast<00:02:48.920> and

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
next I want to increase the contrast and

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.720 
next I want to increase the contrast and
because<00:02:50.660> this<00:02:50.930> is<00:02:51.080> a<00:02:51.110> landscape<00:02:51.920> image<00:02:52.400> I<00:02:52.640> can

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
because this is a landscape image I can

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.500 
because this is a landscape image I can
go<00:02:53.360> a<00:02:53.390> little<00:02:53.540> crazy<00:02:54.050> with<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:54.470> clarity<00:02:54.950> and

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
go a little crazy with the clarity and

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.750 
go a little crazy with the clarity and
vibrance<00:02:56.920> which<00:02:57.920> I<00:02:58.040> do<00:02:58.100> usually<00:02:58.459> on

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
vibrance which I do usually on

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.270 
vibrance which I do usually on
landscapes<00:02:59.540> or<00:02:59.720> people<00:03:00.110> and<00:03:00.290> saturation

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
landscapes or people and saturation

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.030 
landscapes or people and saturation
which<00:03:01.610> I<00:03:01.760> rarely<00:03:02.090> do<00:03:02.570> on<00:03:02.750> people<00:03:03.170> I<00:03:03.320> can<00:03:03.950> go

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
which I rarely do on people I can go

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.560 
which I rarely do on people I can go
ahead<00:03:04.100> and<00:03:04.280> pump<00:03:04.520> up<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.790> saturation<00:03:05.270> get

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
ahead and pump up the saturation get

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.170 
ahead and pump up the saturation get
those<00:03:05.750> blues<00:03:06.110> nice<00:03:06.500> and<00:03:06.709> blue<00:03:06.890> those<00:03:07.610> orange

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
those blues nice and blue those orange

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.420 
those blues nice and blue those orange
is<00:03:08.300> nice<00:03:08.480> and<00:03:08.660> orange<00:03:08.900> however<00:03:09.830> no<00:03:09.980> matter<00:03:10.010> how

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
is nice and orange however no matter how

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.600 
is nice and orange however no matter how
much<00:03:10.580> I<00:03:10.760> adjust<00:03:11.180> it<00:03:11.360> the<00:03:12.080> sky<00:03:12.530> that<00:03:12.980> was<00:03:13.190> cast

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
much I adjust it the sky that was cast

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.880 
much I adjust it the sky that was cast
on<00:03:13.970> this<00:03:14.209> is<00:03:14.390> kind<00:03:14.720> of<00:03:14.780> blowing<00:03:15.110> out<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.650> top

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
on this is kind of blowing out the top

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.949 
on this is kind of blowing out the top
part<00:03:16.130> of<00:03:16.310> this<00:03:16.430> image<00:03:16.790> and<00:03:17.000> so<00:03:17.570> what<00:03:17.690> I'll<00:03:17.810> do

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
part of this image and so what I'll do

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.140 
part of this image and so what I'll do
is<00:03:17.990> use<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.440> graduated<00:03:19.040> filter<00:03:19.370> and<00:03:19.610> we'll

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
is use the graduated filter and we'll

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.290 
is use the graduated filter and we'll
just<00:03:20.300> go<00:03:20.390> ahead<00:03:20.450> and<00:03:20.630> pull<00:03:20.900> that<00:03:20.930> down<00:03:21.470> and

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
just go ahead and pull that down and

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.970 
just go ahead and pull that down and
that<00:03:23.300> can<00:03:23.450> make<00:03:23.540> a<00:03:23.600> very<00:03:23.690> nice<00:03:24.320> adjustment<00:03:24.890> at

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
that can make a very nice adjustment at

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.820 
that can make a very nice adjustment at
the<00:03:25.100> top<00:03:25.340> just<00:03:26.269> using<00:03:26.660> the<00:03:26.750> exposure<00:03:27.170> controls

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
the top just using the exposure controls

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.100 
the top just using the exposure controls
so<00:03:28.610> I<00:03:28.670> can<00:03:28.820> just<00:03:28.970> bring<00:03:29.180> down<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:29.570> exposure<00:03:29.900> or

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
so I can just bring down the exposure or

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.350 
so I can just bring down the exposure or
the<00:03:30.290> top<00:03:30.560> part<00:03:30.890> of<00:03:30.980> that<00:03:31.100> image<00:03:31.400> to<00:03:31.640> kind<00:03:32.239> of

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
the top part of that image to kind of

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.180 
the top part of that image to kind of
balance<00:03:32.690> it<00:03:33.080> out<00:03:33.200> with<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.590> rest<00:03:33.920> of<00:03:34.100> the

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
balance it out with the rest of the

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.860 
balance it out with the rest of the
image<00:03:34.459> so<00:03:34.670> it<00:03:34.760> doesn't<00:03:35.090> look<00:03:35.150> so<00:03:35.209> washed<00:03:35.570> out

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
image so it doesn't look so washed out

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.470 
image so it doesn't look so washed out
at<00:03:36.019> the<00:03:36.110> top<00:03:36.350> now<00:03:37.160> speaking<00:03:37.730> of<00:03:37.880> adjustments

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
at the top now speaking of adjustments

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.780 
at the top now speaking of adjustments
let's<00:03:38.780> go<00:03:38.900> to<00:03:38.959> the<00:03:39.140> adjustment<00:03:39.620> brush<00:03:39.769> where<00:03:40.760> I

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
let's go to the adjustment brush where I

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.630 
let's go to the adjustment brush where I
don't<00:03:41.180> want<00:03:41.420> to<00:03:41.510> adjust<00:03:41.570> the<00:03:41.870> exposure<00:03:42.640> it's

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
don't want to adjust the exposure it's

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.790 
don't want to adjust the exposure it's
going<00:03:43.880> to<00:03:43.940> balance<00:03:44.239> that<00:03:44.540> back<00:03:44.750> out<00:03:44.959> and<00:03:45.290> or

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
going to balance that back out and or

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.199 
going to balance that back out and or
the<00:03:46.100> clarity<00:03:46.640> or<00:03:47.980> oh<00:03:48.980> actually<00:03:49.610> I<00:03:49.820> do<00:03:49.880> want<00:03:50.120> to

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
the clarity or oh actually I do want to

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.970 
the clarity or oh actually I do want to
saturation<00:03:50.630> so<00:03:51.350> I'm<00:03:51.440> going<00:03:51.560> to<00:03:51.620> go<00:03:51.709> ahead<00:03:51.800> and

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
saturation so I'm going to go ahead and

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.560 
saturation so I'm going to go ahead and
do<00:03:52.190> the<00:03:52.310> saturation<00:03:53.000> now<00:03:53.150> it's<00:03:53.269> not<00:03:53.360> going<00:03:53.510> to

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
do the saturation now it's not going to

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:54.910 
do the saturation now it's not going to
make<00:03:53.720> that<00:03:53.870> big<00:03:53.930> of<00:03:54.320> a<00:03:54.380> difference<00:03:54.530> because

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
make that big of a difference because

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.220 
make that big of a difference because
this<00:03:55.070> is<00:03:55.190> already<00:03:55.370> pretty<00:03:55.900> saturated<00:03:56.900> for<00:03:57.110> the

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
this is already pretty saturated for the

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.370 
this is already pretty saturated for the
blue<00:03:57.560> water<00:03:58.690> here<00:03:59.690> we'll<00:03:59.810> go<00:03:59.959> over<00:04:00.110> here<00:04:00.320> and

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
blue water here we'll go over here and

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.590 
blue water here we'll go over here and
just<00:04:00.530> keep<00:04:00.830> painting<00:04:01.190> on<00:04:01.459> this<00:04:01.610> part<00:04:01.910> and<00:04:02.120> this

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
just keep painting on this part and this

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.300 
just keep painting on this part and this
is<00:04:02.780> why<00:04:02.930> I<00:04:02.959> like<00:04:03.320> working<00:04:03.680> in<00:04:03.739> Camera<00:04:04.130> Raw<00:04:04.280> I

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
is why I like working in Camera Raw I

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.220 
is why I like working in Camera Raw I
have<00:04:04.700> to<00:04:04.790> worry<00:04:04.940> about<00:04:05.060> masking<00:04:05.810> at<00:04:05.930> first

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
have to worry about masking at first

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.470 
have to worry about masking at first
creating<00:04:06.860> layers<00:04:07.160> doing<00:04:07.880> any<00:04:08.030> of<00:04:08.180> that<00:04:08.300> kind

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
creating layers doing any of that kind

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.540 
creating layers doing any of that kind
of<00:04:08.570> stuff<00:04:08.769> because<00:04:09.769> the<00:04:09.920> adjustment<00:04:10.400> brush

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
of stuff because the adjustment brush

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.870 
of stuff because the adjustment brush
will<00:04:11.330> auto<00:04:11.600> mask<00:04:12.019> and<00:04:12.410> now<00:04:13.070> to<00:04:13.130> just<00:04:13.549> make<00:04:13.700> that

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
will auto mask and now to just make that

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.759 
will auto mask and now to just make that
water<00:04:14.180> just<00:04:14.299> a<00:04:14.600> little<00:04:14.959> bit<00:04:15.049> more<00:04:15.200> bluer<00:04:15.530> I

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
water just a little bit more bluer I

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:18.340 
water just a little bit more bluer I
didn't<00:04:16.310> just<00:04:16.459> drop<00:04:16.880> the<00:04:17.120> temperature<00:04:17.600> make<00:04:18.200> it

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
didn't just drop the temperature make it

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.550 
didn't just drop the temperature make it
very<00:04:18.530> cold<00:04:18.799> make<00:04:19.549> it<00:04:19.700> very<00:04:19.910> warm<00:04:20.299> or<00:04:20.630> somewhere

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
very cold make it very warm or somewhere

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.170 
very cold make it very warm or somewhere
in<00:04:21.650> the<00:04:21.769> middle<00:04:22.040> so<00:04:22.370> we'll<00:04:22.490> just<00:04:22.640> make<00:04:22.880> it<00:04:22.910> just

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
in the middle so we'll just make it just

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.020 
in the middle so we'll just make it just
a<00:04:23.300> little<00:04:23.540> bit<00:04:23.720> bluer<00:04:24.110> than<00:04:25.040> it<00:04:25.220> was<00:04:25.400> before

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
a little bit bluer than it was before

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.270 
a little bit bluer than it was before
and<00:04:26.140> now<00:04:27.140> I<00:04:27.169> can<00:04:27.380> do<00:04:27.470> the<00:04:27.620> same<00:04:27.890> kind<00:04:27.950> of

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
and now I can do the same kind of

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.830 
and now I can do the same kind of
adjustment<00:04:28.820> let's<00:04:29.030> make<00:04:29.210> a<00:04:29.240> new<00:04:29.510> adjustment

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
adjustment let's make a new adjustment

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.589 
adjustment let's make a new adjustment
here

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:30.599 
here

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:32.419 
here
and<00:04:30.689> we'll<00:04:31.110> make<00:04:31.289> an<00:04:31.439> adjustment<00:04:31.889> on<00:04:32.129> the

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:32.429 
and we'll make an adjustment on the

00:04:32.429 --> 00:04:34.100 
and we'll make an adjustment on the
mountain<00:04:32.849> itself<00:04:33.179> now<00:04:33.539> of<00:04:33.719> course<00:04:33.869> I<00:04:34.050> don't

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
mountain itself now of course I don't

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.429 
mountain itself now of course I don't
want<00:04:34.289> temperature<00:04:34.949> in<00:04:35.099> this<00:04:35.219> case<00:04:36.289> okay<00:04:37.289> and

00:04:37.429 --> 00:04:37.439 
want temperature in this case okay and

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:40.549 
want temperature in this case okay and
put<00:04:37.740> the<00:04:37.860> temperature<00:04:38.159> back<00:04:38.399> to<00:04:38.610> zero<00:04:39.529> but<00:04:40.529> I

00:04:40.549 --> 00:04:40.559 
put the temperature back to zero but I

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:43.850 
put the temperature back to zero but I
do<00:04:40.679> want<00:04:40.949> saturation<00:04:41.929> so<00:04:42.929> now<00:04:43.110> it's<00:04:43.409> and<00:04:43.679> again

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
do want saturation so now it's and again

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.499 
do want saturation so now it's and again
it<00:04:44.009> was<00:04:44.099> already<00:04:44.399> pretty<00:04:44.550> saturated<00:04:44.849> so<00:04:45.389> it's

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:45.509 
it was already pretty saturated so it's

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:46.760 
it was already pretty saturated so it's
not<00:04:45.629> going<00:04:45.779> to<00:04:45.869> do<00:04:45.990> a<00:04:46.020> whole<00:04:46.319> lot<00:04:46.589> with

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
not going to do a whole lot with

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.279 
not going to do a whole lot with
saturation<00:04:47.449> but<00:04:48.449> now<00:04:48.599> that<00:04:48.809> I've<00:04:48.899> made<00:04:49.080> this

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 
saturation but now that I've made this

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.040 
saturation but now that I've made this
adjustment<00:04:49.979> on<00:04:50.129> the<00:04:50.429> mountain<00:04:50.759> I<00:04:50.969> can<00:04:51.719> kind<00:04:51.959> of

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
adjustment on the mountain I can kind of

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.049 
adjustment on the mountain I can kind of
balance<00:04:52.319> that<00:04:52.740> out<00:04:52.800> a<00:04:52.949> little<00:04:53.189> bit<00:04:53.399> more<00:04:53.610> by

00:04:54.049 --> 00:04:54.059 
balance that out a little bit more by

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:55.909 
balance that out a little bit more by
dropping<00:04:54.509> the<00:04:54.599> exposure<00:04:54.959> of<00:04:55.259> just<00:04:55.709> that

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
dropping the exposure of just that

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.809 
dropping the exposure of just that
adjustment<00:04:56.339> I<00:04:56.520> just<00:04:56.819> made<00:04:57.860> good<00:04:58.860> right<00:04:59.610> about

00:04:59.809 --> 00:04:59.819 
adjustment I just made good right about

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:02.989 
adjustment I just made good right about
there<00:05:00.089> maybe<00:05:00.389> and<00:05:00.919> also<00:05:01.919> increase<00:05:02.849> the

00:05:02.989 --> 00:05:02.999 
there maybe and also increase the

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:05.779 
there maybe and also increase the
sharpness<00:05:03.300> of<00:05:03.569> it<00:05:04.039> because<00:05:05.039> it<00:05:05.459> is<00:05:05.759> a

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:05.789 
sharpness of it because it is a

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:07.790 
sharpness of it because it is a
landscape<00:05:06.059> we<00:05:06.539> can<00:05:06.659> go<00:05:06.749> nuts<00:05:07.020> with<00:05:07.199> sharpness

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
landscape we can go nuts with sharpness

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.449 
landscape we can go nuts with sharpness
and<00:05:08.449> clarity<00:05:09.449> and<00:05:09.930> things<00:05:10.139> like<00:05:10.259> that<00:05:10.499> so

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:11.459 
and clarity and things like that so

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:14.600 
and clarity and things like that so
we've<00:05:11.999> got<00:05:12.300> our<00:05:12.569> image<00:05:12.809> adjusted<00:05:13.529> now<00:05:14.249> again

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
we've got our image adjusted now again

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.420 
we've got our image adjusted now again
we<00:05:14.879> click<00:05:15.089> OK<00:05:15.449> it<00:05:16.139> will<00:05:16.379> process<00:05:16.740> that<00:05:16.979> as<00:05:17.399> a

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
we click OK it will process that as a

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.719 
we click OK it will process that as a
filter<00:05:17.939> and<00:05:18.529> because<00:05:19.529> I<00:05:19.770> did<00:05:20.039> it<00:05:20.069> not<00:05:20.520> as<00:05:20.699> a

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
filter and because I did it not as a

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:23.299 
filter and because I did it not as a
smart<00:05:21.569> object<00:05:21.749> I<00:05:22.139> can<00:05:22.439> always<00:05:22.740> come<00:05:23.099> back<00:05:23.249> and

00:05:23.299 --> 00:05:23.309 
smart object I can always come back and

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:26.059 
smart object I can always come back and
turn<00:05:23.819> off<00:05:24.089> that<00:05:24.119> filter<00:05:24.779> turn<00:05:25.589> it<00:05:25.769> and<00:05:25.919> that's

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:26.069 
turn off that filter turn it and that's
