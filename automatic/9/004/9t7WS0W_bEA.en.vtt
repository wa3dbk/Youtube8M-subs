00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:10.559
 Well, ready, first of all, start 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.840
 against the line as it reaches up 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.540
 in eighth vision five years ago when 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.480
 I had 14 good through the selective 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.920
 that made any sister pileri 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.900
 we played a game against duty and there 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.300
 It was where they saw me and they called me to 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.010
 to do my first preseason with the 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.140
 audience as I was living beyond 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.150
 that you were a previous one maybe not 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.610
 you had so much time in first division 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.870
 this second preseason good as well as 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.329
 the blind when truth did not have 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.769
 preseason is could go down and good in 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.140
 expectations are to be able to stay in the 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:41.699
 campus and earn a place and on the day to 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.859
 day in here after so many hours 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.059
 they are locked in as they come 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:47.309
 coexistence with who is sharing 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.309
 the concentration with cristian 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.350
 insaurralde and lucas ocampos and is 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.110
 quite bearable thank God a 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.060
 partner that I get along very well 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.580
 and as we say by the account that is 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.200
 locked up but we go in tomorrow and from 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.910
 late is very little time we have 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.060
 level but good you have to understand that 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.520
 this is a preseason and what 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.810
 you have to be at the bottom of the canyon and in the 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.250
 privacy of the room who is the 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.310
 more messy the more and maybe 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.350
 quilombero of the three thanks are 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.250
 quite ordered all and I do not apart 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.399
 in the morning 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.369
 we believe that we look for them clean us 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.750
 everything so that's where black are three 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.580
 that are just beginning to appear in 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.740
 the first division help each other 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.979
 they say look you did this right this bad 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.689
 6 surely to the night more than anything in 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.880
 the same dinner that we are just too 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.950
 the same table talks a lot about what 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.659
 we made mistakes during the day 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.360
 we had that we were good that 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.490
 you have to improve are talks that is that 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.200
 It has a new intimacy we hate 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.569
 personally what do you think is your point 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.729
 strong and what is your maybe aspect that 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:52.890
 should I improve let's put my point 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.689
 strong is to be aware central is 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.670
 fight fighting is always in area 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.380
 to convert the goal would have to 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.899
 improve a little more when the 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.090
 lying down that is not my strong sum 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.909
 very strong inside the area but good 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.270
 started running out of time with the 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.610
 practicing trainings 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.490
 although 9 you can say that you 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.090
 identify 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:19.000
 in July cross would identify me an 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.410
 forward so the truth that I do not know with 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.920
 who to compare and if I had to choose 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.690
 say good me flying reference or my 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.050
 idol during my strong childhood was 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.580
 I always admired this much we do not 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.920
 I have condition of the same 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.020
 conditions that pulled it was from trova of 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.140
 genre is a very powerful forward that 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.990
 with very good technique that I always admired 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.260
 a lot and I also believe 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.060
 it seems a 9 that very opportunistic that by 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.740
 there should not appear much in during 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.840
 the match but the first one that plays 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.130
 always left the so it's one of that 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.380
 also always have as a reference 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.090
 a few years ago there was a group of 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.310
 juveniles who traveled to england me 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.740
 it seems and I had possible to know the drugs 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.810
 litters ts group one with your interest the 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.569
 group that is just the final against 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.030
 the chelsea converted a goal 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.370
 after the game you can meet him 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.200
 aragua can tell you something but 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.359
 photographers talk about a photo of 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.280
 autograph that take pictures really 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:17.150
 when you get on that trip and go with the 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.650
 mentality to be able to meet him was a boy and 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.740
 we really had also met 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.319
 terry but 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.109
 in my head was in being able to know 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.489
 and today returning to the river present 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:30.530
 you are life employing from far back 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.989
 they have a little on their head this saying 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.459
 Well, right now, we need to appear 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.469
 to us at first the team 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.689
 goes down they think they analyzed it what 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:41.150
 they spoke among you not no the truth 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:43.099
 that obviously I'm a river fan in 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.439
 the moment that happened that was very 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.420
 sad but good to risk does not stop 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:50.150
 be river for more where we always play 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.579
 we are going to be great and we have to continue 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.079
 training hard to be able to be which 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.459
 your expectations will be from 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.169
 now when they return to good airs of 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.760
 face to this next season there is a 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:00.379
 expectation begin first because 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.900
 also the campus to be able to earn me 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:06.430
 place and more than anything that I grasp that 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.430
 can leave champion
