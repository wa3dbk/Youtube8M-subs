00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.310
 and 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.300
 anyone can start 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.890
 work to be more efficient both in 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.400
 its consumption of resources as in the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.810
 reduction and recycling of waste 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.820
 some cities have very programs 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:51.120
 advanced but we should still see a 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.280
 100% ecological city without a trace of 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.590
 carbon and completely independent of 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.900
 polluting energy sources a 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.300
 project that began in 2006 is 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.460
 of the city of masdar that is being 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.350
 developing in abu dhabi the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.780
 project managers anticipate that 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.970
 Masdar will be a car- free city 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.119
 with internal combustion engines and 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.610
 skyscrapers at the end of October of the year 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.890
 past the news that sweden circulated 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.590
 must import Norwegian garbage to 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.979
 convert energy into energy near 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.500
 88 200 thousand tons to be precise 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.810
 waste collection has put in 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.270
 check entire real governments and 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.580
 virtual who has not had 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.610
 inconveniences in the trash in without seven 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.259
 but in the case of Sweden the problem is 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.080
 manifested at the other end of the 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.460
 chain are so efficient that they do not have 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.990
 enough raw material 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.320
 to continue recycling or 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.940
 incinerating although if Sweden could be 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.610
 an example to follow at this point 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.070
 There are also other goals such as 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.590
 zero carbon vehicle reduction 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.170
 with traditional engines and greater use 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.330
 of alternative energy sources is 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.250
 can create a city with a 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.740
 neutral carbon footprint without 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.890
 waste or system dependencies 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.080
 of energy pollutants 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.840
 the name we are looking for is more than 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.050
 a city developed by abu dhabi 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.050
 future energy company and its construction 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.850
 is being carried out about 17 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.700
 kilometers from the city of abu dubai 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.770
 next to the airport the project started 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.450
 in the year 2006 with the hope that 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.840
 his first phase was complete and 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.010
 ready to be inhabited in 2009 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.260
 unfortunately the financial crisis 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.450
 seriously delayed the plans and although 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.610
 existing facilities occupied the 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.180
 first phase will not be ready until 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.010
 the year 2015 still a positive detail 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.220
 is that the original estimated cost of the 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.200
 city has fallen 2006 a reported 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.330
 investment of 22 million dollars 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.120
 while the current average is located 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.340
 above 19 billion dollars 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.100
 the city is expected to reach a 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:02.030
 surface of 6 square kilometers with 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.920
 about 45 40,000 residents the idea 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.989
 original was that masdar depended 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.360
 basically public transport and 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.480
 spot car system also known as 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.640
 fair 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.640
 for the displacement of the inhabitants 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.830
 prohibiting conventional vehicles without 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.540
 However, a complete mix between costs 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.150
 and the layout of the streets for 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.220
 reduce the impact of wind limited 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.129
 ford cars to its test phase 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.230
 pilot as an alternative more he received it 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:31.860
 in January 2011 a flotilla of 10 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.629
 electric cars mitsubishi i-miev under 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.690
 an evaluation program that lasted a 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:38.879
 year solar energy is a key factor 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.860
 in the development of the city but not 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.750
 will be the only source since there will be 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.670
 wind farms in the vicinity and 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.579
 the possibility is also being evaluated 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.430
 of using geothermal energy a 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:53.280
 desalination structure desalination 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.160
 based on solar energy could reduce 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.900
 your water use by 60 percent 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.549
 compared to similar cities and it 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.700
 estimates that 80 percent of the water 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:05.370
 will be reused how long will there be 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.739
 wait to see full masdar according to 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.880
 the most recent parameters 17 more years 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.850
 in the best case 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.270
 bridge 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.270
