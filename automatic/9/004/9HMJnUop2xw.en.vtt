00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
let's suppose is the side Q R K so this

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.220 
let's suppose is the side Q R K so this
is<00:00:56.610> Q<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.320> r<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.190> it's<00:00:59.879> equal<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.449> 12

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
is Q this is r and it's equal to 12

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.149 
is Q this is r and it's equal to 12
centimeters<00:01:01.680> that's<00:01:02.250> given<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.550> us<00:01:02.699> right<00:01:02.969> and

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
centimeters that's given to us right and

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.240 
centimeters that's given to us right and
the<00:01:05.159> other<00:01:05.460> two<00:01:05.760> sides<00:01:06.000> are<00:01:07.040> say<00:01:08.040> like<00:01:08.369> this

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
the other two sides are say like this

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.570 
the other two sides are say like this
okay<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:12.240> will<00:01:12.479> be<00:01:12.659> point<00:01:13.020> P<00:01:13.310> let's<00:01:14.310> put

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
okay and this will be point P let's put

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.370 
okay and this will be point P let's put
some<00:01:14.760> color<00:01:15.060> into<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:17.210> okay<00:01:18.240> next<00:01:19.049> what<00:01:19.200> we

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
some color into it okay next what we

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.450 
some color into it okay next what we
know<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.740> P<00:01:19.979> Q<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.400> equal<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.759> P<00:01:21.030> R<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:23.130> side

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
know is P Q is equal to P R so this side

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.039 
know is P Q is equal to P R so this side
PQ<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.210> equal<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.900> P<00:01:25.140> R<00:01:25.670> so<00:01:26.670> if<00:01:26.880> P<00:01:27.150> Q<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.630> equal<00:01:27.960> to

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
PQ is equal to P R so if P Q is equal to

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.429 
PQ is equal to P R so if P Q is equal to
P<00:01:28.290> R<00:01:28.500> then<00:01:28.860> we<00:01:28.979> know<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.400> this<00:01:30.329> angle<00:01:30.630> which

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
P R then we know that this angle which

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.920 
P R then we know that this angle which
is<00:01:31.520> P<00:01:32.520> Q<00:01:33.270> R<00:01:33.479> okay<00:01:34.259> let's<00:01:34.680> call<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.070> angle<00:01:35.400> Q

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
is P Q R okay let's call it angle Q

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.950 
is P Q R okay let's call it angle Q
angle<00:01:36.930> Q<00:01:37.290> will<00:01:37.650> be<00:01:37.680> equal<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:39.450> good<00:01:39.780> R

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
angle Q will be equal to and good R

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.940 
angle Q will be equal to and good R
right

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
right

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.060 
right
the<00:01:41.729> angle<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.240> opposite<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.990> equal<00:01:43.409> sides<00:01:43.710> of

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
the angle is opposite the equal sides of

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.969 
the angle is opposite the equal sides of
an<00:01:44.640> isosceles<00:01:44.759> triangle<00:01:45.570> are<00:01:45.869> equal<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:46.500> the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
an isosceles triangle are equal so the

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.550 
an isosceles triangle are equal so the
angle<00:01:47.340> opposite<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.090> side<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.689> angle<00:01:49.380> R

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
angle opposite to this side is angle R

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.649 
angle opposite to this side is angle R
and<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.009> angle<00:01:50.040> opposite<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.939> this<00:01:51.119> side<00:01:51.420> is

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
and the angle opposite to this side is

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.670 
and the angle opposite to this side is
angle<00:01:52.200> Q<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:52.979> angle<00:01:53.640> Q<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.180> equal<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.960> angle<00:01:55.200> R

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
angle Q so angle Q is equal to angle R

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.620 
angle Q so angle Q is equal to angle R
since<00:01:56.310> PQ<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.420> PR<00:01:57.630> are<00:01:58.229> equal<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:58.829> this<00:01:59.630> angle

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
since PQ and PR are equal so this angle

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.120 
since PQ and PR are equal so this angle
angle<00:02:01.350> Q<00:02:01.920> is<00:02:02.189> equal<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.869> angle<00:02:03.869> R<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.409> what<00:02:04.979> we

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
angle Q is equal to angle R and what we

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.839 
angle Q is equal to angle R and what we
also<00:02:05.340> know<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:06.170> angle<00:02:07.170> Q<00:02:07.439> or<00:02:07.710> angle<00:02:08.129> PQR<00:02:08.399> is

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
also know is angle Q or angle PQR is

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.839 
also know is angle Q or angle PQR is
equal<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.720> 50<00:02:10.319> degrees<00:02:10.739> so<00:02:11.220> this<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.580> 50

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
equal to 50 degrees so this is 50

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.170 
equal to 50 degrees so this is 50
degrees<00:02:12.150> right<00:02:12.390> P

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
degrees right P

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.649 
degrees right P
q<00:02:13.840> our<00:02:14.140> angle<00:02:14.739> PQR<00:02:14.920> is<00:02:15.609> equal<00:02:15.969> to<00:02:16.090> 50<00:02:16.359> degrees

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:16.659 
q our angle PQR is equal to 50 degrees

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:19.530 
q our angle PQR is equal to 50 degrees
so<00:02:17.049> if<00:02:17.200> angle<00:02:17.500> PQR<00:02:17.709> is<00:02:18.430> equal<00:02:18.819> to<00:02:18.909> 50<00:02:19.209> degrees

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
so if angle PQR is equal to 50 degrees

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.559 
so if angle PQR is equal to 50 degrees
then<00:02:20.109> angle<00:02:20.590> r<00:02:20.799> must<00:02:21.280> also<00:02:21.549> be<00:02:21.879> equal<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.269> 50

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
then angle r must also be equal to 50

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.110 
then angle r must also be equal to 50
degrees<00:02:22.870> right<00:02:23.079> angle<00:02:23.620> PR<00:02:24.129> q<00:02:24.519> must<00:02:24.700> also<00:02:24.879> be

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
degrees right angle PR q must also be

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.020 
degrees right angle PR q must also be
equal<00:02:25.329> to<00:02:25.359> 50<00:02:25.659> degrees<00:02:25.900> so<00:02:26.019> this<00:02:26.200> is<00:02:26.439> equal<00:02:26.920> to

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
equal to 50 degrees so this is equal to

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.879 
equal to 50 degrees so this is equal to
50<00:02:28.030> degrees<00:02:28.390> that's<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:29.170> property<00:02:29.500> of<00:02:29.620> the

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:29.889 
50 degrees that's the property of the

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:31.709 
50 degrees that's the property of the
essence<00:02:30.159> of<00:02:30.310> triangle<00:02:30.730> that<00:02:30.819> the<00:02:30.969> angles

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:31.719 
essence of triangle that the angles

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:35.580 
essence of triangle that the angles
opposite<00:02:32.349> the<00:02:32.799> equal<00:02:33.280> sides<00:02:33.609> are<00:02:34.090> also<00:02:34.750> equal

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
opposite the equal sides are also equal

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.699 
opposite the equal sides are also equal
so<00:02:35.859> Q<00:02:36.489> is<00:02:36.519> 50<00:02:36.969> degrees<00:02:37.269> therefore<00:02:37.750> R<00:02:38.200> is<00:02:38.230> also

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
so Q is 50 degrees therefore R is also

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.369 
so Q is 50 degrees therefore R is also
equal<00:02:38.889> to<00:02:38.920> now<00:02:39.819> it<00:02:40.030> becomes<00:02:40.389> fairly<00:02:40.629> easy<00:02:41.200> to

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
equal to now it becomes fairly easy to

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.830 
equal to now it becomes fairly easy to
draw<00:02:42.250> this<00:02:42.489> triangle<00:02:42.790> okay<00:02:43.209> so<00:02:43.480> let's<00:02:43.659> do<00:02:43.810> that

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
draw this triangle okay so let's do that

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.460

let's<00:02:43.989> take<00:02:44.409> a<00:02:44.469> ruler<00:02:44.739> and<00:02:45.069> draw<00:02:45.639> a<00:02:45.849> side<00:02:46.150> of<00:02:46.510> 12

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
let's take a ruler and draw a side of 12

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.960 
let's take a ruler and draw a side of 12
centimeters<00:02:48.340> so<00:02:48.879> here<00:02:49.120> is<00:02:49.209> my<00:02:49.359> ruler<00:02:50.790> place<00:02:51.790> it

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
centimeters so here is my ruler place it

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.530 
centimeters so here is my ruler place it
here<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:54.450> draw<00:02:55.450> a<00:02:55.480> line<00:02:55.840> that<00:02:56.489> 12<00:02:57.540> centimeters

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
here and draw a line that 12 centimeters

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:05.089 
here and draw a line that 12 centimeters
long<00:02:59.349> okay<00:03:00.099> so<00:03:00.790> 0<00:03:01.120> to<00:03:01.269> 12<00:03:01.480> here<00:03:03.030> now<00:03:04.030> this<00:03:04.359> is<00:03:04.419> Q

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
long okay so 0 to 12 here now this is Q

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:11.819 
long okay so 0 to 12 here now this is Q
this<00:03:06.099> is<00:03:06.340> R<00:03:06.849> and<00:03:07.299> this<00:03:08.019> is<00:03:08.430> 12<00:03:09.599> right<00:03:10.599> now<00:03:10.900> angle

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
this is R and this is 12 right now angle

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:16.619 
this is R and this is 12 right now angle
Q<00:03:12.129> or<00:03:12.370> angle<00:03:12.909> P<00:03:13.870> Q<00:03:14.560> R<00:03:14.769> is<00:03:15.430> equal<00:03:15.879> to<00:03:16.000> 50<00:03:16.299> degrees

so<00:03:16.810> let's<00:03:17.019> take<00:03:17.229> a<00:03:17.260> protractor<00:03:18.389> okay

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:19.629 
so let's take a protractor okay

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:22.619 
so let's take a protractor okay
this<00:03:19.989> protractor<00:03:20.590> here<00:03:20.889> put<00:03:21.699> it<00:03:21.819> on<00:03:21.909> Q<00:03:22.269> and

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:22.629 
this protractor here put it on Q and

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:27.000 
this protractor here put it on Q and
Mark<00:03:23.319> and<00:03:23.650> angle<00:03:24.190> off<00:03:24.900> 50<00:03:25.900> degrees<00:03:26.260> right<00:03:26.470> so

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
Mark and angle off 50 degrees right so

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.089 
Mark and angle off 50 degrees right so
let's<00:03:27.190> do<00:03:27.340> that<00:03:29.040> let<00:03:30.040> us<00:03:30.750> put<00:03:31.750> a<00:03:31.989> point<00:03:32.470> here<00:03:32.859> at

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
let's do that let us put a point here at

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.800 
let's do that let us put a point here at
50<00:03:33.549> degrees<00:03:33.879> right<00:03:34.629> 0<00:03:35.260> 10<00:03:35.590> 20<00:03:35.889> 30<00:03:36.370> 40<00:03:36.849> 50<00:03:37.030> put<00:03:37.780> a

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
50 degrees right 0 10 20 30 40 50 put a

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.409 
50 degrees right 0 10 20 30 40 50 put a
mark<00:03:38.079> at<00:03:38.229> 50<00:03:38.500> degrees<00:03:38.829> then<00:03:39.540> join<00:03:40.919> from<00:03:41.919> Q<00:03:42.419> to

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:43.419 
mark at 50 degrees then join from Q to

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:46.140 
mark at 50 degrees then join from Q to
the<00:03:43.569> point<00:03:43.900> and<00:03:44.199> through<00:03:44.439> okay<00:03:45.069> so<00:03:45.489> this<00:03:45.639> is<00:03:45.849> 50

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
the point and through okay so this is 50

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.719 
the point and through okay so this is 50
degrees<00:03:46.479> all<00:03:46.780> right<00:03:47.530> what<00:03:48.310> next

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:48.729 
degrees all right what next

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:51.089 
degrees all right what next
well<00:03:49.000> angle<00:03:49.449> R<00:03:49.659> is<00:03:49.900> also<00:03:50.199> equal<00:03:50.470> to<00:03:50.560> 50<00:03:50.829> degrees

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
well angle R is also equal to 50 degrees

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.849 
well angle R is also equal to 50 degrees
so<00:03:51.250> we<00:03:51.340> take<00:03:51.549> the<00:03:51.699> protractor<00:03:52.530> move<00:03:53.530> it<00:03:53.709> to

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
so we take the protractor move it to

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:58.259 
so we take the protractor move it to
point<00:03:54.189> R<00:03:54.489> and<00:03:55.590> Mark<00:03:56.590> another<00:03:56.829> line<00:03:57.459> so<00:03:58.120> that

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
point R and Mark another line so that

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.509 
point R and Mark another line so that
angle<00:03:58.449> R<00:03:58.780> over<00:03:59.079> here<00:03:59.349> is<00:03:59.560> equal<00:04:00.000> to<00:04:01.079> 50<00:04:02.079> degrees

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
angle R over here is equal to 50 degrees

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.149 
angle R over here is equal to 50 degrees
okay<00:04:03.519> so<00:04:04.709> let's<00:04:05.709> do<00:04:05.919> that

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:06.159 
okay so let's do that

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:10.259 
okay so let's do that
at<00:04:06.970> this<00:04:07.150> point<00:04:07.479> over<00:04:07.720> here<00:04:08.699> let's<00:04:09.699> join<00:04:10.030> the

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
at this point over here let's join the

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:15.509 
at this point over here let's join the
two<00:04:11.069> through<00:04:12.870> there<00:04:13.870> you<00:04:14.049> go<00:04:14.199> now<00:04:15.009> the<00:04:15.069> point

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
two through there you go now the point

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.509 
two through there you go now the point
at<00:04:15.790> which<00:04:16.150> the<00:04:16.419> two<00:04:16.449> lines<00:04:16.900> cross<00:04:17.139> is<00:04:17.889> your

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
at which the two lines cross is your

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.200 
at which the two lines cross is your
point<00:04:18.909> P<00:04:19.120> and<00:04:19.329> this<00:04:19.539> is<00:04:19.720> your<00:04:19.900> triangle<00:04:21.210> PQR

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
point P and this is your triangle PQR

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.029 
point P and this is your triangle PQR
the<00:04:22.539> isosceles<00:04:22.810> triangle<00:04:23.529> that<00:04:23.710> you've<00:04:23.889> been

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
the isosceles triangle that you've been

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:26.800 
the isosceles triangle that you've been
asked<00:04:24.190> to<00:04:24.310> trouble<00:04:24.729> okay<00:04:25.330> now<00:04:25.750> this

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
asked to trouble okay now this

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.129 
asked to trouble okay now this
girl<00:04:27.080> we<00:04:27.320> know<00:04:27.500> is<00:04:27.770> equal<00:04:28.040> to<00:04:28.780> 50<00:04:29.780> degrees

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
girl we know is equal to 50 degrees

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.580 
girl we know is equal to 50 degrees
right<00:04:30.440> and<00:04:31.070> this<00:04:31.669> angle<00:04:31.970> is<00:04:32.360> also<00:04:32.870> 50<00:04:33.260> degrees

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
right and this angle is also 50 degrees

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.210 
right and this angle is also 50 degrees
now<00:04:34.340> what<00:04:34.639> should<00:04:34.820> this<00:04:35.060> angle<00:04:35.450> be<00:04:35.570> equal<00:04:35.870> to

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
now what should this angle be equal to

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.670 
now what should this angle be equal to
it's<00:04:37.220> quite<00:04:37.400> simple<00:04:37.790> the<00:04:38.419> sum<00:04:38.660> of<00:04:38.870> all<00:04:39.440> the

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
it's quite simple the sum of all the

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.700 
it's quite simple the sum of all the
angles<00:04:39.800> of<00:04:40.130> a<00:04:40.220> triangle<00:04:40.490> is<00:04:40.850> 180<00:04:41.450> degrees<00:04:42.110> so

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
angles of a triangle is 180 degrees so

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.430 
angles of a triangle is 180 degrees so
if<00:04:42.950> this<00:04:43.190> is<00:04:43.400> 50<00:04:43.790> and<00:04:44.000> this<00:04:44.150> is<00:04:44.330> 50<00:04:44.720> then<00:04:45.169> this

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
if this is 50 and this is 50 then this

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.960 
if this is 50 and this is 50 then this
angle<00:04:45.889> will<00:04:46.100> be<00:04:46.130> 180<00:04:47.030> minus<00:04:47.770> 50<00:04:48.770> minus<00:04:49.400> 50

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
angle will be 180 minus 50 minus 50

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.840 
angle will be 180 minus 50 minus 50
which<00:04:50.780> is<00:04:51.050> what<00:04:51.410> let's<00:04:51.620> see<00:04:51.770> 180<00:04:52.130> minus<00:04:52.490> 50<00:04:52.790> is

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
which is what let's see 180 minus 50 is

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.980 
which is what let's see 180 minus 50 is
130<00:04:53.300> 130<00:04:54.200> minus<00:04:54.650> 50<00:04:54.980> is<00:04:55.160> 80<00:04:55.430> so<00:04:56.150> this<00:04:56.510> is<00:04:56.660> equal

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
130 130 minus 50 is 80 so this is equal

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.290 
130 130 minus 50 is 80 so this is equal
to<00:04:57.020> 80<00:04:57.350> degrees<00:04:57.889> let's<00:04:58.400> see<00:04:58.610> if<00:04:58.790> this<00:04:59.060> really

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
to 80 degrees let's see if this really

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.780 
to 80 degrees let's see if this really
is<00:04:59.540> 80<00:04:59.810> or<00:04:59.960> not<00:05:00.139> okay<00:05:00.380> so<00:05:00.830> I<00:05:01.220> take<00:05:01.760> my

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
is 80 or not okay so I take my

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:08.620 
is 80 or not okay so I take my
protractor<00:05:02.950> turn<00:05:03.950> it<00:05:04.960> okay<00:05:05.960> place<00:05:06.410> it<00:05:06.620> here<00:05:07.630> at

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
protractor turn it okay place it here at

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:16.810 
protractor turn it okay place it here at
B<00:05:09.380> and<00:05:11.740> let's<00:05:12.740> see<00:05:12.979> okay<00:05:13.820> 0<00:05:14.570> 10<00:05:14.990> 20<00:05:15.590> 30<00:05:15.979> 40<00:05:16.010> 50<00:05:16.580> 60

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
B and let's see okay 0 10 20 30 40 50 60

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.810 
B and let's see okay 0 10 20 30 40 50 60
70<00:05:17.210> and<00:05:17.720> 80<00:05:17.840> so<00:05:18.229> this<00:05:18.440> angle<00:05:18.680> really<00:05:19.100> is<00:05:19.520> 80

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
70 and 80 so this angle really is 80

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.750 
70 and 80 so this angle really is 80
degrees<00:05:20.030> right<00:05:20.840> so<00:05:21.050> this<00:05:21.169> is<00:05:21.229> correct<00:05:21.710> this<00:05:22.400> is

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
degrees right so this is correct this is

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.909 
degrees right so this is correct this is
equal<00:05:23.419> to<00:05:24.250> 80<00:05:25.930> degrees<00:05:26.930> but<00:05:27.380> how<00:05:27.590> about<00:05:27.710> the

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
equal to 80 degrees but how about the

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:30.190 
equal to 80 degrees but how about the
two<00:05:28.070> sides<00:05:28.310> PQ<00:05:28.970> and<00:05:29.180> PR<00:05:29.210> are<00:05:29.780> they<00:05:29.930> really

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
two sides PQ and PR are they really

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.140 
two sides PQ and PR are they really
equal<00:05:30.560> but<00:05:31.039> let's<00:05:31.250> see<00:05:31.370> let's<00:05:31.610> measure<00:05:31.820> them

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
equal but let's see let's measure them

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.170 
equal but let's see let's measure them
and<00:05:32.390> see<00:05:33.050> if<00:05:33.080> they<00:05:33.470> are<00:05:33.560> really<00:05:33.800> the<00:05:34.520> same<00:05:34.820> size

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
and see if they are really the same size

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.820 
and see if they are really the same size
or<00:05:35.450> not<00:05:35.600> okay<00:05:36.320> so<00:05:36.830> take<00:05:37.550> this<00:05:37.729> ruler<00:05:38.120> and<00:05:38.840> turn

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
or not okay so take this ruler and turn

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.510 
or not okay so take this ruler and turn
it<00:05:40.160> and<00:05:40.729> see<00:05:41.479> how<00:05:41.690> much<00:05:41.900> the<00:05:42.830> length<00:05:43.130> of<00:05:43.340> this

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
it and see how much the length of this

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:49.659 
it and see how much the length of this
line<00:05:43.789> is<00:05:44.710> let's<00:05:45.710> see<00:05:46.419> this<00:05:47.419> is<00:05:47.770> equal<00:05:48.770> to<00:05:48.800> looks

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
line is let's see this is equal to looks

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:51.190 
line is let's see this is equal to looks
like<00:05:49.850> it's<00:05:50.060> about<00:05:50.180> nine<00:05:50.539> point<00:05:50.990> three

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.200 
like it's about nine point three

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.990 
like it's about nine point three
centimeters<00:05:51.860> okay

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
centimeters okay

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.920 
centimeters okay
so<00:05:53.510> we<00:05:53.630> write<00:05:53.750> that<00:05:53.990> down<00:05:54.169> here<00:05:54.500> that<00:05:55.630> this<00:05:56.630> is

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
so we write that down here that this is

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.360 
so we write that down here that this is
sine<00:05:57.860> PQ<00:05:58.850> is<00:05:59.060> nine<00:05:59.479> point<00:06:00.050> three<00:06:00.500> centimeters

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
sine PQ is nine point three centimeters

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.909 
sine PQ is nine point three centimeters
but<00:06:02.000> is<00:06:02.210> side<00:06:02.539> P<00:06:02.900> are<00:06:03.110> also<00:06:03.289> equal<00:06:03.680> to<00:06:03.710> nine

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 
but is side P are also equal to nine

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:06.060 
but is side P are also equal to nine
point<00:06:03.950> three<00:06:04.280> centimeters<00:06:04.700> let's<00:06:05.510> find<00:06:05.720> out

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
point three centimeters let's find out

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:12.370 
point three centimeters let's find out
so<00:06:07.070> we<00:06:08.440> turn<00:06:09.440> it<00:06:09.710> one<00:06:10.070> more<00:06:10.280> time<00:06:10.690> here<00:06:11.690> put<00:06:12.260> the

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.380 
so we turn it one more time here put the

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.650 
so we turn it one more time here put the
zero<00:06:12.820> on<00:06:13.820> P<00:06:14.950> let's<00:06:15.950> see<00:06:16.130> well<00:06:16.880> this<00:06:17.180> one<00:06:17.419> also

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:17.660 
zero on P let's see well this one also

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.500 
zero on P let's see well this one also
looks<00:06:17.900> like<00:06:18.380> it's<00:06:18.770> nine<00:06:19.490> point<00:06:19.970> three<00:06:20.060> this<00:06:20.360> is

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:20.510 
looks like it's nine point three this is

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.779 
looks like it's nine point three this is
nine<00:06:20.690> nine<00:06:21.200> point<00:06:21.500> one<00:06:21.590> nine<00:06:21.710> point<00:06:22.310> two<00:06:22.400> and

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:22.789 
nine nine point one nine point two and

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:25.510 
nine nine point one nine point two and
nine<00:06:22.910> point<00:06:23.240> three<00:06:23.300> so<00:06:23.840> side<00:06:24.050> PR<00:06:24.560> is<00:06:24.889> also

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 
nine point three so side PR is also

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.390 
nine point three so side PR is also
equal<00:06:25.940> to<00:06:26.090> nine<00:06:26.330> point<00:06:26.720> three<00:06:26.950> so<00:06:27.950> there<00:06:28.280> you

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 
equal to nine point three so there you

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.779 
equal to nine point three so there you
go<00:06:28.840> you've<00:06:29.840> drawn<00:06:30.229> the<00:06:30.260> correct<00:06:31.100> triangle

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:31.789 
go you've drawn the correct triangle

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:33.779 
go you've drawn the correct triangle
okay<00:06:32.120> so<00:06:32.479> this<00:06:32.600> is<00:06:32.780> an<00:06:32.900> isosceles<00:06:33.229> triangle

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:33.789 
okay so this is an isosceles triangle

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:37.000 
okay so this is an isosceles triangle
the<00:06:34.789> two<00:06:35.000> sides<00:06:35.330> are<00:06:35.780> equal<00:06:36.349> to<00:06:36.740> nine<00:06:36.979> point

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.010 
the two sides are equal to nine point

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.700 
the two sides are equal to nine point
three<00:06:37.400> centimeters<00:06:37.880> and<00:06:38.510> the<00:06:38.870> angles<00:06:39.289> of

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:39.710 
three centimeters and the angles of

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.510 
three centimeters and the angles of
to<00:06:39.890> them<00:06:40.070> are<00:06:40.370> equal<00:06:40.880> to<00:06:41.030> fifty<00:06:41.360> degrees<00:06:41.720> and

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 
to them are equal to fifty degrees and

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.640 
to them are equal to fifty degrees and
the<00:06:43.520> other<00:06:43.550> angle<00:06:43.940> is<00:06:44.300> 80<00:06:44.540> degrees<00:06:44.960> and<00:06:45.260> the

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:45.650 
the other angle is 80 degrees and the

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.010 
the other angle is 80 degrees and the
other<00:06:45.680> side<00:06:46.220> that<00:06:46.400> was<00:06:46.550> given<00:06:46.850> to<00:06:46.970> us<00:06:47.150> is<00:06:47.480> 12

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020 
other side that was given to us is 12

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.290 
other side that was given to us is 12
centimeters<00:06:48.410> all<00:06:49.370> right<00:06:49.610> well<00:06:49.790> that's<00:06:49.970> it
