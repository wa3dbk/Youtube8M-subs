00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:05.930 
by weight down he goes

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.290 
by weight down he goes
I<00:00:05.959> say<00:00:06.890> when<00:00:07.009> Paul<00:00:07.220> maybe<00:00:07.700> broke<00:00:07.910> the<00:00:07.999> record

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:08.300 
I say when Paul maybe broke the record

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.150 
I say when Paul maybe broke the record
and<00:00:09.140> I<00:00:09.230> think<00:00:09.440> that<00:00:09.530> was<00:00:09.620> a<00:00:09.680> favorite<00:00:09.950> play<00:00:10.130> of

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.160 
and I think that was a favorite play of

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.010 
and I think that was a favorite play of
all<00:00:10.400> we<00:00:10.580> all<00:00:10.910> wanted<00:00:11.120> him<00:00:11.300> to<00:00:11.330> break<00:00:11.930> the

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:12.020 
all we all wanted him to break the

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.600 
all we all wanted him to break the
record<00:00:12.170> and<00:00:12.380> I<00:00:12.620> think<00:00:13.100> we<00:00:13.190> played<00:00:13.310> together

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.610
