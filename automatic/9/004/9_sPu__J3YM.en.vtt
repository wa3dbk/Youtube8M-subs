00:00:17.389 --> 00:00:19.860
 Good evening, welcome to "Hat-trick Barça"! 

00:00:20.276 --> 00:00:22.421
 Today we have news for you related to Barça transfers. 

00:00:22.421 --> 00:00:23.351
 What, Pichi? 

00:00:23.351 --> 00:00:27.477
 Yes, I think that Litmanen can be a surprising move. 

00:00:27.477 --> 00:00:30.918
 What are you talking about Pichi? Litmanena was bought in 1999. 

00:00:31.935 --> 00:00:34.896
 You already know that I do not like to rush. 

00:00:35.018 --> 00:00:40.487
 Okay .. As every year, the sports press presents the possible Barça transfers. 

00:00:40.487 --> 00:00:43.624
 And not that much. Here are some examples: 

00:00:58.105 --> 00:00:59.640
 And many other. 

00:01:00.618 --> 00:01:05.604
 There are so many of them that we prefer to talk to players that Barça does not want. 

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:09.139
 With us are ... Swede Magnuss Sörensen 

00:01:09.584 --> 00:01:11.609
 and Romanian Andrei Balanescu 

00:01:12.425 --> 00:01:15.629
 better known as the "Koala Carpathians" ... 

00:01:27.122 --> 00:01:30.494
 And everything is clear. Thank you... 

00:01:31.927 --> 00:01:36.401
 Well, here are the two players Barça does not want next season ... 

00:01:39.574 --> 00:01:40.560
 Thanks. 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.200
 Breaking news... 

00:01:45.552 --> 00:01:51.340
 The technical secretariat is interested in Balanescu as a reinforcement of Barcelona's defense. 

00:01:51.338 --> 00:01:52.460
 Congratulations! 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.410
 Thank you, thank you! 

00:02:01.117 --> 00:02:04.130
 Thank you, you can go back to training. 

00:02:04.743 --> 00:02:07.000
 Here we are only talking with those that Barça does not want. 

00:02:07.322 --> 00:02:10.160
 Come on, goodbye to you ... Excursion !! 

00:02:12.195 --> 00:02:19.870
 Well, see, Pichi ... Magnuss Sörensen, the only player he does not want Barça. 

00:02:19.867 --> 00:02:21.110
 Yes thank you. 

00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:23.270
 But I feel sorry for this guy. 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:29.170
 If they do not want him, he must have a pathetic technique and no score. 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.990
 Yes thank you. 

00:02:33.874 --> 00:02:35.370
 Nice victim, Pichi! 

00:02:35.676 --> 00:02:38.890
 It is obvious that this player does not have Barça DNA. 

00:02:38.894 --> 00:02:42.220
 How do you know if anyone has or does not have Barça's DNA? 

00:02:42.225 --> 00:02:46.650
 It's easy, you just have to do the Barometer test. 

00:02:46.652 --> 00:02:47.510
 How? 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.160
 It's very simple, you need to get a few drops of sweat from the player 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.970
 and the result will be displayed soon. 

00:02:55.255 --> 00:02:56.270
 Yes thank you. 

00:02:56.533 --> 00:02:57.420
 And what came out, Pichi? 

00:02:58.701 --> 00:02:59.640
 Well what result? 

00:03:00.353 --> 00:03:01.380
 Dude, what is it? 

00:03:02.126 --> 00:03:03.390
 But emotions ... 

00:03:05.104 --> 00:03:08.050
 Now! We already have the result. 

00:03:08.048 --> 00:03:11.850
 This player can not play for Barça. 

00:03:11.847 --> 00:03:17.600
 There is no Blaugrana DNA and is in the third month of pregnancy. 

00:03:21.452 --> 00:03:24.000
 Yes! Thank you! 

00:03:25.203 --> 00:03:26.350
 Are you sure Pichi? 

00:03:26.988 --> 00:03:30.750
 Yes, and he thinks I'm the father. 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.440
 Xavier, help me!
