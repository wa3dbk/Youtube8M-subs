the<00:00:47.370> floor<00:00:47.610> over<00:00:47.910> here<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.590> just<00:00:49.590> finished<00:00:50.309> it

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
the floor over here I just finished it

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.819 
the floor over here I just finished it
it<00:00:50.670> took<00:00:51.120> me<00:00:51.329> about<00:00:51.660> two<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.320> half<00:00:52.350> hours

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
it took me about two and a half hours

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.959 
it took me about two and a half hours
but<00:00:53.160> as<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:54.000> can<00:00:54.149> see<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.420> took<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:55.610> like<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.640> tote

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
but as you can see I took a like a tote

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.630 
but as you can see I took a like a tote
just<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.629> tote<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.670> what<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.699> did<00:01:00.000> was<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.539> got<00:01:00.570> the

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
just a tote and what I did was I got the

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.350 
just a tote and what I did was I got the
insulation<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:04.309> comes<00:01:05.309> in<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.610> roll<00:01:05.820> I

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
insulation that comes in a roll I

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.270 
insulation that comes in a roll I
thought<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.260> brought<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.680> over<00:01:07.799> here<00:01:08.070> but

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
thought I brought it over here but

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.240 
thought I brought it over here but
anyway<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:09.090> comes<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.689> roll<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.290> what<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:10.979> did

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
anyway it comes in a roll and what I did

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.050 
anyway it comes in a roll and what I did
was<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.490> just<00:01:12.619> unrolled<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.100> then<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.610> folded

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
was I just unrolled it and then I folded

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.730 
was I just unrolled it and then I folded
it<00:01:15.210> down<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.500> fashion<00:01:17.189> that's<00:01:17.430> double<00:01:18.740> double

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
it down in fashion that's double double

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.149 
it down in fashion that's double double
panes<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:21.119> it'll<00:01:21.810> insulate<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.710> inside

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
panes so that it'll insulate the inside

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.980 
panes so that it'll insulate the inside
of<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.930> tote<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.799> then<00:01:26.700> what<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.880> did<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.600> I

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
of the the tote and then what I did is I

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.969 
of the the tote and then what I did is I
took<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.979> top<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.820> tote<00:01:30.600> as<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.590> can<00:01:31.740> see

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
took the top of the tote as you can see

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.819 
took the top of the tote as you can see
over<00:01:32.159> here<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.420> cut<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.659> hole<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.229> the

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
over here and I cut a hole in it the

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.440 
over here and I cut a hole in it the
whole<00:01:34.860> intent<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.610> supposed<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.150> be<00:01:36.299> big

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
whole intent is supposed to be big

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.859 
whole intent is supposed to be big
enough<00:01:36.570> for<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:37.079> cat<00:01:37.820> and<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:39.299> course<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.720> I

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
enough for the cat and of course I I

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.080 
enough for the cat and of course I I
duct-taped<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.560> edges<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.520> wouldn't

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
duct-taped the edges so it wouldn't

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.969 
duct-taped the edges so it wouldn't
scratch<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.630> cat<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.259> he's<00:01:43.409> going<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.799> there

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
scratch the cat a is he's going in there

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.609 
scratch the cat a is he's going in there
if<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:44.970> back<00:01:45.210> up<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.570> little<00:01:45.750> bit<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.110> can<00:01:46.290> see

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
if I back up a little bit you can see

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.080 
if I back up a little bit you can see
the<00:01:46.939> full<00:01:47.939> view<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:49.520> that's<00:01:50.520> what<00:01:50.880> the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
the full view of it so that's what the

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.679 
the full view of it so that's what the
cat<00:01:51.479> back<00:01:51.720> box<00:01:52.229> looks<00:01:53.130> like<00:01:53.399> with<00:01:54.210> double

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
cat back box looks like with double

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.920 
cat back box looks like with double
layers<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:55.460> insulation<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:57.299> when<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.750> take

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
layers of insulation and when you take

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.770 
layers of insulation and when you take
it<00:01:58.079> off<00:01:58.229> I'm<00:01:59.180> going<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.270> show<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.630> inside

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
it off I'm going to show you the inside

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.149 
it off I'm going to show you the inside
of<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.530> door<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:03.060> top<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.719> which<00:02:04.649> I

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
of the door the top of it which I

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.710 
of the door the top of it which I
insulated

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
insulated

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.920 
insulated
all<00:02:07.320> around<00:02:07.650> the<00:02:07.770> edges<00:02:08.130> of<00:02:08.509> where<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.660> hole

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 
all around the edges of where that hole

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.260 
all around the edges of where that hole
is<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.710> then<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.220> thought<00:02:11.520> well<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:11.880> know<00:02:11.910> what

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
is and then I thought well you know what

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.540 
is and then I thought well you know what
