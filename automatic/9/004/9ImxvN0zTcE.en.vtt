wanted<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:02.789> car<00:01:03.089> I<00:01:03.659> wouldn't<00:01:03.899> have<00:01:04.049> the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.710 
wanted in this car I wouldn't have the
details<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.710> think<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.369> will<00:01:05.489> be<00:01:05.549> based<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.600> the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
details I think it will be based on the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.460 
details I think it will be based on the
fact

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
fact

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.950 
fact
I'm<00:01:09.370> sure<00:01:09.640> this<00:01:10.210> would<00:01:10.390> be<00:01:10.510> a<00:01:10.570> huge<00:01:10.720> success

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
I'm sure this would be a huge success

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.510 
I'm sure this would be a huge success
and<00:01:11.200> so<00:01:11.470> as<00:01:11.620> well<00:01:11.860> it<00:01:12.070> will<00:01:12.160> need<00:01:12.400> to

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
and so as well it will need to

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.400 
and so as well it will need to
penetration<00:01:12.970> more<00:01:13.420> awareness<00:01:13.690> public<00:01:14.080> aunty

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
penetration more awareness public aunty

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.640 
penetration more awareness public aunty
and<00:01:15.250> I<00:01:15.700> think<00:01:15.880> a<00:01:16.060> lot<00:01:16.090> more<00:01:16.330> people<00:01:16.630> who<00:01:16.870> can't
