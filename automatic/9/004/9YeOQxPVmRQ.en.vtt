00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.799
 do not 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.320
 hi hello girl and today is one more day to me 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.110
 channel and today I bring you a 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.110
 tutorial makeup inspired by two of 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.060
 my favorite palettes of the moment one of 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.010
 They are the vanilla chocolate 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.450
 I inspired to use the colors of 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.270
 shades higher then in shades 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.640
 chocolate stretched etcetera and the other 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.440
 is the electric of urban the key that 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.870
 I'm in love with her and it's the 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.820
 first video supervised with her but 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.559
 I'm going to do a lot more because every 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.570
 one of the tones has inspired me 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.430
 very much in doing different tutorials 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.110
 this time I decided to use this 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.970
 palette in a discreet way so that 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.950
 see that in people who want it 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.600
 buy do not necessarily have to why 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.580
 make makeup too exaggerated 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.750
 using all the colors because it brings 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.210
 the palette of truth that can not 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.190
 use is also simply colors 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.509
 neutral top and the bottom 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.729
 as I said today you can 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.950
 use a little color as they say 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.960
 or a color detail we could also 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.430
 say in Spanish then using one of 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.610
 the shadows of this palette that are 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.979
 quite lit well my loves like 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.240
 I have eyes a little and 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.430
 despite striking 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.070
 at the top I decided then 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.840
 keep your neutral lips well not 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.850
 extended the intro more let's see in their 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.820
 the tutorial that my loves and I did 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.340
 my eyebrows and obviously because I made a 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.960
 eye I will place then this prebase 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.390
 which is a tad ahead is called 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.120
 yahoo 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.690
 and I 'm going to put the whole eyelid 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.690
 mobile only 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.450
 never taking it up because 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.890
 I was deprived I have in the shine 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.740
 now I will use the palette 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:15.450
 chocolate bar this beautiful 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.430
 that tonito here that is like gold 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.980
 You can obviously use any 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.739
 gold they have in any little 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.950
 I will put it in all the 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.950
 eyelid 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.540
 and pressing a little 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.920
 anyone can not use this 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.750
 term here is as a tonito 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.370
 candy 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.790
 I like it a lot to use it as 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.190
 transition and I put it at the door of the 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.570
 loin 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.570
 and the beginning of the dry 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.680
 so be it expressed also 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.599
 in all dinner success because I want 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.599
 that this is not 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.590
 now I'm going to use it's brown from here and 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:14.040
 I'm here that are the tones this medium 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:18.260
 and this is already darker as for 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.260
 define the basin and the corner of the eye 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.030
 Y 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:54.250
 I'm going to use this pencil that this god 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:56.349
 it's called 040 metal and pencil this is a 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.760
 blue cobalt blue can use 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.250
 obviously any blue pencil that 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:04.230
 have and I will delineate both the line 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.230
 of water as in the upper lashes 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:21.340
 ok now the electric pallet can 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:25.960
 use this pretty kim of 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:30.930
 corner that is called chaos or chaos and is 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.930
 very blue in terms of blur as it is 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.100
 no longer next to put the eyeliner 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.810

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.780
