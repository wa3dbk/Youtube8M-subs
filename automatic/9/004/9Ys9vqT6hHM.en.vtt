00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.200
 hey people today I have a new video 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.880
 for you and probably already 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.710
 noticed that the background today 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.510
 a little different is that's because 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.770
 that I am currently in my kitchen 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.300
 because you probably already have in 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.250
 read the headline that yes 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.230
 snack video is why I stand today 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.360
 not like everywhere else does not sit like 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.460
 otherwise in my room but stand 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.220
 my kitchen as already said that is 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.290
 video a snack video and that is 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.480
 in cooperation with the tu never from the channel 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.949

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.290
 mean a lot if you but her over 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:51.820
 looks for the subscriber deserves 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.530
 because she makes really good videos 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.000
 that's why switch off the video 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.280
 or just now with her 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.170
 over and let you like an abo and 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.969
 maybe in the high as in the video there 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.300
 and yes, I'll show you this one 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.300
 trailer 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.320
 Yes 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.079
 and if you know what to by snacks 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.670
 you should be able to do me in 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.619
 For example, pictures mark 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.329
 Instagram or twitter and you can me 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.340
 Of course, your pictures on the net 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.869
 send if you want and me 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.909
 I'll get you all over here 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.530
 instagram snapshot and twitter charge 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.319
 link or object 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.390
 if you are not like my own and 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.219
 yes that's why do not forget me on the 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.170
 latte links some with security 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:57.560
 suffer and comment on it 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.969
 for doing something free and free 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.140
 I would say instead now are 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:02.140
 my video a lot of fun 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.250
 instead of the first snack and it is 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.900
 he needs a watermelon ice cream for that 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.900
 first a watermelon and then 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.110
 such ice- cream ice- skins and trees 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.920
 then you first melon in the 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.690
 half and then fourth will be again 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.459
 and if you could have done that then 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.950
 you fill that in, so to speak 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.390
 So use models of pulp 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.650
 I'm not so good at that 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.299
 hinbekommen I could also help 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.950
 leave because they do not even on the 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.269
 then gets a bit 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.359
 took me a while 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.250
 awkward but if you did that 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:46.910
 you can have it all in already 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.680
 give a mixer and I have now 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.359
 one more lime added so one 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.530
 half because it is just a bit 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:54.980
 has more taste and a bit 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.630
 sweeter is and you can do that 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.819
 want and then everything is now only 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.650
 mix and if you did that then 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.190
 now also in your form blow dry and 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.290
 then just have to scribble in but 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.970
 will also eat 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.890
 and so my ice saw then completed and 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.640
 I 'm really delicious was totally 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.040
 was sweet 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.810
 we continue with a plate of ice cream and 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.760
 that's a little bit wrong with me 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.120
 gone and what he needs for it is 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.920
 a spoonful of nutella and then milk and 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.110
 I have a bit too little milk bom 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.730
 so make sure you have a lot more 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.950
 milk than in tennis 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.030
 and then I just as possible 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.799
 given to it 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.390
 and when you have done that then have to 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.769
 you just lose it and then find it 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.810
 even in euro form and then 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.209
 So two to three hours in the 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.829
 put fridge with freezer compartment and 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.000
 if that's the case with you 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.040
 You should not be able to do that anymore 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.349
 you can just get out the top 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:55.230
 lose weight so to speak and then just 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:57.810
 from people that tastes just as good of 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.579
 the next snack is a euro 1 and 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.410
 that tasted really good and for that 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:04.170
 you just need ios and milk 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.629
 and the osz smaller you then ever 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.040
 after how many you want to take 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.900
 your car prius i have three now 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.160
 except for a form and that 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.889
 a little bit too much 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.410
 So 2 1 for a form must 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:18.510
 prove and the only thing we do then 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.760
 make it very curious in euros 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.630
 make 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.020
 join in and then a few more 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.090
 Now stomp boys and if you 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.810
 which then did it is actually 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.810
 already done 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.690
 the next one is a fantastic one 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.540
 you only need two for that 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.680
 ingredients and that's fantastic and then 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.870
 Food coloring I have first 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.520
 the fanta poured into the mold and 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.530
 then a little more food coloring 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.390
 given over and you have to take care 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.190
 that does not mix too much 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.660
 as best not to stir but 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.730
 Just leave it as it is and then 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.600
 the cap on it and when it is in 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:59.900
 In many cases it was about 2 hours, it should be synonymous 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.580
 already finished and then it has to 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.220
 art gradient with me you have is 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.290
 not so good but there are 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.880
 very cool and yes and tastes 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.880
 I always thought it was delicious 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.910
 the big six pack are really cool 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.950
 ice cream spoon finds and what he for 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.350
 it needs first a silicone mold 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:25.440
 why it is elongated and it is there 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.970
 ikea and then berries what 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.040
 Whatever you want and I have there 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:32.850
 now both of them are learning and 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:35.220
 then mint and then distributed 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.750
 just as you want in your form as 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.600
 first into the water and then clean 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.560
 can you put pattern or even so 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.390
 do not do anything 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.280
 you want and I have in the first one 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:47.300
 layer of raspberries and blueberries and 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:50.040
 then only believe then I have minster 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.460
 and so I keep it going 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.460
 made 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.680
 and if you did that because needs 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.120
 everything is really just inspired 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.310
 and if we should get it out then 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.960
 how to be frozen and then how it looks 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.780
 I think it's really cool for 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.949
 any birthdays or parties and 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:19.150
 yes, then it could be a new one 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:21.280
 make a drink and drink the next 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.139
 May I show you how cool you are 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.750
 snacks with bananas strawberries around 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:28.270
 peanut butter and what you can do 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.650
 need for this are first as spies and 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.330
 you should then share the bananas 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.160
 just like the strawberries and if you are 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.380
 You can easily do that in 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.090
 the middle of the strawberry to in 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.919
 peanut butter deletes the other 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.360
 half and the two halves 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:41.979
 then just connect you can there 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.960
 make a dish but I found it 

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:45.960
 the better, and then I've only blue 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.490
 It would be done and then eaten 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.710
 Snack is my absolute favorite song 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.479
 and for that a silicone mold then needs 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:54.550
 Covers or any chocolate 

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:56.500
 the effort and strawberries and what you then 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:59.590
 is that your chocolate in the 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.120
 melt water bath and incidentally can 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.590
 then we will look at your fruits 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.340
 cut so now I have only 

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:08.289
 accepted and how do you then cut in 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:10.060
 quarter pieces and if the chocolate 

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:11.770
 then melted it would have the only 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.050
 give in your silicone mold I have 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:16.690
 now from ikea and then you can always 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.699
 make a strawberry on it and if 

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:20.139
 you did that then you can 

00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:22.120
 put it already in the freezer 

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:24.039
 and after so half an hour would have 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.469
 get out and then you are already 

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:28.270
 Finished those are so small strawberry 

00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:30.130
 chocolate pralines and that was not so 

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:33.479
 yummy they tasted really good 

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.479
 and yes
