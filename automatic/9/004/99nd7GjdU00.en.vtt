00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.640
 so today before you count that revenue 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.960
 That we 'll try to say hello, I always will. 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.010
 I made a point of speaking the bed of good 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:14.519
 Let's try a paçoca recipe. 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.520
 first time a car also husband 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:22.640
 adores not super easy checker of 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:27.029
 Making is released from peanut butter 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.820
 scallop rapadura looks that block 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.510
 I have not worked in the past 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.360
 compensates and a pinch of salt 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.710
 It's very simple, we'll transform 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.149
 this all in the blender a flour 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.170
 I'll stop talking to him. 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.950
 blender that makes damn noise 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.950
 first sick man 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.010
 The trick here is 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.050
 can see that it will be the year while 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.000
 he got wet 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.170
 you give a shake and stay 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.170
 show you 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:23.680
 hence we're going to rescue ufu from this smoke 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:23.680
 if he leaves and the rapadura 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.700
 and a little more noise from our video 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.700
 every merrier key 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.180
 I was ready for a little bit at the boy's house. 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.540
 so our back 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:02:00.700
 We're going to pass this a pot here. 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:02:04.290
 great race to collect everything always bruno 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:07.479
 a little bit there at the end feeling 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:17.790
 processor is a bit easier but 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:17.790
 The problem is not for those who like it. 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.880
 ie let's search our butter for her 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.310
 It's ok the English way if you want can 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.220
 leave virtually settles in 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:37.180
 bain-marie on the stove 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:41.190
 four colleges are the clothes 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.190
 Let's see how it goes. 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:55.940
 Look at this time we messed up 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:58.930
 little with the spoon 2 tasty it is 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.930
 put your hand in the dough 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:06.700
 the kids are sure to love it there 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:24.700
 so in this recipe we do not use the 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:30.940
 condensed milk in this recipe. 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:33.250
 did not use white sugar in this recipe to 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:39.280
 people not only ingredients of b e 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:41.200
 O natural ingredients there is us 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.310
 I want her to be a little balloon later. 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:49.440
 right 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:49.440
 She's getting a dough 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.240
 remember that we used butter 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.340
 butter when it is refrigerated. 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.590
 hardens 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.710
 so we'll put this into small 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.530
 molds can be silicone mold 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:09.340
 can be that plastic cup of the 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:16.140
 coffee pots can be those 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:21.130
 storage kitchen that will get a 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:23.500
 It's going to be a super giant party. 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:28.390
 people who will love a paçoca of this 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:36.340
 and we'll do it, so I'm back. 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:41.110
 there that paçoca that helps to spoon the 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:46.120
 people model very well too 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:49.840
 kept on a whim and will 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.600

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:57.880
 time to carry your little body you 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:05:01.870
 Pass the plastic film here. 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:04.240
 it you can hear straight from the pot or 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.240
 you can misinform that you have not 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:10.750
 just in time to keep nessi and only 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.090
 It's a very simple bar, right? 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:16.860
 It will be a delight for others. 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.860
