00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
into the creases or whatnot and some

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.420 
into the creases or whatnot and some
color<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:13.940> my<00:02:14.150> top<00:02:14.599> lip<00:02:14.840> is<00:02:14.959> way<00:02:15.170> below<00:02:15.410> but<00:02:15.769> my

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
color and my top lip is way below but my

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.740 
color and my top lip is way below but my
top<00:02:16.610> of<00:02:16.730> it<00:02:16.790> was<00:02:16.880> darker<00:02:17.120> than<00:02:17.150> my<00:02:17.360> bottom<00:02:17.630> lip

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750

but they're both like really pigmented
it's<00:02:20.810> weird<00:02:21.080> so<00:02:21.500> they'll<00:02:22.250> probably<00:02:22.489> be<00:02:22.670> wise

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
it's weird so they'll probably be wise

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.850 
it's weird so they'll probably be wise
to<00:02:23.090> use<00:02:23.180> a<00:02:23.209> primer<00:02:23.569> but<00:02:24.319> I<00:02:24.650> didn't<00:02:25.430> so<00:02:26.860> whatever

but this is a color and it's actually

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.890 
but this is a color and it's actually
really<00:02:37.430> pretty<00:02:37.670> it's<00:02:37.970> like<00:02:38.180> an<00:02:38.330> orange<00:02:38.540> wig
