00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.569
 bye bye then i have lots of them 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.429
 lessons to show you today I will do 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.519
 see a part then that a little bit from 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.009
 to finish is certainly in a few days 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.780
 I will make another video creation in the meantime 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.970
 I wanted to resume the creations that 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.560
 I have not yet shown you that I have from 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.779
 a little bit of time 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.269
 I'll show you the first one immediately 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.359
 which is really one of those now 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.760
 that I finished quite a few days ago ed 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.329
 it's a trash arm and then there's a tool 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.040
 also made of earrings 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.260
 obviously with the same pearls and with the 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.460
 themselves carry out delicious sessions of 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.100
 tape a big record a little bit like 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.570
 see it is a working band 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.420
 obtained by working the cable ties 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.149
 nose and vertical tapes for 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.079
 this I used several pearls and 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.079
 beads that he had bought the day 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.320
 of the meeting if I'm not mistaken in May 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.700
 some months have passed since the meeting 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.180
 creative hands and rome when we are 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.700
 went to the makkah and stone from stones from 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.610
 celine I took notes of the threads 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.850
 of pearls including these like 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.420
 these turquoise should be here 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.600
 Angels de so sorry there is no 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:28.080
 all the sim coral and 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.930
 and then some silver beads 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.810
 these lie none of the minutes e 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.700
 then I took this button on purpose 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.710
 to achieve the management of the 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:43.200
 bracelet that as you can see is this here 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.700
 here it was, I wanted a road to show 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.259
 the part really cost me 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.039
 many hours of work this 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:53.700
 creation however had grown a lot in 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:56.100
 reality comes from a creation from a 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:01.500
 video that showed you look at line up 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:03.659
 a bracelet on if I'm not mistaken 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.119
 however, dancing was much more complex 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.920
 gone for the earrings or used 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.000
 loses of the same type even if not 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.910
 they have exactly the same 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.350
 fantasy that my snow decanated 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.780
 daisy and out nothing then I have 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.750
 set to embed the closures 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.930
 on the back or set of these 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.860
 Berliners in the coral with notes of 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.049
 minutes and it seems that the effect is 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.420
 good because they remained very firm if 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:35.190
 pearl closures and I succeeded 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.840
 finally then to realize this 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.870
 what I took a little bit here too 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.940
 because these are not really regular 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:47.790
 beads in the sea cast 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:49.079
 then I'll show you a house 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.700
 of a tradition that I was 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.579
 forgot to see it already last 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:57.000
 filmed and these are the earrings 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:59.820
 made wire a bit that style 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.310
 ethnic made precisely with the thread of 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.519
 2 mm thick aluminum colored in 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.160
 these colors so castle and then 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:14.750
 precisely the colored metal wire 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:16.700
 and also the romanello here is also 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.940
 these here is not me as been because 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.240
 certain things inspire me that I am 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.710
 simple 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.230
 I'll show you another thing too 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.970
 this is a tutorial I did 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.000
 last year on a bow pendant by 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.910
 snow for now remained in the world drawer 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.220
 I have found a finished mary instead 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.770
 the inspiration I realized this 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:40.100
 leaflet that also serves as a weave 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.870
 precisely to hook on to the collar 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.610
 and in my opinion 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.519
 I was able to make the most of it 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.170
 this this July show indeed 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.209
 adding this decoration with the 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.830
 little leaves then if you want later 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.790
 I make a small tutorial of this 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:58.190
 little leaf that I don't seem to have 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.040
 never seen anywhere 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:05.739
 then the media equaled a consequence 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.739
 simple but I can show you 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:12.459
 thickened on the king species in the middle 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:15.470
 here it is a collar, a necklace 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.840
 that they went to the front with 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.209
 directing the past 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.460
 one end by spending a summer 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.880
 the chain the two ships of the end 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:29.900
 on the other side and from the realized one 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:32.320
 in silver and very dark violet in purple 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.360
 dark purple aubergine 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.190
 so it is very well liked therefore 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.990
 this our taking of the true story of 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.020
 because I liked it so much 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.180
 ok step to another 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.710
 I made these bracelets neither with the 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.830
 given webbing buys from politics 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.830
 active 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.800
 here too he used a component 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.710
 a little details I had this is a 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.529
 ceramic component 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.989
 coli 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:05:02.849
 these are balls donated to 

00:04:57.989 --> 00:05:05.999
 this is a mesh here 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:08.729
 navy in antiqued copper very beautiful that 

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:11.069
 I decided to mount this one 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:12.949
 very very very simple way vi 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:15.889
 I also show other facials 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:19.249
 terrified at this time and am 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:21.779
 very simple breach in the world 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:24.419
 I will show you just because I am 

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:26.999
 very colorful this is nice 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:31.619
 this topaz red tones here 

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:33.569
 on midnight blue and your own matte and ho 

00:05:31.619 --> 00:05:36.809
 also used in mother of pearl of 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:39.689
 this mustard color so this 

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:43.949
 here we will already show this here 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:46.549
 in gray and limina pink with crystals 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:49.499
 pink of eye shit just from 

00:05:46.549 --> 00:05:52.109
 very bright silver all of course 

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:56.729
 15 years attach this green here 

00:05:52.109 --> 00:05:59.020
 pearly white oil and crystals 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:03.370
 this gray green 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:05.889
 Look, I'll show you two more 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:11.379
 wire aggressions that are these 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:16.440
 earrings made with gods say that 

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:16.440
 they go from pink and adapt 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:25.230
 I like them very much and then I do it 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:28.080
 see the last one they can do that I have 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:32.330
 baptized ones because he knows that I 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.330
 it looks like a glue in the field like liena 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.930
 let's say this one comes from a chronicle 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.820
 did in beating the metal 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:42.870
 they will forge to get the shape 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:45.630
 circulate and I have enriched among other things 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:48.150
 this central element is also fruit 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:51.960
 of a forcing to obtain precisely the 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:55.230
 fold and enrich this element e 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:59.400
 of the collar with small washers 

00:06:55.230 --> 00:07:01.110
 of 16 meters trino that I find very much 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.300
 very pretty did not like very much 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:05.700
 had bought some time and this is one 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:10.230
 of ways to was one of the ways to 

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:13.650
 use them here and I alternated 

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:15.330
 all'interramento of silver this point 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:18.480
 we made with the wire comes to 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:20.520
 aluminum I finished my creations for 

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.080
 the moment in a few days I make one 

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.850
 other because I have to resist sea ​​a 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.980
 define some sheet things I wanted 

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:29.120
 show them in the meantime I greet you 

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:29.120
 bye Bye
