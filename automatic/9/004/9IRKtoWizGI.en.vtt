obviously he wouldn't probably get into
the<00:02:06.119> Norwich<00:02:06.390> team<00:02:06.659> but<00:02:06.990> he<00:02:07.530> was<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.740> player

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
manager at Hamilton so that means he's

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.460 
manager at Hamilton so that means he's
now<00:02:11.039> no<00:02:11.340> longer<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.730> player<00:02:11.940> manager<00:02:12.090> but<00:02:12.480> yeah
