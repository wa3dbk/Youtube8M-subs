00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.860 
tuft it done sort of half size after i
submit<00:04:25.310> orders<00:04:25.669> and<00:04:25.700> it<00:04:26.060> seemed<00:04:26.630> fairly

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
submit orders and it seemed fairly

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.590 
submit orders and it seemed fairly
regular<00:04:27.380> i<00:04:27.590> was<00:04:28.010> going<00:04:28.220> round<00:04:28.300> and<00:04:29.300> I<00:04:29.389> thought

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
regular i was going round and I thought

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.450 
regular i was going round and I thought
counted<00:04:29.990> up<00:04:30.169> and<00:04:30.410> it<00:04:30.500> was<00:04:30.860> a<00:04:30.919> lot<00:04:31.010> of<00:04:31.100> literally

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
counted up and it was a lot of literally

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.190 
counted up and it was a lot of literally
every<00:04:31.760> sort<00:04:32.060> of<00:04:32.120> eight<00:04:32.240> bytes<00:04:32.540> or<00:04:32.810> definitely

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
every sort of eight bytes or definitely

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.870 
every sort of eight bytes or definitely
48<00:04:33.889> bytes<00:04:34.280> and<00:04:34.789> you<00:04:35.120> know<00:04:35.210> from<00:04:35.600> computer<00:04:36.440> side

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
48 bytes and you know from computer side

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.320 
48 bytes and you know from computer side
is<00:04:37.880> obviously<00:04:38.270> some<00:04:38.539> sort<00:04:38.660> of<00:04:38.840> binary<00:04:39.200> code<00:04:40.330> so

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
is obviously some sort of binary code so

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.210 
is obviously some sort of binary code so
then<00:04:41.479> I<00:04:41.600> that<00:04:41.810> then<00:04:42.050> did<00:04:42.500> the<00:04:42.530> straightforward

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
then I that then did the straightforward

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.210 
then I that then did the straightforward
thing<00:04:43.400> I<00:04:43.490> just<00:04:43.760> converted<00:04:44.060> it<00:04:44.389> into<00:04:44.419> asking

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
thing I just converted it into asking

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.120 
thing I just converted it into asking
which<00:04:46.220> is<00:04:46.400> the<00:04:46.550> standard<00:04:46.760> took<00:04:48.130> computer

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
which is the standard took computer

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.230 
which is the standard took computer
language<00:04:49.460> that<00:04:49.700> you<00:04:50.180> encode<00:04:50.450> the<00:04:50.600> alphabetic

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
language that you encode the alphabetic

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.520 
language that you encode the alphabetic
and<00:04:53.240> of<00:04:53.360> course<00:04:53.539> I<00:04:53.630> then<00:04:53.840> started<00:04:53.990> to<00:04:54.350> get

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
and of course I then started to get

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.120 
and of course I then started to get
words<00:04:54.800> for<00:04:55.580> mere<00:04:55.760> four<00:04:56.510> are<00:04:56.660> you<00:04:56.960> know<00:04:57.770> getting

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
words for mere four are you know getting

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.620 
words for mere four are you know getting
somewhere<00:04:58.580> here<00:04:58.789> so<00:04:59.030> I've<00:04:59.120> been<00:04:59.270> did<00:04:59.510> the
