00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
it is fairly boxy and simple so you can

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.659 
it is fairly boxy and simple so you can
drawing<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:32.009> mudflaps

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669

2<00:00:38.790> what<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.059> do<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.329> pick<00:00:39.540> up<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.750> few<00:00:39.899> cutie

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
2 what you do is pick up a few cutie

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.229 
2 what you do is pick up a few cutie
points<00:00:40.530> on<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.770> side<00:00:40.980> view<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.790> project<00:00:42.120> them

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
points on the side view and project them

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.270 
points on the side view and project them
back<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.690> vanishing<00:00:42.960> point<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.100> take

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
back to the vanishing point so you take

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.299 
back to the vanishing point so you take
your<00:00:44.309> rule<00:00:44.640> around<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.180> then<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.950> leading

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
your rule around and then the leading

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.790 
your rule around and then the leading
edge<00:00:47.489> on<00:00:47.730> say<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.570> hood<00:00:48.750> take<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.680> back

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
edge on say that the hood take it back

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.459 
edge on say that the hood take it back
to<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.980> vanishing<00:00:50.190> point<00:00:50.399> then<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.570> the

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
to the vanishing point then the the

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.720 
to the vanishing point then the the
bottom<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.949> windscreen<00:00:53.250> take<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.610> back

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
bottom of the windscreen take you back

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.160 
bottom of the windscreen take you back
to<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.940> vanishing<00:00:54.120> point<00:00:54.480> top<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
to a vanishing point top of the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.450 
to a vanishing point top of the
windscreen<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.770> get<00:00:55.890> back<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.219> vanishing

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
windscreen to get back to the vanishing

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.790 
windscreen to get back to the vanishing
point<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.750> do<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.109> for<00:00:58.260> all<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.440> key

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
point so you do that for all the key

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.820 
point so you do that for all the key
points<00:00:59.070> are<00:00:59.789> on<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.180> side<00:01:00.510> profile<00:01:03.830> step

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
points are on the side profile step

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.350 
points are on the side profile step
three<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.309> now<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.670> get<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> perspective

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
three and now you get the perspective

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.570 
three and now you get the perspective
lines<00:01:06.630> in<00:01:06.840> place<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.680> can<00:01:07.740> or<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.130> back<00:01:08.310> edge

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
lines in place you can or the back edge

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.910 
lines in place you can or the back edge
of<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.180> vehicle<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.530> actually<00:01:10.799> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
of the vehicle so this is actually the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.080 
of the vehicle so this is actually the
top<00:01:11.100> edge<00:01:12.110> the<00:01:13.110> other<00:01:13.229> side<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.890> vehicle

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
top edge the other side of the vehicle

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.609 
top edge the other side of the vehicle
so<00:01:15.090> what<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.330> do<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.659> just<00:01:15.840> pick<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.080> point<00:01:16.350> on

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
so what you do is just pick a point on

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.830 
so what you do is just pick a point on
one<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.979> perspective<00:01:17.430> lines<00:01:17.700> here<00:01:18.360> say

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
one of the perspective lines here say

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.620 
one of the perspective lines here say
here<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.830> then<00:01:20.009> draw<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.299> parallel<00:01:21.299> line<00:01:21.360> to

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
here and then draw a parallel line to

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.719 
here and then draw a parallel line to
the<00:01:21.720> front<00:01:21.960> edge<00:01:22.140> see<00:01:23.009> how<00:01:23.100> that's<00:01:23.280> parallel

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
the front edge see how that's parallel

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.230 
the front edge see how that's parallel
to<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.110> front<00:01:25.110> front<00:01:25.830> line<00:01:26.009> here<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.970> do<00:01:27.150> the

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
to the front front line here and do the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.990 
to the front front line here and do the
same<00:01:27.450> for<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.840> roof<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:29.549> it's<00:01:29.700> parallel<00:01:29.820> to

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
same for the roof so it's parallel to

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.179 
same for the roof so it's parallel to
the<00:01:30.150> front<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.930> windscreen<00:01:31.439> that's<00:01:31.740> parallel

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
the front the windscreen that's parallel

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.440 
the front the windscreen that's parallel
and<00:01:32.880> then<00:01:33.000> for<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:34.310> for<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.460> hood<00:01:36.180> that's

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
and then for the for the hood that's

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.160 
and then for the for the hood that's
parallel<00:01:36.869> as<00:01:37.170> well<00:01:37.610> so<00:01:38.610> then<00:01:38.880> just<00:01:39.329> be<00:01:39.840> careful

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
parallel as well so then just be careful

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:47.870 
parallel as well so then just be careful
not<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.350> make<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.619> political<00:01:46.579> of<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.670> hammer

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
not to make the political of the hammer

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.700 
not to make the political of the hammer
blocked<00:01:48.299> out<00:01:48.479> with<00:01:48.750> pretty<00:01:49.530> much<00:01:49.680> a

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
blocked out with pretty much a

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.740 
blocked out with pretty much a
three-dimensional<00:01:50.520> look<00:01:50.579> already<00:01:51.450> happening

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
three-dimensional look already happening

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.810 
three-dimensional look already happening
so<00:01:54.750> this<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.110> step<00:01:55.380> four<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.920> now<00:01:56.280> we<00:01:56.340> begin<00:01:56.610> to

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
so this is step four and now we begin to

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.300 
so this is step four and now we begin to
draw<00:01:57.149> in<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.360> wheels<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.710> do<00:01:58.950> this<00:01:59.070> to

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
draw in the wheels and to do this to

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.420 
draw in the wheels and to do this to
start<00:01:59.610> drawing<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.329> line<00:02:01.020> represents<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:01.979> axle

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
start drawing a line represents the axle

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.160 
start drawing a line represents the axle
line<00:02:02.610> they<00:02:03.270> go<00:02:03.420> from<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.719> center<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.049> the

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
line they go from the center of the

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.789 
line they go from the center of the
mudguards<00:02:05.119> back<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.560> projecting<00:02:07.560> back<00:02:07.680> to

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
mudguards back to the projecting back to

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.080 
mudguards back to the projecting back to
the<00:02:07.890> vanishing<00:02:08.129> point<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:08.789> that's<00:02:08.970> that

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
the vanishing point and so that's that

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.330 
the vanishing point and so that's that
line<00:02:09.330> there<00:02:09.660> all<00:02:10.259> these<00:02:10.500> lines<00:02:10.770> here

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
line there all these lines here

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.729 
line there all these lines here
okay<00:02:12.430> sketching<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.480> lips<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:14.019> represent<00:02:14.680> the

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
okay sketching the lips to represent the

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.009 
okay sketching the lips to represent the
front<00:02:15.010> face<00:02:15.190> of<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.459> wheel<00:02:15.640> so<00:02:16.390> that<00:02:16.900> one

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
front face of the wheel so that one

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.130 
front face of the wheel so that one
there<00:02:17.050> and<00:02:17.430> then<00:02:18.430> just<00:02:18.790> offset<00:02:19.209> it<00:02:19.540> slightly

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
there and then just offset it slightly

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.600 
there and then just offset it slightly
with<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.530> second<00:02:20.800> ellipse<00:02:21.040> at<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.430> back

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
with the second ellipse at the back

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.820 
with the second ellipse at the back
there<00:02:21.879> and<00:02:21.910> that<00:02:22.150> represents<00:02:23.019> a<00:02:23.080> back<00:02:23.260> edge<00:02:23.500> of

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
there and that represents a back edge of

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.160 
there and that represents a back edge of
the<00:02:24.610> wheel<00:02:24.760> of<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:26.230> tire<00:02:27.360> okay<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.599> then<00:02:29.049> you

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
the wheel of the tire okay and then you

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.690 
the wheel of the tire okay and then you
join<00:02:29.410> these<00:02:29.530> two<00:02:29.799> ellipses<00:02:30.220> together<00:02:30.549> with

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
join these two ellipses together with

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
join these two ellipses together with
some<00:02:30.970> shorter<00:02:31.299> lines<00:02:32.549> there<00:02:33.549> and<00:02:33.879> that

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
some shorter lines there and that

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.400 
some shorter lines there and that
basically<00:02:35.110> rounds<00:02:35.620> out<00:02:35.799> your<00:02:36.239> wheel<00:02:40.410> so

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
basically rounds out your wheel so

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.699 
basically rounds out your wheel so
that's<00:02:41.590> step<00:02:41.799> 4<00:02:45.150> in<00:02:46.150> step<00:02:46.450> 5<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:47.019> you<00:02:47.380> can<00:02:47.530> see

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
that's step 4 in step 5 and you can see

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.400 
that's step 4 in step 5 and you can see
basic<00:02:48.340> overall<00:02:49.060> shape<00:02:49.329> of<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.599> body<00:02:49.840> vehicle

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
basic overall shape of the body vehicle

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.589 
basic overall shape of the body vehicle
has<00:02:50.620> been<00:02:50.650> fleshed<00:02:51.130> out<00:02:51.340> and<00:02:51.670> then<00:02:52.390> you<00:02:52.450> can

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
has been fleshed out and then you can

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.630 
has been fleshed out and then you can
begin<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:53.019> draw<00:02:53.170> in<00:02:53.290> some<00:02:53.380> other<00:02:53.680> details<00:02:54.040> so

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
begin to draw in some other details so

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.789 
begin to draw in some other details so
you<00:02:55.390> can<00:02:55.540> add<00:02:55.690> some<00:02:55.720> of<00:02:55.989> them<00:02:56.200> or<00:02:56.349> the<00:02:56.560> door

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
you can add some of them or the door

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:03.720 
you can add some of them or the door
details<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:58.390> hood<00:02:58.690> cut<00:02:59.650> lines<00:03:02.489> for<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.579> hood

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
details the hood cut lines for the hood

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.940 
details the hood cut lines for the hood
and<00:03:03.970> you<00:03:04.690> can<00:03:04.840> notice<00:03:05.079> a<00:03:05.170> little<00:03:05.319> scoop<00:03:05.709> on<00:03:05.860> the

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
and you can notice a little scoop on the

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.289 
and you can notice a little scoop on the
hood<00:03:06.129> as<00:03:06.280> well<00:03:08.160> and<00:03:09.160> then<00:03:09.459> with<00:03:10.000> all<00:03:10.180> these

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
hood as well and then with all these

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:11.759 
hood as well and then with all these
lines<00:03:10.599> you'll<00:03:10.900> notice<00:03:11.230> that<00:03:11.349> horizontal

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
lines you'll notice that horizontal

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.589 
lines you'll notice that horizontal
lines<00:03:12.250> all<00:03:12.489> converge<00:03:12.819> back<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.269> the<00:03:13.360> vanishing

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
lines all converge back to the vanishing

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.620 
lines all converge back to the vanishing
point<00:03:13.780> so<00:03:14.170> that<00:03:14.860> line<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.250> game<00:03:15.430> right<00:03:15.549> there

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
point so that line the game right there

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.099 
point so that line the game right there
these<00:03:16.630> lines<00:03:16.959> go<00:03:17.200> back<00:03:17.410> there<00:03:18.780> on<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:19.959> whole

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
these lines go back there on the whole

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.229 
these lines go back there on the whole
lines<00:03:20.829> converge<00:03:21.519> back<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:21.850> the<00:03:21.970> vanishing

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
lines converge back to the vanishing

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.539 
lines converge back to the vanishing
point<00:03:22.560> so<00:03:23.560> you<00:03:23.620> know<00:03:23.950> every<00:03:24.190> line<00:03:24.340> that<00:03:24.370> you

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
point so you know every line that you

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.500 
point so you know every line that you
draw<00:03:24.760> on<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:25.090> roof<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:26.590> back<00:03:26.859> on<00:03:27.760> top<00:03:28.120> side<00:03:28.359> of

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
draw on the roof the back on top side of

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.390 
draw on the roof the back on top side of
the<00:03:28.569> hole<00:03:28.750> all<00:03:29.079> these<00:03:29.260> lines<00:03:29.500> on<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.130> vehicle

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
the hole all these lines on the vehicle

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.920 
the hole all these lines on the vehicle
converge<00:03:30.670> back<00:03:30.880> to<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.060> vanishing<00:03:31.269> point<00:03:33.930> so

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
converge back to the vanishing point so

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:35.699 
converge back to the vanishing point so
in<00:03:35.019> step<00:03:35.319> 6

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
in step 6

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.069 
in step 6
basically<00:03:36.579> we<00:03:37.030> just<00:03:37.209> pay<00:03:37.329> more<00:03:37.660> attention<00:03:37.810> to

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
basically we just pay more attention to

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.229 
basically we just pay more attention to
the<00:03:38.290> wheels<00:03:38.500> here<00:03:38.920> in<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:39.549> previous<00:03:39.849> step<00:03:40.090> we

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
the wheels here in the previous step we

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.509 
the wheels here in the previous step we
drew<00:03:40.889> some<00:03:41.889> inner<00:03:42.639> wheels<00:03:42.970> higher<00:03:44.099> well<00:03:45.130> the

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
drew some inner wheels higher well the

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.520 
drew some inner wheels higher well the
rims<00:03:45.880> basically<00:03:46.540> the<00:03:46.690> outside<00:03:47.049> shape<00:03:47.319> of<00:03:47.470> the

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
rims basically the outside shape of the

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.370 
rims basically the outside shape of the
rims<00:03:48.299> by<00:03:49.299> drawing<00:03:49.540> a<00:03:49.690> slightly<00:03:49.959> smaller

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
rims by drawing a slightly smaller

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.190 
rims by drawing a slightly smaller
ellipse<00:03:50.880> that<00:03:51.880> matches<00:03:52.239> the<00:03:52.359> outside<00:03:52.389> one<00:03:52.870> so

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
ellipse that matches the outside one so

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.559 
ellipse that matches the outside one so
it's<00:03:53.349> basically<00:03:53.680> just<00:03:54.269> that's<00:03:55.269> at<00:03:55.419> the

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
it's basically just that's at the

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.960 
it's basically just that's at the
outside<00:03:55.870> one<00:03:56.079> there<00:03:56.560> and<00:03:57.250> then<00:03:57.549> the<00:03:57.700> smaller

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
outside one there and then the smaller

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.890 
outside one there and then the smaller
ones<00:03:58.209> on<00:03:58.359> the<00:03:58.450> inside<00:03:58.810> and<00:03:59.560> that<00:03:59.620> gives<00:04:00.220> a<00:04:00.900> the

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
ones on the inside and that gives a the

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.750 
ones on the inside and that gives a the
these<00:04:02.680> are<00:04:02.829> still<00:04:03.040> next<00:04:03.220> step<00:04:03.400> which<00:04:03.519> is<00:04:03.549> to

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
these are still next step which is to

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.210 
these are still next step which is to
give<00:04:03.910> the<00:04:04.030> rooms<00:04:04.209> a<00:04:04.359> bit<00:04:04.389> more<00:04:04.720> depth<00:04:05.019> so<00:04:05.919> again

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
give the rooms a bit more depth so again

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.210 
give the rooms a bit more depth so again
I<00:04:06.599> start<00:04:07.599> with<00:04:07.720> a<00:04:07.750> fairly<00:04:08.139> open<00:04:08.290> ellipse<00:04:08.769> along

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
I start with a fairly open ellipse along

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.569 
I start with a fairly open ellipse along
the<00:04:09.400> same<00:04:10.319> access<00:04:11.319> line<00:04:11.500> so<00:04:11.950> this<00:04:12.099> is<00:04:12.220> a<00:04:12.250> minor

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
the same access line so this is a minor

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:14.879 
the same access line so this is a minor
axis<00:04:13.120> here<00:04:13.450> that<00:04:14.349> goes<00:04:14.530> back<00:04:14.709> to<00:04:14.739> the

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
axis here that goes back to the

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:17.610 
axis here that goes back to the
vanishing<00:04:15.160> point<00:04:15.660> it's<00:04:16.660> the<00:04:16.780> same<00:04:16.989> access

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
vanishing point it's the same access

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.459 
line there but now what you want to do
is<00:04:20.109> make<00:04:20.229> it<00:04:20.260> slightly<00:04:20.590> offset<00:04:21.510> so<00:04:22.510> as<00:04:23.110> you<00:04:23.320> can

00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:23.469 
is make it slightly offset so as you can

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:24.810 
is make it slightly offset so as you can
see

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
see

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.110 
see
it's<00:04:25.820> a<00:04:25.910> little<00:04:26.210> bit<00:04:26.740> it's<00:04:27.740> not<00:04:27.800> the<00:04:28.120> it's

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
it's a little bit it's not the it's

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.590 
it's a little bit it's not the it's

other<00:04:32.889> ellipse<00:04:33.889> here<00:04:34.930> so<00:04:35.930> that<00:04:36.430> so<00:04:37.430> these<00:04:37.820> two

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
other ellipse here so that so these two

lips<00:04:38.330> is<00:04:38.510> that<00:04:38.540> you<00:04:38.750> have<00:04:38.900> drawn<00:04:39.230> now<00:04:39.490> on<00:04:40.490> that

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
lips is that you have drawn now on that

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.659 
lips is that you have drawn now on that
slightly<00:04:40.940> offset<00:04:41.150> collides<00:04:41.690> at<00:04:41.870> the<00:04:41.960> top<00:04:42.169> and

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
slightly offset collides at the top and

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.800 
slightly offset collides at the top and
then<00:04:43.669> at<00:04:43.820> the<00:04:43.910> bottom<00:04:44.090> there's<00:04:44.419> a<00:04:44.480> bit<00:04:44.600> more<00:04:44.660> of

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
then at the bottom there's a bit more of

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.900 
then at the bottom there's a bit more of
a<00:04:44.870> gap<00:04:45.080> here<00:04:45.110> so<00:04:46.040> as<00:04:46.250> you<00:04:46.400> can<00:04:46.490> see<00:04:46.550> there's<00:04:46.880> a

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
a gap here so as you can see there's a

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.879 
a gap here so as you can see there's a
bit<00:04:47.030> more<00:04:47.150> gap<00:04:47.330> at<00:04:47.480> the<00:04:47.510> bottom<00:04:47.690> by<00:04:48.380> the<00:04:48.410> topic

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
bit more gap at the bottom by the topic

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.020 
bit more gap at the bottom by the topic
are<00:04:49.270> collide<00:04:50.270> coincides<00:04:51.230> with<00:04:51.410> the<00:04:52.030> the

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
are collide coincides with the the

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.000 
are collide coincides with the the
outside<00:04:53.389> of<00:04:53.510> the<00:04:53.600> rim<00:04:53.780> and<00:04:54.020> what<00:04:54.500> this<00:04:54.620> does<00:04:54.830> is

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
outside of the rim and what this does is

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.130 
outside of the rim and what this does is
it<00:04:55.130> gives<00:04:55.250> it<00:04:55.430> a<00:04:55.520> bit<00:04:55.639> of<00:04:55.760> a<00:04:55.900> additional<00:04:56.900> look

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.140 
it gives it a bit of a additional look

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.000 
it gives it a bit of a additional look
and<00:04:57.440> a<00:04:58.100> 3d<00:04:58.520> effect<00:04:58.840> so<00:04:59.840> you<00:05:00.290> can<00:05:00.440> see<00:05:00.650> it's<00:05:00.800> kind

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
and a 3d effect so you can see it's kind

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.770 
and a 3d effect so you can see it's kind
of<00:05:01.040> been<00:05:01.220> offset<00:05:01.610> slightly<00:05:01.910> same<00:05:02.600> with<00:05:02.720> the

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
of been offset slightly same with the

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.500 
of been offset slightly same with the
front<00:05:03.020> one<00:05:03.220> see<00:05:04.220> how<00:05:04.310> it's<00:05:04.490> there's<00:05:05.210> been<00:05:05.390> more

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
front one see how it's there's been more

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.390 
front one see how it's there's been more
gap<00:05:05.750> at<00:05:05.960> the<00:05:05.990> bottom<00:05:06.230> then<00:05:06.620> there<00:05:06.740> is<00:05:06.860> a<00:05:06.890> Tom<00:05:07.190> so

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
gap at the bottom then there is a Tom so

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:14.050 
gap at the bottom then there is a Tom so
that<00:05:07.520> gives<00:05:07.730> it<00:05:07.820> the<00:05:07.850> 3d<00:05:08.180> effect<00:05:11.050> and<00:05:12.850> so<00:05:13.850> next

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
that gives it the 3d effect and so next

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.040 
that gives it the 3d effect and so next
is<00:05:14.300> step<00:05:14.480> 7<00:05:15.340> so<00:05:16.340> in<00:05:16.520> step<00:05:16.790> 6<00:05:17.060> we<00:05:17.210> already<00:05:17.780> drew

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
is step 7 so in step 6 we already drew

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.760 
is step 7 so in step 6 we already drew
the<00:05:18.320> the<00:05:18.680> middle<00:05:19.100> in<00:05:19.970> a<00:05:20.210> circle<00:05:20.660> a<00:05:20.840> small<00:05:21.590> soak

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
the the middle in a circle a small soak

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.280 
the the middle in a circle a small soak
on<00:05:21.919> the<00:05:22.010> back<00:05:22.160> face<00:05:22.370> of<00:05:22.580> the<00:05:22.669> rim<00:05:23.110> indicate<00:05:24.110> the

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
on the back face of the rim indicate the

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.320 
on the back face of the rim indicate the

hubs of the center hubs on the ring of
the<00:05:26.720> rims<00:05:26.900> now<00:05:27.710> we<00:05:27.770> can<00:05:27.950> begin<00:05:28.100> to<00:05:28.310> sketching

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
the rims now we can begin to sketching

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.240 
the rims now we can begin to sketching
the<00:05:28.880> spokes<00:05:29.240> of<00:05:29.419> the<00:05:29.479> rim<00:05:29.660> so<00:05:30.560> this<00:05:30.740> these<00:05:31.100> are

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
the spokes of the rim so this these are

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.550 
the spokes of the rim so this these are
all<00:05:31.370> simple<00:05:31.790> six-pack<00:05:32.750> designs<00:05:33.110> where<00:05:33.470> you

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
all simple six-pack designs where you

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.810 
all simple six-pack designs where you
can<00:05:33.710> just<00:05:33.890> draw<00:05:34.450> three<00:05:35.450> lines<00:05:35.479> across<00:05:35.930> the<00:05:36.050> rim

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
can just draw three lines across the rim

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.000 
can just draw three lines across the rim
so<00:05:37.820> one<00:05:38.150> two<00:05:38.510> three<00:05:39.140> again<00:05:39.470> through<00:05:39.919> the

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
so one two three again through the

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.520 
so one two three again through the
center<00:05:40.280> point<00:05:40.520> indicate<00:05:41.120> the<00:05:41.240> spokes<00:05:41.570> let's

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
center point indicate the spokes let's

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.040 
center point indicate the spokes let's
continue<00:05:42.860> filling<00:05:43.190> them<00:05:43.430> out<00:05:43.630> by<00:05:44.630> giving<00:05:44.810> them

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
continue filling them out by giving them

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.680 
continue filling them out by giving them
a<00:05:45.080> bit<00:05:45.260> of<00:05:45.350> thickness<00:05:45.590> just<00:05:46.390> just<00:05:47.390> ensure<00:05:47.570> that

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
a bit of thickness just just ensure that

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.690 
a bit of thickness just just ensure that
everything<00:05:47.930> is<00:05:48.140> working<00:05:48.650> towards<00:05:49.640> the

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
vanishing point again the correct axis

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.310 
vanishing point again the correct axis

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
the correct line or perspective and it's

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.370 
the correct line or perspective and it's
slowly<00:06:03.050> acquiring<00:06:03.710> that<00:06:03.830> 3d<00:06:04.310> feel<00:06:05.289> then<00:06:06.289> we

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
slowly acquiring that 3d feel then we

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.080 
slowly acquiring that 3d feel then we
started<00:06:06.620> drawing<00:06:06.830> the<00:06:07.070> shadow<00:06:07.310> lines<00:06:07.880> on<00:06:08.030> the

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.090 
started drawing the shadow lines on the

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.060 
started drawing the shadow lines on the

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
other side of the vehicle as well as you

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.450 
other side of the vehicle as well as you
can<00:06:10.190> see<00:06:10.370> here<00:06:10.610> there's<00:06:10.910> a<00:06:11.030> shadow<00:06:11.240> line<00:06:11.600> there

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
can see here there's a shadow line there

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.770 
can see here there's a shadow line there
and<00:06:13.460> keep<00:06:13.850> in<00:06:13.970> mind<00:06:14.000> that<00:06:14.240> all<00:06:14.390> these<00:06:14.570> lines

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.780 
and keep in mind that all these lines

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.450 
and keep in mind that all these lines
also<00:06:15.020> have<00:06:15.350> to<00:06:15.470> converge<00:06:15.770> rates<00:06:15.979> a<00:06:16.039> vanishing

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:24.640 
point so this next step step 8 basically

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.760 
point so this next step step 8 basically
here<00:06:25.640> emphasizing<00:06:26.510> on<00:06:26.660> the<00:06:26.690> lines<00:06:26.990> by<00:06:27.440> drawing

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770 
here emphasizing on the lines by drawing

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.940 
here emphasizing on the lines by drawing
in<00:06:27.979> heavier<00:06:28.910> lines<00:06:29.180> so<00:06:30.110> heavier<00:06:30.440> black<00:06:30.740> was

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:30.950 
in heavier lines so heavier black was

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.580 
in heavier lines so heavier black was
used<00:06:31.190> to<00:06:31.310> coloring<00:06:31.729> the<00:06:31.970> the<00:06:32.270> tires<00:06:32.570> the<00:06:33.200> area

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
used to coloring the the tires the area

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.100 
used to coloring the the tires the area
under<00:06:33.830> the<00:06:33.919> mud<00:06:34.099> guards<00:06:34.550> there<00:06:34.960> it's<00:06:35.960> the

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
under the mud guards there it's the

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.920 
under the mud guards there it's the
front<00:06:36.380> now

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:36.930 
front now

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.060 
front now
and<00:06:37.250> the<00:06:38.250> same<00:06:39.180> with<00:06:39.330> the<00:06:39.389> shadows<00:06:39.860> and<00:06:40.860> also

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070 
and the same with the shadows and also

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.529 
and the same with the shadows and also
the<00:06:41.160> reflection<00:06:41.310> line<00:06:41.820> through<00:06:42.060> the<00:06:42.150> windows

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:42.539 
the reflection line through the windows

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:45.650 
the reflection line through the windows
and<00:06:42.979> there's<00:06:43.979> a<00:06:44.009> bit<00:06:44.130> of<00:06:44.160> gray<00:06:44.370> marker<00:06:44.910> just<00:06:45.509> to

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660 
and there's a bit of gray marker just to

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.680 
and there's a bit of gray marker just to
pull<00:06:45.840> off<00:06:45.960> the<00:06:46.169> roof<00:06:46.560> racks<00:06:46.860> and<00:06:47.190> the<00:06:48.180> spoiler

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690 
pull off the roof racks and the spoiler

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:56.540 
pull off the roof racks and the spoiler
across<00:06:49.110> the<00:06:49.259> top<00:06:49.410> of<00:06:49.530> the<00:06:49.590> vehicle<00:06:50.039> so<00:06:55.070> and<00:06:56.070> the

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:56.550 
across the top of the vehicle so and the

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.310 
across the top of the vehicle so and the
same<00:06:56.789> and<00:06:57.030> same<00:06:57.389> goes<00:06:57.660> with<00:06:57.780> the<00:06:57.900> front<00:06:58.110> bumper

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:58.320 
same and same goes with the front bumper

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.010 
same and same goes with the front bumper
as<00:06:58.620> well<00:06:58.650> so<00:06:59.220> using<00:07:00.120> a<00:07:00.210> bit<00:07:00.360> of<00:07:00.389> colour<00:07:00.630> to<00:07:00.810> pull

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.020 
as well so using a bit of colour to pull

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.990 
as well so using a bit of colour to pull
out<00:07:01.169> pull<00:07:01.590> out<00:07:01.710> the<00:07:01.889> detail<00:07:02.280> there<00:07:04.820> so<00:07:05.820> then

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 
out pull out the detail there so then

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.499 
out pull out the detail there so then
that<00:07:06.419> basically<00:07:06.840> finishes<00:07:07.530> your<00:07:07.680> overall

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:08.509 
that basically finishes your overall

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:12.650 
that basically finishes your overall
sketch<00:07:09.560> of<00:07:10.560> one<00:07:11.190> point<00:07:11.340> spec<00:07:11.550> divot<00:07:11.880> in<00:07:12.030> a<00:07:12.060> one

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:12.660 
sketch of one point spec divot in a one

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.810 
sketch of one point spec divot in a one
point<00:07:12.930> perspective<00:07:13.080> of<00:07:13.500> a<00:07:13.590> hammer<00:07:13.800> so<00:07:14.669> what

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:14.820 
point perspective of a hammer so what

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.719 
point perspective of a hammer so what
you<00:07:14.910> want<00:07:15.120> to<00:07:15.150> do<00:07:15.300> next<00:07:15.509> is<00:07:16.250> what<00:07:17.250> you<00:07:17.370> could<00:07:17.550> do

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:17.729 
you want to do next is what you could do

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:22.670 
you want to do next is what you could do
next<00:07:17.940> I<00:07:18.120> mean<00:07:18.300> is<00:07:19.460> convert<00:07:20.460> it<00:07:20.639> and<00:07:21.680> using

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:22.680 
next I mean is convert it and using

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.159 
next I mean is convert it and using
Photoshop<00:07:23.160> so<00:07:23.370> here<00:07:24.180> in<00:07:24.389> this<00:07:24.720> in<00:07:25.050> this

00:07:25.159 --> 00:07:25.169 
Photoshop so here in this in this

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:27.469 
Photoshop so here in this in this
picture<00:07:25.560> you<00:07:25.770> could<00:07:26.130> use<00:07:26.370> it<00:07:26.520> as<00:07:26.639> an<00:07:26.880> lay<00:07:27.180> and

00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:27.479 
picture you could use it as an lay and

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:29.300 
picture you could use it as an lay and
then<00:07:27.599> retrace<00:07:28.020> it<00:07:28.259> fixing<00:07:28.979> some<00:07:29.160> of<00:07:29.190> the

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:29.310 
then retrace it fixing some of the

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.189 
then retrace it fixing some of the
little<00:07:29.550> things<00:07:29.759> that<00:07:29.880> you<00:07:29.970> didn't<00:07:30.630> like<00:07:30.810> and

00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:31.199 
little things that you didn't like and

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:33.529 
little things that you didn't like and
then<00:07:31.919> scan<00:07:32.280> it<00:07:32.400> into<00:07:32.520> Photoshop<00:07:32.789> and<00:07:33.120> then<00:07:33.389> add

00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:33.539 
then scan it into Photoshop and then add

00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:36.379 
then scan it into Photoshop and then add
some<00:07:33.750> color<00:07:33.990> and<00:07:34.349> tone<00:07:34.830> to<00:07:34.860> finish<00:07:35.280> it<00:07:35.400> off<00:07:35.550> and

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:36.389 
some color and tone to finish it off and

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:38.330 
some color and tone to finish it off and
there<00:07:36.630> you<00:07:36.660> have<00:07:37.020> a<00:07:37.320> quick<00:07:37.380> one-point

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:38.340 
there you have a quick one-point

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.779 
there you have a quick one-point
