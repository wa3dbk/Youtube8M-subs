00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.780
 because this guy gives me a feature film of 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:14.590
 fiction that tells the story of dew 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.170
 a single mother of 25 years and who is 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.279
 going through a lot of fatigue 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.100
 struggling day by day to get the 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.380
 sustenance and being able to feed her daughter 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.980
 be in a movie I help my idea a 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.230
 necessary film and I'll take a 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.820
 phrase that the producer saw when I 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.040
 I asked not because I'm going to produce this 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.570
 movie and the medium because life came to you 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.570
 it makes us better people 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.420
 because the reflection of the society in which 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.780
 we live now I was immersed in a 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.510
 great economic crisis that many family 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.240
 he is suffering in his flesh and they are 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.230
 living the most extreme poverty we 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:01.140
 We put the focus where there are responsible 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.480
 I think I do not want to look 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.199
 but always good we are on the side of 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.199
 The most disadvantaged 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.610
 logically also because stripping 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:16.039
 of all demagoguery or leaving spaces 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.100
 so that for the viewer to think 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:21.789
 about the social and moral dilemmas that 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.789
 presents the movie 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.470
 and 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.080
 sometimes super complicated to all this 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.640
 where we are today is thanks to the 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.860
 team of professionals behind 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.710
 that they are giving all that are 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.190
 dump with the project and that's why good 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.560
 we have decided to use the platform 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.360
 verkami of micro-patronage 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.939
 so to get funding for the 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.130
 movie and also like that you do not have to 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.790
 go through the political filter of the 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.790
 subsidies 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.550
 is a way to get involved in the 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.170
 make it more yours and all of it 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.520
 it can be good for a small contribution 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.640
 economically because it receives a reward 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.350
 We also offer the opportunity to 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.840
 Become an associate producer of teas and 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.660
 food 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.860
 and participate in the possible income 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.860
 that can give that can generate 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.730
 for now I would say good to give them the 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.220
 thanks to all the followers and all the 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.030

 support us in exchange for it then you can 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.770
 get a reward but for me 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.569
 I think others are as much for them as 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.090
 for the whole world the greatest reward 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.069
 is that this movie goes ahead that 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.260
 we can do it and I want it because 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.030
 We have the duty and responsibility of 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.370
 make a good movie so that it arrives 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:07.620
 further away they see more viewers and 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.620
 then wake up asleep consciences 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.930
 we have the commitment of the 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.510
 most of them and I hope that event 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.670
 a few days we can say what you do 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.680
 I can say that 36 is equal to the 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.030
 team cast of actors as 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.030
