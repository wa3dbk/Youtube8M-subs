00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.580
 I will show the lamps I made 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:26.640

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:34.500

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:37.559
 have these minors a glass for 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.140
 do on the cover here this is a 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.870
 copper 6 mm more or less used 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.129
 in refrigeration refrigerator that you 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.780
 found in any case of 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.629
 cooling 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.940
 they even have to play so they do not 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.170
 will not use 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:59.299
 so the wick wakes up a cord of 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:06.720
 cotton and 50 cm cotton cord 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:09.930
 each glass cotton lamp one store 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.460
 The city just came out expensive. 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:17.820
 I suggest you usually use lots of rope 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.970
 cotton buy at the house of the ropes in 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.120

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:30.890
 a SÃ£o Paulo store that knows or a 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.890
 roll a pound leaves on average 23 reais 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:39.690
 I did the following I took a glass as 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.180
 that 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.180
 I made a hole in the middle of the lid 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.110
 I left with a philips key after 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.390
 alleges 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.640
 I just spoke with the tub of 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.520
 copper 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.700
 Then I got a sandpaper and scratched the whole edge. 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:06.440
 hole and XEi aa very edge of 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:08.550
 tube to be able to give tack 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.890
 the first few times I'm from 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.480
 consolidator but I found it more useful 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:19.659
 using the torch said 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:24.569
 I have one of the western xing torch 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:24.569

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.489

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:34.060
 videos showing a video of Diego 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:39.159
