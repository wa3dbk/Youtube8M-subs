00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.000
 New Mazda 6 showed in the heart 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.980
 Russia in Siberia and it says not only 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.320
 about how important this car is for 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.310
 mazda yes and that our frost she 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.310
 kind of not afraid 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.140
 thermometer showed on the street minus 32 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.430
 it was a good test of strength and 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:42.620
 for ourselves 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:44.850
 but about everything in order 1 appearance 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.040
 the design of the last two generations of this 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.960
 the model was extremely successful and the new mazda6 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.670
 does not violate this tradition new 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.710
 designer language code which 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.760
 debuted on cx-5 turned out to be quite 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.570
 by the way sedan 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.190
 however, competitors do not stand still 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.199
 graceful lines and shapes are impressive but 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.190
 can you tell the six from 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.190
 other Asian manufacturers 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.240
 plus you have to pay for beauty 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.240
 minimum rims are now 17 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.510
 and our car was already 19 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.280
 the second 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.990
 technology mondo company is small 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.180
 huge money for constant new 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.250
 of course they have no development therefore they 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:37.119
 decided to refine what they have and 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.920
 bring it up to absolutely so appeared 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.549
 technology skyactiv about which we already 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.960
 told toast x5 translated to 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.479
 ordinary language it means that all 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.690
 basic car components such as 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.070
 engine box or bodywork is very strong 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.930
 upgraded 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.000
 for example engine and petrol and 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.130
 diesel operate at record degree 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.280
 compression and provide low consumption 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.990
 fuel 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.909
 in our case it's two-liter 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.799
 gasoline engine that gives 150 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.390
 horsepower is exactly the same 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.250
 so much from the predecessor but now 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.700
 the motor has become much more economical and yet 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.860
 much easier 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.760
 actually in May asset to as many as 2 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.410
 liter engines 145 and 165 . day but us 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.599
 decided to bring the last nobody 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.370
 forced it on transport taxes then 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.360
 there are future owners will surely find 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.220
 way to return lost horses to places 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.430
 although my own flow measurements 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.410
 fuel of some kind of revolution did not reveal in 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:38.560
 the city turns out about 10 liters and on 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.560
 highway flow metering on the figure of 7.1 liters 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.400
 third interior 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.930
 when creating a new generation of you to 6 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.860
 engineers paid a lot of attention 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.080
 interiors 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.290
 but you can be honestly 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:59.420
 say that the previous generation with this 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:01.430
 there were small difficulties in the first place they 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.350
 removed all unnecessary controls a 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.140
 secondly, the quality was noticeably improved 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:09.620
 finishes plus here added modern 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.400
 multimedia but the main thing is of course the form 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.630
 interior car became more solid 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.000
 now there is something to catch on 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.040
 glance framing many elements from 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.280
 aluminum than before indulged in only 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.280
 Germans 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.260
 pumped up only the buttons on the steering wheel 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.790
 They seem to be from another car leather 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.799
 finish and large color display 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.910
 available only from top versions 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.640
 and only for extra charge 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.420
 but there was no such thing before but there is 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.940
 one country 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.560
 color touch screen for some reason 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.970
 supplied with a control panel which 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.459
 placed on the center console 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.130
 although it looks and works very much 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.799
 great i would even say too great 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:52.850
 and suspiciously reminds bmw well it 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:54.380
 only better and their goal must be said 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.720
 they got when you sit down and in new 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.250
 Mazda 6 you know that yes this car 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.120
 really looks and feels 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.590
 more expensive than before the car is noticeable 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.760
 grew up outside and it shows 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.340
 with the naked eye 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.280
 but it did not increase much inside 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.620
 and if you pay attention to the ceiling 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.160
 from my head, my little space 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.790
 height is 178 centimeters this 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:23.860
 but clearly not the ricos of this chair omitted 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:25.110
 the most minimal position at all 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.620
 inside there is some feeling 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.930
 psychological distress 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.310
 how sports hurts it helps 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.780
 focus on management 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.620
 car tune in more 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.480
 active driving 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:39.520
 but a bunch of motor automata thinks differently 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.860
 box by the way is also a new sky act and she 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.260
 finally six-speed but obviously 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.120
 ecologically tuned they school at 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.540
 there is not enough money 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.810
 fast switches meters that but mode 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:55.500
 while at the same time the machine for some reason 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.500
 slowly 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.990
 acceleration to a hundred takes him 10 point 

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:03.620
 six-tenths of a second well it's somehow 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.780
 a bit much seems to me 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.229
 by numbers the full order of characteristics 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.009
 best acceleration faster but it feels 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:13.189
 completely different story 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:15.919
 In general, there is some dissonance 

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:19.610
 cool sports look and 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.610
 quite sluggish speaker 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.960
 the situation could save the motor with two 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.670
 half or diesel but as long as they are in Russia 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.670
 do not deliver and will be unknown 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.480
 price of a two-liter version with options and so 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.530
 noticeably exceeded one million and then there 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.300
 more powerful motor 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.100
 underwent great changes and 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.620
 car suspension especially the rear 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:49.160
 part and this noticeable car has become much 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.160
 comfort and 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:56.970
 and again he comfortably aboard the words 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:06:01.110
 comfortable how would this tie aggressive 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:03.520
 sports appearance is not very memory 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.000
 get a new Mazda 6 must choose 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.920
 a heart 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.440
 and so with such appearance not to give in 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.720
 the spell will not be easy and it does not matter what kind of 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.110
 skyactiv inside her and how much more expensive 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.110
 on a star 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.620
 technology technology and the brothers will 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.040
 just as previously exclusively for 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.040
 beauty
