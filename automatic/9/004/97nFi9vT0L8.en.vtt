00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
that they can work there are things that

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.889 
that they can work there are things that
need<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.790> happen<00:00:42.000> though<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.750> there's

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
that need to be made right from the

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.080 
that need to be made right from the
beginning<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.610> first<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.000> most

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
beginning and the first and most

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.680 
beginning and the first and most
important<00:00:48.539> thing<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:49.190> honesty<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.460> trust<00:00:50.879> you

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.209 
important thing is honesty and trust you
have<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.020> be<00:00:52.170> one<00:00:52.440> hundred<00:00:52.559> percent<00:00:52.739> honest

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
have to be one hundred percent honest

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.889 
have to be one hundred percent honest
with<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.340> person<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.180> also<00:00:54.390> need<00:00:54.719> to

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
with a person and you also need to

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.110 
with a person and you also need to
completely<00:00:55.590> trust<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.370> person<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:57.090> are

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
completely trust the person that you are

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.150 
completely trust the person that you are
with<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:58.320> can't<00:00:58.559> be<00:00:58.710> with<00:00:58.829> them<00:00:58.949> all<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.129> time

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
with you can't be with them all the time

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.209 
with you can't be with them all the time
to<00:00:59.609> watch<00:01:00.539> them<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.199> don't<00:01:01.649> really<00:01:01.770> like<00:01:01.890> using

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
to watch them I don't really like using

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.830 
to watch them I don't really like using
that<00:01:02.370> word<00:01:02.489> every<00:01:03.180> day<00:01:03.300> will<00:01:03.449> be<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.570> struggle

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
that word every day will be a struggle

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.100 
that word every day will be a struggle
if<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.229> don't<00:01:04.500> my<00:01:05.369> girlfriend<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.880> go

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
if you don't my girlfriend and I go

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.750 
if you don't my girlfriend and I go
sometimes<00:01:07.110> two<00:01:07.530> months<00:01:07.950> without<00:01:08.310> seeing<00:01:08.640> each

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
sometimes two months without seeing each

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.670 
sometimes two months without seeing each
other<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.659> there's<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.290> lot<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.409> things

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
other and so there's a lot of things

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.830 
other and so there's a lot of things
that<00:01:10.920> can<00:01:11.010> happen<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.580> two<00:01:11.729> months<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.780> you

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
that can happen in two months and so you

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.109 
that can happen in two months and so you
need<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.619> be<00:01:13.950> trusting<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.580> need<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.000> be

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
need to be trusting and you need to be

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.539 
need to be trusting and you need to be
open<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.770> that<00:01:16.770> brings<00:01:16.920> into<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.280> second

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
open and that brings into the second

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.929 
open and that brings into the second
point<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:18.170> communication<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:20.040> key

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
point that communication is is key

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.580 
point that communication is is key
because<00:01:21.450> it's<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.080> majority<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.470> your

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
because it's the majority of your

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.300 
because it's the majority of your
relationship<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:23.520> need<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.750> have<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:25.770> you

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
relationship you need to have that you

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.679 
relationship you need to have that you
you<00:01:26.670> meet<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.180> phone<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:28.040> you<00:01:29.040> know<00:01:29.189> it's<00:01:29.689> it's

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
still really hard the second question is

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.400 
still really hard the second question is
do<00:02:39.299> you<00:02:39.360> believe<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.690> you<00:02:39.989> can<00:02:40.110> meet<00:02:40.260> the

do you believe that you can meet the
right<00:02:40.650> person<00:02:40.830> at<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.580> wrong<00:02:41.790> time<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.330> this

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
right person at the wrong time and this

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.380 
right person at the wrong time and this
makes<00:02:43.230> me<00:02:43.349> think<00:02:43.530> of<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.680> song<00:02:44.060> by<00:02:45.060> ingrid

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
makes me think of a song by ingrid

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.839 
makes me think of a song by ingrid

there's a line in the song that says if

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.750 
there's a line in the song that says if
you<00:02:52.170> have<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.650> last<00:02:52.860> hands<00:02:53.160> that<00:02:53.310> I<00:02:53.400> want<00:02:53.670> to
