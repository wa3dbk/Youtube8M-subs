Taiei Kin

00:00:04.818 --> 00:01:05.302
Q: What do you think about what happened? 

00:01:05.302 --> 00:01:20.308
A: My opponent is a good fighter and I had fun in the first round, but what a goofball! I think he panicked. In the last 10 seconds he relaxed and when I hit him with a right hook, he was surprised. I don't remember what happened after that.  

00:01:20.308 --> 00:02:37.493
Q: He said he wants a rematch. 

00:02:37.493 --> 00:02:45.797
A: Anytime. His lowkicks don't even hurt. I think he's a little bit crazy. He's a fun fighter, but not that smart. I'm always ready for a rematch. It was a short fight, but it was fun. I fought according to plan. 

00:02:45.797 --> 00:03:21.118
Q: I know you feel unfulfilled by the match, but please give the fans a message. 

00:03:21.118 --> 00:03:43.165
A: I'm really sorry. Well, I mean he... Anyway, I'm sorry. ã€‚

00:03:43.165 --> 00:03:47.445
Q: Every time you come to Korea an accident happens. 

00:03:47.445 --> 00:04:46.225
A: The first time, I cut my brow, and something happened at last year's Asia GP. But this time... He was just stupid. He'd be a good fighter if he used his head. 

00:04:46.225 --> 00:04:55.520
Q: Who will win this year's WGP?

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:08.975
A: I'm rooting for Aerts because we are the same age. I don't know about the others.
