yeah I picked up a key there and I'll
show<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.160> what<00:00:29.250> these<00:00:29.340> Keys<00:00:29.550> do<00:00:29.670> in<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.820> little

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
show you what these Keys do in a little

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.089 
show you what these Keys do in a little
bit<00:00:30.150> but<00:00:30.720> essentially<00:00:31.260> what<00:00:31.410> they're<00:00:31.560> for<00:00:31.859> are

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
bit but essentially what they're for are

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.430 
bit but essentially what they're for are
for<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.460> elevators<00:00:33.149> so<00:00:33.750> once<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.200> have<00:00:34.320> the

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
for the elevators so once you have the

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.690 
for the elevators so once you have the
power<00:00:34.680> on<00:00:34.920> you're<00:00:35.070> going<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.250> want<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.430> insert

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
power on you're going to want to insert

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.700 
power on you're going to want to insert
these<00:00:35.850> into<00:00:35.910> elevators<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.809> there's<00:00:37.350> four

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.760 
collect them so let me go show you guys
what<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.659> for<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.110> if<00:01:10.320> you're<00:01:10.439> at<00:01:10.590> an

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
what this is for so if you're at an

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.560 
what this is for so if you're at an
elevator<00:01:11.189> shaft<00:01:11.280> once<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.909> power<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.240> open

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
elevator shaft once the power is open

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.380 
elevator shaft once the power is open
it'll<00:01:13.229> say<00:01:13.380> insert<00:01:13.950> elevator<00:01:14.490> key<00:01:14.760> at<00:01:14.850> any<00:01:15.060> of

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
it'll say insert elevator key at any of

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.230 
it'll say insert elevator key at any of
them<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.220> kind<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.610> buildable<00:01:17.909> part

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
them so this is kind of a buildable part

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.510 
them so this is kind of a buildable part
so<00:01:18.540> if<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.750> go<00:01:18.869> over<00:01:19.049> here<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.229> double<00:01:19.799> tap<00:01:20.009> see

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
so if you go over here to double tap see

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.520 
so if you go over here to double tap see
it<00:01:20.610> went<00:01:20.759> away<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.150> insert<00:01:21.750> my<00:01:21.780> elevator<00:01:22.290> key

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
it went away I insert my elevator key

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.039 
it went away I insert my elevator key
and<00:01:22.740> once<00:01:23.520> it's<00:01:23.670> done<00:01:23.790> building<00:01:24.150> double<00:01:24.840> tap

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
and once it's done building double tap

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.920 
and once it's done building double tap
we'll<00:01:25.259> fly<00:01:25.500> right<00:01:25.530> back<00:01:25.920> up<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:26.390> what<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:27.570> key

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
we'll fly right back up so what this key

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.800 
we'll fly right back up so what this key
does<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.890> quick<00:01:29.820> save<00:01:30.210> if<00:01:30.479> you're

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
does is it is a quick save if you're

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.499 
does is it is a quick save if you're
