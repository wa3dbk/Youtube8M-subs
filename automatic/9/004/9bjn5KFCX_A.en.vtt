00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:07.830
 Saturday June 9, 2012 we 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.480
 we found at 12 49 under a 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.199
 Retractable roof greenhouse in 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:17.050
 antalya turkey here you will be able to see a 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:20.230
 greenhouse that has a clear roof 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:24.119
 and an internal screen of shady and 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.119
 energy saving that is white 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.050
 let's go check the impact they are going 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.550
 to have these different these 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.220
 different ceilings both clear and 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.540
 white on the surfaces that are 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.540
 exposed to direct sunlight 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.170
 The first thing we are going to do is go to 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.790
 move to measure the temperature of the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.180
 post that is under the shade 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.760
 since it will give us a temperature 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.300
 approximate air temperature 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.280
 of the air since it is not found 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.559
 exposed to direct sunlight the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.980
 The temperature it gives us is 34 or 35 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.980
 degrees 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.030
 now we are going to move under the 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.820
 different ceilings 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.040
 retractable we have installed 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.350
 white and clear to check the 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.940
 temperature differences that we're going to 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.460
 have on the floor 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.190
 if we move if we move under the 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.310
 under the transparent roof cover 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.670
 we can see that under the shade at 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.670
 half past twelve 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.159
 the temperature is 44 46 degrees 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.289
 centigrade 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.530
 but if we move under the strip of 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:42.640
 direct sunlight the temperature is 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:48.810
 63 65 or 66 degrees Celsius 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.810
 now we are going to go under the shadow 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.220
 that generates the white roof 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.410
 and in the strip of direct sunlight 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.190
 we have that temperature is 66 67 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.190
 degrees Celsius 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.299
 but if we move low under where 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:11.410
 find the white roof shadow the 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:13.840
 temperature is 42 degrees this 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.700
 it's a temperature difference of 25 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.970
 degrees Celsius 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.040
 lower a temperature lower than the 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.910
 that we were in the strip of 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.950
 direct sunlight 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.360
 this is the temperature reduction that 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.360
 you can get a white roof 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.770
 and if the soil temperature low low 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.500
 the clear roof was only 12 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.330
 degrees centigrade than that we 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.310
 we found under the flat text is low 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.430
 the white roof this what you mean 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.140
 is that the colors on the ceilings both 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.450
 white as clear they do not have a 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.850
 very important influence on 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.210
 surface temperature without 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.210
 embargo 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.180
 the white roof will create is going to have 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.410
 a significant advantage avoiding the 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.300
 increase in temperature of the 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.300
 surface an increase in temperature 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.980
 of the air of the air temperature 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.410
 therefore if what we want 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.450
 is to reduce the temperature of the 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.760
 surfaces and air temperature what 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.860
 what we will do is use a roof 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.690
 white but if what we want is 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.500
 increase the air temperature by 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.980
 example in winter we will use a one 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.960
 Clear roof that will be the most appropriate 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.290
 for the winter for the increase of 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.290
 the temperature 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.560
 so that in the most optimal design goes 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.200
 to have a white roof for summer and 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.190
 a screen or a clear roof for the 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:44.129
 winter and obviously if it closes 100% 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.799
 cover during the winter of the 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:50.170
 winter nights you can have a 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:53.440
 energy retention capacity 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.390
 much more efficient since that 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.130
 radiation that sunlight that is this that 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.020
 we are incorporating within 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.930
 greenhouse during the day we can 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.329
 hold during the night 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.890
 but for certain crops it is 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.870
 necessary that they can have this 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.340
 Temperature reduction capacity of 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.750
 another since otherwise 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.959
 they would have tolerance to sunlight 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.959
 direct 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.170
 therefore what we can see now is 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.380
 that when the greenhouse is closed 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:23.050
 30% and the energy screen of 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:27.640
 gloomy is closed 65% we are 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.710
 causing a shadow a shadow in all 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.180
 the greenhouse area preventing the 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.950
 direct sunlight can in no 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.930
 moment to heat both the temperature of 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.030
 surface as time as the 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.460
 plants if we had plants in 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.130
 this greenhouse and therefore the 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.690
 plants and andy the plants nor any 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.940
 surface inside the greenhouse is going to 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.450
 be exposed to direct sunlight 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.830
 by the alternation and by the opening the 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.060
 opening difference the difference of 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.040
 opening that will have both the 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.240
 internal screen as as the fixed roof 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.240
 but nevertheless 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.750
 precisely because we have an opening 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.540
 35 percent horizontally 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:06.630
 the heat will be able to be 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.500
 escape so much through the opening created by 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.450
 the screen 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.490
 internal energy saving and iu of 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.430
 shade as by the opening we have 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.590
 created on the roof this would be at 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.060
 so much what we mean the the 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.340
 Reaction cooling system 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.050
 optimal temperature because we are going to 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.660
 can have an opening what 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.010
 important enough to ventilate 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.200
 no need for there to be an exhibition 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:31.080
 of direct sunlight heating the 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.580
 surfaces or the plants taking with 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.800
 the negative impact that this can 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.790
 suppose both for plants and for 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.790
 air temperature
