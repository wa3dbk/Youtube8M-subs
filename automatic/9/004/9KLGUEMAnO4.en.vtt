00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
kind of hunched over a little bit so if

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:06.740

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
taller so the gear was three figures did

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.510 
taller so the gear was three figures did
scale<00:02:09.479> down<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.720> little<00:02:10.020> bit<00:02:10.200> but<00:02:10.649> it's<00:02:11.430> really

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
scale down a little bit but it's really

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
Lancer that will answer is the one that

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.910 
Lancer that will answer is the one that
came<00:02:26.310> with<00:02:26.370> Dom<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:27.390> new<00:02:27.600> Lancer<00:02:28.140> this<00:02:28.470> one<00:02:28.650> is

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
came with Dom the new Lancer this one is

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.410 
came with Dom the new Lancer this one is
not<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.250> bendy<00:02:29.760> plastic<00:02:30.240> is<00:02:30.540> really<00:02:32.300> it's<00:02:33.300> a

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
not a bendy plastic is really it's a

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.320 
not a bendy plastic is really it's a
hard<00:02:33.750> plastic<00:02:34.020> and<00:02:34.470> it<00:02:34.530> is<00:02:34.650> not<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:35.190> mean<00:02:35.940> it's

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
hard plastic and it is not I mean it's

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.080 
hard plastic and it is not I mean it's
really<00:02:36.600> really<00:02:36.960> good<00:02:37.200> but<00:02:37.860> um<00:02:38.070> this<00:02:38.760> part

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
really really good but um this part

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.300 
really really good but um this part
right<00:02:39.210> here<00:02:39.290> does<00:02:40.290> not<00:02:40.470> bend<00:02:40.740> open<00:02:40.980> so<00:02:41.220> you

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
right here does not bend open so you

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.980 
right here does not bend open so you
can't<00:02:41.490> have<00:02:41.640> fit<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:41.910> hand<00:02:42.270> in<00:02:42.480> so<00:02:42.660> I<00:02:42.750> couldn't

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
can't have fit the hand in so I couldn't

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.720 
can't have fit the hand in so I couldn't
really<00:02:43.230> fit<00:02:43.560> his<00:02:43.710> hand<00:02:44.010> in<00:02:44.160> here<00:02:44.340> because<00:02:44.610> his

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
really fit his hand in here because his

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.790 
really fit his hand in here because his
hand<00:02:44.940> is<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.090> little<00:02:45.330> bit<00:02:45.420> more<00:02:45.570> open<00:02:45.960> so<00:02:46.770> I

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
hand is a little bit more open so I

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.310 
hand is a little bit more open so I
never<00:02:47.100> give<00:02:47.220> him<00:02:47.310> this<00:02:47.400> tadam<00:02:47.900> so<00:02:48.900> he<00:02:49.110> is<00:02:49.200> using

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
never give him this tadam so he is using

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.170 
never give him this tadam so he is using
Dom's<00:02:49.650> Lancer<00:02:50.040> another<00:02:50.790> thing<00:02:50.910> that<00:02:51.030> was<00:02:51.120> a

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
Dom's Lancer another thing that was a

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.620 
Dom's Lancer another thing that was a
pain<00:02:51.450> is<00:02:52.250> his<00:02:53.250> arms<00:02:53.700> are<00:02:53.850> not<00:02:53.970> really<00:02:54.360> meant

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
pain is his arms are not really meant

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.810 
pain is his arms are not really meant
for<00:02:54.780> him<00:02:55.080> to<00:02:55.230> really<00:02:55.520> grasped<00:02:56.520> his<00:02:56.790> rifle

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
for him to really grasped his rifle

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.740 
for him to really grasped his rifle
perfectly<00:02:57.780> as<00:02:57.960> you<00:02:58.380> can<00:02:58.650> see<00:02:58.860> he<00:02:59.070> can't<00:02:59.310> really

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
perfectly as you can see he can't really

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
perfectly as you can see he can't really
lay<00:03:00.750> down<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.020> iron<00:03:01.260> sight<00:03:01.410> or<00:03:01.500> anything<00:03:01.650> I

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
lay down the iron sight or anything I

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:02.870 
lay down the iron sight or anything I
mean<00:03:01.890> it<00:03:01.950> was<00:03:02.070> difficult<00:03:02.460> enough<00:03:02.520> to<00:03:02.700> get<00:03:02.790> him

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
mean it was difficult enough to get him

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.420 
mean it was difficult enough to get him
to<00:03:03.000> do<00:03:03.270> this<00:03:03.480> just<00:03:04.200> because<00:03:04.320> of<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.740> um<00:03:04.950> of<00:03:05.370> the

articulation restrict me but really it's

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.440

it's just his armor moving because it's

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.110 
it's just his armor moving because it's
all<00:06:25.770> really<00:06:25.979> rubber<00:06:26.340> which<00:06:26.610> is<00:06:26.759> kind<00:06:26.940> of<00:06:27.030> a

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
all really rubber which is kind of a

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.790 
all really rubber which is kind of a
cool<00:06:27.360> feature<00:06:27.660> I<00:06:27.840> really<00:06:27.930> I<00:06:28.320> kind<00:06:28.530> of<00:06:28.620> like

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
cool feature I really I kind of like

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.900 
cool feature I really I kind of like
that<00:06:29.360> just<00:06:30.360> because<00:06:30.630> it's<00:06:30.780> more<00:06:31.520> you<00:06:32.520> know<00:06:32.639> I

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:32.910 
that just because it's more you know I

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.760 
that just because it's more you know I
guess<00:06:33.240> in<00:06:33.360> some<00:06:33.419> ways<00:06:33.630> it's<00:06:34.020> more<00:06:34.080> durable

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:34.770 
guess in some ways it's more durable

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.040 
guess in some ways it's more durable
just<00:06:35.250> the<00:06:35.460> fact<00:06:35.729> that<00:06:35.880> it<00:06:36.030> won't<00:06:36.210> really<00:06:36.419> break

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050 
just the fact that it won't really break

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.270 
just the fact that it won't really break
or<00:06:37.979> anything<00:06:38.250> stiff<00:06:38.460> it's<00:06:38.610> more<00:06:38.849> s<00:06:39.539> pliable

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.280 
or anything stiff it's more s pliable

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.159 
or anything stiff it's more s pliable
but<00:06:41.280> um<00:06:41.490> he's<00:06:41.970> pretty<00:06:42.300> cool<00:06:42.509> can<00:06:42.840> I<00:06:42.870> really

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:43.169 
but um he's pretty cool can I really

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:45.620 
but um he's pretty cool can I really
like<00:06:43.380> the<00:06:43.560> look<00:06:43.740> of<00:06:43.860> him<00:06:44.009> um<00:06:44.310> not<00:06:45.180> really<00:06:45.300> sure

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:45.630

problems I've really encountered the

00:06:49.349 --> 00:06:50.779 
problems I've really encountered the
fact<00:06:49.590> that<00:06:49.680> he<00:06:49.830> couldn't<00:06:50.099> really<00:06:50.250> hold<00:06:50.550> his

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:50.789 
fact that he couldn't really hold his

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:52.370

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.420 
cool figure I really highly recommend
you<00:07:28.560> pick<00:07:28.590> him<00:07:28.889> up<00:07:28.949> if<00:07:29.099> you<00:07:29.190> find<00:07:29.520> him<00:07:31.370> rating<00:07:32.370> I

reason<00:07:34.919> why<00:07:35.039> it's<00:07:35.190> a<00:07:35.250> four<00:07:35.430> point<00:07:35.610> five<00:07:35.789> is<00:07:36.000> the

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:36.030 
reason why it's a four point five is the

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:37.399 
reason why it's a four point five is the
fact<00:07:36.330> that<00:07:36.449> you<00:07:36.659> know<00:07:36.750> I<00:07:36.780> had<00:07:36.990> to<00:07:37.080> swap<00:07:37.289> out
