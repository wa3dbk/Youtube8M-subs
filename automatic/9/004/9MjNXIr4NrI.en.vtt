00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
yeah it's not really for commercial use

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.640 
yeah it's not really for commercial use
right<00:03:48.760> right<00:03:49.120> so<00:03:49.300> it's<00:03:49.540> better<00:03:49.840> to<00:03:50.200> register

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
right right so it's better to register

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.030 
right right so it's better to register
it<00:03:50.710> as<00:03:50.860> let's<00:03:51.070> say<00:03:51.300> pinoy<00:03:52.300> culture<00:03:52.990> info<00:03:53.740> oh

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
it as let's say pinoy culture info oh

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.000 
it as let's say pinoy culture info oh
okay<00:03:54.850> pinoy<00:03:55.300> culture<00:03:55.690> com<00:03:56.140> so<00:03:56.470> that<00:03:56.740> is<00:03:56.980> how

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
okay pinoy culture com so that is how

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.640 
okay pinoy culture com so that is how
you<00:03:57.220> basically<00:03:57.850> find<00:03:58.360> out<00:03:58.570> what<00:03:58.810> the<00:03:58.900> contents

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
you basically find out what the contents

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.580 
you basically find out what the contents
of<00:03:59.860> that<00:04:00.520> website<00:04:01.420> is<00:04:01.660> based<00:04:02.200> on<00:04:02.320> what<00:04:02.470> the

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
of that website is based on what the

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.400 
of that website is based on what the
suffix<00:04:03.100> is<00:04:03.250> at<00:04:03.430> the<00:04:03.550> very<00:04:03.730> end<00:04:03.970> yes<00:04:04.690> enom<00:04:05.140> it's

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
suffix is at the very end yes enom it's

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.520 
suffix is at the very end yes enom it's
usually<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.730> likelihood<00:04:07.510> of<00:04:07.540> B<00:04:07.870> of<00:04:08.080> your

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
usually the likelihood of B of your

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.420 
usually the likelihood of B of your
website<00:04:09.010> name<00:04:09.220> being<00:04:10.120> registered<00:04:10.420> is<00:04:11.430> the

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
website name being registered is the

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.610 
website name being registered is the
likelihood<00:04:12.820> of<00:04:12.940> it<00:04:13.120> already<00:04:13.570> being<00:04:13.840> on<00:04:13.990> online

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
likelihood of it already being on online

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.120 
likelihood of it already being on online
is<00:04:14.920> less<00:04:15.250> right<00:04:15.880> I<00:04:15.910> use<00:04:16.390> the<00:04:16.900> appropriate

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
is less right I use the appropriate

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.770 
is less right I use the appropriate
domain<00:04:18.130> instead<00:04:18.430> of<00:04:18.820> everyone's<00:04:19.299> typically

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
domain instead of everyone's typically

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.810 
domain instead of everyone's typically
just<00:04:19.900> going<00:04:20.169> for<00:04:20.290> a<00:04:20.350> dot-com<00:04:20.560> so<00:04:21.070> domain<00:04:21.520> is

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
just going for a dot-com so domain is

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.150 
just going for a dot-com so domain is
the<00:04:21.850> dots<00:04:22.360> whatever<00:04:23.140> it<00:04:23.290> is<00:04:23.410> okay<00:04:23.830> okay<00:04:23.950> I'm

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
the dots whatever it is okay okay I'm

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.750 
the dots whatever it is okay okay I'm
getting<00:04:24.280> it<00:04:24.490> now

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
getting it now

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.020 
getting it now
that<00:04:25.480> thought<00:04:26.260> pH<00:04:26.800> is<00:04:27.160> basically<00:04:27.640> the<00:04:27.790> top

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
that thought pH is basically the top

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.060 
that thought pH is basically the top
level<00:04:28.510> domains<00:04:28.960> coming<00:04:29.410> together<00:04:29.560> now<00:04:29.890> it's

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
level domains coming together now it's

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.220 
level domains coming together now it's
coming<00:04:30.310> up<00:04:30.400> for<00:04:30.700> eternity<00:04:31.060> now<00:04:31.630> when<00:04:31.900> is<00:04:32.080> the

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
coming up for eternity now when is the

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.380 
coming up for eternity now when is the
best<00:04:32.440> time<00:04:32.650> to<00:04:33.160> register<00:04:33.400> your<00:04:33.970> own<00:04:34.150> domain

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
best time to register your own domain

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.750 
best time to register your own domain
name<00:04:34.630> the<00:04:35.110> best<00:04:35.470> time<00:04:35.740> really<00:04:35.980> is<00:04:36.220> when<00:04:36.610> you

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
name the best time really is when you

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.320 
name the best time really is when you
already<00:04:37.000> know<00:04:37.300> or<00:04:38.080> if<00:04:39.010> you're<00:04:39.250> like<00:04:39.460> I<00:04:39.760> think<00:04:40.270> I

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
already know or if you're like I think I

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.660 
already know or if you're like I think I
want<00:04:40.510> to<00:04:40.570> come<00:04:40.720> up<00:04:40.840> with<00:04:40.870> a<00:04:40.990> website<00:04:41.470> and<00:04:41.740> I
