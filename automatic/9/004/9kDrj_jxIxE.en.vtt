 they could leave something of you together and we 

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:14.710

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:28.900
 your net is actually announced in 

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:31.240
 March with Martin Garrix 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:35.050
 so how is that one bought and still 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:37.509

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:41.979

 that record too 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:47.469
 and so it actually started 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.749
 and we are going back and forth 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:52.360
 shoot and are the first ideas that 

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:54.999
 we already have it so we have to finish it now 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.439
 work and yes that comes out here 

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:58.389

00:05:56.439 --> 00:06:00.789
 it just get a martin garrix and 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:02.289
 glowinthedark yes yes and possibly yes 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:04.060
 probably that's going to be 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:05.229
 used for my profession then you are 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.610
 we have to do one thing so nicely 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:07.930

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.520

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.930

 music and go from the music 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:20.469
 we pick up the clothing line again because yes 

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:21.939
 you can't do everything at once 

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:27.069
