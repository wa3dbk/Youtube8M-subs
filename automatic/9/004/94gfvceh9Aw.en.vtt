 greetings to your friend xxxx 402 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.160
 and in this new video tutorial I come to you 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:04.309
 to teach how to download a program 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:08.600
 to take pictures on our computer 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:14.260
 without the need for a camera, 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:17.510
 the program is called prt is scr something like that 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.190
 something very similar good first thing that 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.540
 have to do is go to the link that is 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.540
 leave in the description of the video 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.120
 it's totally uploaded by my mediafire 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.400
 good now 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.720
 in download 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.720
 or download 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.110
 well I already had the file downloaded 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.840
 really 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.160
 right click extract here 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:13.120
 then they will have this icon with our 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:16.360
 little camera and this doll but give double 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:22.629
 click to open it they give it where it says 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:26.019
 next here next here I usually had the 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:28.450
 folder but I'm going to replace it 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:31.599
 they leave everything like this they give next here 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.540
 install good and it will start to 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:39.330
 install automatically 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.130
 good good as he had told us 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.080
 I already had the folder so that's why I 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.680
 this appears but it does not take you 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.680
 for the ok 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:57.000
 good ready in 10m finished installing 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.540
 now here is to open and 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.660
 and the program will automatically leave 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.140
 to teach them how to use it 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.140
 phillips 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:17.640
 well apparently the program was not opened 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.910
 they have to do the following this 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.040
 it also depends on your keyboard the most 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.990
 of the keyboards by 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.710
 and knowledge 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:32.430
 next to the f key 12 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.569
 there is a key that is called and band 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.400
 6 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:39.329
 something like less 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.730
 you have to give this key 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:44.980
 in my case on my keyboard is next to 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.840
 the key where he ran where they are deleted 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:53.400
 the letters or things 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:56.110
 this will appear here as something for 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:00.130
 take the photo very simple 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:02.710
 they give in the key that says control they give 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.660
 left click 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:08.410
 good 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:12.700
 here in this case do not press 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:15.580
 control only applies to the screen to 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.389
 full screen if they want an area 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.299
 specific 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:22.400
 again and they give you control 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.100
 left 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.590
 and select here the area where they are going to 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:32.449
 take the photo 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:35.540
 loose and ready now if you want 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:37.860
 take a little more messy only 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.710
 they give right click 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:44.770
 in this way but I do not think the go 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:47.949
 to take it loose and ready 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:50.979
 there's also like a type of that grated 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:53.240
 he told me about notes for example if they want 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:58.699
 underline here 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:05:01.530
 give control and right click and underline 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:04.030
 look 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:07.840
 then release in pro leaves control 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:12.940
 pressed and then against the staff 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:16.810
 left click good as you can see 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:19.180
 capture the photos let's say that night 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.920
 because that would be a bit of an exaggeration 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.850
 but yes 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:28.680
 they are variable and do not take them as ugly or 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.680
 blurred good 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:35.640
 this has been all friends that basically 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:38.580

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.139

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:44.479
 to serve 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:48.930
 it's been good everything has been said by his friend 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:52.340
