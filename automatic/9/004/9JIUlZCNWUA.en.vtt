00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
himself with you hot all the way or not

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.800 
himself with you hot all the way or not
I<00:02:54.010> don't<00:02:54.430> care<00:02:54.640> I<00:02:54.970> just<00:02:55.180> want<00:02:55.330> to<00:02:55.390> see<00:02:55.510> both<00:02:55.630> of

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
I don't care I just want to see both of

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.660 
I don't care I just want to see both of
them<00:02:55.900> on<00:02:56.140> opposite<00:02:56.650> sides<00:02:56.860> and<00:02:57.070> see<00:02:57.250> what

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
them on opposite sides and see what

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.729 
them on opposite sides and see what
reasoning<00:02:58.630> maybe<00:02:58.780> we'll<00:02:58.959> get<00:02:59.110> a<00:02:59.170> glance<00:02:59.470> at

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
reasoning maybe we'll get a glance at

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.170 
reasoning maybe we'll get a glance at
what<00:02:59.920> would<00:03:00.070> use<00:03:00.250> reasoning<00:03:00.700> is<00:03:00.880> but

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
what would use reasoning is but

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.580 
what would use reasoning is but
nonetheless<00:03:01.360> I<00:03:01.690> definitely<00:03:02.020> want<00:03:02.170> to<00:03:02.200> see<00:03:02.410> if

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
nonetheless I definitely want to see if

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
back I've had some crazy theory that

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.660 
back I've had some crazy theory that
Aizen<00:03:38.560> is<00:03:38.680> already<00:03:38.920> there<00:03:39.310> on<00:03:39.549> the

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
Aizen is already there on the

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.729 
Aizen is already there on the
battlefield<00:03:39.850> because<00:03:40.450> it<00:03:41.260> was<00:03:41.410> something<00:03:41.590> to

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
battlefield because it was something to

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.800 
battlefield because it was something to
do<00:03:41.890> a<00:03:41.920> killer<00:03:42.190> doc<00:03:42.400> wouldn't<00:03:42.880> suite<00:03:43.120> where<00:03:43.540> he

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
do a killer doc wouldn't suite where he

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.780 
do a killer doc wouldn't suite where he
was<00:03:43.989> standing<00:03:44.650> around<00:03:44.890> and<00:03:45.280> when<00:03:45.549> he<00:03:45.670> was

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
was standing around and when he was

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.640 
was standing around and when he was
talking<00:03:45.970> to<00:03:46.150> hospital<00:03:46.660> how<00:03:47.170> he<00:03:47.230> looked

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
talking to hospital how he looked

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.500 
talking to hospital how he looked
different<00:03:47.920> how<00:03:48.250> he<00:03:48.310> all<00:03:48.610> of<00:03:48.700> a<00:03:48.760> sudden<00:03:49.030> didn't

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
different how he all of a sudden didn't

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.180 
different how he all of a sudden didn't
have<00:03:49.660> the<00:03:49.780> eyepatch<00:03:50.260> and<00:03:50.590> people<00:03:50.890> were<00:03:50.950> saying

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
have the eyepatch and people were saying

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.580 
have the eyepatch and people were saying
that<00:03:51.400> maybe<00:03:51.790> that<00:03:52.329> was<00:03:52.510> actually<00:03:53.049> eyes<00:03:53.290> and

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
that maybe that was actually eyes and

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.590 
that maybe that was actually eyes and
already<00:03:53.799> there<00:03:54.010> that<00:03:54.040> kyoraku<00:03:54.670> is<00:03:55.120> still<00:03:55.390> in

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
already there that kyoraku is still in

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.539 
already there that kyoraku is still in
the<00:03:55.870> human<00:03:56.260> world<00:03:56.290> with<00:03:56.980> ichigo's<00:03:57.370> friends

the human world with ichigo's friends

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.150 
the human world with ichigo's friends
and<00:03:57.940> that's<00:03:58.030> Aizen<00:03:58.660> and<00:03:58.810> also<00:03:59.079> that<00:03:59.260> akira<00:03:59.950> who

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
and that's Aizen and also that akira who

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.250 
and that's Aizen and also that akira who
rarely<00:04:00.670> drinks<00:04:01.000> anything<00:04:01.269> but<00:04:01.630> alcohol<00:04:02.110> and

he was drinking tea there so maybe

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.850

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
it's my fuck the shit out of me and

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.880

that's<00:04:07.450> totally<00:04:07.690> sounding<00:04:08.200> crazy<00:04:08.380> but<00:04:08.739> that

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
that's totally sounding crazy but that

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.289 
that's totally sounding crazy but that
was<00:04:09.130> a<00:04:09.160> theory<00:04:09.489> I<00:04:09.519> read<00:04:09.820> and<00:04:09.970> that<00:04:10.090> would<00:04:10.180> be

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
was a theory I read and that would be

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.449 
was a theory I read and that would be
totally<00:04:10.510> insane<00:04:10.900> and<00:04:11.290> a<00:04:11.620> great<00:04:11.890> introduction

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
totally insane and a great introduction
