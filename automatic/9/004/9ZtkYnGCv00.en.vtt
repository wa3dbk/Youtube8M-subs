probably<00:01:31.770> should<00:01:32.100> have<00:01:32.220> tied<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:33.000> soldered

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
probably should have tied and soldered

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.420 
probably should have tied and soldered
these<00:01:34.290> spokes<00:01:34.710> if<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.009> don't<00:01:35.189> know<00:01:35.280> what

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
these spokes if you don't know what

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.249 
these spokes if you don't know what
tying<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.970> soldering<00:01:36.390> your<00:01:36.600> spokes<00:01:36.900> are<00:01:37.079> go

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
tying and soldering your spokes are go

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.340 
tying and soldering your spokes are go
over<00:01:37.500> we<00:01:37.590> got<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.740> video<00:01:37.920> on<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:39.350> makes

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
over we got a video on that it makes

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.920 
over we got a video on that it makes
this<00:01:40.530> beep<00:01:41.130> beep<00:01:42.090> around<00:01:42.270> when<00:01:42.600> we<00:01:42.659> put<00:01:42.840> them

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
this beep beep around when we put them

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.050 
this beep beep around when we put them
on<00:01:43.020> our<00:01:43.049> polo<00:01:43.350> bikes<00:01:43.649> as<00:01:43.829> well<00:01:44.009> but<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:45.000> is

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
on our polo bikes as well but this is

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.520 
on our polo bikes as well but this is
kind<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.420> like<00:01:45.540> almost<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:46.259> know<00:01:46.350> what<00:01:46.439> it

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
kind of like almost you know what it

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.600 
kind of like almost you know what it
kind<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.740> looks<00:01:46.920> like<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.159> looks<00:01:47.310> like<00:01:47.369> it's

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
kind of looks like it looks like it's

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.990 
kind of looks like it looks like it's
like<00:01:47.880> pieces<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.270> old<00:01:48.630> tire<00:01:49.369> radial<00:01:50.369> tire<00:01:50.759> that

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
like pieces of old tire radial tire that

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.300 
like pieces of old tire radial tire that
they<00:01:51.180> cut<00:01:51.509> up<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.899> they<00:01:52.590> put<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.220> they

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
they cut up and they put that and they

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.100 
they cut up and they put that and they
sandwich<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.270> spokes<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.869> then<00:01:54.990> you

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
sandwich that in the spokes and then you

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.260 
sandwich that in the spokes and then you
got<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.350> steel<00:01:55.950> sprockets<00:01:56.520> on<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.759> backside

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
got the steel sprockets on the backside

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.050 
got the steel sprockets on the backside
and<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:58.049> is<00:01:58.259> on<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.469> front<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.729> was<00:01:59.850> cut

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
and this is on the front and it was cut

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.340 
and this is on the front and it was cut
this<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.600> toughest<00:02:00.990> part

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
this is the toughest part

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.679 
this is the toughest part
we<00:02:02.159> got<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.340> chain<00:02:02.640> tensioner<00:02:03.180> here<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:03.570> is

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
we got a chain tensioner here this is

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.920 
we got a chain tensioner here this is
the<00:02:03.810> factory<00:02:04.320> chain<00:02:04.560> tensioner<00:02:05.130> right<00:02:05.340> here

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
the factory chain tensioner right here

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.180 
the factory chain tensioner right here
so<00:02:06.930> we<00:02:07.079> can<00:02:07.259> move<00:02:07.409> this<00:02:07.649> up<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.099> down

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
so we can move this up and down

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.219 
so we can move this up and down
accordingly<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:09.060> get<00:02:09.239> our<00:02:09.330> chain<00:02:09.599> somewhat

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
accordingly to get our chain somewhat

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.350 
accordingly to get our chain somewhat
tight<00:02:10.470> in<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.280> initial<00:02:11.640> stages<00:02:11.879> our<00:02:12.150> chain

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
tight in the initial stages our chain

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.290 
tight in the initial stages our chain
was<00:02:12.510> too<00:02:12.660> loose<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:13.020> it

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
was too loose and it

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.970 
was too loose and it
jammed<00:02:13.480> up<00:02:13.750> and<00:02:13.840> into<00:02:14.110> here<00:02:14.440> we<00:02:14.590> had<00:02:14.740> to<00:02:14.830> take

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
jammed up and into here we had to take

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.310 
jammed up and into here we had to take
it<00:02:15.160> apart<00:02:15.460> and<00:02:15.580> do<00:02:15.730> what<00:02:15.880> we<00:02:16.030> had<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.330> do<00:02:16.510> this

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
it apart and do what we had to do this

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.800 
it apart and do what we had to do this
is<00:02:17.470> your<00:02:17.650> this<00:02:18.040> is<00:02:18.100> your<00:02:18.370> clutch<00:02:18.640> which<00:02:19.300> we'll

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
is your this is your clutch which we'll

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.140 
is your this is your clutch which we'll
get<00:02:19.960> into<00:02:20.110> that<00:02:20.260> in<00:02:20.410> a<00:02:20.650> minute<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:21.700> other

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
get into that in a minute the other

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.850 
get into that in a minute the other
tough<00:02:22.600> part<00:02:22.900> some<00:02:23.170> of<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.320> things<00:02:23.530> that<00:02:23.710> we've

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
tough part some of the things that we've

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.560 
tough part some of the things that we've
had<00:02:24.070> problems<00:02:24.340> with<00:02:24.640> or<00:02:24.850> we<00:02:24.970> talked<00:02:25.270> to<00:02:25.420> people

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
had problems with or we talked to people

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.100 
had problems with or we talked to people
about<00:02:26.610> put<00:02:27.610> that<00:02:27.730> down<00:02:27.850> is<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.750> fact<00:02:28.990> that

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
about put that down is the fact that

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.170 
about put that down is the fact that
they<00:02:29.290> might<00:02:29.500> need<00:02:29.710> a<00:02:29.890> longer<00:02:30.280> bottom<00:02:30.760> bracket

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
they might need a longer bottom bracket

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.250 
they might need a longer bottom bracket
axle<00:02:32.430> because<00:02:33.430> this<00:02:34.120> does<00:02:34.450> not<00:02:34.480> clear<00:02:34.990> the

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
axle because this does not clear the

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.350 
axle because this does not clear the
motor<00:02:35.730> okay<00:02:36.730> as<00:02:37.120> you<00:02:37.870> can<00:02:37.900> see<00:02:38.260> it<00:02:38.470> is

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
motor okay as you can see it is

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.630 
motor okay as you can see it is
fractions<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:41.530> only<00:02:41.770> reason<00:02:42.040> it's<00:02:42.160> fractions

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
fractions the only reason it's fractions

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.940 
fractions the only reason it's fractions
is<00:02:42.730> because<00:02:43.060> I<00:02:43.090> took<00:02:43.210> a<00:02:43.450> big<00:02:43.810> pipe<00:02:44.350> on<00:02:44.590> here<00:02:44.830> and

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
is because I took a big pipe on here and

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.340 
is because I took a big pipe on here and
I<00:02:45.070> sent<00:02:45.370> this<00:02:45.580> back<00:02:45.880> we<00:02:46.480> wanted<00:02:46.780> to<00:02:46.900> do<00:02:47.020> this<00:02:47.170> on

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
I sent this back we wanted to do this on

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.960 
I sent this back we wanted to do this on
a<00:02:47.380> budget<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:48.040> do<00:02:48.160> it<00:02:48.280> as<00:02:48.400> quickly<00:02:48.670> as<00:02:48.940> we

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
a budget and do it as quickly as we

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.790 
a budget and do it as quickly as we
possibly<00:02:49.540> could<00:02:49.780> to<00:02:49.840> make<00:02:50.110> this<00:02:50.260> thing<00:02:50.470> -

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
possibly could to make this thing -

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.990 
possibly could to make this thing -
didn't<00:02:51.490> know<00:02:51.610> if<00:02:51.730> it<00:02:51.880> was<00:02:52.000> kind<00:02:52.300> of<00:02:52.420> work<00:02:54.000> it

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
didn't know if it was kind of work it

didn't know if it was kind of work it
works<00:02:55.210> believe<00:02:55.540> me<00:02:55.690> we're<00:02:55.900> gonna<00:02:55.990> go<00:02:56.170> put<00:02:56.350> it

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
works believe me we're gonna go put it

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.370 
works believe me we're gonna go put it
on<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.650> dynamometer<00:02:57.160> about<00:02:57.940> two<00:02:58.270> seconds<00:02:58.870> we

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
on the dynamometer about two seconds we

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.260 
on the dynamometer about two seconds we
also<00:02:59.530> push<00:02:59.950> this<00:03:00.130> I<00:03:00.310> crushed<00:03:00.670> this<00:03:00.880> without<00:03:01.150> I

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
mean really Rube Goldberg at its best we

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.330 
mean really Rube Goldberg at its best we
just<00:03:04.480> slammed<00:03:05.050> this<00:03:05.350> thing<00:03:05.590> home<00:03:05.830> and<00:03:06.070> just

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
just slammed this thing home and just

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.860 
just slammed this thing home and just
beat<00:03:06.520> it<00:03:06.670> up<00:03:06.790> so<00:03:06.940> that<00:03:06.970> way<00:03:07.270> it<00:03:07.390> would<00:03:07.510> fit<00:03:07.720> in

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
beat it up so that way it would fit in

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.600 
beat it up so that way it would fit in
there<00:03:08.050> and<00:03:08.260> kind<00:03:08.830> of<00:03:09.010> rigged<00:03:09.340> it<00:03:09.490> up

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
there and kind of rigged it up

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.310 
there and kind of rigged it up
