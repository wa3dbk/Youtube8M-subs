going<00:00:43.970> to<00:00:44.059> show<00:00:44.300> us<00:00:44.480> how<00:00:44.690> the<00:00:44.750> check<00:00:45.110> nymph

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
going to show us how the check nymph

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.220 
going to show us how the check nymph
method<00:00:45.800> can<00:00:46.070> be<00:00:46.100> used<00:00:46.190> for<00:00:46.550> longer<00:00:46.940> distances

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
method can be used for longer distances

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.830 
method can be used for longer distances
the<00:00:48.230> medium<00:00:48.710> distance<00:00:49.129> method<00:00:52.239> this<00:00:53.239> one<00:00:53.540> is

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
the medium distance method this one is

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.040 
the medium distance method this one is
the<00:00:54.230> first<00:00:54.530> oh<00:00:56.199> sure<00:00:57.199> ok<00:00:58.040> button<00:00:58.640> yes<00:00:59.180> and<00:00:59.839> and

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
the first oh sure ok button yes and and

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.930 
the first oh sure ok button yes and and
what's<00:01:00.409> interesting<00:01:00.589> is<00:01:01.070> that<00:01:01.100> I<00:01:01.400> can<00:01:01.580> see<00:01:01.790> the

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
what's interesting is that I can see the

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.660 
what's interesting is that I can see the
back<00:01:02.150> here<00:01:02.540> and<00:01:02.799> that's<00:01:03.799> something<00:01:04.040> typical

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
back here and that's something typical

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.149 
back here and that's something typical
for<00:01:04.879> the<00:01:04.970> check<00:01:05.210> name<00:01:05.420> figure<00:01:05.810> yes<00:01:06.170> and<00:01:06.409> this

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
for the check name figure yes and this

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.500 
for the check name figure yes and this
was<00:01:07.600> 1987<00:01:09.430> how's<00:01:10.430> the<00:01:10.580> Flies<00:01:10.820> drift<00:01:11.299> with<00:01:11.479> the

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
was 1987 how's the Flies drift with the

was 1987 how's the Flies drift with the
