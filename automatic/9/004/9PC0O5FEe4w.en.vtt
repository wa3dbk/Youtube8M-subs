00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
eight fights but he's a contender for

the<00:01:10.979> IBF<00:01:11.369> i<00:01:11.640> believe<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.330> that's<00:01:12.540> why<00:01:12.689> he's<00:01:12.869> a

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
the IBF i believe so that's why he's a

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.370

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
recent fights so I'm just gonna guess

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.590 
recent fights so I'm just gonna guess
here<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.850> if<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:48.000> guys<00:01:48.149> think<00:01:50.030> some<00:01:51.030> Solomon

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
here so if you guys think some Solomon

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.060 
here so if you guys think some Solomon
has<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.750> chance<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.229> win<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:52.680> fight<00:01:52.890> rather

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
has a chance to win this fight rather

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.200 
has a chance to win this fight rather
than<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.399> comment<00:01:53.640> section<00:01:53.880> below<00:01:53.970> why

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
than the comment section below why

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.469 
than the comment section below why
because<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.750> choose<00:01:55.460> Felix<00:01:56.460> term<00:01:56.850> I'm<00:01:57.240> just

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
because I choose Felix term I'm just

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.539 
because I choose Felix term I'm just
guessing<00:01:57.689> here<00:01:57.990> because<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.320> don't<00:01:58.500> know<00:01:58.680> who<00:01:59.399> I

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
guessing here because I don't know who I

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.969 
guessing here because I don't know who I
haven't<00:02:00.540> seen<00:02:00.659> much<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:00.990> Sam<00:02:01.350> Sullivan<00:02:01.590> I've

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
haven't seen much of Sam Sullivan I've

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.039 
haven't seen much of Sam Sullivan I've
only<00:02:02.130> seen<00:02:02.340> him<00:02:02.490> I'm<00:02:03.240> like<00:02:03.390> back<00:02:03.630> in<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.840> day

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
only seen him I'm like back in the day

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.840 
only seen him I'm like back in the day
when<00:02:04.530> he<00:02:04.680> was<00:02:04.829> he<00:02:05.130> looked<00:02:05.340> actually<00:02:05.460> pretty

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
when he was he looked actually pretty

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.510 
when he was he looked actually pretty
good<00:02:06.060> back<00:02:06.299> in<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.450> day<00:02:06.600> but<00:02:06.770> he's<00:02:07.770> already<00:02:07.950> 39

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
good back in the day but he's already 39

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.279 
good back in the day but he's already 39
years<00:02:08.700> old<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.090> he<00:02:09.209> has<00:02:09.300> 11<00:02:09.569> losses<00:02:09.899> so<00:02:10.229> I

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
years old and he has 11 losses so I

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.840 
years old and he has 11 losses so I
don't<00:02:10.649> really<00:02:10.679> know<00:02:10.860> much<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.190> say<00:02:11.370> about<00:02:11.459> him

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
don't really know much to say about him
