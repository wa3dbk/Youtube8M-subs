00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:19.299
 that process configuring the service 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:23.170
 pack 1 percent 2 percent took one 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:25.450

 now it windows 2008 r2 enterprise 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.829
 service pack 1 is very interesting after 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.810
 to install the service pack you do 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.639
 windows update because many 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.950
 new updates came after the 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:49.950
 service pack 1 so I came here to start the 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:57.150
 The ticket already appeared here for me. 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:57.150
 windows update 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.659
 he has shown me is that four 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.769
 Important updates are 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:04.180
 available 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.739

 Permissions just click here for you 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.000
 see 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:14.169
 Seeing several new updates 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.280
 then the service pack installs the 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:17.079
 Updates 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.090
 it is logical that this 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:21.579
 windows update must be performed from 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.199
 constant form, mainly after the 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.680
 installation of a new role for a new 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:28.419
 service within your server is only 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.389
 I hope you liked it and this
