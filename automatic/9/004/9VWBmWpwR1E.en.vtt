00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.610
 imported 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.430
 can never have a bad German security and by the office 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.130
 internal television or newspaper printed that are only two season accessories 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.270
 by car 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.680
 I collect, I do not have a collection that I like very much. 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.010
 company a car of these 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.010
 in the estimated value 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.810
 this is a green color - 158 eros was American the young car 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.330
 sporting is braga sporting 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.700
 already has special ' 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.899
 there was one of the first cases with large size v8 bodywork in fiber 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.759
 should first blame the charge 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:15.029
 the convertible fiberglass body was a car 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:20.469
 the monster at the time the sporty is the direct supersport looks the detail of the 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:24.140
 escape from the prophecy that she suffers to speak nothing else to distract her 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.140
 it was that other side too 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.169
 now it's here specially 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:38.559
 this is the car 

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:42.289
 the former vocalist is any place in the world has passion for this being a cut 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:46.159
 this at least 136 alongside - and 77 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:49.989
 was a super futuristic car and to this day is an icon of the world motorsport 

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:53.709
 it's an all-aerodynamic car show but how tiradentes 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.640
 mounted caputo give a little to the routine of the car I will have a detail 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.679
 incredible in this car that is an exchange that he is serious shift of the marches 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.429
 I am here 

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:05.039
 It's called letterman. 

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:09.169
 then it is the exchange rate fluctuates state by well says if you change the gear of this 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:10.859
 active form 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.239
 You were released first. 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.120
 second bullshit then is a path that takes super revolutionary time 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.909
 musical people were looking for 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:25.329
 comfort so if you have a crop of positivism to advertise 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:26.719
 with a very large cost 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:29.780
 you only with tv only without taking your hand off the steering wheel 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.689
 You changed the lows. 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:34.689
 then it is the exchange very excited Wednesdays 

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:47.379
 they are anything but 129 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:49.810
 cgtp has even a true 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:50.829
 the author of the animated 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.849
 I was just voting for outside coat 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:55.789
 was already made so at the time 

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:57.669
 she is unique in Brazil 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:01.429
 and it is not because it is a levity in partnership with city hall office 

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:03.779
 He was selling books in this car. 

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:08.359
 let's go until he's the only man so it's suspected that this one has even one 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:10.189
 plate of wanting cremil 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:12.319
 This plague is clemilda. 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.419
 was less than 70 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:15.589
 weighted 

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:17.789
 car stats 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:22.530
 and working the pool is my brother's gift voucher 

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:24.400
 measures are put in place. 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.040
 so I think it's the name of the lawyer is to invest until today 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:39.849
 this is a cadilac 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:43.459
 if it is a dog that 1916 is a testimony of the time is a car that 

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:44.960
 has never been restored 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.169
 also part of the museum is the young man 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.580
 which today is the largest collection in South America and this car belonged to the Baron 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.249
 of tefé if you look at the car start and stop looks like a carriage a promoter and 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:58.580
 is a v8 engine since it has a story with baron 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.129
 it's belly, right? 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:02.830
 so when you from a person who was fat 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.379
 you want to get in the car in 1906 already had direction is motivated 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:11.190
 and facilitated the entry 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.190
 from the car driver 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:26.219
 The letter speaks of antiquity in anyone better than it is a person who lived in the 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:27.050
 time 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.699
 my father 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:30.419
 we hope we can 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:35.960
 36 with v8 reversing engines was called a baratinha 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:42.130
 I have a booth and then civil 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.620
 where his portal for him to open 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.900
 and there's another bank there would be two people 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.819
 if the person has the protector 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:53.330
 there the relief of the work from outside said that it was 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.889
 or the mother-in-law's body, right? 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:01.210
 the text - and that the maker the story of richter 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.939
 one of them is the champions 

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:04.849
 this modern 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:07.849
 they did behind was similar to the front 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:13.990
 the certification is could there be people did not know if the elderly was 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.529
 coming back from government 

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:17.250
 in the final round 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:23.870
 is almost equal to the front is an airplane face it comes mitral virei with a jet 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.409
 that had at the time that would be used 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:29.409
 This time I want to do something similar. 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:39.949
 My father already had a prominent USA 

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:45.819
 it's even possible it will open 

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:48.749
 is your value is 46 front and line 

00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:50.270
 it was the other thing 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.999
 accomplish the feat two new positions 

00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:55.680
 of the time is mainly delicate 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.050
 alice and roberta 2-1 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:03.780
 all hard was big and heavy they used and abused minutes taken right? 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.650
 because of all this he weighed today in his closets because I've seen a lot 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.639
 thing of until here 

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:14.789
 the classic tico romario 

00:07:20.369 --> 00:07:23.690
 são paulo today is a world center 

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:28.910
 of the old mobilized the passion for the old car is very large and you have 

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:34.210
 the way the media leda written more than 15 this specialized distance and 

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:36.669
 antigomobilismo antigomobilismo newspaper

 meetings of old cars by the whole brazil in the sambódromo every Tuesday 

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:44.189
 I thought it was an illness the last objective 

00:07:44.189 --> 00:07:47.789
 and to have a way in the blood you're accounting will be forever 

00:07:51.439 --> 00:07:54.439
 all 

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:59.550
 prof 

00:08:02.009 --> 00:08:02.499
 but
