00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 hello to all guys and girls and 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.840
 welcome once again to the territory 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.840
 firefighter 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.139
 in today's video is true because I'm going 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.480
 to talk a lot because my dearest 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.310
 stop and the next month's channel 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.550
 nominated in the tag of my dearest 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.220
 raquel del canal rebels this the tag of 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.020
 my own style and if you know this 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.340
 two girls you have to go to know them already 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.780
 of them because it is that I tell you of the 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.940
 relationship that you will love I hate you and 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.980
 before rolling the rest I'm going to start 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.190
 already with this video because it is that I speak 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.620
 a lot then I'm going to try to make it so 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.040
 as short as possible so as not to have 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.810
 roll up is developing lay 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.950
 I was snoring and you answer 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.950
 Well, it's worth it 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.120
 Thank you 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:03.530
 if this is it, this is my other self 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.400
 it came first to ask what are the 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.010
 three civilians 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.370
 my three essentials I would say that 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.930
 are the high-rise pants and if 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.880
 I have to choose a chosen color at 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.690
 black but I'm not worth the 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:24.469
 cowboys minus whites all 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:27.350
 high-shot pants and 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:31.330
 as well 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.330
 and the converse 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:42.140
 the 26 hooks 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:45.230
 good to see if this winter of 6 years and 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.270
 if it's summer with tops is worth the risk a 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.429
 hole 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.560
 paris with the following question stone 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.020
 I adore plated 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.539
 Clear 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.590
 I already had better the golden one but it is that 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.939
 I have more silver, but it's not worth it 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.100
 is that not really in which but it is 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:05.729
 that I have more silver and gold things 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.860
 I do not know why but I think that 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.670
 I go more for the silver for the gold 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.610
 the ravioli 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:19.450
 the next question 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.450
 so you 've taken it to the satiety 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.450
 sealed to satiety 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.240
 I'm the textile in the denim jacket 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.030
 that my aunt gave me that I am not 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.740
 until January 2 until I plan not to 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.770
 I wanted to put on a coat because I said no 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.770
 it's winter and I put on his jacket 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.580
 do not 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:50.319
 tell me something you would never wear 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.709
 I never condemn you I would put your face 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.709
 torch 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:06.020
 but I would never wear these shoes that 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.730
 they are like silicone that have 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.940
 little holes this time I'm going to you I'm going to 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:16.680
 leave some data that tracks you we are going to 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:19.700
 leave a picture down here those who 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.700
 my icons 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.980
 I 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.980
 at home 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:36.220
 in front of the favorite to wear in white 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.220
 the target 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.540
 the color that I 'm wearing it so that 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.049
 you are 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:48.640
 I think it will launch more pointing or is 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:50.650
 orange phosphorite good is that we go in 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.629
 an orange shirt that I like to know 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.359
 if you look at this one you also have is totally 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:58.950
 of orange but I would not put an orange 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:04.890
 butane plan or an orange that you say 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.890
 Hi, I'm going to underline 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.920
 is asking an eternity of bruno 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:13.980
 - it's more or less is less I think 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:17.100
 considering as seen less is 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:20.590
 more but also thought that in some 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.970
 more chances is more 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.970
 but it depends on which this person 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:32.819
 leave it alone 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:32.819
 tickets are worth trends or not 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.410
 good if you have if why because you 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.570
 I was that within hours of arriving and if 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.910
 like it you buy it and you do not like it 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.620
 you do not buy it then I think 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.990
 you have to follow trends but with some 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.610
 limits you have to like what you 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.590
 You're not going to be one and you do not like it 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.620
 you hate but you're going to put it 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.810
 because it takes away you know how to see the tastes 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.740
 change then at first you can 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.740
 put this face on 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:09.069
 but new tea but then you can finish 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:11.800
 liking then good that I say it is 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:16.590
 I have tendencies but limited and 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:18.550
 would you define your style as 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.990
 groupon 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:25.530
 ok put the next 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.550
 well then to see it really depends on 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:31.750
 as 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:34.120
 that is me today I woke up dad and 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.610
 then I put a shirt 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:40.450
 flowers because I'm happy and it's 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.730
 spring and I think the flowers then 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:45.640
 they represent the spring that I am 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.530

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.780

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.850
 Pijama 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:00.990
 is that it depends on 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:04.870
 of the day so define a style in how 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:08.560
