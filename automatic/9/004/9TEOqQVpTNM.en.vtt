today I'm going to be showing you about
a<00:00:18.590> program<00:00:19.070> called<00:00:19.099> SMC<00:00:20.060> fan<00:00:20.360> control<00:00:20.779> but

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
a program called SMC fan control but

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.439 
a program called SMC fan control but
this<00:00:21.800> program<00:00:22.189> basically<00:00:22.730> allows<00:00:22.970> you<00:00:23.150> to<00:00:23.180> do

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
this program basically allows you to do

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:25.269 
this program basically allows you to do
is<00:00:23.930> control<00:00:24.439> the<00:00:24.470> fan<00:00:24.770> speed<00:00:25.070> of<00:00:25.160> your

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
is control the fan speed of your

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.510 
is control the fan speed of your
computer<00:00:25.689> so<00:00:26.689> let's<00:00:26.899> say<00:00:27.169> that<00:00:27.200> your<00:00:28.129> laptop

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
computer so let's say that your laptop

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.269 
computer so let's say that your laptop
is<00:00:28.939> running<00:00:28.969> a<00:00:29.239> little<00:00:29.329> hot<00:00:29.919> so<00:00:30.919> with<00:00:31.160> this

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
is running a little hot so with this

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.160 
is running a little hot so with this
program<00:00:31.700> you<00:00:31.849> can<00:00:31.879> prove<00:00:32.210> stuff<00:00:32.540> and<00:00:32.780> speeds

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
program you can prove stuff and speeds

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.650 
program you can prove stuff and speeds
and<00:00:33.879> eventually<00:00:34.879> your<00:00:34.969> computer<00:00:35.329> will<00:00:35.450> cool

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
and eventually your computer will cool

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.790 
and eventually your computer will cool
down<00:00:37.239> so<00:00:38.239> you're<00:00:39.200> just<00:00:39.320> gonna<00:00:39.440> want<00:00:39.620> to<00:00:39.680> have

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
down so you're just gonna want to have

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.900 
down so you're just gonna want to have
an<00:00:39.890> SMC<00:00:40.219> fan<00:00:40.550> control<00:00:41.000> on<00:00:41.449> Google<00:00:42.199> and<00:00:42.910> it

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
an SMC fan control on Google and it

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.880 
an SMC fan control on Google and it
should<00:00:44.090> be<00:00:44.180> the<00:00:44.300> first<00:00:44.540> one<00:00:47.710> once<00:00:48.710> you
