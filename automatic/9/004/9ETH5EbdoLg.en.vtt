 all comrade hello yango with you 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.030
 in the west and in such a review today we 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.750
 let's see the keyboard that came to 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.009
 me home and toji keyboard 910 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.529
 postpone because 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.359
 orion who knows who doesn't know what they kept 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.400
 still on sale in Ukraine she did not appear 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.890
 I do not know the exact information about Russia 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.050
 but I got this exclusive 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.180
 product than sitting in what is it 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.609
 mechanical keyboard inside is 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.790
 spring points response time maximized 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.399
 quickly this is a top unit now from 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.680
 Logitech companies are very interesting 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.829
 pressed inside there is a little bit such 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.500
 that's the exact flight itself podstavochki 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.500
 slips at the expense of three such here 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.390
 say such supports and straight down 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.850
 I put in the key that is definitely not 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.640
 promezhete and there is still such a wonderful 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.629
 backlight illumination from customizable 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.460
 through logic gaming software themselves 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.289
 you can almost every button 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.629
 set up like I did let's say 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.070
 you see how i have them now 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.830
 arranged let's say easier to add 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.200
 yellow and the keys with and like this 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.270
 they just start to appear here 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.619
 on the eyes 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.920
 in a wonderful way that is possible 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.080
 set up 16 million colors here 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.659
 different, that is, customize what you want 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.090
 whatever you want whatever you want is all 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.770
 really depends on you also 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.470
 all sorts of already programmed actions 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.570
 like a color cycle that is straight 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.970
 the keyboard flashes well at night to be honest 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.740
 it hits under the eye but of course if you 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.259
 want to surprise some of your friends 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.630
 it is quite possible though again 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.869
 notice colors attack will be a million 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.270
 billion don't know how many millions they 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.159
 will not affect the quality of your game 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.700
 quality affects exactly 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.560
 the response is exactly how fast it is pressed 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.570
 one or another key in mechanical 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.659
 keyboards it happens instantly and 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.189
 it pleases the fingers also do not get tired 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.490
 the only thing in mechanical 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.960
 keyboards is a creature 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.409
 now if you click here you 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.630
 see the noise but the quality guys 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.330
 requires sacrifice namely noise that is 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.489
 record of course if you surveyor 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.290
 It will be hard for it there have 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.450
 a little work sound editor 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.930
 but still it's worth it already 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.190
 The keyboard is very comfortable on it 9 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.030
 programmable buttons now and key 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.500
 this is another little effect effect 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.660
 breathing is all hardware 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:33.340
 lights up something like 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:38.830
 New Year's bulbs g1 to g5 are located 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:40.660
 on the left side of g6 g7 g8 9 to jijiji 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.000
 hard to pronounce a little is 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.700
 top honestly when you hold 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.440
 left hand does not interfere 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.890
 located right under your finger that is 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:54.100
 Prim, well, the slightest bit necessary movement you 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.080
 You can directly give them the g key 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.530
 6 honestly placed too high 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.870
 as if f1 still interferes 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.269
 I honestly would not use them again 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.820
 dock station opens like this 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.280
 But on the keyboard to put Gizmo 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.820
 your favorite smartphone is in 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.290
 application now i will open it this is rx 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.299
 control meaning you just bet 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.680
 connection lost did not say but again 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.150
 looking to connect you should be 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.340
 installed software on 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.230
 computer he connects them and you all 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.440
 there is a straight bing under these all the buttons 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.940
 which I burn g set up captive in this 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.890
 smartphone app 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.420
 also with multimedia you can click and 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.209
 and although on the keyboard too 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.350
 multimedia slider and switch 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.630
 all sorts of music everything else 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.390
 Mute is also comfortable even on 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.950
 my keyboard say no 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.049
 mice if you are from a ji company so you 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.750
 can also increase reduce depay 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.340
 It is through this application that this is super 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.170
 have you see what is now the value of st 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.810
 and here I clicked on the mouse now see 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.840
 it increases ie 2,400 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.000
 shows I add up to 800 that is or 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.280
 before 1600 it is cool 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.700
 Who would not say that to me? 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:07.120
 like well or what else are you here 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.760
 tell honestly the quality of the material 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.319
 it is all done very well there is no jacket 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.930
 Such gloss which very often many 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.190
 annoys me but let's say minimalism and 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.600
 although here I would not say that it is 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.970
 minimalist so it glows like 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.610
 Christmas tree and let's say 9 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:26.150
 programmable buttons also have a fashion in 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:28.000
 the keyboard that is, well, the bottom sausage 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.009
 minimalist well such here 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.680
 upgraded new keyboard without 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:36.560
 strong super uber frills that you 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.030
 love to see me here 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.210
 fits the only thing that bothered me 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.710
 again, they have a thick cord 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.800
 I can not say anything about this 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.660
 but he did not say that is the only sheathed 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.160
 minus because if you are an amateur 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.320
 drive your keyboard somewhere 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.910
 keep it neatly away from 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.729
 some sharp objects because 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.009
 Immediately comes a layer of cord although very strong 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.870
 thick i mean write about it your 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:02.330
 cameras of my my comments what are you 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.070
 generally think about it and honestly 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.690
 I liked the lights here, I don't know 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.340
 although I used to choose all the time 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.960
 the keyboard did not pay attention to it but 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.180
 if your keyboard is on top 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.840
 my desk is now below 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:17.150
 hidden then the glowing keyboard is 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.460
 ice is very cool so guys 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.099
 think write in the comments as you 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.800
 even this model 910 is it strong 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:27.380
 surpassed its predecessors 710 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.900
 like that or you still expected 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.000
 something bigger also with us 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.960

 there is such a certain rod like 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.930
 other boards cause some kind of entity 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.610
