00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.329 

well<00:00:01.860> here's<00:00:02.310> the<00:00:02.490> microphone<00:00:02.730> in<00:00:03.210> question<00:00:03.750> I

00:00:04.329 --> 00:00:04.339 
well here's the microphone in question I

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:07.579 
well here's the microphone in question I
haven't<00:00:05.339> hooked<00:00:05.460> up<00:00:05.990> as<00:00:06.990> you<00:00:07.140> can<00:00:07.290> hear<00:00:07.470> the

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
haven't hooked up as you can hear the

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.100 
haven't hooked up as you can hear the
speakers<00:00:08.099> and<00:00:09.170> the<00:00:10.170> problem<00:00:10.559> is<00:00:11.599> 60<00:00:12.599> cycle<00:00:13.080> hum

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
speakers and the problem is 60 cycle hum

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.300 
speakers and the problem is 60 cycle hum
which<00:00:14.330> hopefully<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:15.509> can<00:00:15.719> hear<00:00:16.049> if<00:00:16.170> not<00:00:16.410> you

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
which hopefully you can hear if not you

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.330 
which hopefully you can hear if not you
can<00:00:17.490> see<00:00:17.730> it<00:00:17.850> on<00:00:17.970> this<00:00:18.180> meter<00:00:18.800> shows<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.830> minus

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
can see it on this meter shows a minus

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.060 
can see it on this meter shows a minus
20<00:00:21.949> right<00:00:22.949> there<00:00:23.900> and<00:00:24.900> if<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.170> touch<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.830> body

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
20 right there and if I touch the body

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.160 
20 right there and if I touch the body
of<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.430> microphone<00:00:28.490> the<00:00:29.490> hum<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:30.449> diminished

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
of the microphone the hum is diminished

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.150 
of the microphone the hum is diminished
and<00:00:31.529> almost<00:00:32.369> goes<00:00:32.610> away<00:00:33.739> I'm<00:00:34.739> gonna<00:00:34.920> turn<00:00:35.040> the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
and almost goes away I'm gonna turn the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.889 
and almost goes away I'm gonna turn the
speaker's<00:00:35.610> down<00:00:37.520> all<00:00:38.520> right<00:00:41.629> what<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.780> the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
speaker's down all right what is the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.470 
speaker's down all right what is the
problem<00:00:43.969> one<00:00:44.969> more<00:00:45.239> symptom<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:47.480> without

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
problem one more symptom is that without

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.660 
problem one more symptom is that without
touching<00:00:50.449> if<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.690> move<00:00:51.989> my<00:00:52.020> hand<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.920> front<00:00:53.430> of

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
touching if I move my hand in front of

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:02.060 
touching if I move my hand in front of
the<00:00:53.730> microphone<00:00:57.530> you'll<00:00:58.530> see<00:00:58.859> that<00:01:01.070> signal

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
the microphone you'll see that signal

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.420 
the microphone you'll see that signal
went<00:01:02.250> up<00:01:02.370> that's<00:01:02.989> that<00:01:03.989> same<00:01:04.260> 60<00:01:04.860> cycle<00:01:05.400> hum

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
went up that's that same 60 cycle hum

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.100 
went up that's that same 60 cycle hum
okay

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.399 

everybody<00:01:10.110> had<00:01:10.290> done<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.369> do<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.880> too

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
everybody had done this I do it too

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.580 
everybody had done this I do it too
well<00:01:13.409> let's<00:01:13.920> make<00:01:14.130> sure<00:01:14.360> we<00:01:15.360> have<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.600> ground<00:01:15.900> in

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
well let's make sure we have a ground in

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.030 
well let's make sure we have a ground in
the<00:01:17.189> case<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.939> microphone<00:01:21.290> very<00:01:22.290> very<00:01:22.860> low

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
the case of the microphone very very low

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.890 
the case of the microphone very very low
point<00:01:23.490> for<00:01:23.670> ohms<00:01:24.710> and<00:01:25.710> then<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.250> thought<00:01:26.520> well

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
point for ohms and then I thought well

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.600 
point for ohms and then I thought well
let's<00:01:27.900> make<00:01:28.080> sure<00:01:28.140> all<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.890> metal<00:01:29.159> parts<00:01:29.189> are

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
let's make sure all the metal parts are

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.100 
let's make sure all the metal parts are
grounded<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.170> stuck<00:01:31.530> my<00:01:31.710> probe<00:01:32.009> on<00:01:32.250> the

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
grounded and so I stuck my probe on the

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:39.710 
grounded and so I stuck my probe on the
windscreen<00:01:34.250> and<00:01:37.040> yeah<00:01:38.040> let<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:39.060> read<00:01:39.479> pretty

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
windscreen and yeah let it read pretty

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.770 
windscreen and yeah let it read pretty
low<00:01:40.909> you<00:01:41.909> know<00:01:42.150> see<00:01:43.079> if<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.290> other<00:01:43.439> side<00:01:44.780> you

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
low you know see if the other side you

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.380 
low you know see if the other side you
know<00:01:45.869> they're<00:01:46.380> all<00:01:46.560> pretty<00:01:46.860> low<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.490> what's

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
know they're all pretty low so what's

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.820 
know they're all pretty low so what's
the<00:01:48.540> problem

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
the problem

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.950 
the problem
well<00:01:50.580> when<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.570> touched<00:01:52.440> my<00:01:52.680> probe<00:01:52.980> to

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
well when I touched my probe to

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.410 
well when I touched my probe to
windscreen<00:01:55.250> and<00:01:56.250> as<00:01:56.700> I'm<00:01:56.880> doing<00:01:57.090> right<00:01:57.210> now

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
windscreen and as I'm doing right now

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.550 
windscreen and as I'm doing right now
very<00:01:58.020> lightly<00:01:59.270> as<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.510> see<00:02:00.750> there<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.170> no

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
very lightly as you see there is no

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.880 
very lightly as you see there is no
resistance<00:02:02.010> I<00:02:02.990> assumed<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.350> was<00:02:04.590> just<00:02:04.800> not

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
resistance I assumed that I was just not

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.790 
resistance I assumed that I was just not
getting<00:02:05.400> a<00:02:05.610> good<00:02:05.790> connection<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:06.750> what<00:02:07.500> you

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
getting a good connection so what you

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.730 
getting a good connection so what you
normally<00:02:08.010> do<00:02:08.400> is<00:02:08.430> press<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.060> little<00:02:09.270> harder<00:02:09.740> and

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
normally do is press a little harder and

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.220 
normally do is press a little harder and
when<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.070> do<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.670> get<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:12.180> lower<00:02:12.540> resistance

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
when you do you get a lower resistance

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.010 
when you do you get a lower resistance
this<00:02:14.100> is<00:02:14.160> conductive<00:02:14.970> paint<00:02:16.220> you<00:02:17.220> do<00:02:17.430> not<00:02:18.020> have

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
this is conductive paint you do not have

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.370 
this is conductive paint you do not have
to<00:02:19.290> press<00:02:19.560> hard<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:21.150> get<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.390> connection<00:02:22.140> just

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
to press hard to get a connection just

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.030 
to press hard to get a connection just
laying<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.610> probe<00:02:23.850> against<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:24.770> without<00:02:25.770> any

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
laying the probe against it without any

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.830 
laying the probe against it without any
pressure<00:02:26.780> but<00:02:27.780> when<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.110> do<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.560> on<00:02:28.740> this<00:02:28.920> one

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
pressure but when I do that on this one

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.490 
pressure but when I do that on this one
mmm<00:02:30.900> no<00:02:31.770> resistance<00:02:32.750> so<00:02:33.750> what<00:02:33.960> had<00:02:34.080> happened

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
mmm no resistance so what had happened

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.780 
mmm no resistance so what had happened
somewhere<00:02:35.100> a<00:02:35.160> long<00:02:35.340> way<00:02:35.990> this<00:02:37.520> had<00:02:38.520> gotten

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
somewhere a long way this had gotten

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:46.750 
somewhere a long way this had gotten
knocked<00:02:39.450> loose<00:02:40.190> and<00:02:43.160> without<00:02:44.160> this<00:02:44.670> screen<00:02:45.500> as

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
knocked loose and without this screen as

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.930 
knocked loose and without this screen as
you<00:02:47.760> can<00:02:47.970> see<00:02:48.210> that<00:02:49.100> element<00:02:50.100> of<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.550> large

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
you can see that element of a large

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.550 
you can see that element of a large
condenser<00:02:51.510> mic<00:02:51.720> is<00:02:52.640> just<00:02:53.640> going<00:02:53.850> crazy<00:02:54.560> and

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
condenser mic is just going crazy and

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.050 
condenser mic is just going crazy and
with<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.890> screen<00:02:56.190> in<00:02:56.489> place<00:02:56.760> but<00:02:57.000> not

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
with the screen in place but not

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.990 
with the screen in place but not
grounded<00:02:57.750> what<00:02:58.170> happens<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.700> screen

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
grounded what happens is the screen

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.180 
grounded what happens is the screen
itself<00:03:00.390> begins<00:03:00.690> to<00:03:00.930> pick<00:03:01.110> up<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.410> charge<00:03:01.739> based

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
itself begins to pick up a charge based

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.210 
itself begins to pick up a charge based
on<00:03:02.520> the<00:03:02.790> 60<00:03:03.270> cycles<00:03:03.810> that's<00:03:04.020> just<00:03:04.260> in<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.739> air

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
on the 60 cycles that's just in the air

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.330 
on the 60 cycles that's just in the air
all<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.580> time<00:03:05.820> and<00:03:06.500> induce<00:03:07.500> it<00:03:07.739> into<00:03:08.100> the

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
all the time and induce it into the
