00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
gravel rides having st. 70 speed so it's

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.900 
gravel rides having st. 70 speed so it's
how<00:01:23.530> fast<00:01:23.590> we<00:01:24.040> were<00:01:24.130> going<00:01:24.370> on<00:01:24.520> something<00:01:24.820> like

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
how fast we were going on something like

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.750 
how fast we were going on something like
this<00:01:25.290> Dean<00:01:26.290> on<00:01:26.470> this<00:01:26.620> some<00:01:26.830> gravel<00:01:27.250> surface<00:01:27.460> we

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
this Dean on this some gravel surface we

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.800

drives<00:01:53.500> I<00:01:53.860> say<00:01:54.490> that<00:01:54.610> they<00:01:54.729> shouldn't<00:01:54.909> be<00:01:55.000> on

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
found something a little challenging for

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.150 
found something a little challenging for
us<00:02:12.299> what<00:02:13.299> lies<00:02:13.510> ahead<00:02:13.720> yeah<00:02:14.709> then<00:02:14.920> we're<00:02:15.069> going

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
us what lies ahead yeah then we're going

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.770 
us what lies ahead yeah then we're going
to<00:02:15.220> have<00:02:15.370> a<00:02:15.400> look<00:02:15.519> at<00:02:15.670> driving<00:02:16.209> up<00:02:16.420> this<00:02:16.540> hill

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
to have a look at driving up this hill

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.650 
to have a look at driving up this hill
but<00:02:17.620> first<00:02:18.100> safety<00:02:18.400> tip<00:02:18.700> of<00:02:18.910> before<00:02:19.420> we<00:02:19.510> got

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
but first safety tip of before we got

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.690 
but first safety tip of before we got
there<00:02:19.810> like<00:02:20.019> this<00:02:20.140> is<00:02:20.410> always<00:02:20.620> a<00:02:20.799> walk<00:02:21.370> of<00:02:21.519> it

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
there like this is always a walk of it

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.850 
there like this is always a walk of it
basically<00:02:22.630> you<00:02:22.780> can<00:02:22.989> walk<00:02:23.290> through<00:02:23.319> water

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
basically you can walk through water

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.410 
basically you can walk through water
walk<00:02:24.190> up<00:02:24.400> hills<00:02:24.640> what<00:02:24.880> that's<00:02:25.030> what<00:02:25.150> i<00:02:25.239> bought

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
walk up hills what that's what i bought

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.240 
walk up hills what that's what i bought
the<00:02:25.630> full<00:02:25.810> wheel<00:02:25.989> drawing<00:02:26.319> tools<00:02:26.530> right<00:02:26.860> but

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
the full wheel drawing tools right but

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.250 
the full wheel drawing tools right but
we're<00:02:27.489> gonna<00:02:27.580> be<00:02:27.730> safe<00:02:27.910> yeah<00:02:28.209> and<00:02:28.360> basically

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
we're gonna be safe yeah and basically

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.320 
we're gonna be safe yeah and basically
one<00:02:30.220> of<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.400> golden<00:02:30.700> rules<00:02:30.910> if<00:02:31.030> you<00:02:31.120> can't

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
one of the golden rules if you can't

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.030 
one of the golden rules if you can't
walk<00:02:31.480> up<00:02:31.690> it<00:02:31.870> you<00:02:32.110> probably<00:02:32.380> won't<00:02:32.739> be<00:02:32.830> able<00:02:32.860> to

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
walk up it you probably won't be able to

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.009 
walk up it you probably won't be able to
drive<00:02:33.160> up<00:02:33.400> ok<00:02:33.819> I'll<00:02:34.060> handle<00:02:34.390> it<00:02:34.480> with<00:02:34.630> my<00:02:34.780> coop

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
drive up ok I'll handle it with my coop

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.740 
drive up ok I'll handle it with my coop
arrestees<00:02:35.560> yes<00:02:35.890> it<00:02:36.100> was<00:02:36.220> wet<00:02:36.489> yes<00:02:37.209> I<00:02:37.239> suspect

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
arrestees yes it was wet yes I suspect

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.449 
arrestees yes it was wet yes I suspect
you'd<00:02:37.930> have<00:02:38.080> a<00:02:38.110> few<00:02:38.350> from<00:02:38.500> yeah<00:02:38.709> this<00:02:38.920> vehicles

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
you'd have a few from yeah this vehicles

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.580 
you'd have a few from yeah this vehicles
actually<00:02:39.819> got<00:02:39.970> a<00:02:40.480> highway<00:02:40.989> type<00:02:41.230> 4-wheel

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
actually got a highway type 4-wheel

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.960 
actually got a highway type 4-wheel
Drive<00:02:41.769> tire<00:02:42.010> so<00:02:42.280> it's<00:02:42.400> more<00:02:42.549> suited<00:02:42.940> to

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
Drive tire so it's more suited to

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.210 
Drive tire so it's more suited to
highway<00:02:43.780> you<00:02:43.959> some<00:02:44.200> assume<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:45.010> scene

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
highway you some assume and the scene

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.569 
highway you some assume and the scene
that's<00:02:45.670> right<00:02:45.880> so<00:02:47.040> particularly<00:02:48.040> in<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.370> wet

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
that's right so particularly in the wet

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.220 
that's right so particularly in the wet
with<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.120> highway<00:02:49.450> type<00:02:49.660> type<00:02:49.900> might

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
with the highway type type might

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.620 
with the highway type type might
struggle<00:02:50.440> a<00:02:50.709> bit<00:02:50.739> but<00:02:51.340> a<00:02:51.700> all<00:02:52.030> terrain<00:02:52.390> tire

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
struggle a bit but a all terrain tire

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.720 
struggle a bit but a all terrain tire

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
would like the Cooper's yeah would be

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.300 
would like the Cooper's yeah would be
