much much more rings than you do at
lower<00:01:12.960> stronghold<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:13.590> just<00:01:13.770> because<00:01:13.890> you're

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
lower stronghold so just because you're

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.649 
lower stronghold so just because you're
seeing<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.820> know<00:01:14.909> maybe<00:01:15.119> if<00:01:15.270> you're<00:01:15.420> seeing

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
seeing you know maybe if you're seeing

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.539 
seeing you know maybe if you're seeing
six<00:01:15.930> rings<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.560> attack<00:01:16.860> at<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.340> lower

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
six rings and attack at a lower

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.760 
six rings and attack at a lower
stronghold<00:01:18.090> doesn't<00:01:18.540> exactly<00:01:18.840> equate<00:01:19.740> to

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
stronghold doesn't exactly equate to

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.030 
stronghold doesn't exactly equate to
what<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.369> higher<00:01:20.790> stronghold<00:01:21.299> would<00:01:21.450> say<00:01:21.600> now

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
what a higher stronghold would say now

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.950 
what a higher stronghold would say now
you<00:01:23.040> know<00:01:23.159> there<00:01:23.430> needs<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.790> be<00:01:23.820> some<00:01:24.270> sort<00:01:24.810> of

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
you know there needs to be some sort of

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.690 
you know there needs to be some sort of
difference<00:01:25.380> where<00:01:25.560> people<00:01:25.860> who<00:01:25.950> are<00:01:26.130> higher

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
difference where people who are higher

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.249 
difference where people who are higher
level<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.270> game<00:01:27.330> compared<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.049> lower

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
level in the game compared to the lower

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.170 
level in the game compared to the lower
level<00:01:28.650> obviously<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:29.369> shouldn't<00:01:29.790> be<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.909> same

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
level obviously it shouldn't be the same

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.140 
level obviously it shouldn't be the same
rewards<00:01:30.600> but<00:01:30.920> comparing<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.369> let's<00:01:32.939> take<00:01:33.090> a

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
a little bit walking out so it's only

a little bit walking out so it's only
the<00:02:53.500> first<00:02:53.680> week<00:02:53.980> so<00:02:54.310> i'm<00:02:54.610> sure<00:02:54.940> they're<00:02:55.150> still

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
the first week so i'm sure they're still

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.270 
the first week so i'm sure they're still

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830

rewards<00:02:59.950> next<00:03:00.520> week<00:03:00.640> I<00:03:00.820> don't<00:03:01.000> know<00:03:01.120> because

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
rewards next week I don't know because

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.060 
rewards next week I don't know because
this<00:03:01.630> is<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.840> first<00:03:01.870> we've<00:03:02.410> seen<00:03:02.620> of<00:03:02.770> this<00:03:02.860> and

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
this is the first we've seen of this and

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.870 
this is the first we've seen of this and
I<00:03:03.820> don't<00:03:04.810> mean<00:03:04.870> to<00:03:04.989> come<00:03:05.110> off<00:03:05.140> as<00:03:05.410> blood<00:03:05.650> when<00:03:06.430> a

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
I don't mean to come off as blood when a

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.170 
I don't mean to come off as blood when a
man<00:03:07.690> a<00:03:07.720> leader<00:03:08.290> does<00:03:08.560> it<00:03:08.950> go<00:03:09.130> like<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:09.489> way<00:03:09.640> but

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
man a leader does it go like the way but

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.940 
man a leader does it go like the way but
it's<00:03:10.510> just<00:03:10.810> my<00:03:10.959> opinion<00:03:11.320> I<00:03:11.440> think<00:03:11.470> thirty

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
it's just my opinion I think thirty

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.729 
it's just my opinion I think thirty
thousand<00:03:12.430> gold<00:03:12.580> is<00:03:12.850> quite<00:03:13.600> low<00:03:13.870> for<00:03:14.230> reward

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
thousand gold is quite low for reward
