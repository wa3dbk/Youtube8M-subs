 close 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.619
 look from my house I think because I 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.570
 am 14 so I have to take it easy 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.090
 with the stuff i'm going to be my teammate a7 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.960
 and give chestplate you do here you have 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.490
 a chestplate 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.229
 I also mean that of course and has 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.250
 no helmet i don't know i just got kicked 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.289
 just then him 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.780
 okay what I mentioned usually already 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.039
 almost exactly as low as and so 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.479
 we will continue 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.099
 let's go let's have a look here is 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.599
 shit is for nothing this is through 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.670
 teams from when indeed they have 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.099
 with the theory of it and chilled 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.959
 there is another team of 2 and you can 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.180
 Renzo also see who had also 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.829
 lives or how many teams live a day 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.810
 I almost see it would almost be there alone 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.459
 amateurs of two this was a pity 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.400
 b best that this is all team of 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.329
 so its a bit easier of course 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.349
 so I still have to be careful because 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.790
 are nobility teams 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.260
 so I still snubbed things 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.860
 can be what i now so with this best 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.750
 dangerous 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.890
 you only see we there people throne there 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.650
 it will break life 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.610
 oh no he picks it up shit oh 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.190
 it's a pity 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.450
 ok i just kick a bit shit 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.549
 take a turk on the well i don't know if 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.410

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.549

 maybe maybe a wet suit is on 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.260
 a wet suit is indeed broken handy 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.690
 so that course the go well pay attention 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.760
 whether the wet head is easy is real 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.040

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.470
 Mama that that can be broken handy 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.269
