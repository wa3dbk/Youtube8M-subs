you don't have to be perfect we're just
going<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.680> mark<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.460> little<00:01:29.579> spot<00:01:29.939> where<00:01:30.780> we

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
going to mark a little spot where we

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.880

going<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.009> mark<00:01:41.250> with<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.640> other<00:01:41.790> side<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.180> the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
going to mark with the other side of the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.330 
going to mark with the other side of the
spoon<00:01:42.659> where<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.259> want<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.860> come<00:01:44.040> through

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
spoon where I want this to come through

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.840

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
twisting it to make a circle and you

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.350 
twisting it to make a circle and you
could<00:01:58.799> use<00:01:59.040> if<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.369> wanted<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.820> like<00:02:00.030> grab<00:02:00.299> a

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
or screw or something to make that hole

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.930 
or screw or something to make that hole
as<00:02:06.509> big<00:02:07.409> as<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.649> want<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:07.979> be<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.459> then<00:02:08.910> you

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
as big as you want it to be and then you

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.339 
as big as you want it to be and then you
can<00:02:09.209> just<00:02:09.390> sort<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.629> force<00:02:09.869> your<00:02:10.050> spoon

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
can just sort of force your spoon

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.850 
can just sort of force your spoon
through

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.259 

there<00:02:14.860> we<00:02:14.920> go<00:02:15.069> so<00:02:15.579> we're<00:02:15.670> gonna<00:02:15.730> put<00:02:15.939> our<00:02:16.030> spin

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
there we go so we're gonna put our spin

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.670 
there we go so we're gonna put our spin
through<00:02:16.510> you<00:02:16.689> want<00:02:16.840> your<00:02:16.959> spoon<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.379> kind<00:02:17.560> of

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
through you want your spoon to kind of

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.130 
through you want your spoon to kind of
sit<00:02:17.950> at<00:02:18.099> an<00:02:18.220> angle<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:18.819> want<00:02:19.450> it<00:02:19.569> to<00:02:19.689> tilt<00:02:19.930> down

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
sit at an angle you want it to tilt down

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.330 
sit at an angle you want it to tilt down
a<00:02:20.200> little<00:02:20.500> bit<00:02:20.650> more<00:02:20.860> than<00:02:21.010> we<00:02:21.069> did<00:02:21.189> on<00:02:21.310> that

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
a little bit more than we did on that

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.160 
a little bit more than we did on that
one<00:02:21.700> so<00:02:21.939> we'll<00:02:22.090> work<00:02:22.239> harder<00:02:22.629> on<00:02:22.659> the<00:02:22.840> bottom

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
one so we'll work harder on the bottom

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.899 
one so we'll work harder on the bottom
one<00:02:23.379> to<00:02:23.950> make<00:02:24.099> sure<00:02:24.129> that<00:02:24.370> it<00:02:24.459> tilts<00:02:24.730> forward

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
one to make sure that it tilts forward

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:26.610 
one to make sure that it tilts forward
because<00:02:25.269> we<00:02:25.390> want<00:02:25.569> the<00:02:25.689> seed<00:02:25.989> to<00:02:26.260> actually

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
because we want the seed to actually

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.680 
because we want the seed to actually
spill<00:02:26.950> through<00:02:27.189> into<00:02:27.579> the<00:02:27.670> spoon<00:02:27.940> so<00:02:28.659> that

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
spill through into the spoon so that

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.780 
spill through into the spoon so that
serves<00:02:29.409> as<00:02:29.709> the<00:02:29.890> spot<00:02:30.129> where<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.430> birds<00:02:30.610> are

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
serves as the spot where the birds are

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.309 
serves as the spot where the birds are
going<00:02:30.879> to<00:02:30.970> be<00:02:31.060> able<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.269> eat<00:02:31.450> I'm<00:02:32.049> going<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.260> go

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
going to be able to eat I'm going to go

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.830 
going to be able to eat I'm going to go
on<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.530> other<00:02:32.680> side<00:02:32.829> here<00:02:33.569> because<00:02:34.569> we<00:02:34.690> want

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
on the other side here because we want

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.530 
on the other side here because we want
to<00:02:34.930> make<00:02:35.019> sure<00:02:35.049> that<00:02:35.319> this<00:02:35.470> is<00:02:35.650> balanced<00:02:36.280> and

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
to make sure that this is balanced and

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.880 
to make sure that this is balanced and
that<00:02:37.540> it'll<00:02:37.690> hang<00:02:37.930> straight<00:02:38.200> so<00:02:38.470> all<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.680> seed

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
that it'll hang straight so all the seed

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.069 
that it'll hang straight so all the seed
doesn't<00:02:39.129> spill<00:02:39.489> out<00:02:39.519> so<00:02:40.510> I'm<00:02:40.569> going<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:40.750> cut<00:02:40.930> my

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
doesn't spill out so I'm going to cut my

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.160 
doesn't spill out so I'm going to cut my
hole<00:02:41.290> here<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:41.829> I<00:02:42.790> want<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.540> make<00:02:43.810> sure<00:02:43.840> on

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
hole here and I want to make sure on

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.339 
hole here and I want to make sure on
this<00:02:44.349> one<00:02:44.459> that<00:02:45.459> I<00:02:45.549> get<00:02:45.730> my<00:02:45.879> spoon<00:02:46.180> tilted<00:02:46.810> to

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
this one that I get my spoon tilted to

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:48.360 
this one that I get my spoon tilted to
where<00:02:47.470> it's<00:02:47.590> going<00:02:47.680> to<00:02:47.739> come<00:02:47.799> down<00:02:48.129> a<00:02:48.159> little

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
where it's going to come down a little

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.979 
where it's going to come down a little
bit<00:02:48.549> more<00:02:48.790> so<00:02:49.329> I'm<00:02:49.420> going<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.569> come<00:02:49.750> up<00:02:49.870> a

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
bit more so I'm going to come up a

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.720 
bit more so I'm going to come up a
little<00:02:50.019> higher<00:02:50.620> on<00:02:50.650> this<00:02:51.069> one<00:02:51.280> just<00:02:51.459> kind<00:02:51.639> of

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
little higher on this one just kind of

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.149 
little higher on this one just kind of
go<00:02:51.849> on<00:02:51.879> an<00:02:52.329> angle<00:02:52.930> I'm<00:02:53.650> going<00:02:53.829> to<00:02:53.889> cut<00:02:54.040> another

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
go on an angle I'm going to cut another

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:59.399 
go on an angle I'm going to cut another
hole<00:02:54.400> here<00:02:56.010> okay<00:02:57.870> really<00:02:58.870> simple<00:02:59.170> see

00:02:59.399 --> 00:02:59.409 
hole here okay really simple see

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:01.619 
hole here okay really simple see
completely<00:03:00.220> not<00:03:00.489> perfect<00:03:00.940> it<00:03:01.180> doesn't<00:03:01.510> have

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
completely not perfect it doesn't have

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:03.420 
completely not perfect it doesn't have
to<00:03:01.750> look<00:03:01.900> great<00:03:02.139> the<00:03:02.290> birds<00:03:02.530> won't<00:03:03.220> know<00:03:03.310> the

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
to look great the birds won't know the

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.399 
to look great the birds won't know the
difference<00:03:03.459> and<00:03:03.849> they<00:03:03.940> won't<00:03:04.120> care<00:03:04.319> so<00:03:05.319> I'm

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
difference and they won't care so I'm

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:09.930 
difference and they won't care so I'm
going<00:03:05.560> to<00:03:05.620> slide<00:03:05.829> that<00:03:06.069> through<00:03:08.159> maybe<00:03:09.159> there

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
going to slide that through maybe there

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.819 
going to slide that through maybe there
you<00:03:10.000> go<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:10.810> you<00:03:11.049> can<00:03:11.200> see<00:03:11.319> that<00:03:11.470> this<00:03:11.620> one's

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
you go and you can see that this one's

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.530 
you go and you can see that this one's
hanging<00:03:11.980> kind<00:03:12.459> of<00:03:12.549> a<00:03:12.670> little<00:03:13.090> bit<00:03:13.209> of<00:03:13.299> an<00:03:13.389> angle

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
hanging kind of a little bit of an angle

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.119 
hanging kind of a little bit of an angle
so<00:03:14.079> we're<00:03:14.349> going<00:03:14.440> to<00:03:14.500> take<00:03:14.650> this<00:03:14.799> one<00:03:14.980> and

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
so we're going to take this one and

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.670 
so we're going to take this one and
actually<00:03:15.280> just<00:03:15.669> switch<00:03:15.940> it<00:03:15.970> around<00:03:16.650> so<00:03:17.650> that

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
actually just switch it around so that

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.949 
actually just switch it around so that
we<00:03:17.949> have<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.639> angle<00:03:18.970> coming<00:03:19.120> down<00:03:19.449> there<00:03:19.870> we

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
we have the angle coming down there we

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:20.220 
we have the angle coming down there we
go

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
go

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.349 
go
so<00:03:20.859> now<00:03:20.980> we've<00:03:21.099> got<00:03:21.310> both<00:03:21.430> spoons<00:03:21.819> placed<00:03:22.150> in

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
so now we've got both spoons placed in

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:23.759 
so now we've got both spoons placed in
you<00:03:22.510> see<00:03:22.660> that<00:03:22.690> they're<00:03:22.930> a<00:03:22.959> little<00:03:23.109> bit<00:03:23.349> of<00:03:23.470> an

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
you see that they're a little bit of an

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.379 
you see that they're a little bit of an
angle<00:03:24.160> because<00:03:24.519> what<00:03:24.760> we<00:03:24.879> want<00:03:25.120> to<00:03:25.180> have

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.389 
angle because what we want to have

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:27.360 
angle because what we want to have
happen<00:03:25.720> is<00:03:25.810> when<00:03:25.959> we<00:03:25.989> put<00:03:26.169> the<00:03:26.290> seed<00:03:26.530> in<00:03:26.560> it's

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
happen is when we put the seed in it's

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.860 
happen is when we put the seed in it's
actually<00:03:27.549> going<00:03:27.849> to<00:03:27.940> slide<00:03:28.209> down<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.599> handle

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
actually going to slide down the handle

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.750 
actually going to slide down the handle
of<00:03:28.959> the<00:03:29.049> spoon<00:03:29.169> and<00:03:29.620> sit<00:03:30.190> right<00:03:30.340> in<00:03:30.549> the<00:03:30.639> base

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
of the spoon and sit right in the base

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.430 
of the spoon and sit right in the base
of<00:03:30.819> the<00:03:31.030> spoon<00:03:31.239> here<00:03:31.510> and<00:03:31.720> then<00:03:32.139> the<00:03:32.290> other

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
of the spoon here and then the other

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.589 
of the spoon here and then the other
side<00:03:32.799> gives<00:03:33.129> the<00:03:33.310> bird<00:03:33.489> a<00:03:33.519> nice<00:03:34.150> little<00:03:34.329> perch

twine that we had you could use ribbon
you<00:04:28.990> could<00:04:29.139> use<00:04:29.379> yarn<00:04:29.800> really<00:04:30.310> anything<00:04:30.610> that

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
in half and it just attached it to the

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.320 
in half and it just attached it to the
side<00:05:35.979> I<00:05:36.009> used<00:05:36.310> a<00:05:36.460> little<00:05:36.669> bit<00:05:36.759> of<00:05:36.940> hot<00:05:37.300> glue

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
side I used a little bit of hot glue

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.760 
side I used a little bit of hot glue
there<00:05:37.750> just<00:05:37.990> to<00:05:38.050> make<00:05:38.110> sure<00:05:38.199> that<00:05:38.469> the<00:05:38.590> lid

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
there just to make sure that the lid

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.529 
there just to make sure that the lid
stayed<00:05:39.039> on<00:05:39.219> so<00:05:39.819> that<00:05:39.969> gives<00:05:40.180> them<00:05:40.330> a<00:05:40.389> little

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:40.539 
stayed on so that gives them a little

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:42.420 
stayed on so that gives them a little
bit<00:05:40.690> of<00:05:40.779> perch<00:05:41.199> and<00:05:41.529> you<00:05:41.979> could<00:05:42.129> just<00:05:42.279> hang

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
bit of perch and you could just hang

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.829 
bit of perch and you could just hang
that<00:05:42.460> from<00:05:42.699> a<00:05:42.849> tree<00:05:43.089> or<00:05:43.270> you<00:05:43.389> can<00:05:43.509> even<00:05:43.659> just

00:05:43.829 --> 00:05:43.839 
that from a tree or you can even just

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:45.809 
that from a tree or you can even just
sit<00:05:44.080> it<00:05:44.199> somewhere<00:05:44.529> on<00:05:44.589> your<00:05:44.860> porch<00:05:45.099> and<00:05:45.400> that

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:45.819 
sit it somewhere on your porch and that

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:47.519 
sit it somewhere on your porch and that
would<00:05:45.969> give<00:05:46.089> the<00:05:46.210> birds<00:05:46.449> another<00:05:47.020> place<00:05:47.349> to

we used to stick at cut a small hole and

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:56.610 
we used to stick at cut a small hole and
just<00:05:54.789> use<00:05:54.940> that<00:05:55.120> for<00:05:55.330> a<00:05:55.360> perch<00:05:55.569> and<00:05:55.870> filled<00:05:56.500> it

just use that for a perch and filled it
with<00:05:56.650> seed<00:05:56.979> you<00:05:57.250> could<00:05:57.400> also<00:05:57.520> do<00:05:57.759> that<00:05:57.849> with

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:57.909 
with seed you could also do that with

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:00.059 
with seed you could also do that with
water<00:05:58.210> and<00:05:58.690> I<00:05:59.259> saw<00:05:59.440> something<00:05:59.770> under<00:05:59.889> the

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:00.069 
water and I saw something under the

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:01.140 
water and I saw something under the
other<00:06:00.219> day<00:06:00.430> that<00:06:00.460> I<00:06:00.669> thought<00:06:00.849> would<00:06:01.000> be<00:06:01.120> really

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
other day that I thought would be really

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.450 
other day that I thought would be really
cute<00:06:01.659> in<00:06:01.779> the<00:06:01.839> milk<00:06:02.020> carton<00:06:02.379> I<00:06:02.589> read<00:06:03.099> that<00:06:03.310> if

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
cute in the milk carton I read that if

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.610 
cute in the milk carton I read that if
you<00:06:03.610> put<00:06:03.909> water<00:06:04.120> and<00:06:04.300> some<00:06:04.659> orange<00:06:04.960> slices<00:06:05.080> in

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
you put water and some orange slices in

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.439 
you put water and some orange slices in
the<00:06:05.889> butterflies<00:06:06.279> will<00:06:06.520> come<00:06:06.699> so<00:06:07.270> I<00:06:07.300> thought

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:07.449 
the butterflies will come so I thought

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:08.969 
the butterflies will come so I thought
that<00:06:07.599> would<00:06:07.719> be<00:06:07.750> a<00:06:07.839> really<00:06:08.139> cool<00:06:08.440> thing<00:06:08.500> to<00:06:08.800> try
