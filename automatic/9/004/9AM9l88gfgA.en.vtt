00:00:04.269 --> 00:00:04.279 
so hi guys so on the orange orders and

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:07.070 
so hi guys so on the orange orders and
today<00:00:05.279> I<00:00:05.310> will<00:00:05.670> show<00:00:05.700> you<00:00:05.910> how<00:00:06.270> to<00:00:06.390> make<00:00:06.750> a

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
today I will show you how to make a

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.530 
today I will show you how to make a
wristband<00:00:07.830> of<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.550> shoelace<00:00:09.530> up<00:00:10.530> one<00:00:11.540> helps

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
wristband of a shoelace up one helps

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.519 
wristband of a shoelace up one helps
that<00:00:13.349> one<00:00:14.599> so<00:00:15.599> you're<00:00:15.839> gonna<00:00:15.990> need<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.139> shoelace

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
that one so you're gonna need a shoelace

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.859 
that one so you're gonna need a shoelace
and<00:00:17.779> processors<00:00:19.130> so<00:00:20.130> we're<00:00:20.850> gonna<00:00:21.000> do<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.720> you

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
and processors so we're gonna do is you

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.420 
and processors so we're gonna do is you
and<00:00:21.990> they're<00:00:22.080> like<00:00:22.230> tightness<00:00:22.830> or<00:00:22.980> something

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
and they're like tightness or something

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.689 
and they're like tightness or something
like<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.470> I've<00:00:25.470> got<00:00:25.710> my<00:00:25.830> drug<00:00:26.130> catch<00:00:26.490> glove

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
like that I've got my drug catch glove

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.390 
like that I've got my drug catch glove
and<00:00:26.939> all<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.390> you're<00:00:28.019> just<00:00:28.170> gonna<00:00:28.289> like<00:00:28.500> make

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
and all and you're just gonna like make

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.979 
and all and you're just gonna like make
a<00:00:29.460> loop<00:00:30.019> with<00:00:31.019> your<00:00:31.140> shoelace<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.619> then<00:00:32.369> pull

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
a loop with your shoelace and then pull

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.139 
a loop with your shoelace and then pull
the<00:00:33.989> rest<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.770> sea<00:00:34.890> ice<00:00:35.010> through<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:36.000> make

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
the rest of the sea ice through to make

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.790 
the rest of the sea ice through to make
another<00:00:36.750> loop<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:39.620> then<00:00:40.620> you're<00:00:40.770> just

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
another loop of that then you're just

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.260 
another loop of that then you're just
going<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.100> like<00:00:41.250> keep<00:00:41.430> pulling<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.879> shoelace

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
going to like keep pulling the shoelace

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.520 
going to like keep pulling the shoelace
through<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.629> loop<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:43.110> make<00:00:43.860> other<00:00:44.250> loops<00:00:45.530> all

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
through the loop to make other loops all

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.080 
through the loop to make other loops all
that<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.160> then<00:00:47.190> you're<00:00:47.700> just<00:00:47.730> gonna<00:00:47.879> keep

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
that and then you're just gonna keep

00:00:48.090 --> 00:01:09.680 
that and then you're just gonna keep
pulling<00:00:48.390> it

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.310 

this<00:01:10.690> takes<00:01:11.050> about<00:01:11.290> 10<00:01:11.860> minutes<00:01:12.960> little<00:01:13.960> slow

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
this takes about 10 minutes little slow

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.870 
this takes about 10 minutes little slow
Brooks<00:01:14.740> there<00:01:15.180> no<00:01:16.180> I<00:01:16.510> sound<00:01:16.870> like<00:01:16.930> a<00:01:17.020> read<00:01:17.320> on

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
Brooks there no I sound like a read on

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.970 
Brooks there no I sound like a read on
video<00:01:18.880> then<00:01:19.210> I'd<00:01:19.960> usually<00:01:20.170> like<00:01:20.470> edit<00:01:20.830> it

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 
video then I'd usually like edit it

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.510 
video then I'd usually like edit it
because<00:01:21.280> I<00:01:21.370> don't<00:01:21.520> think<00:01:21.970> to<00:01:22.300> software<00:01:23.520> just

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
because I don't think to software just

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:35.450 
because I don't think to software just
like<00:01:24.670> speed<00:01:25.060> up<00:01:25.240> and<00:01:25.480> then<00:01:25.570> I<00:01:25.690> music<00:01:26.080> to<00:01:26.230> it

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.380 

yeah<00:01:36.460> do<00:01:36.640> it<00:01:36.670> is<00:01:36.850> straightening<00:01:37.180> their<00:01:37.360> hair

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
yeah do it is straightening their hair

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.210 
yeah do it is straightening their hair
she<00:01:38.050> just<00:01:38.170> drop<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.650> wire<00:01:39.420> then<00:01:40.420> clubbing<00:01:41.220> I

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
she just drop the wire then clubbing I

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.410 
she just drop the wire then clubbing I
didn't<00:01:42.460> run<00:01:42.580> we've<00:01:42.820> got<00:01:42.970> let<00:01:43.120> you<00:01:43.240> look

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
didn't run we've got let you look

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.240 
didn't run we've got let you look
straight<00:01:43.660> ahead<00:01:43.690> and<00:01:44.200> then<00:01:44.710> once<00:01:45.130> you're

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
straight ahead and then once you're

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.650 
straight ahead and then once you're
finished<00:01:45.370> just<00:01:45.610> pull<00:01:45.970> the<00:01:46.120> string<00:01:46.450> all<00:01:46.600> the

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
finished just pull the string all the

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.150 
finished just pull the string all the
way<00:01:46.750> through<00:01:46.930> the<00:01:47.050> loop<00:01:47.260> and<00:01:47.500> it<00:01:47.650> just<00:01:47.920> tight

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
way through the loop and it just tight

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.719 
way through the loop and it just tight
pull<00:01:48.760> it<00:01:48.880> to<00:01:49.000> make<00:01:49.120> a<00:01:49.150> knot<00:01:49.480> and<00:01:49.720> then<00:01:50.580> you<00:01:51.580> just

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
pull it to make a knot and then you just

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.920 
pull it to make a knot and then you just
like<00:01:52.110> gonna<00:01:53.110> take<00:01:53.350> it<00:01:53.500> off<00:01:54.150> the<00:01:55.150> tested<00:01:55.780> or

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
like gonna take it off the tested or

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.170 
like gonna take it off the tested or
