this<00:00:15.309> year<00:00:15.490> my<00:00:15.639> apple<00:00:15.969> tree<00:00:16.150> is<00:00:16.209> doing<00:00:16.539> just<00:00:16.750> a

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
this year my apple tree is doing just a

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.200 
this year my apple tree is doing just a
crop<00:00:17.260> job<00:00:17.560> I<00:00:17.740> think<00:00:17.800> a<00:00:18.160> combination<00:00:19.000> of<00:00:19.090> the

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
crop job I think a combination of the

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.630 
crop job I think a combination of the
the<00:00:19.690> frost<00:00:20.380> we<00:00:20.650> had<00:00:20.890> there<00:00:21.190> we<00:00:21.340> had<00:00:21.490> that

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
the frost we had there we had that

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.640 
the frost we had there we had that
really<00:00:21.970> warm<00:00:22.210> weather<00:00:22.450> and<00:00:22.660> me<00:00:22.780> then<00:00:23.320> we<00:00:23.500> had

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
really warm weather and me then we had

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.040 
really warm weather and me then we had
the<00:00:23.800> the<00:00:24.040> frost<00:00:24.310> there<00:00:24.640> in<00:00:24.910> June<00:00:25.150> and<00:00:25.600> I<00:00:25.720> think

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
the the frost there in June and I think

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.140 
the the frost there in June and I think
it<00:00:26.230> killed<00:00:26.470> a<00:00:26.590> lot<00:00:26.740> of<00:00:26.770> the<00:00:27.010> blossoms<00:00:27.520> so<00:00:28.030> my

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
it killed a lot of the blossoms so my

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.490 
it killed a lot of the blossoms so my
apple<00:00:28.390> tree<00:00:28.540> didn't<00:00:28.840> get<00:00:28.960> a<00:00:28.990> lot<00:00:29.200> of<00:00:29.350> apples

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
apple tree didn't get a lot of apples

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.260 
apple tree didn't get a lot of apples
this<00:00:29.770> year<00:00:29.830> plus<00:00:30.190> the<00:00:30.250> chipmunks

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:32.829 
the apples that did develop the

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:34.020 
the apples that did develop the
Chipmunks<00:00:33.219> are<00:00:33.309> doing<00:00:33.520> a<00:00:33.550> great<00:00:33.700> job<00:00:33.760> at

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
Chipmunks are doing a great job at

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.500

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
falling off the tree I timed it just

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.669 
falling off the tree I timed it just
right

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
right

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:05.080 
right
all<00:02:03.679> I<00:02:03.830> could<00:02:04.009> imagine<00:02:04.220> the<00:02:04.549> people<00:02:04.819> have<00:02:04.970> been

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
all I could imagine the people have been

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.969 
all I could imagine the people have been
watching<00:02:05.270> this<00:02:05.569> tree<00:02:05.869> they're<00:02:06.530> gonna<00:02:06.679> drive

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
watching this tree they're gonna drive

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.800 
watching this tree they're gonna drive
by<00:02:07.159> today<00:02:07.220> enzyme<00:02:07.819> well<00:02:08.209> what<00:02:08.390> happened

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
by today enzyme well what happened

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:15.850 
by today enzyme well what happened
yesterday<00:02:09.440> was<00:02:09.769> full<00:02:10.009> apples<00:02:10.870> none<00:02:14.620> not<00:02:15.620> many

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
yesterday was full apples none not many

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.610 
yesterday was full apples none not many
apples<00:02:16.280> on<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.459> trees<00:02:16.819> though<00:02:17.090> I<00:02:17.420> had<00:02:18.049> all<00:02:18.410> the

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
apples on the trees though I had all the

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.890 
apples on the trees though I had all the
apple<00:02:18.950> trees<00:02:19.160> down<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.519> highway<00:02:19.940> are<00:02:20.390> in<00:02:20.810> the

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
apple trees down the highway are in the

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.449 
apple trees down the highway are in the
same<00:02:21.140> predicament<00:02:21.470> as<00:02:21.890> mine<00:02:22.100> at<00:02:22.310> home<00:02:22.630> there's

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
same predicament as mine at home there's

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.940 
same predicament as mine at home there's
not<00:02:25.459> a<00:02:25.489> lot<00:02:25.790> of<00:02:25.940> Apple<00:02:26.299> action<00:02:26.690> I<00:02:26.900> think<00:02:27.829> the

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
not a lot of Apple action I think the

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.000 
not a lot of Apple action I think the
frost<00:02:28.250> we<00:02:28.609> had<00:02:28.820> June<00:02:29.359> because<00:02:30.350> of<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:30.769> really

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
frost we had June because of that really

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.580 
frost we had June because of that really
warm<00:02:31.340> weather<00:02:31.579> we<00:02:31.790> had<00:02:32.140> screwed<00:02:33.140> everything

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
warm weather we had screwed everything

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.440 
warm weather we had screwed everything
up<00:02:33.859> losing<00:02:34.400> a<00:02:34.459> lot<00:02:34.640> of<00:02:34.670> apples<00:02:34.850> here<00:02:35.180> hitting

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
up losing a lot of apples here hitting

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.390 
up losing a lot of apples here hitting
the<00:02:35.570> ground<00:02:38.410> they're<00:02:39.410> not<00:02:39.560> really<00:02:39.739> big<00:02:40.010> apples

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
the ground they're not really big apples

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.430 
the ground they're not really big apples
but<00:02:40.489> they're<00:02:40.640> tasty<00:02:41.150> I<00:02:41.420> wish<00:02:42.049> I<00:02:42.140> brought<00:02:42.320> a

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
but they're tasty I wish I brought a

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.210 
but they're tasty I wish I brought a
bigger<00:02:42.620> ladder

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.870 

well<00:02:46.220> this<00:02:46.430> is<00:02:46.609> a<00:02:46.640> another<00:02:47.329> wild<00:02:48.260> apple<00:02:48.590> tree

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
well this is a another wild apple tree

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.080 
well this is a another wild apple tree
this<00:02:49.880> guy<00:02:50.150> that's<00:02:50.870> a<00:02:50.989> really<00:02:51.260> big<00:02:51.470> tree<00:02:51.769> and

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
this guy that's a really big tree and

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.229 
this guy that's a really big tree and
it's<00:02:53.090> normally<00:02:53.690> just<00:02:54.470> loaded<00:02:55.430> but<00:02:56.000> there's

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
it's normally just loaded but there's

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.140 
it's normally just loaded but there's
not<00:02:56.510> a<00:02:56.780> single<00:02:57.140> Apple<00:02:57.859> on<00:02:58.070> it<00:02:58.340> guys<00:02:58.579> this<00:02:58.910> year

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
not a single Apple on it guys this year

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.410 
not a single Apple on it guys this year
nothing<00:03:00.370> well

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.370 

there's<00:03:03.960> not<00:03:04.140> a<00:03:04.320> single<00:03:04.650> Apple<00:03:05.070> on<00:03:05.400> it<00:03:06.380> it's

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
there's not a single Apple on it it's

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:14.270 
there's not a single Apple on it it's
absolutely<00:03:09.020> zero<00:03:10.490> so<00:03:11.490> I<00:03:11.550> think<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.950> frost

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
absolutely zero so I think the frost

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.620 
absolutely zero so I think the frost
must<00:03:14.790> have<00:03:15.060> screwed<00:03:15.420> all<00:03:15.990> the<00:03:16.110> blossoms<00:03:16.350> up

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
must have screwed all the blossoms up

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.410 
must have screwed all the blossoms up
but<00:03:18.630> every<00:03:18.900> tree<00:03:19.230> on<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.130> road<00:03:20.340> that<00:03:20.910> one<00:03:21.180> tree

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
but every tree on the road that one tree

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.150 
but every tree on the road that one tree
I<00:03:21.450> just<00:03:21.570> picked<00:03:21.930> is<00:03:22.050> the<00:03:22.170> only<00:03:22.650> tree<00:03:22.950> that<00:03:23.130> I

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
I just picked is the only tree that I

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.650 
I just picked is the only tree that I
have<00:03:23.250> seen<00:03:23.550> apples<00:03:23.940> on<00:03:24.560> in<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:26.220> whole<00:03:26.660> road

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
have seen apples on in the whole road

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.740 
have seen apples on in the whole road
from<00:03:28.050> you<00:03:28.440> know<00:03:28.530> from<00:03:28.740> town<00:03:29.160> to<00:03:29.190> my<00:03:29.880> house<00:03:30.060> but

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
from you know from town to my house but

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.110 
from you know from town to my house but
it's<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.140> only<00:03:31.260> tree<00:03:31.740> that's<00:03:31.980> high<00:03:32.280> these<00:03:32.760> all

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
it's the only tree that's high these all

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.060 
it's the only tree that's high these all
the<00:03:33.270> other<00:03:33.390> trees<00:03:33.690> are<00:03:33.959> actually<00:03:34.590> in<00:03:34.650> valleys

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
the other trees are actually in valleys

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.620 
the other trees are actually in valleys
so<00:03:35.430> which<00:03:35.610> would<00:03:35.760> make<00:03:35.910> sense<00:03:36.150> with<00:03:36.360> the<00:03:36.390> cold

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
so which would make sense with the cold

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.740 
so which would make sense with the cold
weather<00:03:36.810> we<00:03:36.990> had<00:03:37.140> and<00:03:37.320> the<00:03:37.920> one<00:03:38.160> on<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.750> hill

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
weather we had and the one on the hill

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.320 
weather we had and the one on the hill
where<00:03:40.260> I<00:03:40.290> just<00:03:40.530> picked<00:03:40.709> from<00:03:40.940> with<00:03:41.940> probably

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
where I just picked from with probably

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.550 
where I just picked from with probably
the<00:03:42.390> only<00:03:42.570> one<00:03:42.780> that<00:03:42.810> didn't<00:03:43.230> get<00:03:43.320> hit<00:03:43.470> with

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
the only one that didn't get hit with

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:50.540 
the only one that didn't get hit with
Frost<00:03:43.860> in<00:03:44.340> June<00:03:48.980> well<00:03:49.980> I'm<00:03:50.100> looking<00:03:50.340> at<00:03:50.430> my

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
Frost in June well I'm looking at my

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.170 
Frost in June well I'm looking at my
tree<00:03:50.850> here<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.980> it's<00:03:52.980> side<00:03:53.340> guys<00:03:53.700> there's<00:03:54.120> a

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
tree here and it's side guys there's a

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.000 
tree here and it's side guys there's a
load<00:03:54.450> there's<00:03:54.720> like<00:03:54.900> five<00:03:55.170> apples<00:03:55.590> up<00:03:55.770> there

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
load there's like five apples up there

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.449 
load there's like five apples up there
it<00:03:56.790> looks<00:03:57.030> like<00:03:57.150> about<00:03:57.209> six<00:03:57.570> over<00:03:57.870> here<00:03:58.459> maybe

ten here and that's it

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.440 
ten here and that's it
the<00:04:01.020> trees<00:04:01.290> got<00:04:01.500> no<00:04:01.890> apples<00:04:02.340> on<00:04:02.459> it<00:04:02.489> it's<00:04:03.270> the

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.270 
same boat as uh as all the apple trees
on<00:04:08.549> the<00:04:08.670> other<00:04:09.000> highway<00:04:09.739> and<00:04:10.739> I'm<00:04:10.860> in<00:04:11.010> a<00:04:11.070> lower

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
on the other highway and I'm in a lower

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.910 
on the other highway and I'm in a lower
area<00:04:11.489> and<00:04:12.030> I<00:04:12.120> did<00:04:12.420> get<00:04:12.630> hit<00:04:12.840> with<00:04:12.989> that<00:04:13.049> -7°

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
there in June after the tree had gone

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.259 
there in June after the tree had gone
into<00:04:17.970> blossom<00:04:18.540> so<00:04:19.549> I'm<00:04:20.549> gonna<00:04:20.700> pick<00:04:20.880> what's<00:04:21.120> on
