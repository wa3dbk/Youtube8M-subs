you'll end up with will look like this
except<00:02:13.210> it<00:02:13.300> will<00:02:13.390> say<00:02:13.510> your<00:02:13.810> domain

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
except it will say your domain

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.990 
except it will say your domain
here<00:02:14.530> so<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:14.769> need<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:15.040> replace<00:02:15.310> that<00:02:15.640> with

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
here so you need to replace that with

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.509 
here so you need to replace that with
whatever<00:02:16.450> your<00:02:16.720> domain<00:02:17.019> name<00:02:17.050> is<00:02:17.440> we<00:02:18.250> need<00:02:18.370> to

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
whatever your domain name is we need to

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.839 
whatever your domain name is we need to
copy<00:02:18.849> this<00:02:19.390> bit<00:02:19.629> of<00:02:19.720> code<00:02:20.400> okay<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:21.610> it<00:02:21.700> needs

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
copy this bit of code okay and it needs

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.210 
copy this bit of code okay and it needs
to<00:02:22.000> go<00:02:22.090> between<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.690> head<00:02:23.080> and<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.349> clothes

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
to go between the head and the clothes

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.559 
to go between the head and the clothes
head<00:02:24.580> tags<00:02:25.120> within<00:02:25.959> your<00:02:26.560> web<00:02:27.519> page<00:02:27.760> so<00:02:28.480> we're

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
head tags within your web page so we're

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.320 
head tags within your web page so we're
actually<00:02:28.659> gonna<00:02:28.840> put<00:02:29.049> it<00:02:29.140> in<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.379> header

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
actually gonna put it in the header

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.660 
actually gonna put it in the header
that's<00:02:31.330> where<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.569> head<00:02:31.750> tags<00:02:32.049> will<00:02:32.290> appear

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
that's where the head tags will appear

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.000 
that's where the head tags will appear
so<00:02:33.670> i'm<00:02:33.730> going<00:02:33.819> to<00:02:33.879> edit<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.360> header<00:02:34.390> and

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
so i'm going to edit the header and

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.960 
so i'm going to edit the header and
again<00:02:36.010> just<00:02:36.160> takes<00:02:36.400> a<00:02:36.489> second<00:02:36.730> or<00:02:36.790> two<00:02:36.849> to

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
again just takes a second or two to

if<00:02:47.170> I<00:02:47.379> find<00:02:47.739> the<00:02:48.129> head<00:02:48.280> tag<00:02:48.489> here<00:02:48.790> somewhere

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
if I find the head tag here somewhere

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.650 
if I find the head tag here somewhere
I'll<00:02:50.410> pause<00:02:50.799> what<00:02:51.099> I<00:02:51.129> fine<00:02:51.599> okay<00:02:52.599> I've

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
and paste that bit of code that we

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.930 
and paste that bit of code that we
needed<00:03:12.489> into<00:03:13.030> their<00:03:13.239> fav<00:03:14.140> icon<00:03:14.379> code<00:03:15.040> with<00:03:15.790> our

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
needed into their fav icon code with our

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.240 
needed into their fav icon code with our
own<00:03:16.060> domain<00:03:16.420> name<00:03:16.470> then<00:03:17.470> we<00:03:17.620> simply<00:03:17.950> need<00:03:18.099> to

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
own domain name then we simply need to

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.270 
own domain name then we simply need to
update<00:03:18.489> that<00:03:18.790> file<00:03:19.530> again<00:03:20.530> I'll<00:03:20.769> pause<00:03:21.069> while

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
update that file again I'll pause while

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.360 
update that file again I'll pause while
this<00:03:21.459> updates<00:03:22.239> it<00:03:22.389> will<00:03:22.480> take<00:03:22.599> a<00:03:22.630> moment<00:03:22.840> to

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
this updates it will take a moment to

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.250 
this updates it will take a moment to
okay<00:03:24.370> it<00:03:24.430> saying<00:03:24.730> file<00:03:25.030> editors<00:03:25.599> successfully

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
okay it saying file editors successfully

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.949 
okay it saying file editors successfully
so<00:03:26.560> we<00:03:26.680> go<00:03:26.829> back<00:03:27.069> to<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:27.400> site<00:03:27.579> itself<00:03:27.760> and<00:03:28.269> hit

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
so we go back to the site itself and hit

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.710 
so we go back to the site itself and hit
refresh<00:03:29.169> that<00:03:30.040> doesn't<00:03:30.549> always<00:03:30.760> appear<00:03:31.510> and

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
refresh that doesn't always appear and

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.750 
refresh that doesn't always appear and
to<00:03:32.200> be<00:03:32.290> honest<00:03:32.530> it<00:03:32.650> doesn't<00:03:32.889> always<00:03:33.190> work<00:03:33.519> for

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
to be honest it doesn't always work for

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.819 
to be honest it doesn't always work for
every<00:03:34.030> host<00:03:34.239> it<00:03:34.450> will<00:03:34.690> depend<00:03:34.959> sometimes<00:03:35.680> on

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
every host it will depend sometimes on

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.809

your host most hosts it will work with
