00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.769
 hello to all and welcome to the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.210
 easy english tutorial chain so 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.680
 today we find ourselves to do 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.990
 a little update on the video 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.000
 that I did to you yesterday on the courts 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.699
 these clashes what the fuck so 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.670
 since the update the crime pays and 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.789
 well a small function has changed in 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.500
 the online gta publisher that does not we 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.180
 simply prevents you from creating 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.570
 races where clashes what the 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.059
 fuck 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.739
 you can not overlay objects 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.960
 elements of the decor 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.969
 so all that is looping with the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.920
 ramps it's now impossible to 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.770
 do and overlay the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.300
 containers becomes very difficult so 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.090
 I put a little screen on the screen 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.710
 it's karim ineo 41 that was asked 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.739
 directly to the media 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.230
 rockstar asking them if with 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.149
 the arrival of the new update the 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.579
 not being able to superimpose 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.220
 decor elements was normal and that's 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.920
 what it was wanted by by rockstar or 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.130
 if it was simply a bug following the 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.479
 fortunately update rockstar us 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.670
 responds that this is a bug that this 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.490
 was not expected at the base that their 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.680
 developers are currently on in 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.110
 floor train on to try to 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.500
 solve this problem by cons they we 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.790
 have no date to give as to the 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.030
 solving this problem 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.470
 so we have to hope pretty quickly 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.329
 that they give us this up 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.640
 without necessarily putting a 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.009
 new update it can be done 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.509
 as I imagine like the patches of 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.399
 glitch that put us in the process of putting 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.110
 up to date no need to make a shift for 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.450
 change some settings so I hope 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.810
 it could be done just as easily 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.479
 from them and so I also benefit 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.770
 quickly so already I hope it's 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.290
 good news for most 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.360
 of you despite that I could have been able 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.480
 find that a lot of people that 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.670
 pleased a lot of people that 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.130
 it is no longer possible bah listen I 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.140
 I'm sorry for you but it's going to come back 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.120
 and so I also benefit from it for you 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.980
 announce that soon I will make a video 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.050
 on the publisher to present you a 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.540
 little function of the editor which 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.190
 is not expected a normally but who 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.930
 can be really nice but it's ok 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.870
 allow to make enough catches 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.540
 cool and so suddenly and well I'm going 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.980
 present you this method and by the 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.170
 same opportunity I will talk to you about the 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.960
 karim string hinault so the person 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.970
 who sent the message to 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.900
 rockstar supports i will talk to you about his 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.790
 string because he knows mostly based on on 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.250
 the publisher and I think you could 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.190
 finally learn at least what the 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.020
 are fond of race creation and 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.670
 who do not know you too well 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.530
 could learn a lot of things 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.730
 maybe even those who are knowledgeable 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.190
 a little more you may be able 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.900
 learn something so we'll see that 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.740
 in an upcoming video and on this I 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.740
 tell you very soon
