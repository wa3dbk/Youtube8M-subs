00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.769
 hello today at scheckter's in 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.440
 the diamond series the zaki 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.900
 six thousand and six 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:23.720
 t1 signature here is a double cut 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:27.169
 rather nice enough light mahogany 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.960
 any mahogany with rosewood fingerboard that 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:32.660
 was embellished with lots of small 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:37.489
 very nice things like the number here 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:41.480
 necessarily 6661 the microphone rings with 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.850
 skulls by all the benchmarks of 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.399
 so touch on the 12th box we find 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.199
 his flick knife which is his 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.780
 emblem to zacky revenge 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:53.659
 here and then benchmarks in three 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.170
 pretty cool parts ballooned mother of 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:58.089
 pearl 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.829
 here is a skull skull there on the 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:03.319
 on the head of which you see the guitar 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:07.510
 and lookee well then we have a 

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:12.500
 deck hardware that is as if they were 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:15.049
 worn g1 so chrome face and we'll say 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:20.000
 but it's still a town pro here 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.630
 therefore to blockage of stability in 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.260
 The settings 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:27.950
 and then at the other end we have big 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.500
 so with x automats with a 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.390
 ratio of 18.1 so that these are 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.750
 mechanics that are very soft to 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:39.620
 turn and that are extremely accurate 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:43.820
 this is the micro endowment now we have 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:46.610
 two is dead duncan custom jb so 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.390
 that they can in addition this split is this 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.190
 who do we have so if they are basic 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.000
 on this guitar 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:57.470
 either we are in force and so we have a 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.610
 acute middle serious 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.620
 either we are split with the same three 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.530
 positions but with both baker 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.289
 split in single and forward for 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.209
 clean sounds we start with the microphone 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.190
 serious position sleeve 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.060
 we go through the positions then I 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.060
 split ray here 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.960
 and 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.700
 we 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.120
