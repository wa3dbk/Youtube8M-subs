prior<00:00:02.159> review<00:00:02.399> channel<00:00:02.639> today<00:00:03.480> we<00:00:03.510> have<00:00:03.750> a

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
prior review channel today we have a

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.990 
prior review channel today we have a
comparison<00:00:04.080> review<00:00:04.589> between<00:00:04.950> the<00:00:05.069> people<00:00:05.430> m9

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
comparison review between the people m9

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.410 
comparison review between the people m9
and<00:00:06.899> this<00:00:07.020> is<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.259> 3g<00:00:07.740> version<00:00:07.770> and<00:00:11.420> the

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
and this is the 3g version and the

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.660 
and this is the 3g version and the
primal<00:00:12.809> p90x<00:00:13.320> 3g<00:00:13.769> version<00:00:13.950> so<00:00:14.340> you<00:00:14.400> can<00:00:14.549> see

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
primal p90x 3g version so you can see

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.330 
primal p90x 3g version so you can see
the<00:00:14.759> sim<00:00:14.969> card<00:00:15.000> slot<00:00:15.450> here<00:00:15.809> this<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:16.980> micro

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
the sim card slot here this is a micro

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.689 
the sim card slot here this is a micro
SD<00:00:17.550> card<00:00:18.330> slot<00:00:18.390> here<00:00:18.869> so<00:00:19.830> these<00:00:19.949> are<00:00:20.010> pretty

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
SD card slot here so these are pretty

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.550 
SD card slot here so these are pretty

on the p90x 3g and they got a 15,600 790
score<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.960> can<00:00:49.050> see<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.200> there<00:00:50.030> check<00:00:51.030> out

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
score you can see that there check out

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.279

have a people m9 in-depth review of

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.580 
have a people m9 in-depth review of
where<00:00:59.789> we<00:00:59.910> also<00:01:00.059> do<00:01:00.300> benchmark<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.440> don't

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
where we also do benchmark I don't

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.340 
where we also do benchmark I don't
remember<00:01:01.710> what<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.070> square<00:01:02.520> was<00:01:02.760> so<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.899> this

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
remember what that square was so in this

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.500 
remember what that square was so in this
review<00:01:04.619> then<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:05.700> before<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.150> started<00:01:06.450> I

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
review then this before you started I

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.590 
review then this before you started I
mean<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:08.250> screen<00:01:08.580> size<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.850> like<00:01:09.299> this<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.570> a

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
mean the screen size is like this is a

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.630 
mean the screen size is like this is a
9.7<00:01:10.260> inch<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> 10.1<00:01:11.250> inch<00:01:11.490> so

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
9.7 inch and this is a 10.1 inch so

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.890 
9.7 inch and this is a 10.1 inch so
that's<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.909> only<00:01:11.939> main<00:01:12.360> difference<00:01:12.780> between

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
that's the only main difference between

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.020 
that's the only main difference between
the<00:01:13.680> tablet<00:01:14.010> aside<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.430> cpu<00:01:16.159> so<00:01:17.159> before<00:01:17.880> we

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
the tablet aside this cpu so before we

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.260 
the tablet aside this cpu so before we
started<00:01:18.509> on<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:19.280> test<00:01:20.280> like<00:01:20.909> our<00:01:21.119> video<00:01:23.270> also

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
started on this test like our video also

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.700 
started on this test like our video also

three<00:01:46.140> go

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.570 

looks<00:02:05.340> like<00:02:05.430> it's<00:02:05.580> gonna<00:02:05.700> be<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:05.940> close<00:02:07.580> okay

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
looks like it's gonna be it close okay

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.790 
looks like it's gonna be it close okay
so<00:02:09.420> another<00:02:09.600> thing<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.840> look<00:02:09.869> at<00:02:10.080> is<00:02:10.140> these

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
so another thing to look at is these

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.710 
so another thing to look at is these
banners<00:02:11.130> here<00:02:11.520> which<00:02:11.670> ones<00:02:11.970> download<00:02:12.600> the

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
banners here which ones download the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.370 
banners here which ones download the
fastest<00:02:14.630> okay<00:02:15.630> so<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:15.870> looks<00:02:15.900> like<00:02:16.080> it<00:02:16.290> was

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
fastest okay so it looks like it was

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.380 
fastest okay so it looks like it was
pretty<00:02:16.590> much<00:02:16.800> a<00:02:16.860> tire<00:02:17.130> i<00:02:17.160> think<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.610> m9<00:02:18.180> could

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
pretty much a tire i think the m9 could

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.050 
pretty much a tire i think the m9 could
have<00:02:18.480> been<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:18.630> little<00:02:19.020> bit<00:02:19.260> faster<00:02:19.940> but<00:02:20.940> it's

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
have been a little bit faster but it's

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.640 
have been a little bit faster but it's
hard<00:02:21.209> to<00:02:21.300> tell<00:02:21.510> because<00:02:21.690> this<00:02:22.170> thing<00:02:22.380> came<00:02:22.530> up

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
hard to tell because this thing came up

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:32.230 
hard to tell because this thing came up
let's<00:02:25.650> go<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.920> another<00:02:26.310> site<00:02:26.730> we<00:02:27.150> can<00:02:27.300> go<00:02:27.480> to
