the best piece of advice I could give to
any<00:00:06.720> waterfowl<00:00:07.290> hunter<00:00:07.620> is<00:00:08.010> to<00:00:08.250> be<00:00:08.429> on<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:08.940> X

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
any waterfowl hunter is to be on the X

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.839 
any waterfowl hunter is to be on the X
now<00:00:09.510> what<00:00:09.780> is<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.080> X<00:00:10.290> it's<00:00:10.830> where<00:00:11.130> birds<00:00:11.429> want

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
now what is the X it's where birds want

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.400 
now what is the X it's where birds want
to<00:00:11.940> come<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.360> naturally<00:00:12.990> it<00:00:13.110> could<00:00:13.259> be<00:00:13.380> a

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
to come to naturally it could be a

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.589 
to come to naturally it could be a
feeding<00:00:13.860> area<00:00:14.009> it<00:00:14.639> could<00:00:14.820> be<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:14.969> rest<00:00:15.360> area

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
feeding area it could be a rest area

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.480 
feeding area it could be a rest area
that<00:00:15.900> they<00:00:16.020> come<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.500> after<00:00:16.800> feeding<00:00:17.369> it's

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
that they come to after feeding it's

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.519 
that they come to after feeding it's
where<00:00:17.730> they<00:00:17.910> want<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.240> go<00:00:18.359> naturally<00:00:18.930> you<00:00:19.380> can

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
where they want to go naturally you can

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.290 
where they want to go naturally you can
find<00:00:19.770> that<00:00:19.920> spot<00:00:20.279> they're<00:00:20.580> going<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.850> come<00:00:21.060> to

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
find that spot they're going to come to

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.460 
find that spot they're going to come to
you<00:00:21.570> well<00:00:21.900> guess<00:00:22.199> what

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
you well guess what

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.920 
you well guess what
I'm<00:00:22.710> sorry<00:00:23.070> but<00:00:23.789> in<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:23.970> lot<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.300> cases<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.689> lot<00:00:24.869> of

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
I'm sorry but in a lot of cases a lot of

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.380 
I'm sorry but in a lot of cases a lot of
hunters<00:00:25.350> are<00:00:25.740> not<00:00:25.949> able<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.340> set<00:00:26.609> up<00:00:26.640> on<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.180> X

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
hunters are not able to set up on the X

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.990 
hunters are not able to set up on the X
instead<00:00:28.349> they<00:00:28.710> have<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.099> set<00:00:29.369> up<00:00:29.519> under<00:00:29.970> the

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
instead they have to set up under the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.640 
instead they have to set up under the
flight<00:00:30.330> lanes<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.869> birds<00:00:31.140> this<00:00:31.320> could<00:00:31.529> be

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
flight lanes of the birds this could be

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.220 
flight lanes of the birds this could be
a<00:00:31.679> migration<00:00:32.219> or<00:00:32.520> corridor<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.600> could<00:00:33.870> be<00:00:34.050> a

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
a migration or corridor it could be a

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.500 
a migration or corridor it could be a
travel<00:00:34.739> lane<00:00:34.950> between<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.460> refuge<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.300> a

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
travel lane between a refuge and a

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.080 
travel lane between a refuge and a
feeding<00:00:36.899> area<00:00:37.230> but<00:00:37.980> it's<00:00:38.129> underneath<00:00:38.700> where

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
feeding area but it's underneath where

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.060 
feeding area but it's underneath where
the<00:00:39.239> birds<00:00:39.450> are<00:00:39.600> traveling<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.559> they<00:00:40.710> have<00:00:40.920> to

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
the birds are traveling so they have to

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.160 
the birds are traveling so they have to
overcome<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.940> natural<00:00:42.480> instinct<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.050> the

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
overcome this natural instinct of the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.440 
overcome this natural instinct of the
birds<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.559> go<00:00:43.680> somewhere<00:00:44.100> else<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.640> draw<00:00:45.180> them

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
birds to go somewhere else and draw them

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.200 
birds to go somewhere else and draw them
down<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:46.050> their<00:00:46.230> spot<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:47.309> how<00:00:47.489> do<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.760> do<00:00:47.969> this

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
down to their spot so how do you do this

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.420 
down to their spot so how do you do this
well<00:00:48.570> there<00:00:48.750> are<00:00:48.899> two<00:00:49.079> things<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.500> do<00:00:49.739> number

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430

one<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:51.120> put<00:00:51.360> out<00:00:51.480> as<00:00:51.719> many<00:00:52.020> decoys<00:00:52.559> as<00:00:52.829> you

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
one you put out as many decoys as you

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.880 
one you put out as many decoys as you
can<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.520> huge<00:00:54.090> decoy<00:00:54.600> spread<00:00:54.809> I've<00:00:55.469> hunted<00:00:55.680> over

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
can a huge decoy spread I've hunted over

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.099 
can a huge decoy spread I've hunted over
spreads<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.489> over<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> thousand<00:00:57.239> decoys<00:00:57.629> some

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
spreads of over a thousand decoys some

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.139 
spreads of over a thousand decoys some
of<00:00:58.260> them<00:00:58.379> were<00:00:58.469> out<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.649> range<00:00:58.949> but<00:00:59.579> we<00:00:59.760> left<00:01:00.000> an

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
of them were out of range but we left an

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.939 
of them were out of range but we left an
open<00:01:00.449> hole<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.870> we<00:01:00.989> could<00:01:01.170> steer<00:01:01.440> those<00:01:01.620> ducks

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
open hole and we could steer those ducks

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.979 
open hole and we could steer those ducks
in<00:01:02.129> front<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.520> blind<00:01:02.730> with<00:01:03.390> our<00:01:03.570> calling

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
in front of the blind with our calling

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.530

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
the other thing you can do is to use a

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.410 
the other thing you can do is to use a
lot<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.840> aggressive<00:01:07.350> calling<00:01:08.150> don't<00:01:09.150> sound

but<00:01:21.570> at<00:01:21.689> long-range<00:01:21.930> those<00:01:22.590> birds<00:01:22.890> will<00:01:23.070> hear

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
but at long-range those birds will hear

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.460
