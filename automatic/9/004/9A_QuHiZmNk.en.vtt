00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
an off week and there is research that

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.789 
an off week and there is research that
he<00:02:12.700> cited<00:02:13.150> that<00:02:13.900> shows<00:02:14.200> that<00:02:14.230> actual

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
he cited that shows that actual

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:19.199 
he cited that shows that actual
regression<00:02:15.670> is<00:02:16.470> after<00:02:17.470> nine<00:02:17.650> days<00:02:18.000> so<00:02:19.000> nine

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
regression is after nine days so nine

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.259 
regression is after nine days so nine
days<00:02:19.480> off<00:02:19.720> is<00:02:20.019> the<00:02:20.739> magical<00:02:21.159> oh<00:02:21.489> shit<00:02:22.150> i'm

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269

getting swallows off you will notice a

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.119 
getting swallows off you will notice a
little<00:02:25.239> more<00:02:25.420> softness<00:02:25.870> you<00:02:26.650> might<00:02:26.830> even<00:02:26.860> lose

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
little more softness you might even lose

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:28.770 
little more softness you might even lose
weight<00:02:27.370> because<00:02:27.489> less<00:02:27.790> glycogen<00:02:28.209> storage<00:02:28.599> in

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
weight because less glycogen storage in

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.690 
weight because less glycogen storage in
