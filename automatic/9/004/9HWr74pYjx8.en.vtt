00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.409 

I<00:00:00.269> had<00:00:01.050> some<00:00:01.199> low<00:00:01.319> oil<00:00:01.500> pressure<00:00:02.090> hit<00:00:03.090> a<00:00:03.120> video

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
I had some low oil pressure hit a video

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.860 
I had some low oil pressure hit a video
you<00:00:03.659> can<00:00:03.720> see<00:00:03.929> one<00:00:04.110> of<00:00:04.200> my<00:00:04.259> videos<00:00:04.620> that<00:00:05.870> that

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
you can see one of my videos that that

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.410 
you can see one of my videos that that
third<00:00:07.020> gear<00:00:07.290> pool<00:00:07.880> oil<00:00:08.880> pressure<00:00:09.150> was<00:00:09.389> low

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
third gear pool oil pressure was low

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.249 
third gear pool oil pressure was low
never<00:00:09.870> did<00:00:10.050> it<00:00:10.110> go<00:00:10.230> up<00:00:10.440> do<00:00:11.070> some<00:00:11.280> concerns<00:00:11.730> or

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:12.259 
never did it go up do some concerns or

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.890 
never did it go up do some concerns or
pull<00:00:13.259> it<00:00:13.290> off<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.650> oil<00:00:13.679> filter<00:00:14.250> housing<00:00:14.900> been

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
pull it off the oil filter housing been

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.359 
pull it off the oil filter housing been
studying<00:00:16.289> these<00:00:16.410> things<00:00:16.470> about<00:00:16.949> two<00:00:17.190> days

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
studying these things about two days

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.900 
studying these things about two days
trying<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.119> figure<00:00:18.240> out<00:00:18.510> exactly<00:00:18.779> why<00:00:19.910> the

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
trying to figure out exactly why the

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.250 
trying to figure out exactly why the
forward-facing<00:00:21.420> future<00:00:23.660> has<00:00:24.660> lower<00:00:25.019> oil

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
forward-facing future has lower oil

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.019 
forward-facing future has lower oil
pressure<00:00:25.740> than<00:00:26.810> the<00:00:27.810> 1990<00:00:28.529> field<00:00:28.740> since<00:00:29.400> 1990

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029

filter<00:00:30.359> housing<00:00:31.700> that<00:00:32.700> had<00:00:32.940> on<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.180> car

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
filter housing that had on the car

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.280 
filter housing that had on the car
before<00:00:33.870> prior<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.100> engine<00:00:35.489> bill<00:00:36.290> but

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
before prior to the engine bill but

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.720 
before prior to the engine bill but
after<00:00:37.590> study<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:37.980> see<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.190> springs<00:00:38.489> are

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
after study you see the springs are

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.530 
after study you see the springs are
still<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.180> same<00:00:39.899> springs<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.800> same<00:00:41.010> length

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
still the same springs the same length

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.520 
still the same springs the same length
so<00:00:42.540> assume<00:00:43.579> the<00:00:44.660> 1990<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.809> mean<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.170> assume<00:00:46.230> the

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
so assume the 1990 I mean I assume the

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.279 
so assume the 1990 I mean I assume the
forward-facing<00:00:46.920> filter<00:00:47.989> more<00:00:48.989> pressure

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
forward-facing filter more pressure

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.850 
forward-facing filter more pressure
never<00:00:49.770> go<00:00:49.950> never<00:00:50.610> went<00:00:50.850> up<00:00:50.969> chimp<00:00:51.930> seemed<00:00:52.770> it

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
never go never went up chimp seemed it

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.670 
never go never went up chimp seemed it
heavy<00:00:53.100> never<00:00:53.489> went<00:00:53.730> up<00:00:54.110> so<00:00:55.110> here's<00:00:55.440> what<00:00:55.649> I

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
heavy never went up so here's what I

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.569 
heavy never went up so here's what I
found<00:00:56.039> out<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.820> found<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:58.020> little<00:00:58.530> area<00:00:59.100> of

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
found out I found this little area of

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.850 
found out I found this little area of
concern<00:01:00.559> you<00:01:01.559> see<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.010> area<00:01:02.969> whether<00:01:03.860> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
concern you see the area whether the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.050 
concern you see the area whether the
piston<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.790> spring<00:01:06.090> goes<00:01:06.360> here<00:01:08.060> that's

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
piston is the spring goes here that's

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.080 
piston is the spring goes here that's
the<00:01:09.299> piston<00:01:10.130> but<00:01:11.130> if<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.340> look<00:01:11.490> close<00:01:11.790> there's

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
the piston but if you look close there's

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.179 
the piston but if you look close there's
a<00:01:12.180> little<00:01:12.390> pinhole<00:01:12.659> there<00:01:13.560> sound<00:01:13.860> like<00:01:14.010> some

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
a little pinhole there sound like some

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.950 
a little pinhole there sound like some
kind<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.400> relief<00:01:14.760> hole<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
kind of relief hole in the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.530 
kind of relief hole in the
forward-facing<00:01:16.320> filter<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:18.000> relief<00:01:18.299> hole

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
forward-facing filter that relief hole

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.190 
forward-facing filter that relief hole
bleeds<00:01:18.869> off<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.500> fluid<00:01:20.450> so<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:22.020> never

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
bleeds off the fluid so that it never

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.219 
bleeds off the fluid so that it never
sees<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.530> pressure<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.220> we<00:01:23.430> would<00:01:23.580> see<00:01:23.790> on

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
sees the pressure that we would see on

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.830 
sees the pressure that we would see on
this<00:01:25.229> oil<00:01:25.380> filter<00:01:25.590> housing<00:01:26.479> if<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.570> look<00:01:27.720> at

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
this oil filter housing if you look at

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:36.289 
this oil filter housing if you look at
this<00:01:27.960> one<00:01:28.549> that's<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.700> piston<00:01:33.020> there's<00:01:34.020> no<00:01:35.299> no

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
this one that's the piston there's no no

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.149 
this one that's the piston there's no no
relief<00:01:36.659> hole<00:01:38.869> there<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.860> when<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.130> oil

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
relief hole there so when the oil

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.399 
relief hole there so when the oil
reaches<00:01:41.670> desired<00:01:42.329> pressure<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.990> pushes<00:01:43.320> on

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
reaches desired pressure it pushes on

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.889 
reaches desired pressure it pushes on
the<00:01:43.560> piston<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:43.950> bleeds<00:01:44.220> off<00:01:46.040> through<00:01:47.040> the

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
the piston and bleeds off through the

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:53.960 
the piston and bleeds off through the
the<00:01:48.899> bleed<00:01:49.110> off<00:01:49.759> valve<00:01:51.259> so<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.649> have<00:01:53.369> no<00:01:53.549> idea

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
the bleed off valve so I have no idea

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.990 
the bleed off valve so I have no idea
why<00:01:54.149> mr.<00:01:54.299> Bishop<00:01:54.720> put<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.020> little<00:01:55.200> dot<00:01:56.000> there

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
why mr. Bishop put that little dot there

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.260 
why mr. Bishop put that little dot there
that<00:01:57.350> dot<00:01:58.350> called<00:01:59.130> low<00:01:59.490> oil<00:01:59.759> pressure<00:02:00.530> it<00:02:01.530> has

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
that dot called low oil pressure it has

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.899 
that dot called low oil pressure it has
caused<00:02:03.270> many<00:02:03.509> guys<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:04.250> engines<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.310> fail<00:02:05.610> I

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
caused many guys of engines to fail I

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.749 
caused many guys of engines to fail I
don't<00:02:06.899> want<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.079> ruin<00:02:07.200> my<00:02:07.409> engine<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:08.099> what<00:02:08.670> I'm

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
don't want to ruin my engine so what I'm

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.089 
don't want to ruin my engine so what I'm
going<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:08.940> do<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.450> I'm<00:02:10.440> going<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.649> pull<00:02:10.860> up<00:02:10.950> this

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
going to do is I'm going to pull up this

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.350 
going to do is I'm going to pull up this
hole<00:02:11.370> I'm<00:02:11.849> gonna<00:02:12.030> put<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.510> little<00:02:12.690> tack<00:02:12.959> wheel

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
hole I'm gonna put a little tack wheel

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.250 
hole I'm gonna put a little tack wheel
on<00:02:13.450> it<00:02:13.600> plug<00:02:14.560> it<00:02:14.590> up<00:02:14.800> and<00:02:15.070> hopefully<00:02:16.140> get<00:02:17.140> this

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
on it plug it up and hopefully get this

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.300 
on it plug it up and hopefully get this
oil<00:02:17.470> pressure<00:02:17.740> where<00:02:17.980> it<00:02:18.040> needs<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:18.250> be

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
oil pressure where it needs to be

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.400 
oil pressure where it needs to be
because<00:02:18.700> a<00:02:18.970> whole<00:02:19.570> exhaust<00:02:19.870> system<00:02:20.320> is

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
because a whole exhaust system is

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.670 
because a whole exhaust system is
centered<00:02:20.740> around<00:02:20.770> this<00:02:21.670> water<00:02:21.910> facing<00:02:22.390> future

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
centered around this water facing future

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.230 
centered around this water facing future
so<00:02:23.680> I'll<00:02:24.250> give<00:02:24.400> it<00:02:24.490> a<00:02:24.550> shot<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:24.790> give<00:02:25.090> it<00:02:25.180> a

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
so I'll give it a shot and give it a

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.860 
so I'll give it a shot and give it a
test<00:02:25.420> and<00:02:25.690> see<00:02:27.180> if<00:02:28.180> you<00:02:28.300> get<00:02:28.420> for<00:02:28.600> me<00:02:28.690> where<00:02:28.840> I

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
test and see if you get for me where I
