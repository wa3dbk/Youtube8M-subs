this<00:03:58.860> is<00:03:59.010> a<00:03:59.040> big<00:03:59.220> like<00:03:59.400> question<00:03:59.850> video<00:04:00.090> i

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
this is a big like question video i

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.140 
this is a big like question video i
guess<00:04:00.380> but<00:04:01.380> this<00:04:02.160> was<00:04:02.400> technically<00:04:02.910> the

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
guess but this was technically the

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.030 
guess but this was technically the
second<00:04:03.510> video<00:04:03.600> out<00:04:03.900> today<00:04:04.230> so<00:04:04.739> i<00:04:04.769> probably

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
second video out today so i probably

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.280 
second video out today so i probably
won't<00:04:05.310> be<00:04:05.430> releasing<00:04:05.760> another<00:04:06.120> i<00:04:06.420> may<00:04:06.900> have

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
won't be releasing another i may have

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.860 
won't be releasing another i may have
like<00:04:07.560> some<00:04:07.769> kind<00:04:07.950> of<00:04:08.010> delay<00:04:08.220> or<00:04:09.000> off<00:04:09.420> tomorrow
