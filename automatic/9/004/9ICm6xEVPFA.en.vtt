00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
you would attach the bracket you can

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.530 
you would attach the bracket you can
attach<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.939> number<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.030> ways<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.299> attaching

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
attach it number of ways of attaching

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.060 
attach it number of ways of attaching
this<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.020> can<00:01:16.140> touch<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.320> upside<00:01:16.710> down<00:01:16.740> or

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
this you can touch it upside down or

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.660 
this you can touch it upside down or
right<00:01:17.310> side<00:01:17.490> up<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:18.540> do<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:20.130> you'll<00:01:20.430> figure

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
right side up I do it and you'll figure

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.310 
right side up I do it and you'll figure
that<00:01:20.790> on<00:01:21.030> when<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.240> comes<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:22.080> don't

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
that on when it comes to you you don't

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.990 
that on when it comes to you you don't
have<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.560> understand<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.549> much<00:01:23.759> right

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
have to understand that so much right

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.289 
have to understand that so much right
now<00:01:24.030> but<00:01:24.590> you<00:01:25.590> snap<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.189> into<00:01:26.460> place<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:27.030> it's

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
now but you snap it into place and it's

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.130 
now but you snap it into place and it's
in<00:01:27.479> place<00:01:27.720> now<00:01:29.329> let's<00:01:30.329> go<00:01:30.509> ahead<00:01:30.810> I'm<00:01:30.990> not

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
in place now let's go ahead I'm not

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.920 
in place now let's go ahead I'm not
going<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.320> put<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:32.119> well<00:01:33.119> here<00:01:33.390> let's<00:01:33.600> do<00:01:33.780> it

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
going to put the well here let's do it

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.060 
going to put the well here let's do it
if<00:01:34.409> we<00:01:35.189> take<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.320> you<00:01:37.320> can<00:01:37.500> see<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:37.950> this

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
if we take and you can see that this

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.700 
if we take and you can see that this
bracket<00:01:38.610> has<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:40.880> top<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.119> bottom<00:01:42.380> that<00:01:43.380> you

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
bracket has a top and a bottom that you

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.840 
bracket has a top and a bottom that you
rip<00:01:43.920> your<00:01:44.100> iPad<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.729> these<00:01:45.570> extend<00:01:46.140> out<00:01:46.350> to

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
rip your iPad and these extend out to

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.510 
rip your iPad and these extend out to
accommodate<00:01:47.850> different<00:01:48.030> thicknesses<00:01:48.810> of

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
accommodate different thicknesses of

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.990 
accommodate different thicknesses of
tablets<00:01:50.520> or<00:01:50.640> iPads<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.689> let's<00:01:51.899> put<00:01:52.079> my<00:01:52.820> iPad<00:01:53.820> in

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
tablets or iPads so let's put my iPad in

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.830 
tablets or iPads so let's put my iPad in
here<00:01:55.070> stick<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.369> here<00:01:56.549> now<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.149> like<00:01:57.540> this

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
here stick it in here now and like this

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.789 
here stick it in here now and like this
and<00:01:58.969> then<00:01:59.969> we<00:02:00.090> just<00:02:00.119> push<00:02:00.509> down<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:01.170> snap<00:02:01.770> it

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
and then we just push down and snap it

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.609 
and then we just push down and snap it
over<00:02:02.040> this<00:02:02.250> snap<00:02:02.579> right<00:02:02.820> here<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.350> what<00:02:04.350> locks

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
over this snap right here is what locks

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.779 
over this snap right here is what locks
it<00:02:04.799> in<00:02:04.890> place<00:02:05.780> so

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
it in place so

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.300 

now<00:02:09.390> you've<00:02:09.689> got<00:02:09.929> think<00:02:10.500> all<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.829> unit

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
now you've got think all the unit

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.849 
now you've got think all the unit
completely<00:02:11.790> assembled<00:02:12.090> one<00:02:12.900> of<00:02:13.049> the<00:02:13.170> big

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:13.859 
completely assembled one of the big

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:16.220 
completely assembled one of the big
features<00:02:14.189> that<00:02:14.670> this<00:02:14.909> will<00:02:15.420> allow<00:02:15.659> you<00:02:15.719> to<00:02:15.930> do

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
features that this will allow you to do

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.759 
features that this will allow you to do
is<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.900> flexes<00:02:18.900> at<00:02:19.049> the<00:02:19.170> base<00:02:19.349> if<00:02:19.650> you

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
is that it flexes at the base if you

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:26.229 
is that it flexes at the base if you
watch<00:02:20.069> down<00:02:20.430> here<00:02:21.409> it'll<00:02:23.750> angle<00:02:24.859> two<00:02:25.859> ways

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
watch down here it'll angle two ways

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.899 
watch down here it'll angle two ways
this<00:02:27.239> way<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.780> that<00:02:27.859> way<00:02:28.859> now<00:02:29.609> if<00:02:29.760> you're

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
this way and that way now if you're

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.599 
this way and that way now if you're
sitting<00:02:30.180> in<00:02:30.390> bed<00:02:30.659> and<00:02:30.959> you<00:02:31.680> want<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.010> or<00:02:32.250> you're
