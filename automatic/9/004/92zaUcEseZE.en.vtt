00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.309

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.350

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:05.180
 Well , here we are going to make a sauce 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.620
 and I like that all the dishes have 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.240
 a little bit of background because if you do not 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.770
 we apply the background 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.210
 this is already underway 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.509
 we are going to take a little more 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.509
 oil 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:22.750
 we know that it is virgin oil gold 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.410

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.410

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:35.210
 and well we throw the vegetables 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:40.030
 and we're going to leave the vegetables like this 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.030
 color has freshness the vegetable 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.880
 of course the peas are the ones only 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:51.550
 cast at the end we will leave 20 minutes 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.550
 of cooking and to the plate 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.180
 after 20 minutes what I've done 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.369
 is to drain the water and leave it a little 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.590
 to the fire so that it finishes evaporating 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.939
 all the water that we have left and now 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.550
 dish as you see the little color of the 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.009
 vegetable continues to maintain it because 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.050
 course, freshness is important 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.930
 let's finish this dish you want 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:20.670

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:25.010

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.010

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.250

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:35.130

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.140

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.629

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:49.939

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:09.870
