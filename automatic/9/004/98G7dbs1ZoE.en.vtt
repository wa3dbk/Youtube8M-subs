Sean<00:00:19.770> I'm<00:00:20.580> guessing<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.390> key

part of what you did tell me a little
bit<00:00:23.670> about<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.090> so<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:25.199> device<00:00:25.590> here<00:00:25.920> and

but it's a global company and it uses

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.870 
but it's a global company and it uses
around<00:00:31.560> ten<00:00:31.800> percent<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.340> power<00:00:32.579> that

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
around ten percent of the power that

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.240 
around ten percent of the power that
normal<00:00:33.180> PC<00:00:33.570> would<00:00:33.809> use<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.350> because<00:00:35.130> it

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
normal PC would use and because it

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.979 
normal PC would use and because it

obviously miniature version which uses
much<00:00:46.230> less<00:00:46.260> energy<00:00:46.829> it's<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.100> miniature

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
much less energy it's a miniature

reduced-cost<00:01:39.570> addition<00:01:40.079> because<00:01:40.200> presumably

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
reduced-cost addition because presumably

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.039 
reduced-cost addition because presumably
or<00:01:40.950> your<00:01:41.340> power<00:01:41.549> bills<00:01:41.850> go<00:01:42.090> on<00:01:42.180> down<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.810> course

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
or your power bills go on down of course

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.830 
or your power bills go on down of course
because<00:01:43.439> efficiency<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.579> saving<00:01:45.540> money<00:01:45.720> as

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
because efficiency is is saving money as

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.859 
because efficiency is is saving money as
well<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.350> our<00:01:46.829> utility<00:01:47.280> bills<00:01:47.490> have<00:01:48.060> gone<00:01:48.299> down

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
well so our utility bills have gone down

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.200 
well so our utility bills have gone down
by<00:01:49.110> nearly<00:01:49.920> quarter<00:01:50.189> million<00:01:50.549> pounds<00:01:50.939> through

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
by nearly quarter million pounds through

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.880 
by nearly quarter million pounds through
them<00:01:51.329> from<00:01:51.540> rolling<00:01:52.110> out<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.350> technology

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
them from rolling out this technology

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.260 
them from rolling out this technology
yeah<00:01:53.130> but<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.490> course<00:01:53.670> some<00:01:53.790> companies<00:01:54.149> would

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
yeah but of course some companies would

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.209 
yeah but of course some companies would
be<00:01:54.390> put<00:01:54.630> out<00:01:54.750> put<00:01:55.079> off<00:01:55.170> by<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.710> cost<00:01:56.009> of

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
be put out put off by the cost of

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.249 
be put out put off by the cost of
bringing<00:01:56.430> in<00:01:56.759> all<00:01:56.939> these<00:01:57.090> new<00:01:57.360> terminals<00:01:58.110> did

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
bringing in all these new terminals did

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.240 
bringing in all these new terminals did
you<00:01:58.350> do<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.560> at<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.740> point<00:01:58.890> where<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.189> were

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
you do it at a point where you were

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.859 
you do it at a point where you were
looking<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.549> replace<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.149> hard<00:02:00.270> way<00:02:00.450> we<00:02:00.630> were

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
looking to replace the hard way we were

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.749 
looking to replace the hard way we were
doing<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.409> as<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.560> point<00:02:01.890> where<00:02:02.070> our<00:02:02.189> pcs<00:02:02.610> have

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
doing it as a point where our pcs have

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.310 
doing it as a point where our pcs have
become<00:02:03.030> obsolete<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:03.780> we<00:02:03.930> were<00:02:04.049> doing<00:02:04.259> a

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
become obsolete so we were doing a

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.020 
become obsolete so we were doing a
technology<00:02:04.799> refresh<00:02:04.920> anyway<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:05.880> made

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
technology refresh anyway so it made

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.520 
technology refresh anyway so it made
sense<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.360> do<00:02:06.509> at<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:06.630> point<00:02:06.750> invest<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.409> this

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
sense to do at that point invest in this

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.979 
sense to do at that point invest in this
technology<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.700> big<00:02:08.879> point<00:02:09.119> as<00:02:09.270> well<00:02:09.420> is<00:02:09.599> this

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
technology the big point as well is this

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.449 
technology the big point as well is this
technology<00:02:10.440> will<00:02:10.530> last<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.890> lot<00:02:11.009> longer<00:02:11.069> than<00:02:11.370> a

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
technology will last a lot longer than a

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.790 
technology will last a lot longer than a
PC<00:02:11.879> so<00:02:12.209> we<00:02:12.360> design

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
PC so we design

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.200 
PC so we design
this<00:02:12.920> to<00:02:13.070> last<00:02:13.190> up<00:02:13.400> to<00:02:13.430> eight<00:02:13.670> years<00:02:13.700> where

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
this to last up to eight years where

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.730 
this to last up to eight years where
maybe<00:02:14.390> a<00:02:14.480> PC<00:02:14.840> would<00:02:14.990> last<00:02:15.170> three<00:02:15.590> to<00:02:15.710> four

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
maybe a PC would last three to four

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.740 
maybe a PC would last three to four
years<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:16.310> what<00:02:16.460> about<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.820> initial<00:02:17.330> outlay

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
years and what about the initial outlay

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.380 
years and what about the initial outlay
in<00:02:18.020> buying<00:02:18.710> one<00:02:18.920> of<00:02:18.950> those<00:02:19.220> terminals<00:02:20.090> rather

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
in buying one of those terminals rather

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.360 
in buying one of those terminals rather
than<00:02:20.600> an<00:02:20.750> ordinary<00:02:20.930> standard<00:02:21.740> pieces<00:02:22.070> well

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
than an ordinary standard pieces well

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.950 
than an ordinary standard pieces well
that's<00:02:22.700> a<00:02:22.820> great<00:02:23.000> thing<00:02:23.150> considerably<00:02:23.720> less

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
that's a great thing considerably less

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.950 
that's a great thing considerably less
yeah<00:02:24.440> so<00:02:24.800> maybe<00:02:25.010> twenty<00:02:25.760> to<00:02:25.910> thirty<00:02:26.150> percent

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
yeah so maybe twenty to thirty percent

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.620 
yeah so maybe twenty to thirty percent
of<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.290> price<00:02:27.500> less<00:02:27.920> cost<00:02:28.340> at<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:28.730> outset<00:02:29.390> and

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
of the price less cost at the outset and

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.300 
of the price less cost at the outset and
it's<00:02:29.840> going<00:02:29.990> to<00:02:30.050> last<00:02:30.200> longer<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:30.860> it's<00:02:31.190> gonna

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
it's going to last longer and it's gonna

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.190 
it's going to last longer and it's gonna
reduce<00:02:31.610> your<00:02:31.790> vows<00:02:31.970> yes<00:02:32.270> I'm<00:02:32.750> struggling<00:02:33.050> to

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
reduce your vows yes I'm struggling to

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.450 
reduce your vows yes I'm struggling to
see<00:02:33.350> a<00:02:33.380> downside<00:02:33.590> of<00:02:34.040> this<00:02:34.070> bit<00:02:34.280> of<00:02:34.370> a

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
see a downside of this bit of a

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.960 
see a downside of this bit of a
no-brainer<00:02:35.920> well<00:02:36.920> let's<00:02:37.130> see<00:02:37.280> how<00:02:37.460> many<00:02:37.850> other

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
no-brainer well let's see how many other

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.820 
no-brainer well let's see how many other
companies<00:02:38.180> actually<00:02:38.540> and<00:02:38.960> follow<00:02:39.200> your<00:02:39.470> your

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
companies actually and follow your your

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.380 
companies actually and follow your your
lead<00:02:40.100> in<00:02:40.310> this<00:02:40.460> but<00:02:41.000> something<00:02:41.270> you're

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
lead in this but something you're

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.580 
lead in this but something you're
planning<00:02:41.720> to<00:02:41.780> expand<00:02:42.080> elsewhere<00:02:42.410> in<00:02:42.500> the

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
planning to expand elsewhere in the

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.380 
planning to expand elsewhere in the
world<00:02:42.620> as<00:02:43.040> well<00:02:43.220> yes<00:02:43.490> we've<00:02:43.730> we've<00:02:44.030> recently

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
world as well yes we've we've recently

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.970 
world as well yes we've we've recently
rolled<00:02:44.720> out<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:44.960> Australian<00:02:45.590> Melbourne<00:02:45.890> and

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
rolled out to Australian Melbourne and

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.100 
rolled out to Australian Melbourne and
Sydney<00:02:46.040> so<00:02:46.910> instead<00:02:47.210> of<00:02:47.270> investing<00:02:47.930> into

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
Sydney so instead of investing into

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.680 
Sydney so instead of investing into
infrastructure<00:02:48.680> in<00:02:49.220> Australia<00:02:49.730> we<00:02:50.360> managed

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
infrastructure in Australia we managed

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.200 
infrastructure in Australia we managed
to<00:02:50.960> put<00:02:51.560> in<00:02:51.770> infrastructure<00:02:52.460> mesh<00:02:52.640> in<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.850> UK

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
to put in infrastructure mesh in the UK

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.970 
to put in infrastructure mesh in the UK
which<00:02:53.480> they<00:02:53.690> they<00:02:54.020> do<00:02:54.080> what<00:02:54.500> they<00:02:54.650> call<00:02:54.830> pull

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
which they they do what they call pull

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.770 
which they they do what they call pull
of<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:55.160> Sun<00:02:55.370> so<00:02:55.550> use<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.120> same<00:02:56.300> servers<00:02:56.720> that

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
of the Sun so use the same servers that

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.290 
of the Sun so use the same servers that
we<00:02:56.900> use<00:02:57.110> for<00:02:57.140> our<00:02:57.350> UK<00:02:57.680> market<00:02:58.190> in<00:02:58.850> a<00:02:59.030> different
