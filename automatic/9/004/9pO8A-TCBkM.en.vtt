can achieve threshold and wrath is bored
now<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.660> second<00:00:40.170> virulent<00:00:40.680> sliver<00:00:40.950> isn't

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
now the second virulent sliver isn't

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.540 
now the second virulent sliver isn't
very<00:00:41.790> threatening<00:00:42.350> I'm<00:00:43.350> not<00:00:43.620> real<00:00:44.340> concerned

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
firebolt and I don't really want to lose

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.850 
firebolt and I don't really want to lose
to<00:01:16.439> poison<00:01:17.280> just<00:01:17.490> randomly<00:01:17.880> from<00:01:18.500> say<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.530> third

to poison just randomly from say a third
virulent<00:01:20.700> sliver<00:01:21.049> but<00:01:22.049> I'm<00:01:22.290> not<00:01:22.560> too<00:01:22.799> afraid

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
virulent sliver but I'm not too afraid

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.320 
virulent sliver but I'm not too afraid
of<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.580> I'm<00:01:23.670> going<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.850> just<00:01:23.909> go<00:01:24.210> ahead

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
of that so I'm going to just go ahead

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.109 
of that so I'm going to just go ahead
and<00:01:24.479> invoke<00:01:24.840> Mulder<00:01:25.229> iftar<00:01:25.470> here<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.119> see

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
and invoke Mulder iftar here and see

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.450 
and invoke Mulder iftar here and see
what<00:01:27.330> he<00:01:27.390> has<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.570> his<00:01:27.750> next<00:01:28.080> turn<00:01:28.200> at<00:01:29.100> worst

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
what he has on his next turn at worst

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.990 
what he has on his next turn at worst
I'm<00:01:30.210> going<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.600> be<00:01:30.689> taking<00:01:31.549> probably<00:01:32.549> for<00:01:32.820> more

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
I'm going to be taking probably for more

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.190 
I'm going to be taking probably for more
poison<00:01:33.750> counters<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.409> that's<00:01:34.950> okay<00:01:36.200> he

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
poison counters and that's okay he

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.719 
poison counters and that's okay he
doesn't<00:01:37.439> have<00:01:37.560> another<00:01:37.799> poison<00:01:38.040> sliver<00:01:38.430> just

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
doesn't have another poison sliver just

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.719 
doesn't have another poison sliver just
Jim<00:01:39.060> hide<00:01:39.409> which<00:01:40.409> he<00:01:40.650> cast<00:01:40.979> before<00:01:41.280> combat

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
Jim hide which he cast before combat

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.800 
Jim hide which he cast before combat
interestingly<00:01:42.329> enough<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.549> swings<00:01:44.549> in<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:47.810> get

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
interestingly enough and swings in I get

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.960 
interestingly enough and swings in I get
a<00:01:48.840> couple<00:01:49.140> more<00:01:49.200> poison<00:01:49.680> counters<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.369> go<00:01:50.820> down

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
a couple more poison counters I go down

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.480 
a couple more poison counters I go down
at<00:01:51.119> 17<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.460> I'm<00:01:53.460> entering<00:01:53.670> my<00:01:53.820> fourth<00:01:54.149> turn

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
at 17 and I'm entering my fourth turn

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.700 
at 17 and I'm entering my fourth turn
wrath<00:01:56.490> would<00:01:56.820> be<00:01:56.969> pretty<00:01:57.240> good<00:01:57.540> here<00:01:57.960> but<00:01:58.469> I

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
wrath would be pretty good here but I

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.010 
wrath would be pretty good here but I
still<00:01:59.040> don't<00:01:59.159> have<00:01:59.310> threshold<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.119> there's

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
still don't have threshold and there's

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.690 
still don't have threshold and there's
not<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.229> lot<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.439> pressure<00:02:01.770> on<00:02:02.130> me<00:02:02.549> at<00:02:02.670> the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
not a lot of pressure on me at the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.730 
not a lot of pressure on me at the
moment<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:05.840> I'm<00:02:06.840> trying<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.140> decide<00:02:07.229> if<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.560> want

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
moment so I'm trying to decide if I want

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.440 
moment so I'm trying to decide if I want
to<00:02:07.799> cast<00:02:07.979> deep<00:02:08.250> analysis<00:02:08.849> or<00:02:09.060> if<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.239> want<00:02:09.270> a

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
to cast deep analysis or if I want a

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.540 
to cast deep analysis or if I want a
firebolt<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:10.289> virulent<00:02:10.950> sliver<00:02:11.190> just<00:02:11.489> to

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
firebolt a virulent sliver just to

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.520 
firebolt a virulent sliver just to
prevent

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
some crazy poison kill here and I decide

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.260 
some crazy poison kill here and I decide
to<00:02:16.700> bolt<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:18.080> virulent<00:02:18.470> sliver<00:02:19.090> he<00:02:20.090> lays

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
to bolt the virulent sliver he lays

to bolt the virulent sliver he lays
