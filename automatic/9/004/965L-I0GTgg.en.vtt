00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.470
 imagine a movie with beautiful scenes that only a central forum to 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.960
 understanding would certainly be harmed this is how they feel 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.589
 thousands of Brazilians with visual impairment and who often become 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:23.320
 dependent on someone to narrate what goes on the screen nobody in the rivers of the

 cousin who 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.300

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.050
 It's because the united moments that does not allow 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.170
 Teresa 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.560

 I wanted something strange that happens to the world, we can not talk, right? 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.760
 then what is and what tells 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.170
 that is all 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.170
 but it has a light that 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.110
 so if you understand nothing the same happens to emi at 11 years lost
