00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:09.490
 we did not understand, I stopped 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:11.650
 early in the start of the tournament on 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.900
 all of tournament we are not playing the 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.519
 prestige of such an important tournament and 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.900
 he what the tournament meant for 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.640
 any player and for any 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.490
 any of the whole group that we travel 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.390
 a tournament that gives you much value 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.670
 have a lot of prestige and 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.670
 unfortunately we come with 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.460
 annoyance with anger with sadness and with 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.859
 failure that we did not want to lose the 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.780
 past tournament forces us to win this if 

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:36.550
 we intend to go play a final to 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.039
 look for confederations because 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.929
 winning it does not guarantee anything to us 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:43.659
 guarantee that we win the tournament and we 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:45.670
 guarantees to go to play a final and what 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:48.699
 mexico wants from us directors 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.679
 they mean to confederations then 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.479
 you have to win the tournament first to 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:54.069
 aspire to reach the final 2 that 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:55.350
 We have the obligation to earn this 

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:57.829
 tournament 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.160
 but why do they not follow me 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:05.280
 I'm all going to a stadium, they're going behind me 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.409
 taking pictures and see where I feel and 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.670
 what am I doing I feel down there 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.320
 many times of all are 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.810
 transmitting the game of the are 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.820
 covering the games I did not see anyone either 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.080
 say that I was in the game and I do not 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.740
 work that is put to work in 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.450
 court with whom 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.549
 you put me on the court I just 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.259
 I invent 22 players and there I tell them the 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.659
 campaign come here if not the 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.939
 I have they have the clubs or I 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.740
 I work with them when I have them 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.479
 I work as a technician for making them 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.430
 ask him I asked him and it seems to me that 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.229
 got hooked wrong in the end he answered what 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.689
 what I had to state that I 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.820
 I asked is watching players and then 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.770
 determine who are those who believe 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.450
 which may be the best for each 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.640
 selection and there I can make the mistake 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.039
 responsible I am I took the 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.110
 best honors that is responsibility 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.880
 completely mine and if I am the one that I put 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.399
 head and I put my face and I say what 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.920
 I convened and for me this is that is the 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.259
 group did not work I'm responsible for 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.850
 that works do not work this failure is 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.799
 responsible for the failure because I 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.920
 I took his players that's why I say 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.630
 I go to all the stages of observing 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.250
 the players and then joining us in the 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.470
 kart but it seems that I have to 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.459
 tell all of you today I'm 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.750
 arriving at the kart 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.150

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.550
 doing my job after there is with 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.100
 good business situations 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.110
 maybe because I like the 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.910
 people of the commercials it seems to me that 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.000
 They called me to make them 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.130

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.909
 at least twice a month and then 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.159

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:49.650
