yeah these are the early these are the

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.540 
yeah these are the early these are the
ones<00:01:26.290> that<00:01:26.440> were<00:01:26.470> on<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:26.830> early<00:01:27.100> edge<00:01:27.250> of<00:01:27.460> it

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
ones that were on the early edge of it

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.970 
ones that were on the early edge of it
and<00:01:27.760> then<00:01:27.940> as<00:01:28.150> the<00:01:28.570> recession<00:01:29.170> has<00:01:29.350> taken<00:01:29.890> hold

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:29.980 
and then as the recession has taken hold

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.830 
and then as the recession has taken hold
over<00:01:30.250> the<00:01:30.340> course<00:01:30.520> of<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:30.730> year<00:01:30.970> you've<00:01:31.480> seen

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
over the course of the year you've seen

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.810 
over the course of the year you've seen
job<00:01:32.170> losses<00:01:32.440> just<00:01:32.830> really<00:01:33.100> cover<00:01:33.400> the<00:01:33.610> map

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
job losses just really cover the map

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.870 
job losses just really cover the map
let's<00:01:34.659> advance<00:01:34.960> that<00:01:35.260> to<00:01:35.409> october<00:01:36.220> and<00:01:36.370> so<00:01:36.820> you

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
let's advance that to october and so you

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.550 
let's advance that to october and so you
see<00:01:37.060> they're<00:01:37.390> squeezing<00:01:37.659> in<00:01:38.020> I<00:01:38.200> think<00:01:38.260> we're

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
see they're squeezing in I think we're

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.440 
see they're squeezing in I think we're
having<00:01:38.800> a<00:01:38.890> little<00:01:39.070> bit<00:01:39.280> of<00:01:39.340> a<00:01:39.550> delayed<00:01:40.120> hold

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
having a little bit of a delayed hold

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.760 
having a little bit of a delayed hold
out<00:01:40.630> in<00:01:40.780> the<00:01:40.840> middle<00:01:40.990> of<00:01:41.110> the<00:01:41.229> country<00:01:41.380> from

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
out in the middle of the country from

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.640 
out in the middle of the country from
the<00:01:42.040> from<00:01:42.580> the<00:01:42.610> commodity<00:01:43.240> bubble<00:01:43.540> both<00:01:44.170> you

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
the from the commodity bubble both you

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.770 
the from the commodity bubble both you
know<00:01:44.740> farm<00:01:44.979> prices<00:01:45.250> and<00:01:45.580> oil<00:01:45.700> prices<00:01:46.150> but

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
know farm prices and oil prices but

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.050 
know farm prices and oil prices but
basically<00:01:47.350> the<00:01:47.890> recession<00:01:48.460> has<00:01:48.580> fully<00:01:48.820> grip

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
basically the recession has fully grip

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.240 
basically the recession has fully grip
this<00:01:49.180> this<00:01:49.570> country<00:01:49.990> and<00:01:50.140> you're<00:01:50.860> seeing<00:01:51.100> that

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
this this country and you're seeing that

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.670 
this this country and you're seeing that
in<00:01:51.549> in<00:01:51.820> the<00:01:52.060> latest<00:01:52.240> data<00:01:52.870> there<00:01:53.320> is<00:01:53.409> a<00:01:53.440> very

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
in in the latest data there is a very

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.240 
in in the latest data there is a very
pervasive<00:01:54.720> job<00:01:55.720> loss<00:01:55.930> its<00:01:56.200> regional<00:01:56.740> and<00:01:56.920> it's

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
pervasive job loss its regional and it's

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.910 
pervasive job loss its regional and it's
industry-wide<00:01:57.760> and<00:01:58.240> this<00:01:59.020> is<00:01:59.320> what<00:01:59.740> a

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
industry-wide and this is what a

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.320 
industry-wide and this is what a
recession<00:02:00.400> is<00:02:00.520> and<00:02:00.670> so<00:02:00.760> in<00:02:00.909> the<00:02:01.000> middle<00:02:01.240> of

recession is and so in the middle of

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.930 
recession is and so in the middle of
that<00:02:01.510> right<00:02:02.490> ideological<00:02:03.490> arguments<00:02:03.700> that

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
that right ideological arguments that

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.649 
that right ideological arguments that
