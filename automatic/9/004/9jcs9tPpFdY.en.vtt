to screen because my hair is green and

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.579 
to screen because my hair is green and

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
put it on top of that white eyeliner

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.980 
put it on top of that white eyeliner
because<00:01:05.129> if<00:01:05.430> your<00:01:05.880> eyeshadow<00:01:06.330> isn't<00:01:06.840> that

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
it's on top of white eyeliner so I

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.480 
it's on top of white eyeliner so I

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
this is the most horrible thing I've

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.740 
this is the most horrible thing I've
ever<00:05:15.889> used<00:05:16.310> in<00:05:16.460> my<00:05:16.490> life<00:05:16.610> even<00:05:17.030> worse<00:05:17.360> than<00:05:17.660> the

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
ever used in my life even worse than the

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.540 
ever used in my life even worse than the
black<00:05:17.990> eyeshadow<00:05:18.229> stick<00:05:18.830> because<00:05:19.160> it's<00:05:19.340> so

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
black eyeshadow stick because it's so

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.150 
black eyeshadow stick because it's so
disgustingly<00:05:20.330> oily<00:05:21.020> and<00:05:21.199> it<00:05:21.620> doesn't<00:05:21.889> stay<00:05:22.130> on

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
disgustingly oily and it doesn't stay on

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.240 
disgustingly oily and it doesn't stay on
for<00:05:22.580> more<00:05:22.729> than<00:05:22.789> 0.2<00:05:23.449> seconds<00:05:23.930> but<00:05:24.770> I<00:05:24.800> guess

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
for more than 0.2 seconds but I guess

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.760 
for more than 0.2 seconds but I guess
it's<00:05:25.430> a<00:05:25.490> good<00:05:25.669> enough<00:05:25.970> base<00:05:26.740> honestly<00:05:27.740> I

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
it's a good enough base honestly I

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.200 
it's a good enough base honestly I
probably<00:05:28.070> could<00:05:28.370> have<00:05:28.430> just<00:05:28.490> filled<00:05:28.880> in<00:05:29.030> the

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
probably could have just filled in the

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.760 
probably could have just filled in the
whole<00:05:29.389> thing<00:05:29.599> with<00:05:29.780> eyeliner<00:05:30.139> but<00:05:30.380> I<00:05:30.440> didn't
