00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:06.010
 [Music] 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:12.509
 personal hello all right here and this lena 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.940
 video we'll see how they turned 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.940
 your simple jeans in frayed 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.890
 so let's start here I've already done one 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.600
 side of the pants have made a faith will not 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.670
 show you 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.250
 and the other leg I'm going to do here with 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.690
 you in the autarkic step-by-step already did 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:38.309
 then the next first thing to 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.230
 People are going to do it here with a mug. 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.480
 if you are not sure how many 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.180
 cuts you want to make the size 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.660
 then I say you use a pen the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.140
 first and make the notes by dialing 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.860
 where you will cut though marking 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.539
 here where I'm going to make my cut 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.149
 doing so is captive as if 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.430
 were some little boxes 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.909
 We'll cut the chain later. 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:11.580
 where I ventured to do some 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:15.780
 tracks here near kiss he wants to do 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:20.570
 some larger ones and also make some 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.570
 have smaller here closer to the bar 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.659
 and then after I marked the garden where I 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.880
 I will cut 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.829
 Then I'll get a pair of scissors. 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.400
 preference in good scissors having a 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.759
 Good cut and we can do it. 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.600
 everything as if it were a good dobrinha in the 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.759
 middle of all letters and not 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.979
 forget to take your pockets out 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.979
 welcomed this to cut the pocket 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:59.250
 [Music] 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.010
 so I 'm going to cut right where I 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.300
 I studied and I will try to do this 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.830
 as soon as possible 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.890
 while you no longer understand why 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.110
 The later the cut, the better I 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.480
 I'll explain to you but for now. 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.840
 if they do well the rating cuts well 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:23.340
 I would also like to do some here in 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:26.520
 down near the bar and then we 'll go 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.890
 start to shred to shred 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:35.550
 need a tweezers preferably one 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:38.370
 good head and before it starts to cool 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.040
 You have to understand something, and I have to. 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.200
 had and has two lines have a line 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.630
 south of a line to the white line 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.830
 occurs in this sense and alliance and as 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.050
 in this sense 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:53.160
 so what ever do the following to people 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.480
 will just take the blue line and leave the 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.600
 white line 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.940
 let's start by reaching by pulling the 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.700
 first is difficult to pull even is 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.620
 hard to leave once more that you 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.489
 He took the first out after 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.620
 easy then are you to start closing with 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.410
 a tweezers the blue lines 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.070
 Then you 'll notice that there's going to be only the line. 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:21.390
 white on the horizontal which is what people 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:29.459
 Do you want me to continue with this? 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:32.670
 taking someone like that to the fullest extent 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.650
 from china you can take only a little bit 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.650
 You need to take all the boxes I 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.959
 I took them all but if you want to leave 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.660
 some feel can also because such 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:47.239
 Do you wash those jeans? 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.239
 each time will get even more spied 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.319
 [Music] 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:56.680
 so I advise you to start 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.989
 with few cuts and then you slice 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.830
 try on the body and see how you 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.769
 likes 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.290
 then you want you make more cuts is 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:08.349
 because once you cut there no 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.540
 There's no way you can go back then. 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:13.209
 it is easier for you to make fewer cuts in the 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.670
 first time and try it and then 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:19.090
 you want you do more 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:21.250
 so that's ok, I already made it up here 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.400
 I took the whole blue line will stay 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:28.330
 so I've already taken it here in the 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.880
 knee that was like this and here in the 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:34.389
 the bottom closest to the afternoon I 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:38.020
 I took it out so I 'm done here 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:41.199
 on the whole leg of the pants for you as 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.780
 it was important to have a cut 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:46.479
 it retained staff because from there the line 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:50.050
 white will get more right will not 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:51.610
 appear so much skin is if you want 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.950
 more skin appears you do not need 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.220
 worry about being a good part 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:59.349
 but the straight cut to apply the 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.630
 white lines and staid 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:06.010
 so here in my back pocket I'm going too 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:16.240
 do some just to not get nothing 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:19.270
 such and there after I finished that pocket 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.550
 from behind to that is our final result 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.560
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.389
 video and like it already said staff 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.210
 If you liked, do not forget to give 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:28.400
 June

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:39.860
