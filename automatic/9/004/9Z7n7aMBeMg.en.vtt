00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.250
 Nokia came with a few months ago 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.660
 the lumia 1020 and that was in windows 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.160
 phone device with a very good one 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.500
 cameras and because a pureview camera 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.480
 that for the rest actually not quite 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.070
 and was particularly aircraft was actually 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.320
 hold back a bit by the old one 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.480
 hardware that was in it and that came again 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.830
 on that nokia then or for mike won't 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.050
 large screens and mind fast 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.730
 use processors or better 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.230
 said could not use the windows 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.769
 phone just wasn't there then 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.980
 ready for 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.730
 well that is windows phone now and nokia 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.219
 grabs immediately 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.129
 great from literally because the lumia 1520 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.350
 it is a very large smartphone again 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.910
 with him pureview camera and the best 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.059
 hardware ever form business of it 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.059
 device 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.530
 home 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.619
 although so very large 6 child and 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.670
 therefore probably not really 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.090
 will be attractive to the 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.289
 average user is that lumia 1520 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.899
 clearly a true lumia phone 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:26.960
 that simple design with that rounded 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.520
 edges that is really recognizable and that 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.350
 polycarbonate on the back still feels 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.759
 always very firm 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.009
 and compared to earlier limitation them 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.140
 virtually nothing changed visually 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.570
 except that there is now a micro sd slot 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.820
 is at the top and that the camera is decent 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.649
 great photo made that very nice 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.170
 you have it 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.610
 it is again such a pureview camera and 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.440
 That means their fairly large 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.600
 sensor is in this case with the 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.520
 20 megapixel resolution 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.380
 that the photo taken is reduced afterwards 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.119
 to 5 megapixels 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.549
 and because of that oversampling, that's what they call it 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.369
 you see less noise and ultimately 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.509
 if it's good more detail in your photo 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.039
 In addition, you can also zoom in and 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.509
 pretty tight without you 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.439
 is going to see because you are a very large source 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.179
 photo 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.130
 and then you can take a small picture of it 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.080
 and that system actually works just fine 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.700
 as good as with the lumia 1020 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.930
 but because that sensor in the resolution the 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.790
 be smaller 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.010
 if you have less detail you can do something 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.269
 fewer buttons but it is still a lot 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.590
 better than the average smartphone 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.720
 camera 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.920
 And the advantage is that the camera module 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.390
 now a little more modest is one 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.459
 comparison with those 10 to a whole 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.340
 big bump behind that has this then 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.900
 who is not the only one clearly less 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.989
 is that is the flash 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.329
 1020 had a seal flash and this 25 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.010
 have to do with the normal LED flash 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.480
 in practice you can have dark spaces 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.010
 which are less well- lit and are the 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.829
 colors with flash photos also just something 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.700
 less beautiful but everywhere it is really one 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.700
 very good camera 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.849
 this is the first windows phone with one 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.310
 quad core processor and also the first with 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.690
 a full hd screen and manufacturers wanted 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.250
 they probably make it sooner 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.930
 de was just no support yet 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.580
 now so 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.349
 that first of all ensures windows phone 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.970
 works a lot faster 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.709
 look fluently that was windows phone 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.930
 always with older devices 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.160
 you still have to wait regularly as your app 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.049
 Start you were going to do other things 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.430
 was a settings menu and went 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.530
 compared to the competition it was 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.690
 just not very fast and that is now one 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.650
 much better and that camera is also a lot 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.120
 become faster 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.160
 it is certainly not the fastest 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.540
 camera from a smartphone and you can 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.290
 also hardly expected because 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.150
 that resolution of that sensor is so high 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.690
 that screen has a resolution of 1920 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.280
 at 1080 pixels full hd so and that must be 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.200
 also actually because if you have low 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.400
 resolution already spread over a screen 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.230
 from six inches 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.959
 that you have kept a very grainy image 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.430
 not just that resolution that is good 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.440
 Eye color reproduction is also called one 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.190
 Judgment is the screen a tad 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.390
 blue 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.340
 now we really have to understand 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.870
 have to see 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.700
 on the software side there is still something to be done 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.350
 if canvas that high resolution 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.239
 because I was expecting a bit 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.799
 that will do more with the screen 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.299
 that I would get to see more 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.190
 an extra row of tiles 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.780
 but they are busy in other apps on the 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.150
 browser it all seems a bit 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.850
 just inflated existing interface 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.350
 elements buttons and icons and text it 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.240
 is just a bit bigger than normal but me 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.010
 him not really idea that I am more out of it 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.400
 screen I hope to get top makers on the screen 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.520
 nokia 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.229
 then hear there go do the lumia 1520 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.810
 runs all the latest version of it 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:33.190
 windows phone 8 a gdr3 diet 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.229
 and also runs the latest version of van 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.570
 called Nokia's update package 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:39.100
 place well with the updates and by the way 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.500
 available for a number of older ones 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.660
 lumias because those 25 are standard 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.340
 already installed and those updates 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.850
 get some handy new ones 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.289
 features 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.090
 for example, you can do a screen rotation 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.229
 Fixed and that is nice if you go in the evening 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.419
 bed but you said something watching 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.950
 with on it and from you can fix apps now 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:55.840
 easily really close completely 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.580
 You can contact your foot by another 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.590
 choose ringtone well so its one more 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.180
 lots of little features that are by themselves 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.470
 might not be very impressive 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.180
 but that together 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.720
 working with the phone just a moment 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.720
 make it finer 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.540
 that is the microsoft edge of story 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.440
 Nokia didn't sit still either 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.600
 so there is a new app that it 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.220
 storyteller that actually collects all 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.540
 photos that you have taken and submit 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.580
 a nice way again then you can yourself 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.870
 so choose a timeline cat commentary 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.110
 when putting or your chance of a world map 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.250
 and also funny the nokia beamer 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.680
 With that you can change your content 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.970
 screen after another screen 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.950
 first have to set up a connection that 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.210
 then do you scan qr code and 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.610
 then you can display that screen content 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.240
 forwarding is not possible via the internet 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.980
 straight away 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.960
 so is not fast enough to really have one 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.940
 video to forward but for it 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.610
 photos or blunt and light presentations 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.110
 it works really well 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.700
 because that housing is so big 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.790
 they also have room for a hefty battery 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.630
 this case 34 100 million per hour and the 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.160
 most people 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.650
 except maybe the real die-hard 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.660
 power users' your third day will be fine 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.160
 come through and enter our video test 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.140
 in for example 8 hours 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.040
 certainly not too long to score but also 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.040
 nothing to be ashamed of 

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:16.149
 all that you improve together makes that 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.159
 lumia 1520 the best windows from until now 

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:20.649
 and that is of course positive 

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:22.599
 but somehow it is a shame that they already 

00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:24.129
 that renewal in a 6 set of 

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:26.589
 which few people have stopped 

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:27.729
 are waiting for such a large device 

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:29.799
 I hope to have all of these here 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:31.659
 innovations also quickly become smaller 

00:06:29.799 --> 00:06:33.639
 device to see but for now have the 

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:36.360
 fans of large phones are now one again 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:36.360
 good option at
