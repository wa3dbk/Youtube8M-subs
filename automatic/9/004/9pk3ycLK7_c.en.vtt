out<00:00:10.230> my<00:00:10.950> voltage<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:11.820> current<00:00:12.090> state<00:00:12.300> of

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
out my voltage and current state of

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.320 
out my voltage and current state of
charge<00:00:12.920> while<00:00:13.920> I'm<00:00:14.099> charging<00:00:14.549> from<00:00:14.880> my<00:00:15.000> solar

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
charge while I'm charging from my solar

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.810 
charge while I'm charging from my solar
array<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:16.550> is<00:00:17.550> pretty<00:00:17.850> cool<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.840> it's<00:00:19.020> the

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
array and is pretty cool so it's the

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.970 
array and is pretty cool so it's the
trimetric<00:00:20.820> battery<00:00:21.720> monitoring<00:00:22.230> system<00:00:22.619> from

bogart<00:00:23.490> engineering<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.180> i<00:00:24.779> picked<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.109> up

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
bogart engineering and i picked it up

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.769 
bogart engineering and i picked it up
from<00:00:25.560> northern<00:00:26.039> arizona<00:00:26.160> wind<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.210> solar<00:00:27.420> and

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
from northern arizona wind and solar and

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.830 
from northern arizona wind and solar and
it's<00:00:28.470> got<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.710> lot<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:28.890> cool<00:00:29.130> features<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.840> I'm

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
it's got a lot of cool features and I'm

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.910 
it's got a lot of cool features and I'm
going<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.050> show<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.380> right<00:00:31.529> now<00:00:31.650> so

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
going to show it to you right now so

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.700 
going to show it to you right now so
let's<00:00:32.070> take<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.219> closer<00:00:32.460> look

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
okay so let's take a quick look at some

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.779 
okay so let's take a quick look at some
of<00:00:42.359> the<00:00:42.449> features<00:00:42.659> of<00:00:42.899> this<00:00:43.789> trimetric

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
of the features of this trimetric

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.060 
of the features of this trimetric
battery<00:00:45.239> monitor<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:45.899> really<00:00:46.620> like<00:00:46.769> it<00:00:46.949> it's

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
battery monitor I really like it it's

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.610 
battery monitor I really like it it's
kind<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.280> cool<00:00:47.629> so<00:00:48.629> right<00:00:48.780> now<00:00:48.930> there's<00:00:49.530> a

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
kind of cool so right now there's a

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.319 
kind of cool so right now there's a
number<00:00:49.769> of<00:00:49.890> different<00:00:50.030> readings<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.179> it

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
number of different readings that it

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.270 
number of different readings that it
shows<00:00:51.539> me<00:00:51.750> right<00:00:51.929> now<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.109> have<00:00:52.859> it<00:00:52.979> on<00:00:53.039> my

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
shows me right now I have it on my

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.439 
shows me right now I have it on my
primary<00:00:54.089> battery<00:00:54.510> showing<00:00:55.469> us<00:00:55.589> 13<00:00:55.979> point<00:00:56.280> Oh

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
primary battery showing us 13 point Oh

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.810 
primary battery showing us 13 point Oh
13<00:00:57.449> volts<00:00:58.229> even<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.829> that's<00:00:59.129> with<00:00:59.369> a<00:00:59.399> load<00:00:59.670> on

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
13 volts even and that's with a load on

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.090 
13 volts even and that's with a load on
and<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.030> got<00:01:00.180> some<00:01:00.359> lights<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.899> stuff<00:01:01.680> on<00:01:01.859> right

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
and I got some lights and stuff on right

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.509 
and I got some lights and stuff on right
now<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.519> also<00:01:03.710> it's<00:01:04.710> kind<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.039> cloudy<00:01:05.280> outside

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
now and also it's kind of cloudy outside

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.580 
now and also it's kind of cloudy outside
and<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.720> actually<00:01:07.080> starting<00:01:07.530> to

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
and it's and is actually starting to

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.260 
and it's and is actually starting to
drizzle<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:08.250> little<00:01:08.580> bit<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:08.939> there's<00:01:09.180> really

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
drizzle a little bit so there's really

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.350 
drizzle a little bit so there's really
no<00:01:09.479> no<00:01:10.140> Sun<00:01:10.409> getting<00:01:10.679> through<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.159> charge<00:01:11.520> my

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
no no Sun getting through to charge my

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.969 
no no Sun getting through to charge my
panels<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.229> um<00:01:14.210> my<00:01:15.649> battery<00:01:16.649> controller

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
panels so it's um my battery controller

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.430 
panels so it's um my battery controller
is<00:01:17.190> in<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.369> state<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.610> float<00:01:17.940> right<00:01:18.210> now<00:01:18.440> pumping

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
is in a state of float right now pumping

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.789 
is in a state of float right now pumping
in<00:01:19.940> very<00:01:20.940> little<00:01:21.299> if<00:01:21.690> any<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.560> I'm<00:01:22.619> running

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
in very little if any so I'm running

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.800 
in very little if any so I'm running
pretty<00:01:23.130> much<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.580> my<00:01:23.610> batteries<00:01:24.119> now<00:01:24.569> I<00:01:24.600> can

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
pretty much on my batteries now I can

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.070 
pretty much on my batteries now I can
switch<00:01:24.959> it<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.490> my<00:01:26.490> load<00:01:26.970> readings<00:01:27.780> right<00:01:27.929> now

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
switch it to my load readings right now

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.870 
switch it to my load readings right now
I<00:01:28.110> have<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.380> configure<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.340> show

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
I have a configure to show

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.309 
I have a configure to show
watts<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:31.289> show<00:01:31.619> me<00:01:31.649> I'm<00:01:31.950> drawing<00:01:32.750> 8.45<00:01:33.750> watch

00:01:34.309 --> 00:01:34.319 
watts so show me I'm drawing 8.45 watch

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:35.029 
watts so show me I'm drawing 8.45 watch
right<00:01:34.649> now

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
right now

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:37.149 
right now
now<00:01:35.670> let's<00:01:35.880> if<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.450> turn<00:01:36.659> off<00:01:36.840> these<00:01:36.990> lights

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
now let's if I turn off these lights

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.770 
now let's if I turn off these lights
watch<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.429> I'll<00:01:38.580> turn<00:01:38.819> off<00:01:38.940> this<00:01:39.119> LED<00:01:39.539> lights

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
watch this I'll turn off this LED lights

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.809 
watch this I'll turn off this LED lights
not<00:01:39.990> going<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.200> draw<00:01:40.350> much<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.459> I'll<00:01:41.549> turn<00:01:41.700> off

00:01:41.809 --> 00:01:41.819 
not going to draw much so I'll turn off

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:43.730 
not going to draw much so I'll turn off
this<00:01:41.880> light<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.299> notice<00:01:42.539> it<00:01:42.689> goes<00:01:43.079> down<00:01:43.350> to

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
this light you notice it goes down to

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.510 
this light you notice it goes down to
five<00:01:44.329> some<00:01:45.329> odd<00:01:45.479> watts<00:01:46.070> I'll<00:01:47.070> turn<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.369> back<00:01:47.490> on

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
five some odd watts I'll turn it back on

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.679 
five some odd watts I'll turn it back on
and<00:01:49.520> goes<00:01:50.520> back<00:01:50.700> up<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.149> it's<00:01:51.270> really<00:01:51.390> kind<00:01:51.659> of

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
and goes back up so it's really kind of

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.649 
and goes back up so it's really kind of
nice<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:52.079> see<00:01:52.289> what<00:01:53.270> you<00:01:54.270> know<00:01:54.359> all<00:01:54.539> your

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
nice to see what you know all your

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.959 
nice to see what you know all your
appliance<00:01:55.079> isn't<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.619> what<00:01:56.189> your<00:01:56.340> real<00:01:56.670> time

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
appliance isn't and what your real time

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.749 
appliance isn't and what your real time
draw<00:01:57.359> is<00:01:57.630> on<00:01:57.840> your<00:01:57.990> battery<00:01:58.170> bank<00:01:58.579> helps<00:01:59.579> to

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
draw is on your battery bank helps to

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.510 
draw is on your battery bank helps to

hooked up to my my chassis battery as
well<00:02:36.959> so<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:37.290> don't<00:02:37.440> have<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.829> go<00:02:38.030> wonder<00:02:39.030> what

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
well so I don't have to go wonder what

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.590 
well so I don't have to go wonder what
my<00:02:39.500> what<00:02:40.500> my<00:02:40.560> chassis<00:02:41.130> battery<00:02:41.430> is<00:02:41.579> is<00:02:42.120> charged

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
my what my chassis battery is is charged

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.259 
my what my chassis battery is is charged
at<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:43.290> have<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:43.950> battery<00:02:44.190> tender<00:02:44.790> on<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.090> right

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
at I have a battery tender on it right

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.880 
at I have a battery tender on it right
now<00:02:45.450> so<00:02:45.780> it's<00:02:45.959> got<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:46.170> little<00:02:46.319> trickle<00:02:46.590> charge

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
now so it's got a little trickle charge

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.800 
now so it's got a little trickle charge
going<00:02:47.099> into<00:02:47.370> it<00:02:47.489> and<00:02:47.700> it's<00:02:48.209> reading<00:02:48.420> thirteen

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
going into it and it's reading thirteen

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.380 
going into it and it's reading thirteen
point<00:02:49.049> one

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
point one

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.090 
point one
a couple<00:02:50.750> other<00:02:50.870> modes<00:02:51.170> if<00:02:51.380> I<00:02:51.470> hold<00:02:51.680> this<00:02:51.830> down

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
a couple other modes if I hold this down

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.380 
a couple other modes if I hold this down
and<00:02:53.770> it'll<00:02:54.770> show<00:02:54.800> me<00:02:55.010> my<00:02:55.580> current<00:02:55.940> since<00:02:56.240> I've

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
and it'll show me my current since I've

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.949 
and it'll show me my current since I've
reset<00:02:56.780> it<00:02:56.930> what<00:02:57.560> my<00:02:57.800> amp<00:02:58.069> power<00:02:58.780> usage<00:02:59.780> has

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
reset it what my amp power usage has

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.620 
reset it what my amp power usage has
been<00:02:59.990> you<00:03:00.410> saw<00:03:00.590> I<00:03:00.620> was<00:03:00.709> like<00:03:00.830> 9.8<00:03:01.520> amp<00:03:02.270> hours

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
been you saw I was like 9.8 amp hours

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.690 
been you saw I was like 9.8 amp hours
that<00:03:02.810> I've<00:03:02.930> used<00:03:03.170> so<00:03:03.530> if<00:03:03.620> you<00:03:03.709> subtract<00:03:04.100> 9.8

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
that I've used so if you subtract 9.8

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.740 
that I've used so if you subtract 9.8
take<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:05.150> percentage<00:03:05.630> from<00:03:06.350> 210<00:03:07.360> amp<00:03:08.360> hours

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
take the percentage from 210 amp hours

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.900 
take the percentage from 210 amp hours
that's<00:03:08.990> where<00:03:09.110> it's<00:03:09.230> coming<00:03:09.470> up<00:03:09.560> with<00:03:09.680> that

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
that's where it's coming up with that

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.010 
that's where it's coming up with that
95%<00:03:10.910> capacity<00:03:11.150> and<00:03:13.270> click<00:03:14.270> this<00:03:14.420> it<00:03:14.660> shows<00:03:14.780> me

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
95% capacity and click this it shows me

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.520 
95% capacity and click this it shows me
my<00:03:15.200> days<00:03:15.410> since<00:03:15.830> fully<00:03:16.730> charge<00:03:17.150> zero<00:03:18.080> has<00:03:18.380> been

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
my days since fully charge zero has been

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.120 
my days since fully charge zero has been
charged<00:03:18.950> today<00:03:19.130> and<00:03:19.989> days<00:03:20.989> since<00:03:21.319> equalize<00:03:21.890> as

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
charged today and days since equalize as

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.770 
charged today and days since equalize as
the<00:03:22.250> DSC<00:03:22.760> so<00:03:23.470> 28.1<00:03:24.470> days<00:03:25.090> since<00:03:26.090> it's<00:03:26.330> been<00:03:26.570> the

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
the DSC so 28.1 days since it's been the

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.090 
the DSC so 28.1 days since it's been the
battery<00:03:27.080> bank<00:03:27.230> has<00:03:27.410> been<00:03:27.560> equalized<00:03:27.950> it's

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
battery bank has been equalized it's

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.180 
battery bank has been equalized it's
just<00:03:28.570> to<00:03:29.570> give<00:03:29.720> you<00:03:29.810> a<00:03:29.840> reminder<00:03:30.260> of<00:03:30.290> when<00:03:31.070> you

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
just to give you a reminder of when you

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.660 
just to give you a reminder of when you
should<00:03:31.220> equalize<00:03:31.730> your<00:03:31.760> battery<00:03:32.120> bank<00:03:33.040> so<00:03:34.040> the

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
should equalize your battery bank so the

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.280 
should equalize your battery bank so the
final<00:03:34.970> thing<00:03:35.000> is<00:03:35.269> that<00:03:35.390> it<00:03:35.600> you<00:03:35.810> know<00:03:35.840> show<00:03:36.170> me

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
final thing is that it you know show me

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.400 
final thing is that it you know show me
my<00:03:36.410> real<00:03:36.650> time<00:03:36.920> draw<00:03:37.700> in<00:03:38.060> terms<00:03:38.420> of<00:03:38.660> amps<00:03:39.080> not

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
my real time draw in terms of amps not

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.370 
my real time draw in terms of amps not
watts<00:03:39.769> in<00:03:40.160> this<00:03:40.730> case<00:03:40.970> so<00:03:41.269> 0.7<00:03:42.200> amps

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
watts in this case so 0.7 amps

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.630 
watts in this case so 0.7 amps
same<00:03:45.380> thing<00:03:45.590> if<00:03:45.739> I<00:03:45.800> turn<00:03:45.980> out<00:03:46.010> these<00:03:46.250> lights<00:03:46.459> it

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
same thing if I turn out these lights it

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.570 
same thing if I turn out these lights it
should<00:03:46.790> go<00:03:46.880> down<00:03:47.060> to<00:03:47.300> pretty<00:03:47.510> close<00:03:47.690> to<00:03:47.989> zero

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
should go down to pretty close to zero

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.570 
should go down to pretty close to zero
or<00:03:49.840> 0.4<00:03:50.840> there<00:03:51.380> you<00:03:51.440> go<00:03:51.590> it's<00:03:51.950> just<00:03:52.160> a<00:03:52.280> couple

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
or 0.4 there you go it's just a couple

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.229 
or 0.4 there you go it's just a couple
LED<00:03:53.080> overhead<00:03:54.080> lights<00:03:54.640> only<00:03:55.640> draws<00:03:56.000> about

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
LED overhead lights only draws about

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.819 
LED overhead lights only draws about
point<00:03:56.600> two<00:03:57.140> point<00:03:57.799> one<00:03:57.920> to<00:03:58.040> point<00:03:58.100> two<00:03:58.310> amps<00:03:58.790> so

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
point two point one to point two amps so

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.000 
point two point one to point two amps so
that's<00:04:00.829> pretty<00:04:01.070> much<00:04:01.250> it<00:04:01.489> I<00:04:02.799> really<00:04:03.799> like<00:04:03.890> this

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
that's pretty much it I really like this

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.770 
that's pretty much it I really like this
unit<00:04:04.190> I<00:04:04.459> can<00:04:04.610> see<00:04:04.760> right<00:04:05.000> from<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.390> inside<00:04:05.690> of

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
unit I can see right from the inside of

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.250 
unit I can see right from the inside of
my<00:04:05.840> coach<00:04:06.049> you<00:04:07.010> know<00:04:07.160> what<00:04:08.030> my<00:04:08.260> current

my coach you know what my current

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.460 
my coach you know what my current
capacity<00:04:09.440> is<00:04:09.980> and<00:04:10.900> it's<00:04:11.900> pretty<00:04:12.079> neat<00:04:12.290> and<00:04:12.380> I

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
capacity is and it's pretty neat and I

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.440 
capacity is and it's pretty neat and I
really<00:04:12.680> like<00:04:12.799> it<00:04:12.980> and<00:04:13.220> that's<00:04:13.489> from<00:04:13.820> that's

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
really like it and that's from that's

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.030 
really like it and that's from that's
from<00:04:14.720> Bogart<00:04:15.140> engineering<00:04:15.650> is<00:04:15.739> called<00:04:15.950> a

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
from Bogart engineering is called a

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.890 
from Bogart engineering is called a
trimetric<00:04:16.459> battery<00:04:17.060> monitoring<00:04:17.450> system<00:04:17.750> and

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
trimetric battery monitoring system and

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.710 
trimetric battery monitoring system and
I'll<00:04:17.959> put<00:04:18.109> a<00:04:18.140> link<00:04:18.350> on<00:04:18.560> the<00:04:19.100> blog<00:04:19.190> and<00:04:19.720> so

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
I'll put a link on the blog and so

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.580 
I'll put a link on the blog and so
you'll<00:04:20.900> know<00:04:21.049> where<00:04:21.950> to<00:04:22.130> look<00:04:22.250> for<00:04:22.460> it
