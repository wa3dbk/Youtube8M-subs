of<00:01:17.810> organic<00:01:18.810> spirulina<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:20.810> evolutionary

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
of organic spirulina the evolutionary

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.749 
of organic spirulina the evolutionary
health<00:01:22.140> brains

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
health brains

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.980 
health brains
so<00:01:23.759> someone<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.630> this<00:01:24.780> ones<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.320> market

and so buy organic barley grass and

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.490 
and so buy organic barley grass and
wheatgrass<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:33.140> have<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.170> lot<00:01:34.290> on<00:01:34.409> the
