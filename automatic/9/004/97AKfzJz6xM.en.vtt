part it's pretty limited I mean you know
simple<00:01:08.670> things<00:01:08.970> they<00:01:09.270> could<00:01:09.479> do<00:01:09.720> as<00:01:10.110> far<00:01:10.170> as

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
simple things they could do as far as

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.800 
simple things they could do as far as
giving<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.340> little<00:01:11.580> bit<00:01:11.820> more<00:01:12.090> with<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.570> color

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
giving a little bit more with the color

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.530 
giving a little bit more with the color
options<00:01:13.700> probably<00:01:14.700> would<00:01:14.880> have<00:01:14.970> made<00:01:15.240> them<00:01:15.509> a

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
options probably would have made them a

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.780 
options probably would have made them a
lot<00:01:15.960> more<00:01:15.990> money<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.740> know<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:17.220> if<00:01:17.430> there<00:01:17.670> were

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
lot more money I know that if there were

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.600 
lot more money I know that if there were
certain<00:01:18.270> colors<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:19.110> could<00:01:19.380> have<00:01:19.470> added<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:20.040> a

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
certain colors I could have added to a

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.359 
certain colors I could have added to a
bunch<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.509> different<00:01:22.020> shoes<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.890> would<00:01:23.250> have

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
bunch of different shoes I would have

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.020
