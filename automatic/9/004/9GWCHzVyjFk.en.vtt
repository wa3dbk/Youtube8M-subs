Memphis the FedEx Forum is going to just
be<00:00:30.510> rockin<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.289> really<00:00:31.650> think<00:00:31.800> Memphis<00:00:32.070> has

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
be rockin and I really think Memphis has

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.639 
be rockin and I really think Memphis has
a<00:00:32.730> lot<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.000> value<00:00:33.390> on<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.750> spread<00:00:34.050> however<00:00:34.410> I

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
a lot of value on the spread however I

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.350 
a lot of value on the spread however I
think<00:00:34.890> it's<00:00:35.160> probably<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.640> pretty<00:00:35.790> volatile

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
think it's probably a pretty volatile

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.850 
think it's probably a pretty volatile
wager<00:00:36.570> because<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.200> have<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.530> think<00:00:37.649> that

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
wager because you have to think that

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.139 
wager because you have to think that
Kevin<00:00:38.040> Durant's<00:00:38.489> greatness<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.940> going<00:00:39.090> to

Kevin Durant's greatness is going to

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.970 
Kevin Durant's greatness is going to
show<00:00:39.360> up<00:00:39.510> at<00:00:39.629> least<00:00:39.899> some<00:00:40.200> in<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.530> series<00:00:40.890> and

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
show up at least some in the series and

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.680 
show up at least some in the series and
it<00:00:41.070> could<00:00:41.250> be<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.550> game<00:00:41.790> six<00:00:42.120> performance

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
it could be in a game six performance

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.930 
it could be in a game six performance
which<00:00:43.110> he<00:00:43.320> hasn't<00:00:43.800> had<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.920> cut<00:00:44.100> as<00:00:44.250> had<00:00:44.579> many<00:00:44.789> of

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
which he hasn't had a cut as had many of

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.639 
which he hasn't had a cut as had many of
those<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.629> far<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:45.960> these<00:00:46.079> playoffs<00:00:46.410> now

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
those so far in these playoffs now

Memphis<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.160> 31<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.760> one<00:00:47.879> against<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.210> spread

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
Memphis is 31 and one against the spread

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.540 
Memphis is 31 and one against the spread
here<00:00:48.750> but<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:48.899> think<00:00:48.989> about<00:00:49.469> bet<00:00:49.770> on<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.039> total

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
here but I think about bet on the total

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.720 
here but I think about bet on the total
I've<00:00:51.539> 185<00:00:52.260> points<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.649> really<00:00:53.219> tempting<00:00:53.430> here

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
I've 185 points is really tempting here

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.310 
I've 185 points is really tempting here
because<00:00:53.969> it's<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.239> lowest<00:00:54.570> total<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.110> this

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
because it's the lowest total of this

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.350 
because it's the lowest total of this
series<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.920> we<00:00:56.129> correctly<00:00:56.460> pegged<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.000> over

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
series and we correctly pegged the over

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.200 
series and we correctly pegged the over
in<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.930> last<00:00:58.109> game<00:00:58.440> five<00:00:58.820> likely<00:00:59.820> because<00:01:00.090> of

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
in the last game five likely because of

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.720 
in the last game five likely because of
the<00:01:00.270> over<00:01:00.570> time<00:01:00.750> however<00:01:01.070> 185<00:01:02.070> points<00:01:02.280> still

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
the over time however 185 points still

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.759 
the over time however 185 points still
pretty<00:01:03.120> low<00:01:03.180> comparable<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.170> mismatches

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769

well<00:01:38.790> as<00:01:39.000> well<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.540> think<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.020> Grizzlies<00:01:40.470> here

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
well as well I think the Grizzlies here

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.440 
well as well I think the Grizzlies here
have<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.070> pretty<00:01:41.549> ability<00:01:42.060> pretty<00:01:42.299> good

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
have a pretty ability pretty good

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.510 
have a pretty ability pretty good
ability<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.899> score<00:01:43.110> points<00:01:43.350> here<00:01:43.619> but<00:01:43.770> 185

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
ability to score points here but 185

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.700 
ability to score points here but 185
points<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:45.270> very<00:01:45.659> very<00:01:45.899> low<00:01:46.170> all<00:01:46.380> they<00:01:46.619> would

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
points is very very low all they would

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.380 
points is very very low all they would
have<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.950> do<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.159> get<00:01:47.280> around<00:01:47.490> 90<00:01:47.790> for<00:01:47.970> 295

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
have to do is get around 90 for 295

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.480 
have to do is get around 90 for 295
points<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.869> assume<00:01:49.110> be<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.290> thunder<00:01:49.740> are<00:01:49.890> above

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
points and assume be a thunder are above

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.609 
points and assume be a thunder are above
90<00:01:50.880> points<00:01:51.060> as<00:01:51.329> well<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.990> would<00:01:52.170> cash<00:01:52.409> the

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
90 points as well that would cash the

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.130 
90 points as well that would cash the
over<00:01:52.829> rather<00:01:53.070> easily<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.700> 185<00:01:54.450> points<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.020> do

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
over rather easily in 185 points so I do

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.539 
over rather easily in 185 points so I do
think<00:01:55.380> there<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.590> books<00:01:55.890> have<00:01:56.040> just<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.340> little

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
think there the books have just a little

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.429 
think there the books have just a little
bit<00:01:56.640> overreacted<00:01:57.390> here<00:01:57.540> peg<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:57.990> one<00:01:58.200> lower

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
bit overreacted here peg this one lower

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.230 
bit overreacted here peg this one lower
than<00:01:59.009> what<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.310> could<00:01:59.490> be<00:01:59.520> despite<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.180> being

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
than what it could be despite this being

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.850 
than what it could be despite this being
an<00:02:00.509> elimination<00:02:01.049> game<00:02:01.079> despite<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.740> fact

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
an elimination game despite the fact

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.190 
an elimination game despite the fact
that<00:02:01.979> defenses<00:02:02.640> will<00:02:02.820> be<00:02:02.850> out<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.360> think<00:02:03.810> Durant

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
that defenses will be out I think Durant

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.780 
that defenses will be out I think Durant
is<00:02:04.350> finally<00:02:04.649> going<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.829> show<00:02:05.040> up<00:02:05.219> here<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.579> put

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
is finally going to show up here and put

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.249 
is finally going to show up here and put
his<00:02:05.909> mark<00:02:06.060> on<00:02:06.210> this<00:02:06.329> series<00:02:06.659> demand<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.110> ball

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
his mark on this series demand the ball

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.080 
his mark on this series demand the ball
more<00:02:07.469> from<00:02:07.680> Russell<00:02:07.829> Russell<00:02:08.280> Westbrook<00:02:08.970> who

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
more from Russell Russell Westbrook who

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.150 
more from Russell Russell Westbrook who
shot<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.479> ball<00:02:09.599> 31<00:02:10.170> times<00:02:10.470> in<00:02:10.739> Game<00:02:10.920> five

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
shot the ball 31 times in Game five

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.880 
shot the ball 31 times in Game five
scored<00:02:12.000> 30<00:02:12.209> points<00:02:12.300> however

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
scored 30 points however

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.110 
scored 30 points however
I<00:02:13.950> think<00:02:14.130> it<00:02:14.190> could<00:02:14.340> be<00:02:14.490> a<00:02:14.520> little<00:02:14.730> bit<00:02:14.880> more<00:02:15.030> of

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
I think it could be a little bit more of

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.309 
I think it could be a little bit more of
an<00:02:15.180> offensive<00:02:15.600> game<00:02:15.780> than<00:02:15.930> what<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.110> books

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
an offensive game than what the books

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.480 
an offensive game than what the books
are<00:02:16.440> projecting<00:02:16.830> here<00:02:16.980> so<00:02:17.069> I'm<00:02:17.190> going<00:02:17.400> with

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
are projecting here so I'm going with

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.300 
are projecting here so I'm going with
over<00:02:17.850> 185<00:02:18.750> points<00:02:19.020> between<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.920> Thunder<00:02:20.190> and
