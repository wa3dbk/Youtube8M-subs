 to the prf post this season 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:21.259
 everett 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:24.259
 the sacred mountain 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.949
 in the Himalayan mountain range andrea ronchi virtual half 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:33.749
 but it showed south 

00:00:33.749 --> 00:00:37.339
 by this way the minister of the routes explorers of the whole world 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.740
 he will be here for many is a dream 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.360
 too much pivot to be performed 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.800
 ride you need to carry 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.800
 in the item of first necessity 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.560
 v8 1850 meters 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.840
 in a challenge they are given up 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.510
 if until today 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.680
 eleven Brazilians managed to contemplate the look of the top of the world 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.760
 the first were valdemar niclevicz and show card in 1995 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.030
 vitor negrete experienced mountaineer died shortly after conquering the summit 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.790
 of evereste without supplemental oxygen in 2006 was only the fourth until then 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.660
 the cars santalina and cinnamon and entered this list 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.759
 the most remarkable moments of suspension will be great 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.820
 before the wheel fell very close to us 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.820
 when this occurs 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.149
 I like very close 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.200
 the reflex institute of medical discharge because it's only giving me why I'm 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.880
 write about security and ask for reforms 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.929
 other embezzlement is a remarkable experience but 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:09.929
 all this aside and I will help you with not very good throat 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:11.449
 these actions 

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:14.809
 some drugs in the base to look for this 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:19.889
 to climb even so it did not have the year bothered but it is not I do not like 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:29.579
 What was the moment? 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:33.090
 you choose day as one of the great moments of much emotion 

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:37.799
 the last 100 meters to reach the summit of evereste so a great 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.719
 because they are three years without heart 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:43.969
 and then you do a story acting in your head I remember that the 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:48.060
 biofuel you actually see are being carried out in Dalian at 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:49.249
 few steps 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:54.699
 the memory space very close - that same region according to many smaller ones 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:01.179
 government incentives 

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:03.309
 at the moment we're there 

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:06.759
 author of the gift book in spain 

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:08.629
 the body no longer feels so much 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.199
 the most dangerous physical cost of chelsea 

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:15.559
 We're getting in that club felt bad. 

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:18.559
 the clown 

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:30.660
 at the age of 24 carlos santalena 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.079
 became the youngest Brazilian to win the 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.559
 little different 

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:42.389
 already for carlos canelas to get there meant to win a tragedy 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.739
 the personal challenge of overcoming 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.989
 I broke the strong arm of today 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.359
 I was moving 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:53.349
 pasta and chair and it ended up falling 2010 that the ones in the arm 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:54.490
 he had a 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.939
 an injury of three exposed fractures 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:57.980
 virtually 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.189
 not that they preceded the accident 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:04.079
 turned the match and the table of surgery and according to the French doctor for 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:04.969
 another arm 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:07.969
 and take the works 

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:15.640
 potiguar he prepared the duo 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.079
 and organized the expedition 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.449
 he reached the summit of Everest for the second time 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:24.210
 but your goal is to believe 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.979
 was what had the goal of not only that it wears more inequality 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:30.990
 to please forward 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.889
 besides him two more companions and the fans 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.599
 to get off 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:39.599
 with her 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.039
 rodrigo has already managed to take off from the summit of the bento hill in the French Alps and has 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:52.039
 only half the altitude of evereste 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:57.379
 changed the way we see the mountains in the church a place to 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:58.180
 to arrive 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.219
 now the boy is breaking up 

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:03.800
 according to joÃ£o pessoa and to have put all of them 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.669
 but it was to continue working 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:08.469
 an important detail 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:12.789
 the three mountaineers conquer the evereste making use of a CG in the 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:15.789
 additional 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:22.110
 Congratulations 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.900
 that's the car 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.210
 the whole race 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.210
 I was happy here 

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:34.809
 you 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.150
 without much success 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.150
 the upcoming elections who knows 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.180
 have a party 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.090
 everett 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.659
 the mountain that challenges man 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:58.659
 thus challenging 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.400
 the karate would recover fighting for the revolt released 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.809
 I think this life you can never say yes never 

00:06:25.809 --> 00:06:27.960
 so not in the year 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.550
 the other one heavy 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.870
 after landing 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.630
 with preparation that I know is very necessary however the delegate 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.900
 I'll have to be careful with my way of being.
