kind of a diverted way it means that

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.880 
kind of a diverted way it means that
your<00:00:50.910> computer<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.390> connecting<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:51.989> another

a company for example and the reason why

a company for example and the reason why
companies<00:01:03.899> use<00:01:04.260> proxies<00:01:05.060> well<00:01:06.060> two<00:01:06.360> reasons

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
companies use proxies well two reasons

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.310 
companies use proxies well two reasons
two<00:01:07.110> main<00:01:07.320> reasons<00:01:07.500> one<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.850> prevent<00:01:09.320> any

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
two main reasons one is to prevent any

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.460 
two main reasons one is to prevent any
viruses<00:01:11.189> from<00:01:11.340> your<00:01:11.580> computer<00:01:12.090> from<00:01:12.470> getting

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
viruses from your computer from getting

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.120 
viruses from your computer from getting
to<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.130> competitor<00:01:14.790> company's<00:01:15.240> computers<00:01:16.229> so

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
to the competitor company's computers so

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.830 
to the competitor company's computers so
by<00:01:17.310> having<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:17.880> little<00:01:18.210> computer<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:18.689> the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
by having that little computer in the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.490 
by having that little computer in the
middle<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.170> talks<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.159> your<00:01:20.310> computer<00:01:20.850> it

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
middle that talks to your computer it

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.440 
middle that talks to your computer it
actually<00:01:22.500> blocks<00:01:22.880> anything<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.060> might<00:01:24.240> be

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
actually blocks anything that might be

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.170 
actually blocks anything that might be
unusual<00:01:25.040> another<00:01:26.040> reason<00:01:26.430> why<00:01:26.580> proxies<00:01:27.150> are

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
unusual another reason why proxies are

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.740 
unusual another reason why proxies are
used<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:28.290> let<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.400> IT<00:01:29.610> department<00:01:30.509> for

used is to let the IT department for

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
different connections companies tend to

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.730 
different connections companies tend to
have<00:01:38.009> very<00:01:38.040> secure<00:01:38.970> networks<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.689> are<00:01:40.290> very

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
have very secure networks and are very

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.330 
have very secure networks and are very
very<00:01:41.070> scared<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.990> being<00:01:42.990> hijacked<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.159> way

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
very scared of being hijacked in a way

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.200 
very scared of being hijacked in a way
or<00:01:44.990> losing<00:01:45.990> data<00:01:46.229> or<00:01:46.530> having<00:01:47.040> someone<00:01:47.369> hack

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
or losing data or having someone hack

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.960 
or losing data or having someone hack
into<00:01:48.600> their<00:01:48.960> own<00:01:49.229> networks<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:50.640> by<00:01:50.759> using

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
into their own networks so by using

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.190 
into their own networks so by using
proxies<00:01:51.750> they<00:01:52.439> can<00:01:52.860> see<00:01:53.610> what<00:01:54.390> people<00:01:54.840> are

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
proxies they can see what people are

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.969 
proxies they can see what people are
actually<00:01:55.530> doing<00:01:56.329> monitor<00:01:57.329> what<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:58.020> happening

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
actually doing monitor what is happening

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.010 
actually doing monitor what is happening
even<00:01:59.640> if<00:01:59.850> you<00:01:59.939> didn't<00:02:00.180> have<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.390> proxy<00:02:00.899> you

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
even if you didn't have a proxy you

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.810 
even if you didn't have a proxy you
could<00:02:01.200> still<00:02:01.530> see<00:02:02.159> but<00:02:03.590> proxies<00:02:04.590> help<00:02:05.009> make

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
could still see but proxies help make

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.229 
could still see but proxies help make
that<00:02:06.030> even<00:02:06.750> more<00:02:07.140> secure<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:08.459> how<00:02:08.670> do<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:09.030> add

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
that even more secure so how do you add

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.660 
that even more secure so how do you add
a<00:02:09.270> proxy<00:02:10.020> setting<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.800> when<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.039> was<00:02:11.220> like<00:02:11.370> I

a proxy setting to when I was like I

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.000 
a proxy setting to when I was like I
have<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.629> do<00:02:12.780> is<00:02:12.989> go<00:02:13.170> into<00:02:13.319> your

by<00:02:36.090> default<00:02:36.840> there's<00:02:37.470> automatic<00:02:38.250> detection

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
by default there's automatic detection

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.350 
by default there's automatic detection
of<00:02:39.060> proxies<00:02:39.810> but<00:02:40.049> you<00:02:40.980> will<00:02:41.190> sometimes<00:02:41.849> need

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
of proxies but you will sometimes need

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.160 
of proxies but you will sometimes need
to<00:02:42.540> add<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:43.049> special<00:02:43.769> address<00:02:44.330> for<00:02:45.330> a<00:02:45.629> workplace

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
to add a special address for a workplace

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.070 
to add a special address for a workplace
for<00:02:46.380> example<00:02:46.950> so<00:02:47.760> you<00:02:47.790> have<00:02:48.180> two<00:02:48.599> ways<00:02:48.780> of

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
for example so you have two ways of

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.280 
for example so you have two ways of
doing<00:02:49.170> it<00:02:49.739> you<00:02:50.340> can<00:02:50.670> either<00:02:51.060> go<00:02:51.569> into<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.989> auto

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
doing it you can either go into the auto

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.550 
doing it you can either go into the auto
config<00:02:53.160> that<00:02:53.190> is<00:02:53.430> already<00:02:53.670> there<00:02:54.000> or<00:02:54.319> you<00:02:55.319> can

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
config that is already there or you can

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.309 
config that is already there or you can
use<00:02:55.950> an<00:02:56.160> automatic<00:02:56.549> configuration<00:02:57.110> script<00:02:58.110> a

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
use an automatic configuration script a

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.380 
use an automatic configuration script a
lot<00:02:58.590> of<00:02:58.680> companies<00:02:59.040> use<00:02:59.250> that<00:02:59.489> so<00:03:00.030> you'll<00:03:00.180> have

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
lot of companies use that so you'll have

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.020 
lot of companies use that so you'll have
to<00:03:00.630> basically<00:03:01.200> turn<00:03:01.709> this<00:03:01.920> slider<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.340> on<00:03:02.670> and

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
to basically turn this slider to on and

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.839 
to basically turn this slider to on and
in<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.810> script<00:03:04.140> address<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:04.829> will<00:03:05.010> type<00:03:05.340> the

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
in the script address you will type the

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.550 
in the script address you will type the
address<00:03:06.000> that<00:03:06.569> the<00:03:07.230> company<00:03:08.209> gave<00:03:09.209> you<00:03:09.560> to

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
address that the company gave you to

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.300 
address that the company gave you to
access<00:03:11.329> their<00:03:12.500> settings<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.739> you'll<00:03:14.099> then

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
access their settings and you'll then

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.170 
access their settings and you'll then
click<00:03:14.610> Save<00:03:15.680> you<00:03:16.680> can<00:03:16.890> also<00:03:17.190> have<00:03:17.970> a<00:03:18.000> different

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
click Save you can also have a different

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.900 
click Save you can also have a different
types<00:03:18.750> of<00:03:18.989> proxy<00:03:19.560> which<00:03:19.769> is<00:03:19.950> a<00:03:19.980> manual<00:03:20.579> proxy

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
types of proxy which is a manual proxy

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.050 
types of proxy which is a manual proxy
so<00:03:21.720> you<00:03:21.780> might<00:03:22.049> also<00:03:22.380> need<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.280> use<00:03:23.519> a<00:03:23.730> proxy

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
so you might also need to use a proxy

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.900 
so you might also need to use a proxy
server<00:03:24.510> so<00:03:25.049> you'll<00:03:25.170> have<00:03:25.319> to<00:03:25.440> turn<00:03:25.620> that<00:03:25.680> on

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
server so you'll have to turn that on

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.640 
server so you'll have to turn that on
give<00:03:26.910> out<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.329> address<00:03:27.600> of<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.019> proxy<00:03:28.230> server

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
give out the address of the proxy server

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.190 
give out the address of the proxy server
the<00:03:29.340> port<00:03:29.700> that<00:03:29.970> is<00:03:30.030> going<00:03:30.389> to<00:03:30.450> be<00:03:30.600> used<00:03:30.930> for

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
the port that is going to be used for

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.000 
the port that is going to be used for
the<00:03:31.290> proxy<00:03:31.530> server<00:03:31.889> and<00:03:32.250> all<00:03:33.030> sorts<00:03:33.660> of<00:03:34.010> little

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
the proxy server and all sorts of little

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.420 
the proxy server and all sorts of little
data<00:03:35.600> that<00:03:36.600> might<00:03:36.870> be<00:03:37.170> necessary<00:03:37.680> depending

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
data that might be necessary depending

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.789 
data that might be necessary depending
on<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.000> type<00:03:39.239> of<00:03:39.269> connection<00:03:39.720> that<00:03:40.109> you<00:03:40.650> need

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
on the type of connection that you need

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.809 
on the type of connection that you need

to establish with your workplace or the
distant<00:03:45.440> computer<00:03:46.440> and<00:03:46.910> so<00:03:49.519> you<00:03:50.519> have

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
distant computer and so you have

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.900 
distant computer and so you have
different<00:03:51.870> settings<00:03:52.079> you<00:03:52.290> can<00:03:52.470> also<00:03:52.880> put<00:03:53.880> a

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
different settings you can also put a

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.940 
different settings you can also put a
little<00:03:54.000> checkmark<00:03:54.959> don't<00:03:55.139> use<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.500> proxy
