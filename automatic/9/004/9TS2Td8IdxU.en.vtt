00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
be his like layer cuz it looks like it I

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.609 
be his like layer cuz it looks like it I
mean<00:01:27.060> look<00:01:27.180> how<00:01:27.299> cool<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:27.689> place<00:01:27.750> looks<00:01:28.049> he

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
mean look how cool this place looks he

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.560 
mean look how cool this place looks he
could<00:01:28.799> be<00:01:28.950> like<00:01:29.130> right<00:01:29.369> here<00:01:29.790> that's<00:01:30.330> what<00:01:30.450> I'm

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
could be like right here that's what I'm

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.330 
could be like right here that's what I'm
thinking<00:01:30.689> he<00:01:31.020> might<00:01:31.140> spawn<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.890> or<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.189> this

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
thinking he might spawn it or in this

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.460 
thinking he might spawn it or in this
area<00:01:32.670> cuz<00:01:32.850> there's<00:01:33.000> nothing<00:01:33.330> back<00:01:33.509> here<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:34.439> I

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
area cuz there's nothing back here so I

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.810 
area cuz there's nothing back here so I
do<00:01:34.560> think<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.070> could<00:01:35.130> be<00:01:35.430> one<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.670> his

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
do think that this could be one of his

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.660 
do think that this could be one of his
possible<00:01:36.360> locations<00:01:36.990> or<00:01:37.229> on<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.100> very<00:01:38.340> far

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
possible locations or on the very far

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.249 
possible locations or on the very far

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
could cost 100 strange coins for all I

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.950 
could cost 100 strange coins for all I
know<00:02:04.969> but<00:02:05.969> we<00:02:06.030> just<00:02:06.060> have<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.329> figure<00:02:06.479> out<00:02:06.659> what

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
know but we just have to figure out what

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.600 
know but we just have to figure out what
happens<00:02:07.350> there<00:02:07.680> we<00:02:08.100> could<00:02:08.250> just<00:02:08.399> spawn

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
happens there we could just spawn

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.180 
happens there we could just spawn
randomly<00:02:08.880> this<00:02:09.329> guy<00:02:09.479> could<00:02:09.660> respond<00:02:10.079> at<00:02:10.380> any

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
randomly this guy could respond at any

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.730 
randomly this guy could respond at any
point<00:02:11.579> of<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.790> mat<00:02:12.060> I'm<00:02:12.299> not<00:02:12.420> even<00:02:12.630> joking

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
point of the mat I'm not even joking

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.980 
point of the mat I'm not even joking
so<00:02:14.310> we<00:02:14.430> go<00:02:14.520> all<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.790> way<00:02:14.850> over<00:02:15.210> to<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.420> left

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
so we go all the way over to the left

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.290 
so we go all the way over to the left
side<00:02:16.770> of<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.890> map<00:02:17.040> which<00:02:17.370> I<00:02:17.490> think<00:02:17.670> there's<00:02:18.180> a

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
side of the map which I think there's a

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.940 
side of the map which I think there's a
spot<00:02:18.600> over<00:02:18.720> here<00:02:18.840> that<00:02:19.020> he<00:02:19.110> might<00:02:19.380> spawn<00:02:19.710> at

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
spot over here that he might spawn at

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.480 
spot over here that he might spawn at
I'm<00:02:20.490> not<00:02:20.790> for<00:02:21.030> sure<00:02:21.230> but<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.350> might<00:02:22.920> spawn<00:02:23.220> over

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
I'm not for sure but it might spawn over

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.560 
I'm not for sure but it might spawn over
here<00:02:23.640> guys<00:02:23.820> I'm<00:02:24.030> just<00:02:24.180> showing<00:02:24.300> you<00:02:24.420> this

know he's not gonna be in there and over
there<00:02:46.560> there's<00:02:46.890> a<00:02:46.950> vendor<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:47.340> he's<00:02:47.460> not<00:02:47.520> gonna

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
there there's a vendor so he's not gonna

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.000 
there there's a vendor so he's not gonna
be<00:02:47.700> back<00:02:47.940> there<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:49.230> right<00:02:49.380> there's<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.710> vendor

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
be back there and right there's a vendor

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.170 
be back there and right there's a vendor
but<00:02:50.130> he<00:02:50.220> might<00:02:50.340> be<00:02:50.400> down<00:02:50.610> here<00:02:50.670> too<00:02:51.000> i<00:02:51.030> don't

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
but he might be down here too i don't

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.420 
but he might be down here too i don't
know<00:02:51.360> those<00:02:52.200> are<00:02:52.290> like<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.410> three<00:02:52.530> major

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
know those are like the three major

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.070 
know those are like the three major
points<00:02:53.970> because<00:02:54.150> there's<00:02:54.300> no<00:02:54.420> other<00:02:54.450> vendors

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
points because there's no other vendors

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.800 
points because there's no other vendors
around<00:02:55.200> them<00:02:55.670> so<00:02:56.670> those<00:02:56.850> those<00:02:57.210> points<00:02:57.630> guys

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
around them so those those points guys

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.230 
around them so those those points guys
will<00:02:57.990> be<00:02:58.140> I<00:02:58.380> guess<00:02:59.160> like<00:02:59.340> very<00:02:59.700> like<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.000> big

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
will be I guess like very like the big

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.150 
will be I guess like very like the big
points<00:03:00.660> or<00:03:00.870> at<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.200> very<00:03:01.230> back<00:03:01.740> of<00:03:01.800> the<00:03:01.950> map

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
points or at the very back of the map

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.650 
points or at the very back of the map
