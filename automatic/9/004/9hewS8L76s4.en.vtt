00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.639
 Y 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.780
 this is ours 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.729
 and we are enjoying it over 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.350
 with all the cast of comedians that there is in 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.109
 the program I think the secret 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:27.240
 apart is that we are all friends outside 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:29.310
 of the program and in the program only 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.420
 we know to be the people that we are outside and 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.069
 then it's like they're watching your 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.630
 friends with you have a problem with 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:35.610
 your friends and your friends all at the end 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.079
 he says is that they are from my group are my 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.759
 colleagues doing things and that 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.380
 spirit is what we have in the 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.729
 scenarios and out and we keep it and 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.729
 I think those people 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.780
 record a program that will capture the 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.700
 essence of the room really when 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.610
 let's act up the little ones that 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.680
 there is really the natural site and it opens 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.420
 not only are we going to have monologueists 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.679
 classics we're also going to have the 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.630
 numbers of varieties we want to have in 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.820
 tell jokes that were also here in 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.060
 a little bit reviled and then we're going to 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.800
 have a thing that Eduardo aldÃ¡n already 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.239
 I wanted to make a 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.190
 tarantino and that is to make a tarantin or 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.380
 a tarantino is recovering comedians 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.720
 classics get into another 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.720
 packaged and enjoy them 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.010
 worrying 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.690
 all others 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.340
 of cases and I think we have not seen it in 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.410
 another program I should say in more than 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.910
 no thing will be all 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.060
 codes that you can imagine in the 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.720
 head from before now and forever to 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.440
 we 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.440
 you are not with me 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.810
 well yes
