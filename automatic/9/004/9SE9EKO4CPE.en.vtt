00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:08.320
 hello youtube friends 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:12.350
 Well today I 'm going to teach you how to make a 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:15.980
 picture of flowers looks really true 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:19.440
 pretty original very good what are we going to 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.400
 need is going to be pencil 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.400
 we are going to need 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:33.230
 glue in bar or liquid 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:36.220
 in a good rib me this since 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.420
 I have this 600 milliliter coca cola 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:42.019
 you have a cup of 3 but you have 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:45.820
 as with a flower below a 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:45.820
 container where to put paint 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.109
 and preferably painting is pink 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.210
 good and also has a cardboard 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:05.570
 and they 're going to hurt in half see 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.570
 something like that 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:20.570
 well the first thing that is done in which 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.570
 the containers we are going to paint 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.890
 that is not a little paint 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.050
 A) Yes 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:39.390
 with my old man who already had 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:44.790
 this and this explains 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:47.510
 Now let's put our rib 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.640
 even though 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.640
 because I have so you 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.370
 and on our cardboard already folded 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.990
 let's put it like this 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.990
 so and so easy 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.290
 that looks like this 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.930
 puts like in my case it does not look very good 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.659
 the 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.659
 and middle center we closed painting 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:31.740
 preferably in oslo on something firm 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:36.470
 because if we do not get wet with others 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:38.150
 petals we grow the center itself 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.210
 you can put the flowers that 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.810
 want in a single a mini box like 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.810
 you want 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.170
 yes 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:58.380
 with the other petals as we get him 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:00.330
 he always puts us like that 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.550
 well now let's wait for it 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.550
 dry our flowers 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.530
 good that when it's a little bit more 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:14.210
 dry not total we can do it 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.210
 we connect pencil like the branches 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:22.670
 the branches to where you drive 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.670
 its flowers 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:34.400
 and as well as Swedish 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.400
 which are branches 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.150
 we would have something like that 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.800
 after that we're also that when 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.800
 he entered like a coffee 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.750
 everyone 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.959
 try to make the branches towards 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.549
 thinner flowers thinner than 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.620
 original branch 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.139
 so that 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.350
 you see more the impression that they are ones or 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.350
 plus 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:44.730
 and this is how this is going to be 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:53.889
 then we're going to make you look like you're 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.870
 curves were like that and so 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:58.830
 cannes who is capable of giving the 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.830
 impression that is the flower 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.380
 this is not going to be very simple and 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.940
 very fast 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.870
 you can load the cardboard of 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.870
 color that you like 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.280
 in my case it's a whole card 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:20.040
 fold in half 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.040
 flames bond with the resistol 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.050
 they are sticking 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.139
 from scratch 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:42.129
 can you put more here 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.710
 I'm going to put a little more 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:49.830
 but as a rule 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:51.870
 of 30 centimeters I'm marking here 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:55.770
 does not find that the rule has like 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:57.820
 this little space from here to the 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:01.110
 number 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.110
 I do not know if they are going to put 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:09.680
 well and with a down that you 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.880
 want 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.880
 when you brand 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:22.789
 they take them inventing things 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.789
 keeps everything together 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:30.370
 everything is missing 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.370
 and then have something like that 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.810
 and then you can paint it 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:44.570
 that depends a lot on your activity your 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.570
 imagination 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:55.190
 to 

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:18.130
 understands that when you want it to be 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.570
 dry your flowers do not put it like this 

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:25.030
 I stopped but because if not 

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:25.030
 droplets of flowers can drain 

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:32.219
 and so we have left 

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:36.830
 well this has been all for today many 

00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:36.830
 thank you and I wait for you tomorrow goodbye
