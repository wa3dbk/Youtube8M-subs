 the end of food is in fashion that is 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.040
 those individual portions that you 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.320

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:21.359
 that besides being a dessert that of 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.490
 future because it is too high is very 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.769
 more very practical 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.550
 today the line of pickers is also 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.090
 a lot of practice is very supportive 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:37.140
 so I took a small container 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:40.290
 I'm going to put a cookie 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.270
 plus she always left a little bit 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.539

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.300

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:52.020

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.280
 especially this I will put of cream 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.800
 of milk 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.800
 So he calls if that cookie 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:14.320

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:17.450
 27 - milk candy can buy ready 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.680
 You can cook a can of milk. 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.350
 condensed 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.820
 Our goal is to have a jelly a cream 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.890
 What do you have at home? 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.210

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:36.920
 public is very good when you are 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:42.070
 to kill a peek in the photo is a water 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:47.390
 and it makes it easy for you to distribute this 12 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:50.920
 And then you will exactly do it. 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.979
 can be dried dried fruits given 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.530
 nothing beats a ready meal 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.509
 that already comes with that flavor and I chose 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.080
 what is loose 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:10.910

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.680
 a neatest touch to the people 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.140

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.720

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.329
 incredible range of prints and colors and I

 put on 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:41.170

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.780
