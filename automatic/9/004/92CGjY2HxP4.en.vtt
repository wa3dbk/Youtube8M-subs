00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:03.409 

okay<00:00:01.709> in<00:00:01.829> this<00:00:01.949> tutorial<00:00:02.159> we'll<00:00:02.970> take<00:00:03.179> a<00:00:03.210> look

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
okay in this tutorial we'll take a look

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.749 
okay in this tutorial we'll take a look
at<00:00:03.510> adding<00:00:03.659> spotlights<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:04.890> scene<00:00:05.130> now

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
at adding spotlights to the scene now

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.360 
at adding spotlights to the scene now
I've<00:00:06.540> tried<00:00:06.930> this<00:00:07.080> before<00:00:07.140> with<00:00:07.710> traditional

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
I've tried this before with traditional

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.919 
I've tried this before with traditional
spotlights<00:00:08.910> that<00:00:09.030> you<00:00:09.179> would<00:00:09.300> use<00:00:09.510> with<00:00:09.719> in

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
spotlights that you would use with in

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.900 
spotlights that you would use with in
blender<00:00:10.320> render<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:10.860> if<00:00:11.190> you<00:00:11.309> would<00:00:11.460> come<00:00:11.730> in

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
blender render and if you would come in

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.450 
blender render and if you would come in
and<00:00:12.830> say<00:00:13.830> added<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:15.890> traditional<00:00:16.890> spot<00:00:17.160> lamp

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
and say added a traditional spot lamp

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.760 
and say added a traditional spot lamp
like<00:00:18.000> that<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.570> scene<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.560> kind<00:00:19.710> of

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
like that to the scene and it kind of

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.529 
like that to the scene and it kind of
looks<00:00:19.949> like<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:20.279> might<00:00:20.460> work<00:00:20.490> because<00:00:21.330> if<00:00:21.449> I

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
looks like it might work because if I

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.349 
looks like it might work because if I
change<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.260> say<00:00:22.439> green<00:00:22.800> in<00:00:23.130> here<00:00:24.060> went

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
change this to say green in here went

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.529 
change this to say green in here went
back<00:00:24.539> into<00:00:24.750> blender<00:00:25.170> cycles<00:00:25.590> like<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:26.820> that

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
back into blender cycles like that that

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.929 
back into blender cycles like that that
will<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.439> converted<00:00:29.279> over<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.550> using

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
will and I you converted over to using

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.620 
will and I you converted over to using
nodes<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.689> then<00:00:31.380> maybe<00:00:32.450> cranked<00:00:33.450> up<00:00:33.570> the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
nodes and then maybe cranked up the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.720 
nodes and then maybe cranked up the
intensity<00:00:34.290> well<00:00:34.800> then<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.040> green<00:00:35.280> comes<00:00:35.520> to

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
intensity well then the green comes to

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.600 
intensity well then the green comes to
life<00:00:35.940> but<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:37.320> reality<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:38.040> turns<00:00:38.250> out<00:00:38.460> that

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
life but in reality it turns out that

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.250 
life but in reality it turns out that
it's<00:00:38.760> not<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.969> spotlight<00:00:39.450> at<00:00:39.629> all<00:00:39.780> it's<00:00:40.170> just

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
it's not a spotlight at all it's just

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.950 
it's not a spotlight at all it's just
though<00:00:40.620> it's<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:42.180> looks<00:00:42.300> like<00:00:42.600> what<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.780> does

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
though it's it looks like what it does

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.569 
though it's it looks like what it does
it<00:00:43.110> just<00:00:43.140> takes<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.710> as<00:00:43.829> an<00:00:43.920> object<00:00:44.100> and

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
it just takes it as an object and

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.779 
it just takes it as an object and
creates<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.570> light<00:00:46.140> from<00:00:46.680> an<00:00:46.829> object<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.460> I

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
creates a light from an object and I

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.389 
creates a light from an object and I
verify<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.510> because<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:49.110> have<00:00:49.829> like<00:00:50.160> for

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
verify that because I have like for

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.920 
verify that because I have like for
instance<00:00:50.730> this<00:00:50.969> light<00:00:51.210> up<00:00:51.360> here<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.660> can<00:00:51.780> see

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
instance this light up here you can see

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.529 
instance this light up here you can see
if<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.050> crank<00:00:52.320> up<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.649> intensity<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.789> the

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
if I crank up the intensity it the

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.569 
if I crank up the intensity it the
intensity<00:00:55.079> comes<00:00:55.800> up<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.129> same<00:00:56.340> on<00:00:56.550> both

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
intensity comes up the same on both

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.549 
intensity comes up the same on both
objects<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.449> it's<00:00:57.570> obviously<00:00:57.899> not<00:00:58.109> pointing

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
objects so it's obviously not pointing

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.910 
objects so it's obviously not pointing
in<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.969> direction<00:01:00.140> and<00:01:01.140> even<00:01:01.620> if<00:01:01.710> we<00:01:01.829> had

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
in that direction and even if we had

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.889 
in that direction and even if we had
gone<00:01:02.070> back<00:01:02.219> into<00:01:02.579> blender<00:01:02.969> render<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.719> gone

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
gone back into blender render and gone

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.990 
gone back into blender render and gone
down<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.409> spot<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.979> change<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.850> say

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
down to the spot and change this to say

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.420 
down to the spot and change this to say
a<00:01:06.030> 5<00:01:06.299> degree<00:01:06.510> angle<00:01:06.960> for<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.320> spot<00:01:08.040> like<00:01:08.250> that

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
a 5 degree angle for that spot like that

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.460 
a 5 degree angle for that spot like that
we<00:01:08.610> would<00:01:08.729> expect<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.270> more<00:01:09.510> direct<00:01:09.869> light

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
we would expect a more direct light

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.770 
we would expect a more direct light
focused<00:01:11.130> at<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.430> location<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.260> then<00:01:13.260> if<00:01:13.409> we

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
focused at that location and then if we

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.149 
focused at that location and then if we
went<00:01:15.780> back<00:01:15.869> into<00:01:16.229> here<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:18.560> would<00:01:19.560> my<00:01:19.740> light<00:01:19.890> go

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
went back into here I would my light go

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.100 
went back into here I would my light go
where<00:01:20.970> did<00:01:21.360> my<00:01:21.450> light<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.630> would<00:01:21.750> turn<00:01:21.990> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
where did my light I would turn the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.929 
where did my light I would turn the
light<00:01:22.290> down<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:22.650> I'll<00:01:22.740> turn<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.040> back<00:01:23.159> up<00:01:23.189> well

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
light down so I'll turn it back up well

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.240 
light down so I'll turn it back up well
you<00:01:24.540> see<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.840> doesn't<00:01:25.200> there's<00:01:25.710> no<00:01:25.799> focus

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
you see it doesn't there's no focus

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.039 
you see it doesn't there's no focus
light<00:01:26.460> there<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.150> spotlights<00:01:27.600> don't<00:01:27.869> work

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
light there so the spotlights don't work

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.890 
light there so the spotlights don't work
and<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.409> like<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.950> would<00:01:29.150> might<00:01:30.150> expect<00:01:30.479> so

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
and it like you would might expect so

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.660 
and it like you would might expect so
what<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.350> order<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.770> make<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:31.979> spot<00:01:32.310> just<00:01:32.549> in

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
what in order to make a spot just in

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.130 
what in order to make a spot just in
case<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:32.909> haven't<00:01:33.090> seen<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.450> tutorials<00:01:33.960> that

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
case you haven't seen the tutorials that

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.080 
case you haven't seen the tutorials that
I<00:01:34.259> don't<00:01:34.829> own<00:01:34.950> how<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.130> create<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> gallery<00:01:35.610> spot

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
I don't own how to create a gallery spot

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.969 
I don't own how to create a gallery spot
lamp<00:01:36.329> like<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.810> did<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.200> couple<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.619> we're<00:01:37.740> kind

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
lamp like I did a couple that we're kind

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.830 
lamp like I did a couple that we're kind
of<00:01:38.040> similar<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.579> what<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.479> need<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.720> do

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
of similar to that what you need to do

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.990 
of similar to that what you need to do
is<00:01:40.170> make<00:01:40.710> your<00:01:40.860> own<00:01:40.979> kind<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.400> spots<00:01:41.670> and

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
is make your own kind of spots and

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.819 
is make your own kind of spots and
here's<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.570> light<00:01:42.840> light<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.530> can<00:01:43.680> see

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
here's a light light and you can see

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.380 
here's a light light and you can see
this<00:01:43.979> has<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.189> yellow<00:01:44.460> light<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.270> a

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
this has a yellow light in it this is a

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.999 
this has a yellow light in it this is a
little<00:01:45.659> lamp<00:01:45.960> just<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.259> little<00:01:46.470> cylindrical

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
little lamp just a little cylindrical

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.179 
little lamp just a little cylindrical
lamp<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.520> notice<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:49.049> has<00:01:49.290> some<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.100> this

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
lamp and notice it has some of this

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.660 
lamp and notice it has some of this
yellow<00:01:50.640> light<00:01:50.880> up<00:01:51.119> here<00:01:51.450> as<00:01:51.570> well<00:01:52.070> but<00:01:53.070> it's

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
yellow light up here as well but it's

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.850 
yellow light up here as well but it's
not<00:01:53.880> nearly<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.420> same<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:55.110> what<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.829> this

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
not nearly the same so what this is this

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.130 
not nearly the same so what this is this
is<00:01:56.280> just<00:01:56.549> from<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.090> ray<00:01:57.299> tracer<00:01:57.570> itself<00:01:57.990> it's

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
is just from the ray tracer itself it's

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.840 
is just from the ray tracer itself it's
just<00:01:58.320> reflecting<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.040> light<00:01:59.070> back<00:01:59.430> up<00:01:59.640> here

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
just reflecting the light back up here

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.359 
just reflecting the light back up here
because<00:01:59.880> in<00:02:00.509> case<00:02:01.409> you're<00:02:01.560> not<00:02:01.680> an<00:02:01.770> artist

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
because in case you're not an artist

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.980 
because in case you're not an artist
type<00:02:02.579> which<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.820> suspect<00:02:03.210> most<00:02:03.299> most<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.899> you

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
type which I suspect most most of you

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.450 
type which I suspect most most of you
are<00:02:04.110> but<00:02:04.290> some<00:02:04.439> of<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.649> might<00:02:04.770> not<00:02:04.979> be<00:02:05.159> if

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
are but some of you might not be if

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.190 
are but some of you might not be if
you're<00:02:05.549> not<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.700> trained<00:02:06.000> artist<00:02:06.149> light<00:02:06.869> you

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
you're not a trained artist light you

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.320 
you're not a trained artist light you
know<00:02:07.320> from<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.619> sky<00:02:07.829> hits<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.280> ground<00:02:08.489> the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
know from the sky hits the ground the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.300 
know from the sky hits the ground the
green<00:02:09.780> from<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.110> ground<00:02:10.470> grass<00:02:10.920> also

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
green from the ground grass also

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.520 
green from the ground grass also
reflects<00:02:11.970> back<00:02:12.209> up<00:02:12.450> on<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.690> other<00:02:12.810> objects<00:02:13.440> so

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
reflects back up on the other objects so

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.880 
reflects back up on the other objects so
everything

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
everything

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.710 
everything
kind<00:02:14.040> of<00:02:14.130> reflects<00:02:14.550> all<00:02:14.880> over<00:02:15.330> each<00:02:15.420> other<00:02:15.630> and

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
kind of reflects all over each other and

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.840 
kind of reflects all over each other and
that<00:02:15.870> is<00:02:16.140> what<00:02:16.710> we're<00:02:16.860> seeing<00:02:17.069> here<00:02:17.520> in<00:02:17.700> this

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
that is what we're seeing here in this

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.360 
that is what we're seeing here in this
case<00:02:18.090> but<00:02:18.569> to<00:02:18.600> make<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.959> spot<00:02:19.230> all<00:02:20.040> I<00:02:20.220> had<00:02:20.340> done

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
case but to make the spot all I had done

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.540 
case but to make the spot all I had done
was<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:21.030> had<00:02:21.720> taken<00:02:21.840> an<00:02:22.290> existing<00:02:22.860> cylinder<00:02:23.370> and

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
was I had taken an existing cylinder and

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.890 
was I had taken an existing cylinder and
I<00:02:23.819> cut<00:02:24.060> out<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.209> bottom<00:02:24.510> of<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.690> cylinder

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
I cut out the bottom of the cylinder

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.990 
I cut out the bottom of the cylinder
let's<00:02:25.590> go<00:02:25.830> into<00:02:26.040> material<00:02:26.459> mode<00:02:26.580> just<00:02:26.760> for<00:02:26.940> a

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
let's go into material mode just for a

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.330 
let's go into material mode just for a
second

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
second

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.160 
second
I'll<00:02:29.340> go<00:02:29.490> look<00:02:29.700> at<00:02:29.790> that<00:02:29.940> up<00:02:30.060> close<00:02:30.090> all<00:02:31.020> right

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
I'll go look at that up close all right

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.080 
I'll go look at that up close all right
so<00:02:31.320> here's<00:02:31.530> our<00:02:31.680> cylinder<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.670> knocked<00:02:32.940> out

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
so here's our cylinder and I knocked out

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.510 
so here's our cylinder and I knocked out
the<00:02:33.180> bottom<00:02:33.630> of<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:33.870> in<00:02:34.020> here<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.590> then<00:02:35.130> up

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
the bottom of it in here and then up

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.420 
the bottom of it in here and then up
inside<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.570> have<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.930> disc<00:02:37.350> that<00:02:37.620> was<00:02:38.070> from<00:02:38.310> the

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
inside I have a disc that was from the

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.610 
inside I have a disc that was from the
base<00:02:38.610> of<00:02:38.820> a<00:02:38.880> cone<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.450> it<00:02:39.900> was<00:02:39.989> just<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.350> and

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
base of a cone and it was just the and

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.410 
base of a cone and it was just the and
then<00:02:41.040> I<00:02:41.070> took<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.400> disc<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.060> matched<00:02:42.239> the

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
then I took the disc and it matched the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.840 
then I took the disc and it matched the
size<00:02:42.630> and<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:42.959> shoved<00:02:43.350> it<00:02:43.440> up<00:02:43.590> inside<00:02:44.010> here<00:02:44.700> and

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
size and I shoved it up inside here and

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.000 
size and I shoved it up inside here and
you<00:02:44.910> can<00:02:45.090> see<00:02:45.239> I<00:02:45.270> have<00:02:45.569> it<00:02:45.600> pointing<00:02:46.140> down<00:02:46.440> you

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
you can see I have it pointing down you

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.620 
you can see I have it pointing down you
can<00:02:47.160> always<00:02:47.370> verify<00:02:47.610> that<00:02:48.000> because<00:02:48.150> I'm<00:02:48.480> on

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
can always verify that because I'm on

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.930 
can always verify that because I'm on
the<00:02:48.720> local<00:02:49.050> axis<00:02:49.410> here<00:02:49.620> if<00:02:49.860> I<00:02:50.520> was<00:02:50.700> on<00:02:50.820> the

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
the local axis here if I was on the

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.699 
the local axis here if I was on the
global<00:02:51.270> axis<00:02:51.630> I<00:02:51.810> would<00:02:52.110> think<00:02:52.230> it<00:02:52.380> was<00:02:52.470> still

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
global axis I would think it was still

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.940 
global axis I would think it was still
pointing<00:02:53.040> up<00:02:53.510> so<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:54.540> have<00:02:55.140> that<00:02:55.320> pointing<00:02:55.769> down

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
pointing up so I have that pointing down

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.430 
pointing up so I have that pointing down
and<00:02:56.220> then<00:02:56.580> I<00:02:56.820> turn<00:02:57.120> that<00:02:57.390> into<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.989> regular

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
and then I turn that into a regular

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.430 
and then I turn that into a regular
emission<00:02:59.010> light<00:02:59.250> facing<00:03:00.000> downward<00:03:00.720> inside<00:03:01.200> so

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
emission light facing downward inside so

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.710 
emission light facing downward inside so
the<00:03:01.560> light<00:03:01.680> can't<00:03:01.980> escape<00:03:02.070> from<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:03.390> cylinder

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
the light can't escape from the cylinder

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.570 
the light can't escape from the cylinder
like<00:03:03.989> this<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.560> then<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.130> can<00:03:05.250> make<00:03:05.400> whatever

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
like this and then you can make whatever

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.550 
like this and then you can make whatever
kind<00:03:05.910> of<00:03:06.030> spotlights<00:03:06.510> you<00:03:06.630> want<00:03:06.870> like<00:03:07.320> let's

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
kind of spotlights you want like let's

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.860 
kind of spotlights you want like let's
see<00:03:07.709> then<00:03:08.060> what<00:03:09.060> we're<00:03:09.180> going<00:03:09.390> to<00:03:09.420> render<00:03:09.660> mode

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
see then what we're going to render mode

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.210 
see then what we're going to render mode
take<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.140> look<00:03:10.320> at<00:03:10.440> it<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:10.680> then<00:03:10.800> we'll<00:03:10.980> just

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
take a look at it and then we'll just

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.070 
take a look at it and then we'll just
see<00:03:11.340> if<00:03:11.370> we<00:03:11.459> can<00:03:11.610> actually<00:03:11.730> make<00:03:12.150> it<00:03:12.720> look<00:03:12.750> like

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
see if we can actually make it look like

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.229 
see if we can actually make it look like
a<00:03:13.220> spotlight<00:03:14.220> because<00:03:14.730> that's<00:03:14.880> really<00:03:15.030> what

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
a spotlight because that's really what

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.330 
a spotlight because that's really what
we<00:03:15.360> want<00:03:15.390> is<00:03:15.630> a<00:03:15.690> spotlight<00:03:16.170> well<00:03:16.830> maybe<00:03:17.010> we<00:03:17.220> do

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
we want is a spotlight well maybe we do

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.280 
we want is a spotlight well maybe we do
or<00:03:17.489> don't<00:03:17.670> but<00:03:17.940> all<00:03:18.660> right<00:03:18.780> so<00:03:18.840> there's<00:03:19.110> our

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
or don't but all right so there's our

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.800 
or don't but all right so there's our
light<00:03:19.500> in<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:19.860> scene<00:03:20.070> like<00:03:20.850> that<00:03:21.090> so<00:03:21.480> let's<00:03:21.690> go

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
light in the scene like that so let's go

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.580 
light in the scene like that so let's go
grab<00:03:22.260> both<00:03:22.530> now<00:03:22.980> to<00:03:23.040> make<00:03:23.250> this<00:03:23.370> perfectly

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
grab both now to make this perfectly

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.199 
grab both now to make this perfectly
exact<00:03:25.590> well<00:03:26.040> you<00:03:26.220> see<00:03:26.370> that's<00:03:26.880> funny<00:03:27.150> that

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
exact well you see that's funny that

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.940 
exact well you see that's funny that
even<00:03:27.360> light<00:03:27.750> comes<00:03:27.959> bouncing<00:03:28.380> off<00:03:28.500> their<00:03:28.680> back

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
even light comes bouncing off their back

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.590 
even light comes bouncing off their back
up<00:03:28.980> onto<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.489> side<00:03:29.760> of<00:03:29.880> that<00:03:30.000> yeah<00:03:30.180> sure<00:03:30.420> why

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
up onto the side of that yeah sure why

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.830 
up onto the side of that yeah sure why
not

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
not

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.740 
not
I'd<00:03:31.019> believe<00:03:31.200> it<00:03:31.470> all<00:03:32.070> right<00:03:32.130> so<00:03:32.820> let's<00:03:33.570> go

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
I'd believe it all right so let's go

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.850 
I'd believe it all right so let's go
grab<00:03:34.019> both<00:03:34.290> of<00:03:34.350> these<00:03:34.590> objects<00:03:36.680> material<00:03:37.680> mode

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
grab both of these objects material mode

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.560 
grab both of these objects material mode
that<00:03:38.310> one<00:03:38.519> there<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:39.060> I'm<00:03:39.180> going<00:03:39.269> to<00:03:39.360> shift

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
that one there and I'm going to shift

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.870 
that one there and I'm going to shift
and<00:03:39.840> grab<00:03:40.049> this<00:03:40.320> one<00:03:40.500> as<00:03:40.860> well<00:03:41.220> okay<00:03:41.610> have<00:03:41.760> them

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
and grab this one as well okay have them

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.740 
and grab this one as well okay have them
both<00:03:42.060> and<00:03:42.390> then<00:03:42.989> I'll<00:03:43.590> go<00:03:43.829> into<00:03:44.570> rendered<00:03:45.570> mode

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
both and then I'll go into rendered mode

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.539 
both and then I'll go into rendered mode
and<00:03:46.290> that<00:03:46.470> says<00:03:46.739> I<00:03:46.829> know<00:03:46.890> I<00:03:46.980> have<00:03:47.250> them<00:03:47.400> I'm

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
and that says I know I have them I'm

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.400 
and that says I know I have them I'm
going<00:03:47.670> to<00:03:47.760> scale<00:03:48.000> it<00:03:48.049> dynamically<00:03:49.049> within

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
going to scale it dynamically within

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.729 
going to scale it dynamically within
here<00:03:49.709> all<00:03:50.130> right<00:03:50.250> I'm<00:03:50.400> going<00:03:50.549> to<00:03:50.579> scale<00:03:50.940> it

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
here all right I'm going to scale it

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.110 
here all right I'm going to scale it
when<00:03:52.739> they're<00:03:52.890> rotated<00:03:53.519> that<00:03:53.670> way<00:03:53.820> so<00:03:53.880> that

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
when they're rotated that way so that

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.180 
when they're rotated that way so that
would<00:03:54.209> be<00:03:54.299> okay<00:03:54.510> are<00:03:54.630> going<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:54.900> scale<00:03:55.380> it<00:03:55.530> on<00:03:55.709> x

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
would be okay are going to scale it on x

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.479 
would be okay are going to scale it on x
and<00:03:56.370> y<00:03:56.610> so<00:03:57.230> only<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:58.470> let's<00:03:59.040> just<00:03:59.220> see<00:03:59.340> how

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
and y so only and let's just see how

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.190 
and y so only and let's just see how
much<00:03:59.640> of<00:03:59.700> a<00:03:59.850> change<00:04:00.090> it<00:04:00.239> makes<00:04:00.450> if<00:04:00.630> I<00:04:00.720> scrunch

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
much of a change it makes if I scrunch

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:08.500 
much of a change it makes if I scrunch
these<00:04:01.470> guys<00:04:01.680> down

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.479 

and<00:04:09.510> well<00:04:09.930> it<00:04:10.140> looks<00:04:10.409> like<00:04:10.469> it's<00:04:10.709> more<00:04:10.920> focused

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
and well it looks like it's more focused

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.679 
and well it looks like it's more focused
light<00:04:11.879> so<00:04:12.209> I<00:04:12.239> guess<00:04:12.599> though<00:04:12.840> to<00:04:12.900> really<00:04:13.349> see

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:14.689 
light so I guess though to really see

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:17.090 
light so I guess though to really see
now<00:04:15.689> we<00:04:15.750> really<00:04:16.199> looks<00:04:16.410> like<00:04:16.470> we<00:04:16.739> need<00:04:16.919> some

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
now we really looks like we need some

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.039 
now we really looks like we need some
intensity<00:04:17.459> but<00:04:17.759> of<00:04:17.850> course<00:04:18.090> this<00:04:18.600> is<00:04:18.780> we're

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
intensity but of course this is we're

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.770 
intensity but of course this is we're
using<00:04:19.410> a<00:04:20.100> parabolic<00:04:20.519> type<00:04:20.850> light<00:04:21.150> like<00:04:21.630> those

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
using a parabolic type light like those

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.240 
using a parabolic type light like those
other<00:04:21.959> tutorials<00:04:22.530> show<00:04:22.680> makes<00:04:22.949> all<00:04:23.100> the

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
other tutorials show makes all the

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.159 
other tutorials show makes all the
difference<00:04:23.340> in<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.729> world<00:04:23.910> because<00:04:24.900> if<00:04:25.050> you

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
difference in the world because if you

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.659 
difference in the world because if you
remember<00:04:25.470> from<00:04:25.620> your<00:04:25.710> math<00:04:26.039> class<00:04:26.370> with

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
remember from your math class with

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.210 
remember from your math class with
parabolas<00:04:27.090> that<00:04:27.389> how<00:04:27.690> they<00:04:27.870> you<00:04:28.440> know<00:04:28.560> or<00:04:29.190> just

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
parabolas that how they you know or just

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.740 
parabolas that how they you know or just
take<00:04:29.610> a<00:04:29.639> look<00:04:29.850> at<00:04:29.910> a<00:04:29.940> flashlight<00:04:30.210> the<00:04:30.539> way<00:04:30.630> they

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
take a look at a flashlight the way they

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.870 
take a look at a flashlight the way they
work<00:04:30.930> if<00:04:31.110> you're<00:04:31.259> not<00:04:31.289> familiar<00:04:31.500> that<00:04:32.220> the

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
work if you're not familiar that the

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.210 
work if you're not familiar that the
lamp<00:04:33.690> is<00:04:33.900> situated<00:04:34.440> in<00:04:34.560> front<00:04:34.590> of<00:04:35.130> the

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
lamp is situated in front of the

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.390 
lamp is situated in front of the
reflective<00:04:35.789> lens<00:04:36.120> and<00:04:36.479> it's<00:04:37.380> because<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:37.889> and

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
reflective lens and it's because the and

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.950 
reflective lens and it's because the and
that<00:04:38.520> reflective<00:04:39.000> lens<00:04:39.210> has<00:04:39.509> a<00:04:39.539> parabolic

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
that reflective lens has a parabolic

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.920 
that reflective lens has a parabolic
shape<00:04:40.199> so<00:04:40.710> when<00:04:41.099> it<00:04:41.190> bounces<00:04:41.720> against<00:04:42.720> any

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
shape so when it bounces against any

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.960 
shape so when it bounces against any
point<00:04:43.320> of<00:04:43.410> that<00:04:43.530> mirrored<00:04:43.949> surface<00:04:44.370> it<00:04:44.639> always

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
point of that mirrored surface it always

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.089 
point of that mirrored surface it always
sends<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:45.870> light<00:04:45.900> straight<00:04:46.590> back<00:04:46.830> out

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:47.099 
sends the light straight back out

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:49.029 
sends the light straight back out
straight<00:04:47.820> ahead<00:04:47.940> so<00:04:48.419> it's<00:04:48.539> a<00:04:48.599> very<00:04:48.780> powerful

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039 
straight ahead so it's a very powerful

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:52.010 
straight ahead so it's a very powerful
mathematical<00:04:50.039> surface<00:04:50.970> to<00:04:51.599> be<00:04:51.690> able<00:04:51.750> to<00:04:51.870> use

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
mathematical surface to be able to use

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.870 
mathematical surface to be able to use
and<00:04:52.289> this<00:04:52.620> is<00:04:52.770> not<00:04:52.949> this<00:04:53.130> is<00:04:53.310> just<00:04:53.340> a<00:04:53.639> flat

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
and this is not this is just a flat

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.469 
and this is not this is just a flat
plane<00:04:54.440> you<00:04:55.440> know<00:04:55.560> going<00:04:55.949> straight<00:04:56.729> down<00:04:56.759> but

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
plane you know going straight down but

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.529 
plane you know going straight down but
we<00:04:57.660> still<00:04:58.080> ought<00:04:58.470> to<00:04:58.830> be<00:04:58.919> able<00:04:59.009> to<00:04:59.300> let's<00:05:00.300> even

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
we still ought to be able to let's even

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:01.150 
we still ought to be able to let's even
get<00:05:00.780> it

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
get it

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.710 
get it
that's<00:05:02.160> the<00:05:02.400> cone<00:05:02.639> yeah<00:05:03.120> that<00:05:03.300> was<00:05:03.419> the<00:05:03.509> cone

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
that's the cone yeah that was the cone

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.860 
that's the cone yeah that was the cone
it<00:05:03.930> was<00:05:04.020> I<00:05:04.280> taken<00:05:05.280> it<00:05:05.400> out<00:05:05.520> of<00:05:05.669> there<00:05:05.849> so<00:05:05.880> now

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
it was I taken it out of there so now

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.300 
it was I taken it out of there so now
let's<00:05:07.080> see<00:05:07.320> if<00:05:07.380> we<00:05:07.440> can<00:05:07.560> just<00:05:07.680> crank<00:05:08.009> up<00:05:08.160> the

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
let's see if we can just crank up the

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.399 
let's see if we can just crank up the
intensity<00:05:08.820> of<00:05:08.970> this<00:05:09.090> and<00:05:09.660> see<00:05:09.840> how<00:05:09.870> well<00:05:10.229> this

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:10.409 
intensity of this and see how well this

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:12.800 
intensity of this and see how well this
works<00:05:10.470> as<00:05:10.979> a<00:05:11.010> spot<00:05:11.400> light<00:05:11.610> make<00:05:12.389> it<00:05:12.539> up<00:05:12.659> to

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
works as a spot light make it up to

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.800 
works as a spot light make it up to
maybe<00:05:13.080> 200<00:05:14.030> it's<00:05:15.030> not<00:05:15.210> going<00:05:15.330> to<00:05:15.389> be<00:05:15.449> very<00:05:15.630> good

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
maybe 200 it's not going to be very good

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:22.430 
maybe 200 it's not going to be very good
but

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.700 

oh<00:05:22.500> well<00:05:23.310> it's<00:05:23.610> trying<00:05:24.030> you<00:05:24.630> know<00:05:24.780> it's<00:05:25.350> trying

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
oh well it's trying you know it's trying

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.490 
oh well it's trying you know it's trying
so<00:05:26.190> it's<00:05:26.940> really<00:05:27.330> important<00:05:27.900> to<00:05:28.110> take<00:05:28.230> those

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
so it's really important to take those

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.380 
so it's really important to take those
look<00:05:29.160> at<00:05:29.250> those<00:05:29.400> two<00:05:29.610> lessons<00:05:29.940> if<00:05:30.060> you<00:05:30.180> hunt

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
look at those two lessons if you hunt

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.580 
look at those two lessons if you hunt
them<00:05:30.450> down<00:05:30.660> how<00:05:30.900> to<00:05:30.960> make<00:05:31.140> a<00:05:31.170> gallery

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
them down how to make a gallery

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.140 
them down how to make a gallery
spotlight<00:05:32.070> you<00:05:32.100> might<00:05:32.430> just<00:05:32.610> type<00:05:32.760> that<00:05:32.940> in

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
spotlight you might just type that in

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.180 
spotlight you might just type that in
and<00:05:33.450> I<00:05:34.050> show<00:05:34.230> you<00:05:34.260> how<00:05:34.440> to<00:05:34.470> make<00:05:34.650> a<00:05:34.680> parabolic

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
and I show you how to make a parabolic

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.400 
and I show you how to make a parabolic

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
service and what I actually get my

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.200 
service and what I actually get my
website<00:05:38.040> up<00:05:38.220> and<00:05:38.310> running<00:05:38.400> next<00:05:38.820> year<00:05:38.940> the

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210

sci-fi animator com what I'll end up

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.520 
sci-fi animator com what I'll end up
doing<00:05:41.790> is<00:05:42.060> for<00:05:42.600> certain<00:05:42.960> objects<00:05:43.320> in<00:05:43.440> the

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
doing is for certain objects in the

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.880 
doing is for certain objects in the
scene<00:05:43.680> that<00:05:43.740> are<00:05:44.010> mathematically<00:05:45.200> based<00:05:46.200> I'll

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
scene that are mathematically based I'll

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.680 
scene that are mathematically based I'll
probably<00:05:47.250> just<00:05:47.520> put<00:05:47.730> a<00:05:47.760> bunch<00:05:48.000> of<00:05:48.120> objects<00:05:48.510> up

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
probably just put a bunch of objects up

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.270 
probably just put a bunch of objects up
there<00:05:48.840> make<00:05:49.050> them<00:05:49.200> available<00:05:49.320> so<00:05:50.010> you<00:05:50.070> guys
