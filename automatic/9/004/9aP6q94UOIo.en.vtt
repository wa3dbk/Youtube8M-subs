00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello friends all good we have new 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.799
 little thing about assassin's creed eating 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.139
 good as I told you in the previous 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.610
 video this year we could have 2 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.799
 assassins when one has confirmed 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.369
 that is unit and that will come out at the end of 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.260
 2014 and hey, he's just going to go to the track 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.180
 There are four and one teams at the moment for 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.620
 pc does not know anything but good for 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.780
 old console generation is not going to 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.000
 to leave but yes that good could come out 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.130
 you make a click comet that is the one that I'm going 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.810
 to talk today how good this is still not 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.219
 It has been confirmed by bones 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.079
 but hey, it was said a long time ago 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.089
 that they had 3 assassins believe in 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.670
 development one already came out that is the black 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:40.800
 flag and good another is the unity so 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.559
 this could be the comet could be the 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.999
 third and surely this will come out 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.679
 year but good has not yet been 

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:48.899
 confirmed I do not think it takes long in 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:50.909
 confirm it and almost certainly yes it is 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.879
 true but good basically I'm going to 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:55.620
 give good I'll explain rumors that 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.409
 I've been looking around these days and 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.089
 so little rumors that have been giving 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:02.609
 equally or mainly the title the 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:04.320
 commit then well basically the 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.650
 title comes to halley comet that good 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.460
 it was first seen in the year one thousand 758 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.340
 and is the 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.670
 thousand 758 is in the year that we are going to start 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.400
 this new delivery or let's live 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.170
 this new delivery in this year and that year 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.659
 that is the year that was first seen 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.940
 the comet halley so maybe a 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.790
 thing and another has something to do I do not know very 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.430
 Well the what but I do not know the best inside 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.770
 of the saga is of assassins believe we see 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.770
 comet halley or I do not know any mission 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.810
 let him see what he puts 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.240
 then they also say it would be a 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.979
 sequel to black flag other than 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.600
 well, you know, he's going to be in between 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:48.060
 after black flag would be between 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.550
 the history of assassins believe 3 and that of 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.009
 lcd scream of adware freedom to the 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.950
 way I never get a name whether or not 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.160
 whale this name the boy this bold 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.039
 Well then it would be between those two good 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.020
 those two deliveries and would close this new 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.330
 delivery would close the trilogy of those who 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.670
 in guayas you would have finished the saga that 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.119
 in guayas to five and four and assassin's 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.400
 believe 3 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.769
 and it would end this saga basically 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.500
 then it would also be set in 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.510
 north america and we could also have 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.940
 as possible location new york 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.099
 we could be good we could travel and 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.950
 is the new york and we could also 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:29.230
 meet with hey is never kiss 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.019
 hey is the father of the cones good I've 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.120
 is and also in the way as I have 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.489
 said and then we have two possible 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.079
 protagonists do not know if they will like 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.829
 assassins believe three we have two 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:45.310
 protagonists that we have the color already 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:47.019
 gaitÃ¡n or basically is one other but 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.790
 when it is for the moment we have two 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.049
 possible protagonists but good this 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.480
 flies me that is going to be something like 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.790
 assassins believe 3 we started with a 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.980
 Templar and then we ended up with a 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.450
 killer but good out there the thing goes 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.489
 Well, we mainly have the 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.400
 protagonist shayk who will be a templar 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:06.340
 betray the way although 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.769
 you know the partner we have together 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.840
 with edward on the jack down and when 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.510
 basically we will be a Templar who 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.880
 we would betray the way and then 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.380
 we have another possible protagonist that 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.540
 same that maybe we have 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.060
 maybe we have one maybe not 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.890
 we have none that would be that bear 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.830
 basically the character of this that 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.810
 you see here is the grandson of adweek go to 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.450
 look for color to show you the 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.630
 knowledge of killer and logging in that 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:38.980
 maybe there starts a new saga 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:41.440
 Sincerely, this is good but this 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.960
 is the end of the saga of those who cool by 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.000
 what we are hearing and I think that if 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.380
 that we have two protagonists and it will happen 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.150
 as in assassin's creed three that 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.550
 we'll start with one and then we'll finish 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.560
 with another delivery and good because we're going 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.200
 to be a Templar then we have a 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.930
 murderer I do not know there goes the thing but good 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.760
 basically that bone to is the grandson of 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.680
 At the way we are going to look for the color to 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.900
 teaching in the knowledge of 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.150
 murderous without perhaps a 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.100
 of will and kate am we have the condor of 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.840
 back so good we'll see to see 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.390
 this delivery that they give us to see if 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.400
 they notice details already confirmed and good 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.980
 little chicken thing to take out but good 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.920
 basically if you put it like that you commit in 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.960
 google you go out you basically go out 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.650
 a little bit of everything but hey this in 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.600
 at the moment the first rumor 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.790
 equality or anything and I'll talk 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.180
 know and see you the next video up 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.180
 the next
