 and we also have many more 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.960
 Hard-working fans ask a lot more questions 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.840
 less personal questions sent 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.430
 want to respond to you today yes and 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.800
 who is actually behind the eco 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.350
 So, we are about eight people 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.550
 here in our team and of course 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.140
 the well-known ones you know for example 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.430
 accepted the club which always here 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.199
 make styling tips for you and 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.449
 Of course I too, we are always 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.190
 watch live videos but it might still be 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.989
 quite a lot of the middle ground and contribute 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.870
 that many coordinated and indeed 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.420
 are the people of zdf enterprises 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.329
 because he is in zdf enterprise namely 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.980
 a co-producer of the series mako and 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.829
 they had the wish and also the idea 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.019
 that you are the fanbase of mako 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.760
 could support because it was at hp 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.070
 Here is a huge fan base and he 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.390
 never really cared 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.340
 and that just wanted to change 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.380
 They wanted to create a platform where 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.000
 we can be there for you and you too 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.950
 could ask us many questions 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.020
 that can answer all that 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.280
 means that it is at center parcs 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.140
 Team gives the whole year 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.730
 coordinate and connect because we 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.080
 have so many different ideas what 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.000
 we want to show you everything with you 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.140
 want to do and then there is 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.180
 once me I'm several 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.370
 Moderators then gives you styling tips 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.470
 and i also have these best on videos 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.850
 from mike u and all that needs 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.620
 coordinated and implemented 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.420
 be and of course there are also 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.370
 The person just behind the camera 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.560
 stand and feel and come to you 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.030
 we'll talk again later 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.590
 yes and there I wanted to tell too 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.880
 as I actually no moderator 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.260
 I became because that's namely 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.580
 actually a very funny story 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.380
 and it was actually more or 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.810
 less chance that it happened 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.180
 and indeed has a friend of mine 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.160
 family get to know the zdf enterprises 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.780
 a fair moderator for the mac pro 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.479
 channel 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.240
 and that's just the spin off series of 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.010
 h2s and then I remembered him and 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.509
 He says that I fit in quite well 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.050
 would be as I am of my kind 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.300
 then something 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.470
 and then I applied there 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.040
 there are others who apply 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.319
 had 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.730
 and then there was a rehearsal of the 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.530
 was then looked like I'm afraid 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.920
 The camera seems to make me smile 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.450
 Can and if I actually have such a 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.340
 can talk set without me constantly to 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.440
 I'm almost sure if I'm right from the tempo 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.970
 Talk in any case, the sample has revolved 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.510
 It worked really well 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.580
 made 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.590
 and apparently or respectively 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.300
 videos have become good and i have 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.100
 I was totally happy and then it became me 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.239
 said yes so if you want then 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.040
 Can you fan the expensive 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.110
 be instruments and I may have it 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.660
 real whole day if I even still 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.519
 It took me longer to really do that 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.489
 hey, you're the one now 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.170
 by the council moderators beforehand channel and 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.580
 some fans had also asked me how 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.989
 Long is actually takes such a video 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.580
 for you to turn and that comes 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.110
 of course, whatever they are 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.510
 because just for a video game to 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.190
 for example, the winners announce 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.540
 let the advent specials home 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.280
 took a long time but they were yes 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.230
 partially only 30 seconds to one 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.130
 minute long it has lasted as long as 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.180
 for example when I watch the video 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.010
 maybe that's three or four 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.450
 minutes duration because as I say, of course, 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.100
 much more and of course I can too 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.910
 Do not just talk like that 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.140
 but I also have a few 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.100
 thoughts do what I command you for 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.200
 actually would tell 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.239
 because if I just talk about it 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.980
 I would believe then one would bet 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.090
 no point and no comma been 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.230
 and then you probably would have 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.000
 Have any of no more buck on it 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.680
 and is in any case 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.540
 of course I promise myself 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.320
 often, for example, I have the last one 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.239
 or penultimate rotation quite often said 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.650
 h2o movie tv movie maybe remembered 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.500
 you still could not do this here 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.329
 on the hd channel from the fourth advent 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.209
 until the second christmas holiday you 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:46.160
 watch the hartz iv movie and i have 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.390
 that's so often misunderstood and always 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.530
 Again, I do not know why I do that 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.329
 said that was kind of like that 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.590
 my head inside and hendrik is on 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.510
 the camera would almost have someday 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.920
 disengaged and, like so annoyed because 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.410
 I have said this wrong in any case 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.840
 and how 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.420
 have turned perceived ex 500 where not 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.460
 I always said wrong but when I did 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.690
 Master me and think 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.300
 then turn your head a bit 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:10.290
 takes about a video shoot like that 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:12.660
 hour yes and the next question was whether 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.310
 I actually h2o or prefer a mac 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.750
 and really pretty me 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.519
 Quite a lot already asked 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.910
 and I have to say honestly I think so 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:23.040
 that I currently or I think 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.170
 probably is forever more 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.880
 I like it just because I think that 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.260
 it is somehow more exciting and knows 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.780
 I just feel that somehow 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.340
 everything about marco white because I yes the 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.750
 I'm four moderators and of course whole 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.910
 a lot of background information too 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.830
 have and I just think that over the 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.270
 whole first season at the eco so one 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.800
 right tension somehow exists 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.060
 because the three girls have her necessarily 6 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.350
 wanted to transform his back 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.210
 wanted to win friendship 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.010
 All these things happened with the 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.290
 trident for example and at hartz iv 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.660
 it's just the way they are 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.310
 actually no friends and go 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.310
 then or fall or whatever in 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.170
 Symbols will log women in and there 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.420
 Of course it's just that they stop 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.040
 just handle it and hide it 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.930
 But that's not what I think 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.270
 Exciting like that when she's three 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.460
 absolutely want to go back to the mud 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.950
 but not allowed to see and stressful 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.660
 that was kind of more exciting than k2o 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.930
 and that's why I think that right now 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.700
 What more you like, whatever you say 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.050
 wanted to write because much more too 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.870
 have that I like me so much 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.000
 already so old and all this here 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.770
 make for micro and she laughed 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.320
 or that they are ashamed or 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.060
 did they report that say their girlfriend 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.500
 you 're already 50 why are you? 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.020
 still mako fans is so full of 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.280
 childrens series as if he wanted to say i 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.169
 my there are also so series like 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.419
 spongebob these are also children's series 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:41.070
 and I do not know but I believe everyone 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:42.840
 from my friend knows the series and 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.520
 even watch them on TV if it is 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.320
 runs and therefore I just wanted to say 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.360
 that's nothing for what you look for 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.800
 it must be ashamed in my corner even looks 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.890
 after a survey was found out 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.960
 that a lot of adult mothers so 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.490
 adult women while even more 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.660
 because they are so nice 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.460
 You and I also think that it is 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.500
 no matter as much as you have to 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.030
 yes and therefore already said that 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.410
 we still have a special one today 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.060
 and that is it 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.470
 hendrick is usually more 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.850
 behind the camera and did not film 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.080
 he is also in front of him today 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:16.070
 camera untitled one now 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:19.080
 hello i am the hendrick 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:22.140
 and I cut and film the videos 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.250
 with vanessa when it already has 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.330
 you say that's about it 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.500
 hour that takes you such a video 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.380
 after I cut that 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.430
 how long such a video is after that 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.630
 I need something like that again 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.240
 three to four hours to everything 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.070
 uploaded data are uploaded and so on 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.690
 further that the latter are cut 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.280
 because, of course, depend on how elaborate 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:42.600
 the video is that some go a bit 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:44.880
 faster, some a bit slower it 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.950
 sometimes one of you asked which one 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.360
 programs we use for it and 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.850
 Although the following program are once 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.500
 photoshop for all the little dots 

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.940
 Keeps it here so far from the video 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:59.039
 they are on the other videos 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:07:00.810
 then we use tobi after 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:02.970
 effects that this since this is the 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.530
 intro and the car can do with it 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.039
 since new text can write in and so 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.010
 continue 

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:08.840
