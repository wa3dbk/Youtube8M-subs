00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.930 

so<00:00:01.740> it's<00:00:02.190> now<00:00:02.879> 9<00:00:03.389> o'clock<00:00:03.840> and<00:00:04.640> everybody<00:00:05.640> is

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
so it's now 9 o'clock and everybody is

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.270 
so it's now 9 o'clock and everybody is
in<00:00:06.150> bed<00:00:06.450> all<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:06.839> babies<00:00:07.170> are<00:00:07.410> in<00:00:07.440> bed<00:00:07.919> the

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
in bed all the babies are in bed the

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.140 
in bed all the babies are in bed the
twins<00:00:08.670> are<00:00:08.910> in<00:00:09.030> bed<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:10.349> look<00:00:11.070> who's<00:00:11.429> up

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
twins are in bed and look who's up

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.470 
twins are in bed and look who's up
Kaylie<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:14.040> so<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.340> was<00:00:14.700> thinking<00:00:15.150> that<00:00:15.299> she

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
Kaylie and so I was thinking that she

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.070 
Kaylie and so I was thinking that she
was<00:00:15.599> going<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:16.020> be<00:00:16.170> in<00:00:16.350> bed<00:00:16.590> already<00:00:17.150> but<00:00:18.150> she

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
was going to be in bed already but she

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.010 
was going to be in bed already but she
is<00:00:19.380> still<00:00:19.710> up<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.310> so<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.029> guess<00:00:21.359> because<00:00:21.630> she

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
is still up and so I guess because she

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.290 
is still up and so I guess because she
not<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:22.560> much<00:00:22.769> throughout<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.189> day<00:00:23.550> that

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
not so much throughout the day that

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.679 
not so much throughout the day that
she's<00:00:24.539> not<00:00:24.750> quite<00:00:24.990> tired<00:00:25.590> yet<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.160> so<00:00:27.060> she's

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
she's not quite tired yet and so she's

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.359 
she's not quite tired yet and so she's
been<00:00:27.720> getting<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.349> little<00:00:28.500> fussy<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:29.310> I

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
been getting a little fussy and so I

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.930 
been getting a little fussy and so I
think<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.910> she<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:31.340> hungry<00:00:32.340> again<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:32.850> I'm

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
think that she is hungry again so I'm

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.500 
think that she is hungry again so I'm
going<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.239> go<00:00:33.480> ahead<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:34.050> feed<00:00:34.380> her<00:00:35.510> bottle
