 Tractors from a german 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.590
 four-cylinder engine same engine 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.880
 as in the 15th 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.800
 most important distinguishing feature is

 manufacturer with four and a half to five 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:20.110

 Number of steering turns halved 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.530
 great feature for front loader work 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.780
 handy is also the stop and go 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:49.300
 Function with which the tractor only 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.830
 This can be stopped by the foot brake
