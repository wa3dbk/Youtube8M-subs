00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.750 
just just for this type of situation you
just<00:02:32.320> rotate<00:02:32.650> it<00:02:32.709> a<00:02:32.859> few<00:02:33.070> times<00:02:33.340> back<00:02:33.700> and

always<00:02:38.049> a<00:02:38.170> good<00:02:38.350> idea<00:02:38.380> just<00:02:38.920> to<00:02:39.190> ensure<00:02:39.940> that

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
always a good idea just to ensure that

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.059 
always a good idea just to ensure that
you<00:02:40.209> get<00:02:40.299> a<00:02:40.359> proper<00:02:40.750> seal<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:44.590> next<00:02:44.859> step

you get a proper seal the next step

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.479 
you get a proper seal the next step
would<00:02:45.250> be<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:45.430> use<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:45.819> proper<00:02:46.239> flux<00:02:46.569> paste<00:02:47.489> to

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.100 

we'll<00:03:28.790> take<00:03:28.939> a<00:03:29.000> look<00:03:29.299> at<00:03:29.480> it<00:03:29.629> make<00:03:29.810> sure<00:03:29.840> it's

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
we'll take a look at it make sure it's

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.649 
we'll take a look at it make sure it's
straight<00:03:30.819> that<00:03:31.819> looks<00:03:32.000> pretty<00:03:32.180> good<00:03:32.299> right

there and then again we apply the heat
to<00:03:35.569> melt
