00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.089 
that
well<00:00:09.510> in<00:00:09.660> this<00:00:09.780> example<00:00:10.170> I<00:00:10.410> have<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.620> report

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
well in this example I have a report

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.249 
well in this example I have a report
with<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.670> bunch<00:00:11.969> of<00:00:12.090> hidden<00:00:12.300> rows<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:13.049> these

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
with a bunch of hidden rows and these

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.829 
with a bunch of hidden rows and these
rows<00:00:13.559> have<00:00:13.860> been<00:00:13.889> hidden<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.150> collapsed

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
rows have been hidden and collapsed

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.019 
rows have been hidden and collapsed
using<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.320> subtotal<00:00:16.859> feature<00:00:17.100> so<00:00:17.820> if<00:00:17.910> I

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
using the subtotal feature so if I

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.880 
using the subtotal feature so if I
expand<00:00:18.510> these<00:00:18.720> groups<00:00:19.109> here<00:00:19.380> you'll<00:00:19.560> see<00:00:19.770> that

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
expand these groups here you'll see that

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.460 
expand these groups here you'll see that
I<00:00:19.949> have<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.220> bunch<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.670> detail<00:00:21.150> rows<00:00:21.480> between

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470

shift Z on the Mac will do the same

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.999 
shift Z on the Mac will do the same
thing<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.390> now<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.259> we've<00:01:28.380> selected<00:01:28.619> the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
visible cells when I hit ctrl C to copy

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.950 
visible cells when I hit ctrl C to copy
you'll<00:01:32.490> notice<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.030> marching<00:01:33.450> ants<00:01:33.720> are
