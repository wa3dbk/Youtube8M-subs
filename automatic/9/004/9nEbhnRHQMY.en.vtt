00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:04.250
 in a steering wheel drive I'm back today with m 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:05.910
 under the hood 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.910
 why not if you noticed these 

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:18.269
 since% of cases spontaneously I established a little withdrawal of 5% which is 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:19.769
 automatically triggers 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.630
 according to what his world 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.730
 delÃ©mont who takes care of everything 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.289
 a new company 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.349
 he discovers like course of gold for example 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.040
 a plan that may seem complicated but in the solutions are simple a 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:34.150
 remark whose life was often how sinks 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.610
 the situation is complicated 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.750
 we are 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.750
 automatically taken fast that a solution press 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.420
 first point 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.420
 tomorrow cloud solutions 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.380
 what does it mean soc 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.910
 100 kilos of water 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.020
 I was bought 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.040
 in France now I'm going to marry sara 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.360
 in fact because 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.410
 here today I claim that every free man 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.410
 must have 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.290
 problem 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.320
 we are dead 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.530
 it is true that correct is very recommended by many people 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.530
 I totally agree laurent 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.710
 in case of crisis you will not be able to use it 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.540
 only when 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.700
 there is house forms of social organization which will allow for example to 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.780
 near the place where you can understand orbit will allow to have a black market 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.510
 which will allow 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.080
 - the change is in progress 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.430
 but at first 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.430
 the most important will be from montebourg 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.420
 at the beginning of a fall 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.420
 the game becomes more important 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.370
 it's so called that at the beginning 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.560
 the person at the right 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.280
 agree to do it by themselves 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.170
 start of the championship 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.170
 the race car of the cemetery often the complete difference does it 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:11.349
 it is that I am champion 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:12.319
 very 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.990
 optimistic because 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.549
 notice that I guess 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.309
 I start from the principle 

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:18.560
 in case of crisis 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.739
 - dawn in real I can go 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.219
 in the garage 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:25.159
 at scale 5 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:28.689
 take a step back to get back to the leather house and form the mix 

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:31.559
 these something 

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:34.849
 tignes 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.079
 we can arrive 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.979
 a social disturbance 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:39.779
 much more advanced 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:43.879
 pickton grabs so that a military circle took place for calais whose 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:44.719
 some 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:46.359
 governed grass 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:50.909
 somalia darfur where and then you will see what makes his culture 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.379
 business 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.299
 for this kind of extreme situations jerome circ'ombelico sleeve creaked the 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:02:58.970
 plan to 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.970
 corresponding a little bit agreed what are being drunk 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.859
 what happens today if you want 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:07.019
 draw 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.709
 it's a kind of vulture to normal 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.659
 which means 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:16.519
 here it had happened on them based on the simmering appearances 

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:20.059
 of value to anything pillars of civil peace at the latest 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:23.639
 decide one day 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:24.709
 paper 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.079
 we had access 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.210
 could not in what way the prince - who could be given 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:29.369
 18 whole 

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:32.699
 work in exchange for this article that could be tolerated only at the very beginning 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:33.899
 to everything and anything 

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:35.049
 we do not change 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.159
 of these practices 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:40.849
 this paper printed of course my no value if it was not if it is the 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:42.169
 left himself 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:43.039
 what is happening 

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:46.499
 these papers are no longer forced to catch up 

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:47.739
 the law of physics 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.099
 and is coming back r it's even worse its flowerbeds 

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:55.869
 behind there is of course it concerns the guide on life boursorama 

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:57.449
 how does it work 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:59.079
 it works the following way 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.760
 there are people today good part of humanity 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.839
 cya accept 

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:07.069
 this paper we do not sing that his work would be possible other 

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:09.859
 at one point 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:10.780
 the system 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.890
 besides all the senses the carpet in hand to the wallet to the chest we are 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.400
 happy 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.859
 two spikes of the ball 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.409
 it's filmed what's going to happen 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:24.240
 you always catch up with the accounting carpet 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.150
 but it is necessary to remember that reports people 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.210
 for the comp 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.380
 to reduce their costs 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.719
 people had changed from prison 

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:34.529
 exhausted gold in the resell his fall 

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:37.499
 having an intrinsic value he will try 

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:38.300
 by nature 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.650
 so it was all exchange 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.770
 any example purchase with their dad works a lot 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.669
 and then we do but trade goods concludes 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.689
 of my time and all my energy I make sure of the court room in good 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:53.689
 and due form kinds of goods is largely failure 

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:56.240
 as long as we do not have 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.200
 but the paper there we can start by accepting the value 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.200
 it's even on foot 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:06.999
 I do not know 6 

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:10.339
 if you listened to what happens after 

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:12.990
 on clay since 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.050
 explaining later 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.800
 listen because 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.550
 at most 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.520
 some tours to the counter a complicity is more alive than I lived 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.889
 of books 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:26.889
 owning books means 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:28.939
 I trusted 

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:31.939
 the British government the return of all 

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:35.979
 600 soldiers multiply confidence 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:38.199
 Vitaly Churkin 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:40.219
 larouche in section of the aveyron 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:41.449
 on the counter 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:43.229
 horace poutine 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:45.469
 at the level of trust 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:47.189
 what do you want 

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:50.389
 because money no value 6 md 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:53.389
 spokesperson 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:57.330
 that's why 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.330
 the situation being 

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:06.050
 to start 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.050
 in this quest 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.300
 if ever too late 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.300
 it is therefore a satisfied woman 

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:22.819
 lp do you think his health 

00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:27.809
 this contest open to all audiences who are very cyclical 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.159
 I understand that every ballot 

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:34.360
 for that 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.849
 the text I mean
