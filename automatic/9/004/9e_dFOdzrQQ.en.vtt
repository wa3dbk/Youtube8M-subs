00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.030
 Do you know that Japanese TV is one thing? 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.429
 half bizarre east against the little pranks 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.469
 very clueless and things that never 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.379
 here would be the colorful and 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.029
 A lot of dirt, they got ready.

 the week a Japanese TV that announced 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.869
 just because I was feeling Japanese 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.920
 they took those phases of street 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.350
 fighter 2 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.689
 knows those who have a car you have 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.929
 who destroy the car and with some blows 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.149
 in some rankings and recreated it in the 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.420
 real life or created it on stage 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:40.739
 program is to show you 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:43.800
 in the wet there is a car of the time and 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.809
 a guy a karateka dressed in a river and 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.950
 begins to throw punches in the car 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.610
 first I am a car is not a 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.160
 very effective thing because he saw that 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.530
 was not effective and began to pull with the 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.559
 hand the pieces of the car even destroying 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.899
 right he goes to the other lighthouse after he 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.470
 part of the hood is advanced that you see 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.930
 looks at kicking and debate with the 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.140
 elbow on the hood and play it all 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.630
 mass is what they are going to put this front 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.340
 cold has been destroying the land to the 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.409
 car his wife will give a tip 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.840
 car side handle 23 and away 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.400
 our of the beggar on the glass destroy the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.540
 No cooler glass is the side of the 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.400
 car at a time and now it will analyze and 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.960
 detail that he did not cut our 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.240
 there were several men who could have 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.420
 died several times if you saw this 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.229
 The player who gave me a car but will 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:44.310
 give up now was with both feet 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:48.570

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.490

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.079

 what a mass then some more things 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.369
 Something that we come to program 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.750
 Japanese and thinks and speaks bizarre why not 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.130
 have's this here is something 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.310
 I think like they did not think about it. 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.100
 Before you did your turn more like 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.690

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.690
