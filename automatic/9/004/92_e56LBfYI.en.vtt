warm<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.250> can<00:00:47.399> shape<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:48.050> so<00:00:49.050> I'll

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
warm so that you can shape it so I'll

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.660 
warm so that you can shape it so I'll
let<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.260> see<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.829> actually<00:00:50.250> kind<00:00:50.520> of

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
let you see that it actually kind of

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.369 
let you see that it actually kind of
doesn't<00:00:51.120> really<00:00:51.360> melt<00:00:51.629> but<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:51.930> just<00:00:52.079> kind<00:00:52.289> of

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
doesn't really melt but it just kind of

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.869 
doesn't really melt but it just kind of
folds<00:00:52.739> down

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
folds down

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.420 
folds down
so<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.570> becomes<00:00:54.780> pliable<00:00:57.739> so<00:00:58.739> now<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:58.920> can<00:00:59.160> shape

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
so it becomes pliable so now I can shape

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.509 
so it becomes pliable so now I can shape
it<00:00:59.460> moon<00:00:59.940> while<00:01:00.149> it's<00:01:00.359> warm<00:01:01.010> and<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.159> can<00:01:02.309> bend

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
it moon while it's warm and you can bend

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.999

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
bend and put curls and it doesn't matter

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.320 
bend and put curls and it doesn't matter
it's<00:01:07.619> already<00:01:08.130> cooled<00:01:08.729> off

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
it's already cooled off

has<00:02:13.180> all<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.540> same<00:02:13.720> properties<00:02:13.959> you<00:02:14.290> can

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
has all the same properties you can

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.050 
has all the same properties you can
still<00:02:14.680> heat<00:02:14.890> it<00:02:15.010> a<00:02:15.070> million<00:02:15.250> times

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
still heat it a million times

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.390 
still heat it a million times
nothing<00:02:16.870> nothing<00:02:17.320> changes<00:02:17.800> it<00:02:17.980> okay<00:02:18.340> so

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
nothing nothing changes it okay so

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.850 
nothing nothing changes it okay so
that's<00:02:18.730> that<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:20.170> then<00:02:20.320> if<00:02:20.410> you're<00:02:20.530> gonna<00:02:20.650> use

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
that's that so then if you're gonna use

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.830 
that's that so then if you're gonna use
the<00:02:21.070> white<00:02:21.280> you<00:02:21.730> would<00:02:21.850> use<00:02:22.090> alcohol<00:02:22.600> inks

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
the white you would use alcohol inks

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.090 
the white you would use alcohol inks
again<00:02:23.110> and<00:02:23.260> those<00:02:23.380> are<00:02:23.530> gonna<00:02:23.620> be<00:02:23.830> really

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
again and those are gonna be really

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:32.640 
again and those are gonna be really
vibrant<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:30.580> then<00:02:31.120> stamped<00:02:31.750> with<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.350> jet

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
vibrant and then stamped with the jet

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.480 
vibrant and then stamped with the jet
black<00:02:32.860> archival<00:02:33.489> okay<00:02:34.060> okay<00:02:34.450> so<00:02:34.510> that's<00:02:34.840> that

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
black archival okay okay so that's that

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.660 
black archival okay okay so that's that
so<00:02:37.000> then<00:02:37.150> my<00:02:37.270> next<00:02:37.330> thing<00:02:37.810> was<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.380> black<00:02:38.680> no

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
so then my next thing was the black no

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.360 
so then my next thing was the black no
inks<00:02:39.970> are<00:02:40.060> going<00:02:40.210> to<00:02:40.270> show<00:02:40.420> up<00:02:40.570> on<00:02:40.750> that<00:02:41.020> so<00:02:41.980> I

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
inks are going to show up on that so I

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:52.440 
inks are going to show up on that so I
was<00:02:42.760> always<00:02:42.910> stamping<00:02:43.450> on<00:02:43.570> it<00:02:43.630> with<00:02:51.030> my<00:02:52.030> idea

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
was always stamping on it with my idea

00:02:52.450 --> 00:03:00.420 
was always stamping on it with my idea
was<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:59.170> size<00:02:59.410> layered<00:02:59.830> would<00:03:00.100> be<00:03:00.220> very

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
was the size layered would be very

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.250 
was the size layered would be very
expensive<00:03:00.610> so<00:03:01.090> I<00:03:01.120> think<00:03:01.330> I'm<00:03:01.480> there<00:03:01.660> a<00:03:01.720> way<00:03:02.230> to

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
expensive so I think I'm there a way to

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.390 
expensive so I think I'm there a way to
do<00:03:02.710> this<00:03:03.000> make<00:03:04.000> it<00:03:04.150> look<00:03:04.300> like<00:03:04.450> metal<00:03:05.160> so<00:03:06.160> this

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
do this make it look like metal so this

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.690 
do this make it look like metal so this
is<00:03:06.520> the<00:03:06.610> clearly<00:03:06.970> for<00:03:07.150> our<00:03:07.240> black<00:03:07.510> house<00:03:08.700> clean

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
is the clearly for our black house clean

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.000 
is the clearly for our black house clean
sheet<00:03:09.880> of<00:03:09.970> glass<00:03:10.060> I<00:03:10.630> painted<00:03:11.590> it<00:03:11.740> with<00:03:11.890> the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
sheet of glass I painted it with the

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.040 
sheet of glass I painted it with the
glue<00:03:12.220> and<00:03:12.400> silk<00:03:12.640> and<00:03:13.390> the<00:03:13.480> reason<00:03:13.780> they<00:03:13.840> did

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
glue and silk and the reason they did

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.600 
glue and silk and the reason they did
that<00:03:14.080> is<00:03:14.230> because<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.710> rock<00:03:14.890> candy<00:03:15.130> crackle

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
that is because the rock candy crackle

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.430 
that is because the rock candy crackle
paint<00:03:15.850> needs<00:03:16.030> some<00:03:16.210> tooth<00:03:16.450> to<00:03:16.690> it<00:03:16.720> here<00:03:16.990> -<00:03:17.230> oh<00:03:17.260> I

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
paint needs some tooth to it here - oh I

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.050 
paint needs some tooth to it here - oh I
like<00:03:17.680> this<00:03:17.920> yeah<00:03:18.190> so<00:03:18.400> if<00:03:18.460> I<00:03:18.550> painted<00:03:18.910> this

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
like this yeah so if I painted this

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.670 
like this yeah so if I painted this
directly<00:03:19.510> on<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:19.810> coulis<00:03:20.140> for<00:03:20.320> art<00:03:20.500> and

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
directly on the coulis for art and

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.200 
directly on the coulis for art and
crafts<00:03:20.980> but<00:03:21.430> when<00:03:21.550> you<00:03:21.610> pick<00:03:21.790> it<00:03:21.820> up<00:03:21.970> and<00:03:22.120> look

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.210 
crafts but when you pick it up and look

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.480 
crafts but when you pick it up and look
at<00:03:22.390> it<00:03:22.540> it<00:03:22.630> all<00:03:22.750> falls<00:03:23.020> off<00:03:23.200> so<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.130> glue<00:03:24.340> and

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
at it it all falls off so the glue and

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:32.220 
at it it all falls off so the glue and
feel<00:03:24.700> kind<00:03:24.970> of<00:03:25.680> yes<00:03:26.710> allows<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:28.860> stick<00:03:29.860> to<00:03:30.070> it
