00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 such important functions remain as 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:08.540
 voice thermoregulation education 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:11.219
 smelling humidification of inhaled air 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.540
 lung tissue also plays an important role 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:18.150
 in processes like hormone synthesis 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.310
 water-salt and lipid metabolism in abundantly 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.600
 developed vascular system of the lungs 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.160
 blood deposition occurs 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.150
 respiratory system also provides 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.640
 mechanical 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.260
 immune protection against external factors 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.640
 Wednesday 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.370
 respiratory muscles and diaphragm 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.680
 man work obeying his will and 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.120
 consciousness therefore for mastering 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.610
 proper breathing 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.040
 knowledge of the device and 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.379
 the mechanism of the respiratory system 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.050
 the main organs of the respiratory system 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.730
 are easy they consist of 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.960
 tiny bubbles 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.239
 alveoli surrounding bronchiole 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.350
 the lungs are located in the chest cavity in 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.530
 surrounded by the bones and muscles of the chest 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.750
 lungs 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.080
 provide oxygen in 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.479
 body and removal from it 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.360
 gaseous product of vital activity 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.189
 carbon dioxide 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.200
 atmospheric air enters the lungs and 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.830
 derived from them thanks to the system 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.580
 pipes 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.590
 called airways secrete 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.330
 upper and lower airways 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.190
 upper airway junction 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.520
 lower 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.860
 performed together crossing 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.860
 digestive and respiratory systems 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.230
 top of the larynx 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:42.800
 upper respiratory system 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:46.340
 consists of a nose nasopharynx and oropharynx 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.290
 and also partially the oral cavity since 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.450
 it can also be used when 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.520
 breathing 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:57.290
 lower respiratory system consists 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:00.130
 from the larynx trachea bronchus lungs pleura 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.930
 chest with respiratory muscles 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.130
 nervous vascular and lymphatic 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:10.640
 systems of the main respiratory muscles 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:14.000
 consists of intercostal scalene muscles and 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.660
 respiratory diaphragm 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.720
 musculature raises the chest 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.690
 the diaphragm shrinks and thickens 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.940
 due to this process lung volume 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:29.120
 increases and the air through the pump 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.550
 penetrates the lungs maximum volume 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.560
 air in human lungs state 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:38.540
 rest is equal to nine liters including stock 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.050
 exhalation is a passive process when 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.510
 which breathing muscles relax 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:47.500
 the diaphragm rises up and the air 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.739
 freely excreted 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.709
 found that an adult does 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:56.959
 1517 breaths per minute 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.450
 a newborn baby makes one who in 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.920
 give me a sec 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.720
 breathing doesn't stop working from 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.720
 man's birth is his death
