purposes<00:00:42.370> now<00:00:42.970> the<00:00:43.090> first<00:00:43.480> purpose<00:00:44.110> is<00:00:44.470> that

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
purposes now the first purpose is that

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.340 
purposes now the first purpose is that
it<00:00:45.040> provides<00:00:45.280> an<00:00:45.489> installation<00:00:46.330> layer<00:00:46.629> for

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
it provides an installation layer for

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.750 
it provides an installation layer for
when<00:00:47.500> you're<00:00:47.650> out<00:00:47.680> riding<00:00:48.340> in<00:00:48.489> cold

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.650 
environments and that becomes quite

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.439 
environments and that becomes quite
important<00:00:51.220> when<00:00:51.550> you're<00:00:51.730> riding<00:00:51.910> over<00:00:52.300> a

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
important when you're riding over a

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.510 
important when you're riding over a
hilly<00:00:52.780> course<00:00:53.110> that<00:00:53.410> involves<00:00:53.890> quite<00:00:54.280> a<00:00:54.340> bit

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
hilly course that involves quite a bit

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.400 
hilly course that involves quite a bit
of<00:00:54.640> descending<00:00:55.210> and<00:00:55.360> it's<00:00:56.050> in<00:00:56.170> those

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
of descending and it's in those

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.110 
of descending and it's in those
situations<00:00:57.190> where<00:00:57.430> you<00:00:57.519> need<00:00:57.670> to<00:00:57.820> protect

yourself from the cold
now<00:01:00.129> the<00:01:00.190> second<00:01:00.699> purpose<00:01:00.940> is<00:01:01.330> that<00:01:01.989> it

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
now the second purpose is that it

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.780 
now the second purpose is that it
provides<00:01:02.589> you<00:01:02.800> with<00:01:02.949> protection<00:01:03.519> when<00:01:03.670> you

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.990 
a lot cheaper but I find that they don't
last<00:02:33.640> as<00:02:33.970> long<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.450> they<00:02:35.050> also<00:02:35.490> don't<00:02:36.490> manage

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
last as long and they also don't manage
