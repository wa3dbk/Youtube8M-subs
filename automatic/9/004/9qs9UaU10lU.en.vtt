00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.990
 we are in musselkanaal 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.799
 what's wrong he really a hefty 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.139
 raging fire 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.000
 right in the center of musselkanaal 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.470
 and it is a fire in a wok 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.670
 restaurant with a number above it 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.710
 houses 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.900
 leaders the fire started the fire is 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.220
 as far as we know started in the in the 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.570
 upstairs houses 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.070
 that was also the first report due 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.599
 instead the flames did indeed come 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.550
 already at the back of the houses 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.800
 hit them outside then has the 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.870
 burn extended to too 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.430
 downstairs restaurant there is something 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.620
 confess to the cause of the fire 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.300
 he causes we can actually do anything 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.219
 about say i know the fire 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.199
 indeed upstairs probably started 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:45.670
 is a first report of that 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:47.350
 and the police will figure that out later 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.079
 if it is still possible to find out a cause 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.679
 upstairs to restaurant where you can 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.350
 tell about it 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:55.300
 address tarantass was open tonight 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.519
 so it was very busy 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.750
 for the people there still a scare 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:01.059
 but luckily among are all 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.620
 have left the building on time 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.330
 for them and also for the residents 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.800
 regularly 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.750
 Many people within the mining 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.040
 Restaurants in due course out there 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.210
 still bad about it 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.240
 no there were no injuries 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.430
 luckily everyone who was inside who 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.619
 comes on time to leave building and what that 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.320
 so fortunately does not concern the injured 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.270
 that's a big fire there is 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.920
 been of danger 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.899
 well there was actually his and none 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.189
 neighboring properties to clear it 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:28.990
 for a detached building 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.580
 so in that sense there is none 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.830
 no reason been there 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.360
 that the way was and transshipment and 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.700
 therefore we can now also do the fire 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.440
 just let it burn out in a controlled manner 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.940
 a lot of smoke 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.220
 there is against the resident 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.140
 live told him but the ass standard 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.210
 advice with regard to considerable smoke development 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.740
 make sure you argue out of that smoke make sure 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.630
 your window and door will look like you if you 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.590
 own house in that smoke light that is too 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.440
 in this case 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.730
 Thus people advised to be behind this 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.040
 indeed the windows and doors closed too 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.950
 keeping a lot of flying fire is another one 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.600
 been in danger so in fact 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.280
 what flight time then we try 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.570
 to sell because knock down with one 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.740
 water screen 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.479
 and as far as I know this also has 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.479
 not currently led to additional risks
