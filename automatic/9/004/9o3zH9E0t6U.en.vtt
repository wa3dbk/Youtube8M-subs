basically a little eater on this side

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.240 
basically a little eater on this side
and<00:02:30.209> this<00:02:30.389> side<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.989> then<00:02:31.560> I<00:02:31.650> could<00:02:31.829> do<00:02:31.950> two

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
and this side and then I could do two

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.789 
and this side and then I could do two
and<00:02:32.670> just<00:02:33.090> bend<00:02:33.389> them<00:02:33.540> down<00:02:33.810> together<00:02:34.139> instead

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
and just bend them down together instead

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.619 
and just bend them down together instead
of<00:02:34.889> doing<00:02:35.099> it<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:36.060> know<00:02:36.090> instead<00:02:36.480> of<00:02:36.540> like

of doing it you know instead of like

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.110 
of doing it you know instead of like
twisting<00:02:37.230> them<00:02:37.379> together<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:38.489> I'm<00:02:38.549> just<00:02:38.760> going

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
twisting them together so I'm just going

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.890 
twisting them together so I'm just going
to<00:02:39.180> be<00:02:39.299> able<00:02:39.359> to<00:02:39.829> find<00:02:40.829> so<00:02:41.790> I'm<00:02:42.419> go<00:02:42.659> ahead<00:02:42.780> and

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
to be able to find so I'm go ahead and

simple but let's ease go ahead and get

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.569 
simple but let's ease go ahead and get
one<00:02:50.549> of<00:02:50.669> my<00:02:50.790> ornament<00:02:51.480> hangers<00:02:52.430> slip<00:02:53.430> this

one of my ornament hangers slip this

00:02:53.579 --> 00:03:02.149 
one of my ornament hangers slip this
down<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:59.340> I<00:02:59.609> just<00:02:59.639> kind<00:03:00.090> of<00:03:00.180> open<00:03:00.480> it<00:03:00.599> up<00:03:01.159> it's

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
honest lay a little bead clear silicon

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:48.100 
honest lay a little bead clear silicon
here<00:03:40.480> not<00:03:41.480> too<00:03:41.690> much<00:03:45.940> and<00:03:46.940> then<00:03:47.600> let's<00:03:47.900> go

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110

little bit it kind of encapsulate sit

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.430 
little bit it kind of encapsulate sit
there<00:04:03.560> and<00:04:04.300> then<00:04:05.300> I'll<00:04:05.480> leave<00:04:05.750> it<00:04:05.900> hang<00:04:06.140> for<00:04:06.410> a

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
there and then I'll leave it hang for a

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.270 
there and then I'll leave it hang for a
second<00:04:06.800> and<00:04:07.310> I<00:04:07.430> get<00:04:08.530> got<00:04:09.530> this<00:04:09.650> little<00:04:09.830> extra

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
second and I get got this little extra

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.430 
second and I get got this little extra
one<00:04:10.430> here<00:04:10.670> that<00:04:10.819> just<00:04:11.660> kind<00:04:11.870> of<00:04:11.900> been<00:04:12.110> on<00:04:12.260> one

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
one here that just kind of been on one

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.360 
one here that just kind of been on one
hand<00:04:13.330> see<00:04:14.330> I<00:04:14.360> can<00:04:14.600> do<00:04:14.690> this<00:04:14.780> with<00:04:14.989> one<00:04:15.170> hand<00:04:15.370> but

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
hand see I can do this with one hand but

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.690 
hand see I can do this with one hand but
then<00:04:17.060> I'll<00:04:17.150> just<00:04:17.329> kind<00:04:17.479> of<00:04:17.630> smooth<00:04:17.900> it<00:04:18.019> out<00:04:18.700> and

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
then I'll just kind of smooth it out and

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:26.219 
then I'll just kind of smooth it out and
make<00:04:19.910> sure<00:04:19.940> this<00:04:20.329> coverage<00:04:22.120> most<00:04:23.120> of<00:04:23.330> it<00:04:23.450> so

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
make sure this coverage most of it so

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.600 
make sure this coverage most of it so
and<00:04:27.229> then<00:04:27.260> as<00:04:27.470> you<00:04:27.560> can<00:04:27.650> see<00:04:27.710> I<00:04:27.890> take<00:04:28.160> this<00:04:28.340> tab

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
and then as you can see I take this tab

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.760 
and then as you can see I take this tab
here<00:04:28.880> and<00:04:29.090> bend<00:04:29.270> it<00:04:29.390> over<00:04:29.510> or<00:04:29.930> bend<00:04:30.620> it<00:04:30.740> that

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
here and bend it over or bend it that

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.050 
here and bend it over or bend it that
way<00:04:31.100> and<00:04:31.340> the<00:04:32.240> same<00:04:32.479> with<00:04:32.690> this<00:04:32.840> so<00:04:33.410> I<00:04:33.440> could

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
way and the same with this so I could

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.560 
way and the same with this so I could
hopefully<00:04:36.250> do<00:04:37.250> more<00:04:37.490> vines<00:04:37.760> this<00:04:38.120> way<00:04:38.330> and

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
hopefully do more vines this way and

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.909 
hopefully do more vines this way and
just<00:04:39.440> like<00:04:39.710> a<00:04:39.740> twisty<00:04:40.400> kind<00:04:40.729> of<00:04:40.789> a<00:04:40.880> thing<00:04:41.919> so

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
just like a twisty kind of a thing so

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:44.950 
just like a twisty kind of a thing so
we'll<00:04:43.160> check<00:04:43.400> it<00:04:43.550> out<00:04:43.640> and<00:04:43.789> see<00:04:43.970> but<00:04:44.210> yeah<00:04:44.930> I

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
we'll check it out and see but yeah I

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.050 
we'll check it out and see but yeah I
was<00:04:45.200> looking<00:04:45.500> for<00:04:45.950> I<00:04:46.220> was<00:04:46.370> told<00:04:46.610> everyone's

wall and the same purpose you know and

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.560 
wall and the same purpose you know and
I'm<00:04:55.520> really<00:04:55.700> easy<00:04:55.910> I<00:04:56.000> couldn't<00:04:56.300> find<00:04:56.450> them

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
I'm really easy I couldn't find them

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.570 
I'm really easy I couldn't find them
anywhere<00:04:56.630> so<00:04:57.260> I<00:04:57.560> figured<00:04:58.039> well<00:04:58.190> for<00:04:58.520> the
