00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.050
 do not 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.510
 hello everyone greets them queen of houses and 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.790
 family see you again I'm here with 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.640
 you with another video and here I am going to 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.860
 teach another nail design and what 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.750
 let's do it is a rainbow I hope and 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.360
 like them and these are the enamels that 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.490
 I'm going to use and below this video 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.550
 I leave the name and the numbering of each 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.500
 enamel that I'm using we're going to 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.110
 start with this design that is very 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.809
 beautiful and very striking with these colors 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.629
 of the rainbow and well so let's 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:43.299
 start here I already used the base of 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:46.449
 revlon protection now I'm going to use 

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:48.850
 this color as the main base so 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:51.390
 we 're going to pass a single layer of this 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.390
 enamel 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.430
 We hope it dries very well and 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.550
 then we will continue with the colors 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:07.360
 let's start with this red color and 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:11.280
 let's do our first line 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.280
 let's start from this side 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.790
 so down here 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:28.150
 then we will use this orange color 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.420
 we make the other line in the part of 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.420
 above 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.530
 of the red color 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.210
 now we are going to apply this color 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.210
 yellow 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.369
 the lines are well delgaditas what 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.369
 we are doing 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.060
 but you have to emphasize the good so that 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.060
 be noticed 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.170
 now we are going to apply this green color 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.700
 the lines have to be attached one 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.700
 after another 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.550
 now we are going to apply this celestial color 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.359
 now let's apply this blue color 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.680
 and we are also going to apply this color 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.650
 this is the last color we're going to 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.650
 Apply 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.790
 of the seven colors of the rainbow and 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.460
 good yes it is very nice this 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.940
 design I hope you like it is very easy 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.940
 to do it 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.069
 and well so let's hope that it 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.730
 dry very well so that later we will go 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.980
 to apply this white color now you 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.420
 we are going to apply this white color in the 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.420
 mere little shore of our nail 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.700
 and fill a little 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.290
 and that's all we're going to do and 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.850
 let's wait for it to dry very well 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.490
 so we can pass our layer of 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.250
 good transparent glaze now you 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.580
 let's move our enamel layer 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.610
 transparent 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:07.280
 so that we follow the colors 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.410
 and good to me it seems to me to put a 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.560
 little pebble that I have here but I 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:15.160
 I'm going to put this blue or rather the 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:19.840
 celestial that is here 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:23.290
 well that's already this optional if you 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:26.740
 he wants to put the pebble or 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:30.390
 decorate it with another little detail that 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.760
 like it but I'm going to put this 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.040
 I'm going to apply it on this nail and good 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.940
 we are going to pass a layer of enamel 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:42.210
 transparent 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.210
 so you can stick the pebble 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:54.570
 well there I already apply it 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.610
 We hope it dries very well and 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.730
 then we had another layer of enamel 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.880
 transparent so that the pebble is not 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:05.040
 move us 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:07.890
 and that's how we're going to be 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.950
 we have finished with this nail design 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.810
 this is a rainbow I hope and like it
