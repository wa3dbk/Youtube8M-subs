00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 hello and welcome to shrek 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:09.330
 Of course we also want the samsung 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.130
 galaxy note 10.1 2014 edition one 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.349
 undergo a short gaming test and 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.120
 That's why we look today and in this 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.060
 video as it is in the games 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.430
 temperance 2 the trigger 2 and modern 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.260
 Combat four so suggests in advance how 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.609
 always the usual course I have that 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.590
 gets him rebooted 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.330
 we do not have any running apps on the 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.070
 is emptied when I play with a game 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.230
 I will finish this again 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.910
 Let's close a new one instead of that 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.860
 that we really get the full one here 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.270
 performance of the device gets to see 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.670
 and the games are not all 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.649
 pre-installed but you can 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.910
 temporary 2 and the trigger free in the 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.680
 playstation 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.899
 then you can do modern combat four 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:53.850
 I also wish to buy a lot 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:57.120
 fun while watching go and the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.920
 So the beginning of the temple is two 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.480
 You always have to be in portrait mode here 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.609
 play something in my opinion 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.890
 unfavorable at such a 10.1 inches 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.990
 Tablet that clear for use in the 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.420
 landscape fashion is oriented or 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.040
 design was sorry but yes please 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.780
 we'll look at it all the same 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.400
 because it is a very popular game 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.040
 because it wants to see some 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.900
 and yes we put the visual policy 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.600
 and of course on the best and catch the same 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.950
 at what immediately noticed the display 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.020
 Of course, that makes a great one 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:30.030
 performance what temperatures at 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.119
 so we are well adjusted here 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.000
 high resolution display have 2560 x 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.799
 1600 pixels, the graphics are very nice 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.420
 adapted that one finds straight in the 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.549
 Android ranges not every game 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.380
 I think I also commendable 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.100
 worth mentioning and I like that 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.140
 really really good 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.030
 otherwise the display will do something 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.880
 Contrast values ​​are of course also here 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.799
 a super figure especially in these 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.049
 play or play this art where 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.700
 We are very very strong and intense 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.680
 Of course, seeing the colors very much does 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.240
 very nice and I think it looks 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.189
 this is also the performance ago 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.659
 There are no problems I have to 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.590
 mention that this is about 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.379
 the note 1 2014 edition with the qualcomm 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.130
 snapdragon 800 is not around with the version 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.890
 the victim 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.390
 So maybe that's what jacksons is about 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.950
 very important for one or the other 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.990
 which precedes the purchase decision 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.940
 maybe the conversion is the 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.430
 gaming performance is better 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.360
 worse I do not know but wanted 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.820
 I just mention 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.350
 so much to temple ran two I think 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.510
 you could pull the performance 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.160
 really good here 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.350
 and on we go now with the trigger 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.880
 two of the most recent of these three 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.070
 play come at the yes, too 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.710
 successor of modern combat 4 is yes 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.750
 of my knowledge for the beginning of 2014 even 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.160
 I'm looking forward to it, too 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.300
 I 'm pretty good, too 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.310
 pretty curious 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.440
 but as I said the trigger is too 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.390
 always really interesting the wheels 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.580
 Incidentally, this is also a very very nice one 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.710
 good performance in landscape mode at 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.810
 I enjoy playing here very well 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.790
 the device will not work anyway 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.770
 great unpleasantly warm 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.660
 Let's see if that's modern 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.970
 4 combat nor I am going changes only 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.280
 quickly into the settings options 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.630
 performance and show you the graphics 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.910
 details also here again 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.770
 high, some want it to 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.510
 always see 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.380
 so far that shows you a lot 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.650
 with pleasure 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.480
 I also like the galaxy 10.1 of this 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.330
 thin frames on the sides I have 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.710
 yes already in unboxing if it comes through 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.210
 the display in my opinion simply 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.250
 again better to the validity 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.230
 The device is here while gambling too 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.220
 very good in hand, there you can 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.080
 do not complain 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.790
 and I think you'll see it here, too 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.690
 quite good that the graphics are very nice 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.790
 is adjusted 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.590
 this is very nice, I mean 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.430
 This is his very small one here 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.350
 microchip 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.300
 I could be there , too 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:49.500
 but otherwise they have gone wrong 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.090
 Everything is actually quite good here and sees 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.430
 really very nice, too 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.330
 Attendance now makes the display is 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.040
 really the best on the galaxy note 10.1 2014 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.640
 I really like that edition 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.640
 very well 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.370
 yes I'm such a small display 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.020
 Fetischist what's up to something but yes 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.050
 i think i had the samsung tablets yes 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.090
 It's been a long time since you needed it 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.070
 yes, there are many new ones 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.440
 models with high-resolution display 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.540
 I'm looking forward to it, too 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.510
 pretty much that was the first level 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.450
 from trigger 2 with the samsung galaxy 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.360
 grade 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.310
 1 2014 Indian we have seen great 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.280
 graphic great performance there you can 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.410
 really do not complain 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.750
 We continue with modern combat 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.600
 also a very complicated game 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.310
 still very popular I take it 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.010
 still like it because there are many 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.590
 Devices are playing with the gameloft 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.690
 Of course, problems do not have that 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.770
 qualcomm snapdragon 800 is expected 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.780
 expect clearly 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:53.650
 exceptions always confirm the rule 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.420
 but I think that will be 10.1 2014 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.130
 also not badly beaten here 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.050
 maybe again a few words to 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.880
 heat development still has 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.650
 not changed the thing feels 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.480
 actually still very pleasant 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.880
 you can hardly tell that it somehow 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.020
 warmer would have been there as well 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.100
 you do not complain at all 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:14.200
 of course speaks for the need 10.1 2014 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.390
 Indian loading times also very very short 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.000
 please excuse me as you do here 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.920
 see now siemens very briefly this 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.800
 trailer arrives on my display 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.510
 opinion very very nice over 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.820
 zidane was absolutely brilliant and must 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.770
 you also enjoy it 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.450
 and now we have to be careful because if 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.460
 we're running forward here, yes 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.350
 often and times framerate breaks 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.720
 one would like to think especially with this 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.640
 high-resolution display but that holds 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.400
 in my opinion really 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:46.860
 within limits 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:49.750
 So yes there is one more here 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.510
 but he also has to believe in and easily 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:56.560
 we're running right here in front of me and 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:58.030
 go natural in coverage and I hope 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.070
 it is spent in euro i still have 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:03.640
 No grenades thrown out of the way 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:05.020
 that was now intentionally developed 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.210
 is already here slowly becoming one 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.670
 running gag that will be a pity if 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.230
 the modern combat 5 comes but no me 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.060
 I'm really looking forward to that 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:16.000
 will hopefully be a successful update 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:18.310
 and yes, I think you're fine here 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.590
 this is really very important here 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.450
 nice there are no problems at all 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.760
 we're done here too 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:27.550
 even with modern combat 4 no 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.960
 problem brilliant graphics super great 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.960
 I really like performance 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.520
 pretty good 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.650
 what can be said in conclusion now 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:37.340
 As expected, the samsung was bad 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:39.349
 galaxy tab 10.1 2014 edition with the 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.630
 you always have to use qualcomm snapdragon 800 

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:43.400
 although excellent in the gaming test 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.410
 the games run very smoothly 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.090
 Graphics are great and otherwise 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.430
 all very much fun 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.960
 in that sense I hope as always that 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.240
 Thank you for your video 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:57.940
 of course with you for watching and it 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.940
 be in this sense until next time
