 how about youtube friends good in this 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.780
 I'm going to show you how to increase your 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.179
 ram memory so your device is 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.679
 cooler works in a better way and 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.259
 Let's run with games on bullets 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:18.800
 better or faster applications and 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:22.060
 well this is very simple is this icon 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.800
 who is here here is memory post 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.310
 now all they are going to do is go to 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.310
 cydia 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.160
 and add a repository 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.850
 this study that is in the repository 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:40.329
 of iphones and in the haq repository 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.260
 soccer and good you are going to press 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.260

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.579
 add 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:53.550
 nm dotcom arrived the rich diagonal 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:58.730
 If not, if it does not work, they will 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.730
 tighten ajax rik dotcom 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.970
 diagonal is not that I added it manila the 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:09.910
 seeker and they will look for memory poster 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:13.540
 here we have memory only add 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:17.650
 the poster and here is I have the wifi 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.850
 off is for them to see the full ram 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.479
 Of the device 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.280
 here is 112 there is no application 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.070
 open 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.520
 and good when they install it they will be 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.580
 spring and now we go to first memory 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.750
 booster the application is going to close 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.290
 automatically but I 'm not going to increase 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:43.180
 the memory is not that it has a crass or 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.180
 it's wrong but well let's try 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.260
 and as you see it increased considerably 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.150
 almost double 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.910
 This good memory and are served 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.550
 to have your cool device that does not 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:01.450
 is locked and well this is mainly 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:06.160
 for generation devices 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:10.869
 last that are 4g 3g in the case of 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.400
 iphone 4 the 3gs and 3g I already have an ipod of 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.110
 fifth generation and then there was no 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.180
 I really do not have problems but 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.060
 It's not bad for me if I have a little more 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:23.190
 of ram memory and that's this is this 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:26.480
 This type is available in 6 point 1.2 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:30.950
 and this down 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.319

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.849
