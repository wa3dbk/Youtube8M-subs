00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.580
 so I hope you have a few 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.610
 thought to do so yes what is yours 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.830
 now 0.9 period it is equal to one 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.299
 it is less than 1 or it could be 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.700
 maybe it's even bigger than that 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.110
 One is the commission at all on it 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.510
 that it could possibly be that 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:29.689
 is greater than one 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:35.670
 well 09 period is yes 0.9 plus 0.09 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:37.589
 plus 0.009 plus and so on, so one 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.320
 to make sum with infinitely many 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:42.330
 so it could be 09 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.610
 period greater than one is maybe 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:49.409
 after all , at least we have one with us 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:56.670
 We look at an infinite number of pages 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:01:01.890
 but 01 period 01 11 and so on 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:15.470
 ie 0.1 period but 0.1 period 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:21.030
 one ninth 02 period 02 period is 29 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:29.040
 yes and 03 33 and so on 03 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:35.340
 period is 3964 that are right now 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:38.030
 at 08 88 108 period yes and 08 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.750
 period is 89 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:46.380
 yes and now finally it will be clear if we 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:50.720
 0.99 so consider 09 period 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.720
 yes that's just ninth 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:02:01.180
 but 99 is equal to one, so in fact 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:06.730
 09 period is one and so on 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:10.510
 element from the natural numbers so 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:13.930
 09 period is not less than 1 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:15.550
 it's not bigger than 1 because of us 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.330
 have an infinite amount here 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.010
 expect of 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.020
 but these hums are getting smaller and smaller 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:25.030
 and eventually you just tell 0 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:27.780
 to 0.9 period is exactly the same 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.780
 1
