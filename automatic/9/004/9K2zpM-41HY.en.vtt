00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.330 
but it could be a lot better I was

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.180 
but it could be a lot better I was
actually<00:06:20.540> kind<00:06:20.810> of<00:06:20.840> disappointed<00:06:20.990> with<00:06:21.590> it<00:06:21.770> in

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
actually kind of disappointed with it in

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.830 
actually kind of disappointed with it in

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:25.910 
thought there would be some sort of

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.299 
thought there would be some sort of
portlet

00:06:28.299 --> 00:06:28.309 
portlet

that's<00:06:41.269> it<00:06:41.419> for<00:06:41.539> this<00:06:41.599> review<00:06:41.749> I<00:06:42.259> pride<00:06:43.189> that<00:06:43.689> I

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:44.859 
that's it for this review I pride that I

00:06:44.859 --> 00:06:49.569 
that's it for this review I pride that I
think<00:06:45.859> this<00:06:46.159> is<00:06:46.429> probably<00:06:47.329> the<00:06:47.539> lowest<00:06:48.579> thing

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:49.579 
think this is probably the lowest thing

00:06:49.579 --> 00:06:52.959 
think this is probably the lowest thing
I've<00:06:49.819> rated<00:06:50.149> out<00:06:50.749> of<00:06:50.989> all<00:06:51.139> the<00:06:51.349> ongoing<00:06:51.969> shows

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:52.969

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:57.249 
I've rated out of all the ongoing shows
I<00:06:55.059> didn't<00:06:56.059> expect<00:06:56.359> it<00:06:56.449> to<00:06:56.509> be<00:06:56.599> good<00:06:56.809> when<00:06:57.139> I

00:06:57.249 --> 00:06:57.259 
I didn't expect it to be good when I

00:06:57.259 --> 00:06:58.899 
I didn't expect it to be good when I
first<00:06:57.529> walked<00:06:57.799> by<00:06:57.979> when<00:06:58.219> I<00:06:58.279> first<00:06:58.669> heard<00:06:58.819> about

00:06:58.899 --> 00:06:58.909 
first walked by when I first heard about

00:06:58.909 --> 00:07:02.199 
first walked by when I first heard about
it<00:06:59.059> and<00:06:59.509> it's<00:06:59.949> it<00:07:00.949> didn't<00:07:01.279> quite<00:07:01.489> live<00:07:01.999> up<00:07:02.059> to

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:02.209 
it and it's it didn't quite live up to

00:07:02.209 --> 00:07:04.539 
it and it's it didn't quite live up to
my<00:07:03.110> terrible<00:07:03.529> expectations<00:07:04.069> out<00:07:04.249> of<00:07:04.279> it<00:07:04.399> and

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:04.549 
my terrible expectations out of it and

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:07.269 
my terrible expectations out of it and
let<00:07:04.669> it<00:07:04.699> to<00:07:04.879> my<00:07:04.969> gigs<00:07:05.299> petitions<00:07:05.869> so<00:07:06.079> it's<00:07:07.069> in

00:07:07.269 --> 00:07:07.279 
let it to my gigs petitions so it's in

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:10.649 
let it to my gigs petitions so it's in
the<00:07:07.339> middle<00:07:08.319> well<00:07:09.319> find<00:07:09.529> out<00:07:09.679> how<00:07:09.799> bad<00:07:10.009> it<00:07:10.219> gets

00:07:10.649 --> 00:07:10.659 
the middle well find out how bad it gets

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:13.419 
the middle well find out how bad it gets
next<00:07:11.659> episode<00:07:11.989> I<00:07:12.079> guess<00:07:12.259> till<00:07:13.009> next<00:07:13.159> time

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:13.429
