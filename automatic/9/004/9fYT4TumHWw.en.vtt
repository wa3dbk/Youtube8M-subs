chopping<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:15.240> table<00:03:15.960> like<00:03:16.110> that<00:03:16.350> so<00:03:16.890> let's

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
chopping the table like that so let's

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.880 
chopping the table like that so let's
just<00:03:17.220> see<00:03:17.580> if<00:03:17.700> that<00:03:17.730> would<00:03:18.090> actually<00:03:18.510> work

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.730 

yeah<00:03:22.890> it<00:03:23.130> does<00:03:23.310> work<00:03:23.490> pretty<00:03:23.790> well<00:03:23.910> and<00:03:24.710> so<00:03:25.710> I

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
yeah it does work pretty well and so I

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.870 
yeah it does work pretty well and so I

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
and then the slightest pressure will

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.510
