00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.269
 Greetings to everyone, wherever they are, is 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.260
 love is the academy right now in germany 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.260
 here is the shoe 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.500
 and I put it out here 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.410
 and it is that I put it outside it has been improved 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.190
 inside the house because we will catch him 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.590
 so I can see it 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.560
 inside the house 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.960
 the pistils had closed and I was 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.520
 like he gave me was another but he says that 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.990
 is that outside has changed a lot 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.030
 it seems head of the places are imported 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.880
 both for people and for 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.170
 plants the place matters and then 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.170
 well look let's show you there 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:52.130
 this is the cattleya gas they wanted to take out 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.130
 they had not been shown 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.500
 homeland I bought a while ago you 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.650
 I'm following up because I change it 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.440
 for muscle is out here and there was at 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.590
 side was my other 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.850
 Thai zapatico plant in its own 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.850
 Thai peron 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.650
 until they were 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.650
 I also have the 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.450
 the dendrobium as you can see 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:39.170
 they attract a lot of birth brings a lot 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.850
 kikin peso I will make a video part but that 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.360
 stay inside 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:47.500
 well as you see, I have a few 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.500
 orchids that were 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.799
 then it is acquired that is there 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.649
 you see there if it was a small 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.890
 accident she had crown rot 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.360
 but I did not vote it I put it so that 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.360
 outside this one is in hydroponics 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.190
 so good that's been a 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.759
 a little experiment that I did 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:14.090
 orchids in semi hydroponics and me 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.800
 how he lost all his leaves and roots 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.590
 they see how good they are 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.540
 Well, I'm going to leave it out here and 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.910
 let's follow up we're steam 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.770
 hoisting daily in that part of the 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.560
 roots and others where they fell 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.890
 the leaves to see if we are lucky to see 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.500
 if maybe a little leaf comes out we'll go to 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.430
 wait let's cross our fingers to see 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.920
 if we are lucky 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.870
 day 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.490
 you experiment the Lord have you 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.360
 to experiment because if not the genes 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.980
 and everyone says different things 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.110
 then it is better than you more or 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.140
 least experiment with their own 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.910
 plants and with their own experience of 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.910
 the same experience gives them the answer 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.760
 everything I told them for example 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.000
 who was talking about the 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.690
 Clear experiences that the good shoe 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.220
 explain you in the information said that 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.910
 it was constantly coming out, so I do not know 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.700
 could chop the stem because she always 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.010
 brought buds effectively already that I 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:27.430
 I have that that was the one that gave me my 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.430
 she has already had two blooms 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.390
 then because it's what I tell you 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.920
 you have always have to 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.900
 experience that yourself why 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.030
 because look at that zapaticos muck 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.980
 I was practically dead 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.550
 obviously in my case and since now 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.430
 take a look at how good it is 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:49.349
 those who have to experience if I the 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.019
 came to leave inside this house 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.760
 third bloom that to them then I was 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.890
 would have died it seems that inside the 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.590
 house there was a lot of steam or maybe the 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.349
 conditions were not to maxwell and that 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.890
 I have to make it perfect 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.720
 your own experiments 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.370
 because that is very important and about 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.980
 I advise all my followers 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.350
 when they are giving tracking 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.900
 some plants take photos once a 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.269
 the week and so then you guys 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.910
 they have the memory of what it was that 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:23.480
 happened what were the how 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:27.230
 developed if some outbreak occurred if 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:29.729
 there was birth and had quique if it got worse 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:32.219
 all that served them this 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:35.740
 for your plan for the next plant that 

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:39.580
 he has and his experience 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:42.280
 good about what he was talking about 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.220
 the place matters well the cattleya was 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:50.210
 inside the house for a long time and 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:56.449
 only when I took it out was he 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:59.090
 the outbreak of this problem 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:03.139
 the old the plants that stays like 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:07.070
 is feeding his little son and elected 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:10.460
 it brings me an outbreak cited to not 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:12.440
 it must be a wand or maybe another kick and 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.510
 let's wait but that had not happened 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.180
 during the previous two years a 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.139
 time that's why I tell them that the 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.419
 place matters 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:23.550
 the place if many people matter 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:25.680
 they say oh lola leaves inside the house 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.229
 I took I thought that 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.840
 I also thought that but it has already 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:33.420
 realized that there are some plants 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.430
 that have to be outside 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.200
 the way to cover yourself from the good sun and 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:41.450
 that already 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.450
 I leave it to the imagination of each 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.210
 for example I will show you if the 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:49.630
 I put here 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.460
 to put him there 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.770
 hanging together with the geraniums 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.280
 shining that everything that everyone has 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.400
 shades 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.569
 well for example that I have this 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.240
 plant 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:06.160
 great gift gave me this was 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.110
 inside the house 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.320
 They are usually plants to be 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.990
 inside the house but 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.930
 the leaves got very ugly they were 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.940
 as rotten 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.800
 and I do not know what happened then what 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:22.370
 I had to do was cut all the 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:25.729
 eyes alright I have all the tallito was 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:29.020
 the detail their stadiums were full 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:29.020
 of plants and like that 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.590
 I had a lot of soy, what I did was that 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:37.050
 the cuts in half look already since 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:39.870
 they were out here look how it's coming 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:43.160
 in the perfect but yes I tell you 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:43.160
 that the place matters 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:49.190
 or someone who produced me in the place 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:51.290
 where I had the light says 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.570
 and the good wheat the light says it's fine 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.070
 the whole house of you can see it 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:57.560
 it's perfect that I have it together with 

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.460
 other plants help has not already taken out but 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.979
 from what 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:03.949
 since I received the kikin there 

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:05.870
 grown a lot however the clover 

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:09.150
 that I also received along with something 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:12.990
 says the clover that I have it there 

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:15.990
 and catch fresh 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:19.150
 tell me who is perfect at the beginning 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:22.030
 there was only one object 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:26.140
 the site only a single plant is 

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:27.720
 developed and we go in July and they are coming 

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.430
 3 

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:32.360
 it was perfect 

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:35.300
 now it can be a good thing 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:38.620
 to all this where they are but that 

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.620
 we are all seeing health 

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:42.980
 take care and until next time 

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.490
 two
