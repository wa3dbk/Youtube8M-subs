00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:12.420
 buying milk in the store I give 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.690
 preference milk in carton boxes 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.190
 because it is this kind of packaging 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.699
 ideally suitable further for 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.699
 handicraft 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.029
 I want to make two boxes of milk 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.029
 puppet throne 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:31.119
 let's start with the fact that we cut off all unnecessary 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.970
 first cut off the front of a 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.370
 then the top 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:39.760
 see besides the side parts there are still 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:43.559
 and the back and the back completely cut off i don't 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.940
 I will be just the back of the throne 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.940
 therefore, it will only have to be cut off 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.820
 half and then scissors give 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.149
 beautiful side cardboard formula 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.230
 stripes will remain long 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.210
 only 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.390
 you need to cut this one off 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.300
 triangular bend twist and one and 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.970
 the other can then proceed 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.659
 perhaps the most painstaking stage 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.880
 we cover the whole structure with a cloth and if 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.570
 to be exact unowned rags for 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.820
 cleaning up these rags perfectly connect with 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:23.640
 surface using two-way 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:25.320
 masking tape as you see troll 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.899
 somewhat rather low 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.320
 just to make it taller i 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:35.660
 I will use 2 box 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:39.240
 we cut it off but turn it over 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:42.800
 we covered with viscose sturdy and after 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.539
 of this we connect one part with another 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.130
 I'll decorate the throne, nothing more than a 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:51.450
 clothesline finishing touch 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.630
 heart decorate back 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.970
 that's all the throne of the most 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.970
 waste materials completed
