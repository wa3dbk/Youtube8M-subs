years straight I think it's at 42 with

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.059 
years straight I think it's at 42 with
last<00:07:10.159> year's<00:07:10.459> senior<00:07:10.789> class<00:07:10.819> as<00:07:11.689> well<00:07:11.899> so<00:07:12.259> two

00:07:13.059 --> 00:07:13.069 
last year's senior class as well so two

00:07:13.069 --> 00:07:14.830 
last year's senior class as well so two
all-time<00:07:13.249> two<00:07:13.909> years<00:07:14.180> we<00:07:14.300> were<00:07:14.389> all

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:14.840 
all-time two years we were all

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.600
