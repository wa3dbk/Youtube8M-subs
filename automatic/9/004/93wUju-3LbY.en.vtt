00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.529 
showing how to draw around the spine of
the<00:00:28.920> design<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.730> we're<00:00:29.939> just<00:00:30.060> repeating<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
the design and we're just repeating the

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.190 
the design and we're just repeating the
same<00:00:30.810> four<00:00:31.019> scalp<00:00:31.260> pattern<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:31.920> each<00:00:32.099> quadrant

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200

give it that uniformity follow your

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:57.270 
give it that uniformity follow your
spine<00:01:54.820> but<00:01:55.820> keep<00:01:56.150> in<00:01:56.300> mind<00:01:56.330> right<00:01:56.600> here

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
knots with this little triangle here

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:32.980 
knots with this little triangle here
here<00:02:02.420> in<00:02:02.479> here

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990

all right so we've got the basic outline

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:31.100 
all right so we've got the basic outline
of<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:22.080> ribbon<00:03:22.470> now<00:03:23.660> we're<00:03:24.660> gonna<00:03:24.810> follow<00:03:30.110> you

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
all right the next segment we're going

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.870 
all right the next segment we're going
to<00:04:03.430> fill<00:04:04.209> in<00:04:04.330> the<00:04:04.450> negative<00:04:04.690> space
