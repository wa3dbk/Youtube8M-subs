you'll find new ones for around one

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.119 
you'll find new ones for around one
hundred<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.530> fifty<00:00:43.920> dollars<00:00:44.480> that's<00:00:45.480> us<00:00:46.129> so

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
hundred and fifty dollars that's us so

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.360 
hundred and fifty dollars that's us so
you<00:00:47.969> don't<00:00:48.149> have<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.390> wrap<00:00:48.570> them<00:00:48.870> in<00:00:49.050> this<00:00:49.370> this

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
you don't have to wrap them in this this

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.760 
you don't have to wrap them in this this
black<00:00:50.760> liner<00:00:51.149> like<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.629> did<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:52.079> just<00:00:52.350> did<00:00:52.590> that

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
black liner like I did I just did that

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.639 
black liner like I did I just did that
so<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.460> would<00:00:53.699> keep<00:00:53.910> out<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.270> Sun<00:00:54.570> which<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.440> not

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
so I would keep out the Sun which is not

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.700 
so I would keep out the Sun which is not
needed<00:00:56.129> at<00:00:56.250> all<00:00:56.600> trial<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.719> error<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.469> there's

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
needed at all trial and error so there's

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.110 
needed at all trial and error so there's
two<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.070> them<00:00:59.160> here<00:00:59.430> they're<00:00:59.609> connected

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
two of them here they're connected

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.299 
two of them here they're connected
together<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.840> front<00:01:01.140> with<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.100> 2-inch

gallons<00:01:08.340> here<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.939> rainwater<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.140> get<00:01:10.530> to

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
gallons here of rainwater that I get to

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.120 
gallons here of rainwater that I get to
use<00:01:10.799> for<00:01:11.640> free<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.840> water<00:01:13.260> some<00:01:13.560> garden<00:01:13.920> beds

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
use for free to water some garden beds

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.490 
use for free to water some garden beds
which<00:01:14.790> we'll<00:01:15.000> go<00:01:15.119> over<00:01:15.330> at<00:01:15.450> or<00:01:15.659> later<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.320> our

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
which we'll go over at or later of our

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.710 
which we'll go over at or later of our
urban<00:01:16.860> site<00:01:17.070> right<00:01:17.610> now<00:01:17.759> it's<00:01:18.210> kind<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.479> under

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
urban site right now it's kind of under

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.060 
urban site right now it's kind of under
maintenance<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:21.680> the<00:01:22.970> elbow<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.420> see

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
maintenance so the elbow that you see

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.429 
maintenance so the elbow that you see
that<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.280> first<00:01:26.610> flush<00:01:26.909> system<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.659> is

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
that is a first flush system it is

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.810 
that is a first flush system it is
connected<00:01:29.070> up<00:01:29.189> here<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.030> gutter<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:31.820> what

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
connected up here to the gutter and what

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.270 
connected up here to the gutter and what
happens<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.750> dirtiest<00:01:34.290> water<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.979> flows

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
happens is the dirtiest water that flows

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.270 
happens is the dirtiest water that flows
off<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.939> roof<00:01:36.150> goes<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:36.900> here<00:01:37.170> first<00:01:37.829> and

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
off of the roof goes in here first and

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.929 
off of the roof goes in here first and
it<00:01:39.210> fills<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:39.930> up<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.500> on<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.189> end<00:01:41.430> there's

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
it fills this up and on the end there's

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.170 
it fills this up and on the end there's
a<00:01:42.000> cat<00:01:42.390> there's<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.409> cap<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:44.070> will<00:01:44.310> stay

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
a cat there's a cap that will stay

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.690 
a cat there's a cap that will stay
slightly<00:01:45.540> open<00:01:46.350> just<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.860> little<00:01:46.890> bit<00:01:47.189> just

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
slightly open just a little bit just

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.620 
slightly open just a little bit just
enough<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.360> let<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.780> water<00:01:48.990> slowly<00:01:49.619> seep<00:01:50.130> out

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
enough to let the water slowly seep out

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.219 
enough to let the water slowly seep out
but<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.869> won't<00:01:52.159> impede<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.240> this<00:01:54.899> pipe

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
but it won't impede that the this pipe

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.740 
but it won't impede that the this pipe
from<00:01:55.500> filling<00:01:56.009> up<00:01:56.219> with<00:01:56.610> dirty<00:01:56.909> water<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.390> up

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
from filling up with dirty water and up

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.990 
from filling up with dirty water and up
here<00:01:58.020> at<00:01:58.049> this<00:01:58.290> joint<00:01:58.680> right<00:01:59.460> here<00:01:59.850> this

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
here at this joint right here this

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.980 
here at this joint right here this
coupling<00:02:01.100> it<00:02:02.100> will<00:02:02.579> fill<00:02:03.240> up<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.719> then<00:02:03.869> the

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
coupling it will fill up and then the

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.190 
coupling it will fill up and then the
clean<00:02:04.320> water<00:02:04.649> gets<00:02:05.009> distributed<00:02:05.579> over

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
clean water gets distributed over

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.080 
clean water gets distributed over
horizontally<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.409> goes<00:02:07.680> down<00:02:08.099> into<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.759> tank

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
horizontally and goes down into the tank

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.330 
horizontally and goes down into the tank
from<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.509> top<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:10.020> then<00:02:10.649> they're<00:02:10.830> connected

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
from the top and then they're connected

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.780 
from the top and then they're connected
from<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.700> bottom<00:02:12.120> so<00:02:12.569> they<00:02:12.720> fill<00:02:12.989> up<00:02:13.200> at<00:02:13.379> the

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
from the bottom so they fill up at the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.330 
from the bottom so they fill up at the
same<00:02:13.939> time<00:02:14.360> so<00:02:15.079> a<00:02:15.110> first<00:02:15.469> flush<00:02:15.739> system<00:02:15.950> is

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
same time so a first flush system is

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.149 
same time so a first flush system is
just<00:02:16.700> a<00:02:16.849> system<00:02:17.329> that<00:02:17.810> takes<00:02:18.079> the<00:02:18.560> dirtiest

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:19.159 
just a system that takes the dirtiest

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:23.559 
just a system that takes the dirtiest
water<00:02:19.370> first<00:02:20.030> and<00:02:21.010> allows<00:02:22.010> it<00:02:22.040> to<00:02:22.400> dump<00:02:23.359> the

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
water first and allows it to dump the

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.869
