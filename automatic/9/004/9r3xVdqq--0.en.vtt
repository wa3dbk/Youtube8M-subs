00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.390
 It speaks there personal and faithful beauty because 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.400
 welcome to another video in 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.559
 channel and today I bring a video here to 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.540
 Talk about my game my opinion 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.370
 number nine that for those who do not hardly know 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.250
 in the cave or wherever you live, do not 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.470
 know this is a new mega man in quotes 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.449
 No, the mega man is being made by 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.140
 keiji inafune who is the same creator of 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.180
 mega man 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.519
 only it is not being done by the caco 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.099
 because the capital believes that megan does not 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.630
 It gives more money but then you 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.230
 gave to those who do not know summed up the story 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.149
 on here 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.030
 bernard marketing is a game made by 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.950
 keiji inafune for the concept jp there 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.320
 because it is a Japanese company and they 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.910
 are developing this game more than 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.090
 number nine they collected I think 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.340
 was 4 million dollars in what it says 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.760
 being here is a site where the staff 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.860
 can support financing a project and has 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.539
 very sure and they are now doing the 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.420
 game I'm really looking forward to playing the 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.789
 game and is the following recently there are 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.399
 two weeks ago comes a trailer of 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.129
 game showing how everything will be 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.869
 before only left a few excerpts from 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.430
 something pictures and such 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.799
 he even had some gameplay than 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.390
 playing a game only that was a scenario 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.090
 that had nothing was a background to a 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.430
 random background and in this face trailer gave 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.439
 to see enough things pretty things 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.540
 and if you have not seen the 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.950
 trailer yet I'll leave the link for 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.990
 application for you to see 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.820
 I wanted to start right and it's 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.140
 right on top of this trailer. 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.150
 I think you have the game. 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.400
 Good first, there were a lot of people. 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.350
 many people many people are fucking 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.729
 but I have seen many people complaining that 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:41.549
 The game is, it just does not want 2.5 of baby 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.070
 the game the game platform the 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.810
 game setting the atmosphere better 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.479
 saying in 2d 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.820
 only the characters the scenario has a 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.680
 depth of field in 3d and such 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.930
 however you walk is that side scheme 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.790
 scrolling is that you go from one side and 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.399
 go get another one and go 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.979
 phase is like every medicine and this comes 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.950
 going on with mega - mind also up 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.430
 today 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.050
 it was normal it was all in 2d there x7 son 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.129
 saw that antics that for whom 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.010
 Followed that you do not know that I do not like 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:14.500
 and the mÃ©gane x8 they fixed only that 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.050
 they left the characters in 3d did not stay 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.450
 bad but I particularly prefer it 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.370
 2d even everything had that thing plated 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.099
 so I thought it was time 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.989
 only in that kept Bernie by the fact 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.450
 of him being the new generation will be the 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.950
 playstation 3 playstation 4 will be for 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.140
 all consoles practically 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.519
 up to date laptops for pc 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:39.040
 also and I did not think it was bad, I know it was a 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.299
 graphic that pleased me to concert 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.329
 game is very pretty 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.620
 so anadia type actually artwork 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.410
 The game is very beautiful. 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.819
 the graphics are cool and it's one is a 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.680
 simple thing 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.630
 the graphic is very beautiful is that 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.060
 that is not that exaggerated thing sabino 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.069
 they are not pursuing that realism 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.110
 and such but it is a is a very 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.630
 time and on the 3rd floor for you to see that the 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.599
 that thematic phases have the same 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.540
 classic megaman type the ice phase goes 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.829
 have several elements of ice makes fire 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.239
 the same and such 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.030
 and one thing that I really liked this 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.670
 magnani is that new dash system 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.829
 that for those who accompany the series of 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.900
 mega man here on the channel or whoever 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:22.359
 played well in life also with certainty 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.850
 You know what I'm talking about, it 's that parade. 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:28.090
 from the dest there he that slipped 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:31.030
 which handle better and mega mega 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.709
 that does not hurt and does not measure bernard 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.630
 I can explain to you that 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.430
 comparing that well that is 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.549
 pretty much that sonic thing 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.100
 the 10 that the liquid of 7 has a 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:45.370
 monster there he runs from that super one 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.440
 direct leap of the monster and it's ready to go 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.540
 this site in the plenary will have what 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.549
 Like you take the dash, there's already a bug. 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.859
 here you give the sequence of ten that already 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:56.319
 takes the year the deficit took not giving 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:59.349
 This is a cool parade, I liked it. 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:01.840
 cool it and gives to gives to realize well 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:04.060
 which is very mega doctor really the 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.620
 that sean is the hood and does not want to do 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.810
 so then I'll do it my way, I'll go 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.299
 change the name because it's really cool because 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.829
 because the character looks alike despite 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.000
 that obama is different but of course the 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.800
 copyright issue 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.480
 on account also that it has a character there 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.540
 that his name now that it was as if it were 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:23.960
 a or Sunday in Classic is that it has the 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.750
 rock and me and mexico in a tub bernie 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:30.800
 there's the other one that 's the cause is the king 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.600
 bernie and the calm and has will looks like it has 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.460
 I do not remember now, but I think it will. 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.590
 having a pet also kind has the 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.630
 roche will have bug is also 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.670
 pretty much the same except that the 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.500
 my current generation I 'm very 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.740
