00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.970 
placing top 5 out of this is obviously a
great<00:02:11.220> feeling<00:02:11.490> our<00:02:12.170> biggest<00:02:13.170> goal<00:02:13.410> and

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
great feeling our biggest goal and

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.620 
great feeling our biggest goal and
concern<00:02:14.340> for<00:02:14.370> me<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.000> be<00:02:15.120> able<00:02:15.330> to

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
concern for me is to be able to

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.140 
concern for me is to be able to
contribute<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:17.040> team<00:02:17.250> score<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:17.970> like

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
contribute to the team score and like

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.880 
contribute to the team score and like
and<00:02:18.360> how<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.870> team<00:02:19.170> plays<00:02:19.350> at<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.650> end<00:02:19.770> but

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
and how the team plays at the end but

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.180 
and how the team plays at the end but
it's<00:02:20.040> always<00:02:20.250> an<00:02:20.640> extra<00:02:20.970> pork<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.300> be<00:02:21.360> able<00:02:21.420> to

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
it's always an extra pork to be able to

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:29.670 
it's always an extra pork to be able to
be<00:02:23.190> like<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.400> personal<00:02:23.850> record<00:02:24.000> or
