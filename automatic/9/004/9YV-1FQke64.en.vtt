00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:10.410
 decided to record a video to remove the caliper 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:17.820
 on cars VAZ 2110 and others 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:21.890
 front-wheel-drive cars of the VAZ family 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:30.240
 principle of special complexity will not be here 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:33.149
 it will be necessary to unscrew the two bolts not 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:39.120
 I know how much it will be seen with 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:41.480
 my lighting now try 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.480
 to show 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:59.570
 see the bolt can be seen 1 and above it will be 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.260
 one more 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.870
 these bolts 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.870
 will need to unscrew 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.750
 and it is advisable to break the brake first 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.150
 hose 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.310
 if the caliper needs to be changed at all 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:27.430
 If you do not need to change, then in principle 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:27.430
 nothing to break do not install it 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:59.009
 and we'll twist here we have two 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:59.009
 bolt on 17 penetrating lubricant amazing 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.030
 bottom bolt 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:25.069
 while it was pretty easy now 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:34.510
 try with the top handle top 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:34.510
 by the way should have no problem now he's a pole 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.459
 put on her hair 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:42.590
 Spin now you can all this design 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.889
 remove from brake disc 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.319
 I think it is clear enough if you 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:50.840
 decided to replace the caliper assembly means 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.750
 unscrew the brake hose more precisely 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.920
 just unscrew the hose caliper 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:04:00.049
 previously ripped off here and everything 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:04.670
 we connect back and set in 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:09.169
 reverse order for what is generally needed 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:12.049
 remove the caliper for example replacement 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:14.840
 brake discs that is if the caliper is not 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:19.400
 remove the drive you will not take off because 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:24.470
 what is he clamping this side well by 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:30.830
 replacing brake discs with white ones 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:31.849
 roller skates a small review in principle and everything 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.539
 what can be shown 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:34.539
 on this topic
