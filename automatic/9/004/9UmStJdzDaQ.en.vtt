00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
want to use that is you don't have to

use ray tracing ray tracing can be
expensive<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.420> takes<00:00:30.630> time<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.040> to<00:00:32.040> render

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
expensive it takes time to to render

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.670 
expensive it takes time to to render
something<00:00:32.730> so<00:00:32.940> with<00:00:33.360> an<00:00:33.809> environment<00:00:34.320> map<00:00:34.500> you

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
something so with an environment map you

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.810 
something so with an environment map you
can<00:00:34.800> get<00:00:34.920> something<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.280> renders<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.700> lot

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
can get something that renders it a lot

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.549 
can get something that renders it a lot
faster<00:00:37.370> so<00:00:38.370> let<00:00:39.239> me<00:00:39.270> change<00:00:39.510> my<00:00:39.600> settings<00:00:40.110> to

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
faster so let me change my settings to

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.150 
faster so let me change my settings to
the<00:00:40.739> default<00:00:41.160> load<00:00:42.120> factory<00:00:42.600> settings

Marisol and I'm going to look at it from

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.010 
Marisol and I'm going to look at it from

the front view by pressing 1 on the

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.819 
the front view by pressing 1 on the
keypad<00:00:49.430> I'm<00:00:50.430> going<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.610> move<00:00:50.730> our<00:00:50.940> cube<00:00:51.239> up

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
keypad I'm going to move our cube up

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.619 
keypad I'm going to move our cube up
holding<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.890> control<00:00:53.250> key<00:00:53.280> such<00:00:53.879> as<00:00:54.030> snaps<00:00:54.300> in

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
holding the control key such as snaps in

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.139 
holding the control key such as snaps in
place<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.879> I'm<00:00:56.879> going<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.210> add<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:58.309> plane<00:00:59.309> it's

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
place and I'm going to add a plane it's

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.660 
place and I'm going to add a plane it's
going<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.359> act<00:01:00.570> like<00:01:00.690> our<00:01:01.460> surface<00:01:02.460> that's

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
going to act like our surface that's

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.230 
going to act like our surface that's
reflecting<00:01:05.689> i'm<00:01:06.689> going<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.900> press<00:01:07.080> s<00:01:07.369> 10<00:01:08.369> enter

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
reflecting i'm going to press s 10 enter

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.490 
reflecting i'm going to press s 10 enter
so<00:01:09.930> i<00:01:09.960> scaled<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.470> plane<00:01:10.650> up<00:01:10.830> 10<00:01:11.070> times<00:01:12.500> i'll

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
so i scaled the plane up 10 times i'll

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.800 
so i scaled the plane up 10 times i'll
go<00:01:13.619> ahead<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.799> throw<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.310> material<00:01:15.270> on<00:01:15.509> the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
go ahead and throw a material on the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.999 
go ahead and throw a material on the
cube<00:01:18.320> make<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.409> red<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:21.439> then<00:01:22.439> for<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.740> plane

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
cube make it red and then for the plane

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.560 
cube make it red and then for the plane
that's<00:01:23.640> going<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.850> have<00:01:23.970> our<00:01:24.090> environment

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
that's going to have our environment

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.230 
that's going to have our environment
right<00:01:24.750> map<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.290> i'll<00:01:26.100> hit<00:01:26.490> zero<00:01:26.729> on<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.909> keypad

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
right map so i'll hit zero on the keypad

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.859 
right map so i'll hit zero on the keypad
look<00:01:27.479> through<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.689> camera<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:30.570> cube<00:01:30.810> is

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
look through the camera and the cube is

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.490 
look through the camera and the cube is
going<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.079> be<00:01:31.140> reflecting<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:31.860> plane

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
going to be reflecting in this plane

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.370 
going to be reflecting in this plane
i'll<00:01:34.500> add<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.829> material<00:01:36.020> i'll<00:01:37.020> go<00:01:37.200> ahead<00:01:37.229> and

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
i'll add a material i'll go ahead and

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.510 
i'll add a material i'll go ahead and
call<00:01:37.560> it

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
call it

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.639 
call it
map<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:42.630> then<00:01:44.609> I'm<00:01:45.609> going<00:01:45.759> to<00:01:45.820> go<00:01:45.939> ahead<00:01:45.969> and

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
map and then I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.240 
map and then I'm going to go ahead and
go<00:01:47.649> to<00:01:47.679> textures<00:01:48.189> click<00:01:49.060> add<00:01:49.299> new<00:01:49.570> and<00:01:50.250> select

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
go to textures click add new and select

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:58.859 
go to textures click add new and select
and<00:01:51.909> the<00:01:52.780> map<00:01:55.289> so<00:01:56.289> at<00:01:56.380> this<00:01:56.530> point<00:01:56.860> we<00:01:57.569> need<00:01:58.569> to

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
and the map so at this point we need to

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.499 
and the map so at this point we need to
go<00:01:59.319> to<00:02:00.159> map<00:02:00.369> input<00:02:00.819> and<00:02:01.709> tell<00:02:02.709> it<00:02:02.860> that<00:02:03.509> it's

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
go to map input and tell it that it's

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.490 
go to map input and tell it that it's
going<00:02:04.630> to<00:02:04.689> be<00:02:04.799> reflecting

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
going to be reflecting

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.240 
going to be reflecting
and<00:02:07.620> what<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.490> reflecting<00:02:09.030> will<00:02:09.450> do<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:10.250> it'll

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
and what the reflecting will do is it'll

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.070 
and what the reflecting will do is it'll
actually<00:02:11.550> move<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.090> camera<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.780> rendering

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
actually move the camera the rendering

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.830 
actually move the camera the rendering
camera<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.620> another<00:02:13.950> point<00:02:14.360> so<00:02:15.360> that<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.660> looks

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
camera to another point so that it looks

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.250 
camera to another point so that it looks
like<00:02:16.050> this<00:02:16.530> cube<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.490> in<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.450> mirror<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.170> way

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
like this cube is in a mirror so the way

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.570 
like this cube is in a mirror so the way
it<00:02:19.290> does<00:02:19.530> that<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:19.890> if<00:02:20.040> it's<00:02:20.250> gonna<00:02:22.580> we're

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
it does that is if it's gonna we're

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.080 
it does that is if it's gonna we're
going<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.790> want<00:02:24.060> it<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.810> render<00:02:26.000> from<00:02:27.000> the

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
going to want it to render from the

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.810 
going to want it to render from the
bottom<00:02:27.390> looking<00:02:27.630> up<00:02:29.270> so<00:02:30.270> let<00:02:30.420> me<00:02:30.450> hit<00:02:30.690> one<00:02:30.720> and

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
bottom looking up so let me hit one and

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.010 
bottom looking up so let me hit one and
here's<00:02:32.820> the<00:02:32.940> camera<00:02:33.330> we're<00:02:33.630> going<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:33.840> want<00:02:33.959> it

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
here's the camera we're going to want it

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
here's the camera we're going to want it
to<00:02:34.170> move<00:02:34.290> down<00:02:34.500> here<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:35.120> render<00:02:36.120> looking<00:02:36.420> up

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
to move down here and render looking up

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.020 
to move down here and render looking up
the<00:02:38.040> way<00:02:38.190> we<00:02:38.310> do<00:02:38.459> that<00:02:38.640> with<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.820> environment

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
the way we do that with the environment

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.170 
the way we do that with the environment
map<00:02:39.420> is<00:02:39.630> we<00:02:39.780> select<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.110> camera<00:02:40.459> and<00:02:42.860> shift<00:02:43.860> s

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
map is we select the camera and shift s

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.780 
map is we select the camera and shift s
will<00:02:45.180> say<00:02:45.420> cursor<00:02:45.959> to<00:02:46.110> selection<00:02:46.640> and<00:02:47.640> then

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
will say cursor to selection and then

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.360 
will say cursor to selection and then
I'll<00:02:47.880> do<00:02:48.030> shift<00:02:48.360> a<00:02:49.280> to<00:02:50.280> add<00:02:50.459> an<00:02:50.790> empty<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:52.370> then

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
I'll do shift a to add an empty and then

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.840 
I'll do shift a to add an empty and then
type<00:02:53.580> n

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.270 

you<00:03:00.390> stick<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:00.750> negative<00:03:01.080> in<00:03:01.170> there<00:03:01.320> that<00:03:02.130> way

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
you stick a negative in there that way

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.700 
you stick a negative in there that way
our<00:03:02.460> empty<00:03:02.940> is<00:03:03.030> sitting<00:03:03.420> below<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.440> plane

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
our empty is sitting below the plane

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.230 
our empty is sitting below the plane
which<00:03:05.010> is<00:03:05.160> on<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.610> x<00:03:06.050> y<00:03:07.050> axis<00:03:07.590> right<00:03:07.800> now<00:03:08.240> but

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
which is on the x y axis right now but

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.240 
which is on the x y axis right now but
sitting<00:03:09.600> in<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.960> exact<00:03:10.380> same<00:03:10.560> position<00:03:10.740> of

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
sitting in the exact same position of

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.350 
sitting in the exact same position of
the<00:03:12.080> camera<00:03:13.080> but<00:03:13.230> at<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.620> negative<00:03:13.950> Z<00:03:14.210> so<00:03:15.210> it's

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
the camera but at the negative Z so it's

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.290 
the camera but at the negative Z so it's
the<00:03:15.540> directly<00:03:16.320> below<00:03:16.560> it<00:03:16.820> yeah<00:03:20.150> go<00:03:21.150> ahead<00:03:21.210> and

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
the directly below it yeah go ahead and

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.150 
the directly below it yeah go ahead and
close<00:03:21.510> it<00:03:21.570> out<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:22.110> then<00:03:22.140> we'll<00:03:22.830> tell<00:03:23.040> the

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
close it out and then we'll tell the

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.160 
close it out and then we'll tell the
plane<00:03:25.760> to<00:03:26.760> use<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.300> thing<00:03:27.510> called<00:03:27.840> empty

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
plane to use the thing called empty

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.410 
plane to use the thing called empty
that's<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.220> that<00:03:29.640> happens<00:03:29.760> to<00:03:29.970> be<00:03:30.030> a<00:03:30.090> name<00:03:30.270> of

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
that's the that happens to be a name of

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.840 
that's the that happens to be a name of
it<00:03:30.540> if<00:03:30.690> I<00:03:30.810> select<00:03:31.020> this<00:03:31.170> you'll<00:03:31.440> see<00:03:31.850> it's

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
it if I select this you'll see it's

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.120 
it if I select this you'll see it's
called<00:03:33.000> empty<00:03:33.350> we<00:03:34.350> call<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:34.650> whatever<00:03:34.830> I<00:03:34.950> want

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
called empty we call it whatever I want

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.420 
called empty we call it whatever I want
we<00:03:35.220> could<00:03:35.310> change<00:03:35.820> that<00:03:35.940> name<00:03:36.240> oh<00:03:37.250> I'm<00:03:38.250> not

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
we could change that name oh I'm not

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.890 
we could change that name oh I'm not
gonna<00:03:38.580> for<00:03:39.330> the<00:03:39.420> sake<00:03:39.570> of<00:03:39.600> time<00:03:41.750> what<00:03:42.750> am<00:03:42.870> i

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
gonna for the sake of time what am i

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.090 
gonna for the sake of time what am i
doing<00:03:45.110> all<00:03:46.110> right<00:03:46.170> I'm<00:03:46.530> going<00:03:46.650> to<00:03:46.710> go<00:03:46.770> into<00:03:46.920> the

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
doing all right I'm going to go into the

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.330 
doing all right I'm going to go into the
render<00:03:47.340> settings<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:48.890> I'm<00:03:49.890> going<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.070> have<00:03:50.160> my

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
render settings and I'm going to have my

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.070 
render settings and I'm going to have my
render<00:03:50.910> window<00:03:51.060> pop<00:03:51.330> up<00:03:51.360> in<00:03:51.600> the<00:03:51.630> upper<00:03:51.870> left

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
render window pop up in the upper left

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.170 
render window pop up in the upper left
corner<00:03:52.350> here<00:03:52.800> i'm<00:03:53.640> going<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:53.850> turn<00:03:53.940> right

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
corner here i'm going to turn right

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.740 
corner here i'm going to turn right
tracing<00:03:54.570> off<00:03:56.210> and<00:03:57.210> I'm<00:03:57.270> gonna<00:03:57.330> turn<00:03:57.480> over

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
tracing off and I'm gonna turn over

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.090 
tracing off and I'm gonna turn over
sampling<00:03:58.020> off<00:03:58.230> I'm<00:03:58.440> going<00:03:58.530> to<00:03:58.620> render<00:03:58.860> it<00:03:59.010> it

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
sampling off I'm going to render it it

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.480 
sampling off I'm going to render it it
fifty<00:03:59.490> percent<00:03:59.730> to<00:03:59.970> so<00:04:00.120> it<00:04:00.210> renders<00:04:00.480> quickly

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
fifty percent to so it renders quickly

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.350 
fifty percent to so it renders quickly
click<00:04:02.490> render<00:04:02.670> and<00:04:03.890> we<00:04:04.890> see<00:04:05.310> a<00:04:05.340> nice<00:04:05.610> black

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
click render and we see a nice black

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.390 
click render and we see a nice black
plane<00:04:06.750> that's<00:04:06.990> not<00:04:07.200> reflecting<00:04:07.620> anything<00:04:07.890> the

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
plane that's not reflecting anything the

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.660 
plane that's not reflecting anything the
reason<00:04:08.730> that<00:04:08.760> is<00:04:09.030> is<00:04:09.560> because<00:04:10.580> when<00:04:11.580> the

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
reason that is is because when the

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.770 
reason that is is because when the
camera<00:04:12.000> moves<00:04:12.240> down<00:04:12.480> here<00:04:12.960> and<00:04:13.110> looks<00:04:13.680> up

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
camera moves down here and looks up

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.530 
camera moves down here and looks up
that's<00:04:15.780> what<00:04:15.960> it<00:04:16.020> sees<00:04:16.170> oh<00:04:16.940> it<00:04:17.940> just<00:04:17.970> seize<00:04:18.359> the

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
that's what it sees oh it just seize the

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.979 
that's what it sees oh it just seize the
plane<00:04:18.780> yeah<00:04:19.410> so<00:04:19.950> what<00:04:20.130> we<00:04:20.220> have<00:04:20.340> to<00:04:20.400> do<00:04:20.549> is<00:04:20.989> we

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
plane yeah so what we have to do is we

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.930 
plane yeah so what we have to do is we
have<00:04:22.020> to<00:04:22.200> tell<00:04:22.410> it<00:04:22.560> not<00:04:22.710> to<00:04:22.770> render<00:04:23.250> that<00:04:23.430> plane

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
have to tell it not to render that plane

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.400 
have to tell it not to render that plane
and<00:04:24.240> the<00:04:24.750> way<00:04:24.870> he<00:04:25.020> can<00:04:25.140> do<00:04:25.260> that<00:04:25.290> in<00:04:25.650> blender<00:04:26.400> is

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
and the way he can do that in blender is

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.750 
and the way he can do that in blender is
we<00:04:28.410> can<00:04:28.530> move<00:04:28.680> this<00:04:28.860> plane<00:04:29.160> to<00:04:29.340> a<00:04:29.370> different

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
we can move this plane to a different

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.450 
we can move this plane to a different
layer<00:04:29.880> you<00:04:30.090> can<00:04:30.120> see<00:04:30.330> it's<00:04:30.450> on<00:04:30.570> layer<00:04:30.720> 1<00:04:30.810> now<00:04:31.460> so

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
layer you can see it's on layer 1 now so

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.690 
layer you can see it's on layer 1 now so
i'll<00:04:32.940> type<00:04:33.180> m<00:04:33.450> to<00:04:33.960> move<00:04:34.310> I'll<00:04:35.310> move<00:04:35.340> it<00:04:35.610> to

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
i'll type m to move I'll move it to

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.730 
i'll type m to move I'll move it to
layer<00:04:35.850> 2<00:04:36.150> and<00:04:38.000> then

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.129 

it's<00:04:42.580> gone<00:04:44.940> so<00:04:45.940> when<00:04:46.180> it<00:04:46.300> renders<00:04:46.599> it<00:04:46.780> will<00:04:47.020> be

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
it's gone so when it renders it will be

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.230 
it's gone so when it renders it will be
you<00:04:47.319> know<00:04:47.410> looking<00:04:47.740> up<00:04:47.830> like<00:04:47.979> this<00:04:48.130> all<00:04:48.430> the

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
you know looking up like this all the

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.969 
you know looking up like this all the
camera<00:04:49.690> other<00:04:50.110> cameras<00:04:50.440> looking<00:04:50.560> down<00:04:50.830> like

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
camera other cameras looking down like

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:52.620 
camera other cameras looking down like
this<00:04:51.160> is<00:04:51.400> it<00:04:52.030> will<00:04:52.150> look<00:04:52.240> like<00:04:52.270> it's<00:04:52.509> in<00:04:52.569> the

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
this is it will look like it's in the

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.480 
this is it will look like it's in the
mirror<00:04:53.819> so<00:04:55.289> we'll<00:04:56.289> hold<00:04:56.650> shift<00:04:56.979> and<00:04:57.190> click<00:04:57.250> on

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
mirror so we'll hold shift and click on

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.490 
mirror so we'll hold shift and click on
this<00:04:57.610> button<00:04:57.819> so<00:04:58.120> that<00:04:58.150> both<00:04:58.419> layers<00:04:58.690> will<00:04:59.319> be

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
this button so that both layers will be

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.360 
this button so that both layers will be
rendered<00:05:01.410> and<00:05:02.410> we'll<00:05:02.530> go<00:05:02.650> into<00:05:02.800> our<00:05:02.949> texture

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
rendered and we'll go into our texture

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.480 
rendered and we'll go into our texture
and<00:05:04.080> you<00:05:05.080> can<00:05:05.229> see<00:05:05.470> down<00:05:05.770> here<00:05:06.190> for<00:05:06.430> the

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
and you can see down here for the

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.420 
and you can see down here for the
environment<00:05:06.729> map<00:05:07.120> we<00:05:07.479> can<00:05:07.599> say<00:05:07.720> don't<00:05:07.990> render

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
environment map we can say don't render

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.420 
environment map we can say don't render
we<00:05:09.430> don't<00:05:09.580> want<00:05:09.699> it<00:05:09.759> to<00:05:09.849> render<00:05:10.060> layer<00:05:10.210> 2<00:05:11.430> i'll

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
we don't want it to render layer 2 i'll

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.020 
we don't want it to render layer 2 i'll
hit<00:05:12.610> f12<00:05:12.910> and<00:05:14.340> wow<00:05:15.340> it<00:05:15.550> still<00:05:15.789> didn't<00:05:16.000> work

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
hit f12 and wow it still didn't work

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.600 
hit f12 and wow it still didn't work
well<00:05:16.479> actually<00:05:17.169> this<00:05:17.590> is<00:05:17.740> a<00:05:17.770> case<00:05:18.009> where<00:05:18.210> as<00:05:19.440> it

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
well actually this is a case where as it

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.649 
well actually this is a case where as it
when<00:05:21.610> an<00:05:21.759> environment<00:05:22.300> map<00:05:22.479> is<00:05:22.720> created<00:05:24.659> it's

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:25.659 
when an environment map is created it's

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:27.149 
when an environment map is created it's
rendered<00:05:26.020> once<00:05:26.229> so<00:05:26.710> it's<00:05:26.830> not<00:05:26.949> keep

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:27.159 
rendered once so it's not keep

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:29.490 
rendered once so it's not keep
re-rendering<00:05:27.880> so<00:05:28.300> that's<00:05:28.449> our<00:05:28.659> performance

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
re-rendering so that's our performance

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:35.010 
re-rendering so that's our performance
it's<00:05:32.880> so<00:05:33.880> this<00:05:34.030> is<00:05:34.150> a<00:05:34.180> case<00:05:34.360> where<00:05:34.419> you<00:05:34.720> want<00:05:34.960> to

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
it's so this is a case where you want to

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.999 
it's so this is a case where you want to
click<00:05:35.139> free<00:05:35.470> data<00:05:36.840> free<00:05:37.840> data<00:05:38.080> clears<00:05:38.800> out<00:05:38.979> the

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:39.009 
click free data free data clears out the

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:40.409 
click free data free data clears out the
environment<00:05:39.490> map<00:05:39.639> and<00:05:39.819> will<00:05:39.909> force<00:05:40.150> it<00:05:40.300> to

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419 
environment map and will force it to

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:47.610 
environment map and will force it to
render<00:05:40.659> again<00:05:45.930> alright<00:05:46.930> so<00:05:47.229> you<00:05:47.320> can<00:05:47.440> see

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
render again alright so you can see

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.920 
render again alright so you can see
there<00:05:48.430> we<00:05:48.580> better<00:05:48.789> reflection<00:05:49.210> that's<00:05:49.719> pretty

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
there we better reflection that's pretty

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.010 
there we better reflection that's pretty
cool<00:05:50.130> but<00:05:51.130> it's<00:05:51.460> very<00:05:51.550> low<00:05:51.880> res<00:05:52.150> looking<00:05:52.570> so

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
cool but it's very low res looking so

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.589 
cool but it's very low res looking so
this<00:05:53.199> is<00:05:53.229> the<00:05:53.409> case<00:05:53.590> where<00:05:54.400> you<00:05:54.729> can<00:05:55.389> change

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:55.599 
this is the case where you can change

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:58.920 
this is the case where you can change
the<00:05:55.840> resolution<00:05:56.050> that<00:05:56.440> renders<00:05:56.889> again<00:05:57.840> so<00:05:58.840> I'm

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
the resolution that renders again so I'm

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.529 
the resolution that renders again so I'm
going<00:05:59.080> to<00:05:59.110> go<00:05:59.229> ahead<00:05:59.259> and<00:05:59.380> bump<00:05:59.620> that<00:05:59.860> up<00:05:59.889> to

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539 
going to go ahead and bump that up to

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:05.969 
going to go ahead and bump that up to
1000<00:06:01.650> and<00:06:02.650> i'll<00:06:03.039> hit<00:06:03.190> f12<00:06:03.520> again<00:06:04.800> we<00:06:05.800> can<00:06:05.949> see

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:05.979 
1000 and i'll hit f12 again we can see

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:10.320 
1000 and i'll hit f12 again we can see
it's<00:06:06.159> much<00:06:06.340> clearer<00:06:07.590> much<00:06:08.590> crisper<00:06:09.330> now

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
it's much clearer much crisper now

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.689 
it's much clearer much crisper now
lastly<00:06:10.750> since<00:06:11.590> the<00:06:11.889> environment<00:06:12.250> maps<00:06:12.400> just

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:12.699 
lastly since the environment maps just

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:15.510 
lastly since the environment maps just
sitting<00:06:13.210> on<00:06:13.449> this<00:06:14.259> plane<00:06:14.560> as<00:06:14.889> a<00:06:14.919> material<00:06:15.130> like

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
sitting on this plane as a material like

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.800 
sitting on this plane as a material like
anything<00:06:15.880> else<00:06:15.969> we<00:06:16.840> can<00:06:16.870> go<00:06:17.110> in<00:06:18.449> i'm<00:06:19.449> a<00:06:19.569> up<00:06:19.659> to

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
anything else we can go in i'm a up to

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.040 
anything else we can go in i'm a up to
me<00:06:19.990> to<00:06:20.050> say<00:06:20.229> hey<00:06:20.289> maybe<00:06:21.270> let's<00:06:22.270> fix<00:06:22.690> that<00:06:22.780> not

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050 
me to say hey maybe let's fix that not

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.799 
me to say hey maybe let's fix that not
quite<00:06:23.380> so<00:06:23.560> much

00:06:27.799 --> 00:06:27.809 

00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:31.319 

and<00:06:28.979> there<00:06:29.979> it<00:06:30.099> looks<00:06:30.309> more<00:06:30.759> like<00:06:30.879> a<00:06:30.939> softer

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:31.329 
and there it looks more like a softer

00:06:31.329 --> 00:06:36.149 
and there it looks more like a softer
reflection<00:06:31.779> at<00:06:31.869> that<00:06:32.019> point<00:06:34.439> right<00:06:35.439> now<00:06:35.469> the

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:36.159 
reflection at that point right now the

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:38.129 
reflection at that point right now the
the<00:06:36.399> underlying<00:06:36.849> text<00:06:37.269> color<00:06:37.509> for<00:06:37.809> this<00:06:37.899> is

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:38.139 
the underlying text color for this is

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:42.089 
the underlying text color for this is
the<00:06:38.499> default<00:06:38.829> light<00:06:39.399> gray<00:06:39.809> we<00:06:40.809> can<00:06:41.069> switch<00:06:42.069> it

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:42.099 
the default light gray we can switch it

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:47.699 
the default light gray we can switch it
out<00:06:42.309> so<00:06:42.609> it's<00:06:42.789> you<00:06:43.749> know<00:06:44.459> green<00:06:45.779> under<00:06:46.779> sit

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:47.709 
out so it's you know green under sit

00:06:47.709 --> 00:06:52.949 
out so it's you know green under sit
down<00:06:47.829> the<00:06:47.919> green<00:06:48.099> surface<00:06:48.659> and<00:06:49.659> so<00:06:49.869> on<00:06:51.959> that's

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:52.959 
down the green surface and so on that's

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:59.969 
down the green surface and so on that's
environment<00:06:53.439> Maps<00:06:53.669> mm-hmm<00:06:56.969> bye
