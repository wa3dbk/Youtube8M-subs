00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.390
 hello everyone how are you 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.030
 As you can see I am in bed and it is not 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.760
 because he's sick but it's because the 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.550
 most of the crazy ideas are we 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.210
 occur from the bed sometimes one does not 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.190
 can sleep and think and think and think 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.010
 and it occurs to you in all kinds of ideas 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.129
 crazy as I can think to myself is not 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.050
 to tell you nothing important my special 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:48.150
 it is simply to discuss the 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:51.420
 brain's theme is to say that computer 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:55.470
 that we have in our heads that it seems that 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.449
 no but many times it governs more 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.269
 situations of which we 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.790
 we could imagine many times 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.690
 we attribute for example the meaning of 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.120
 premonition for example 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.570
 to situations that seem 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.840
 unexplainable when in reality it is the 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:18.080
 own brain that is giving us the 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.120
 track I explain for example in a 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.170
 situation determined for example then 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.350
 what do you imagine 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.479
 Well, you're sitting on a bench and 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.460
 before a person passes by his 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.700
 you turn around and look 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.189
 you know something is going to come 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.740
 that could be quietly a 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:41.149
 premonition but it's not like that 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.400
 I think good me and many people 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:47.450
 we think 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:51.460
 the brain captures and changes in pressure 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.040
 atmospheric that we consciously 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.900
 we do not appreciate them but the brain 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.180
 unconsciously yes and this is a 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.360
 pass 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.580
 it has to be like this 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.700
 Y 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.820
 has and should be like that because it does not have 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.120
 why is it true that we say the 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:15.330
 future does not have to be true 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.460
 that the brain often detects as 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.350
 I told you about those pressure changes 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.830
 atmospheric those frequency changes 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.120
 that the brain is already proven 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.970
 perceive 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.830
 as it can be when a 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.170
 earthquake and we see through 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.850
 our dreams before that happens 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.090
 it's because the noise of the earth 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.930
 what does he do when he shakes 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.450
 is about 4 hertz 5 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.989
 hertz and our brain those changes 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.340
 in the frequency of the earth it feels 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.870
 for example if I am now here in the 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.120
 bed 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.870
 and I'm talking right now with 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.780
 you and now an earthquake happens I do not 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.599
 I obviously know before I 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.209
 pass but if I'm sleeping and my 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:06.209
 brain is working and thinking 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.680
 many times we wake up and it can be 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.140
 that after five minutes or ten 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.480
 an earthquake occurs and it's because our 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.319
 brain perceives those changes of 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.440
 frequency in the brain a machine 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:22.049
 perfect and if some animals can 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.239
 do with your brain things 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.280
 extremely incredible as they can 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.299
 be for example the sepia or the body that 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.709
 they camouflage themselves with some colors 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:34.319
 tremendously similar to the place where 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.049
 are becoming for example a 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:39.810
 rock changing its colors its pigments 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.580
 of the skin and staying exactly 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.610
 same color as the rock 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.490
 and that's all about your brain's 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.770
 brain capacity and we as being 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.500
 human as human beings forgiveness that 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.920
 we are 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.440
 and having more brain capacity a lot 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:01.680
 much more intelligence much more power 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:05.040
 in our brain we are capable 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.409
 look for a series of patterns 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.150
 to make coincidences and many times to 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:13.040
 through dreams predict 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:17.180
 situations and this is not a thing 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:21.639
 that is magic or anything like that is 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.860
 all our brain our brain 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:27.219
 and good I send you a greeting that you pass 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.999
 good week and until another new video 

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:29.999
 see you later
