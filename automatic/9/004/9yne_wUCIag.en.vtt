00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.950
 another minecraft 1.8 tutorial and 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.109
 today show you one 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.970
 Fully automatic pumpkin and melons farm 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.440
 and this vision here in front and if I am 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.880
 Let's have a look in this box 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.259
 that it is still empty but if I am 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.880
 now with the ratings with lifts 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.650
 so that's a little faster 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.570
 we soon see that here are a few 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.070
 Coast grow like now and then 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.250
 are harvested automatically and 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.570
 then over that hopper cycle in 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.400
 This crate is brought as we see 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.099
 here come all the stuff in this 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.230
 touring and the whole thing works over 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.630
 a budget that is it looks like 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.980
 a shopper stands or a melon and 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.469
 then you will automatically 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.870
 harvested and then over a hopper mine 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.489
 card inserted in this opera and then 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.570
 here in the victory and we have seen 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.700
 already four gourds 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.170
 accumulated and therefore soon is halloween 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.000
 can we then this ours 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.500
 landscape happen and how to do that 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.840
 colors builds that I show in this 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.879
 video first we need one 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.440
 floor area of ​​three times three or five 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.520
 four times depending on how much 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.350
 Schnickschnack as to the color yet 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.809
 that is if we want to grow them 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.699
 only three times three do that then this one 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.589
 Whole hopper to drop this box 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.060
 that's enough to follow but then come 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.680
 you would need the items from the hopper 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.689
 meinhardt rausnehmen and if we do that 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.490
 we can do with 5 x 4 all 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.049
 Take items out of this box 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.700
 I 've been for five times now 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.040
 Many seemed and first we sit 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.159
 then you two blocks and there too 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.830
 two times around the top we put three 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.060
 solid blocks that can stones that 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.280
 but may also be other objects 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.869
 the main thing is a solid blog and 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.369
 then we will put one more here then 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.110
 we sit here in the middle water 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.729
 Now we rely on the water a 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.409
 stick slopes and for that we set on 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.439
 Block here and then the ski 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.570
 run on it and on the stick slopes 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.880
 Let's put a stone block and a 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.070
 redstone blog and then we sit here 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.130
 At the ends of each a piston or 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.799
 a runway like that and we still bet on it 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.250
 once solid blocks once there and then 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.110
 then 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.780
 we already see that the fish 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.159
 it works a bit here 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.140
 This construction is a backfisch and 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.270
 whenever blocks are around this runway 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.740
 change around then it will be updated 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.430
 that he's really worth it and then 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.200
 but not again 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.670
 and if i am here for example a blog 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.229
 sit down, we see that he gave the farmer 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.550
 was also here and there, for example 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.200
 Then later our gourds or 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.790
 melons are planted 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.870
 Now we are sitting here 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:19.109
 an oven ran so and on this oven and 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.819
 these stones are redstone soundso 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:22.140
 here we have to press ship so that we 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.829
 Place redstone in the yard too 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.329
 can and now our items 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.799
 we can lay 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.500
 here one seemed and there and there 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.180
 let's put a hopper mainka on it and 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.450
 push it that far for the first time 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.950
 where is actually the pumpkin later 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.180
 grown so we build that off and on 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.189
 Here we put the same thing down again 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.230
 and push that is always so far and 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.459
 the china farmers and so would the 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.299
 Of course, colors only work 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.859
 we still need the fields here 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.870
 make and either pumpkins or 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.579
 sit down melons and then wait until 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.049
 they have grown and that we are now 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.579
 the smallest possible executions of the 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.560
 Colors like I said now you would have here 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.189
 the pumpkins or the melons 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.510
 take out 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:02.069
 but if we do it all then 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.239
 want to collect central in the box 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.400
 Then we are sitting here first a box 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.200
 go and then deal with sacrifices here 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.909
 These drive again to increase the 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.500
 efficiency once again a little though 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:13.950
 is already very efficient without this 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.019
 opera around so we put it that way 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.560
 now and now i would recommend that 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:21.989
 you here 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.879
 Eisengitter sits down so that it this 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.139
 including hobby and if you are here 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.819
 you have to sit down that over 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:28.109
 thinks until 7 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.489
 and then you can also do that here 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.229
 Iron grate sit down that way 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.000
 connect and on the other side 

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:36.150
 we can do that as well as the sacrifice 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.859
 my card does not fall away and that way 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.569
 and now have to still emerge as 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:42.090
 that it is half on this field on it 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.879
 but half on the stool that 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.530
 Let's do it now and now 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:48.060
 Let's look at our works and 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.849
 For that we put the race six sigma 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.709
 high of it, just make game clock antic 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.729
 speed and then another 200 and if we 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.359
 Wait a bit now we see that 

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:58.799
 this plant first grows so and 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.449
 when she is fully grown 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.919
 we see that the pumpkin or melons 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.359
 spawn then changed immediately 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:04.379
 and down there in the box 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.389
 to be collected 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.099
 I hope you like the tutorial 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:10.470
