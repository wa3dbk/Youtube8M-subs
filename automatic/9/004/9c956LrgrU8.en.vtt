the<00:01:04.820> main<00:01:05.000> storyline<00:01:05.540> but<00:01:06.110> just<00:01:06.350> remember

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
the main storyline but just remember

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.800 
the main storyline but just remember
there<00:01:06.920> are<00:01:07.070> also<00:01:07.250> side<00:01:07.790> quests<00:01:08.299> to<00:01:08.330> complete

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
as well to be honest I think you could

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.580

probably<00:01:10.790> beat<00:01:11.299> the<00:01:11.479> main<00:01:11.659> storyline<00:01:12.049> mission

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
probably beat the main storyline mission

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.160 
probably beat the main storyline mission
within<00:01:12.920> an<00:01:13.220> hour<00:01:13.369> or<00:01:13.520> even<00:01:13.909> if<00:01:14.210> that<00:01:14.479> half<00:01:14.960> an

within an hour or even if that half an
hour<00:01:15.320> but<00:01:15.650> seriously<00:01:16.220> why<00:01:16.400> would<00:01:16.430> you<00:01:16.670> rush

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
in fact one particular Fox told me I

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.440 
in fact one particular Fox told me I

won't mention any names here but he did

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.730 
won't mention any names here but he did
tell<00:01:47.659> me<00:01:47.719> that<00:01:47.840> there<00:01:48.109> were<00:01:48.229> reports<00:01:48.679> of

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
tell me that there were reports of

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.639 
tell me that there were reports of
people<00:01:48.799> playing<00:01:49.399> up<00:01:49.609> to<00:01:49.819> 28<00:01:50.689> hours<00:01:51.409> on<00:01:51.530> the

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
people playing up to 28 hours on the

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.010 
people playing up to 28 hours on the
PlayStation<00:01:52.219> 4<00:01:52.249> this<00:01:53.090> is<00:01:53.329> pretty<00:01:53.539> impressive

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
PlayStation 4 this is pretty impressive

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.989 
PlayStation 4 this is pretty impressive
so<00:01:54.590> you<00:01:54.979> know<00:01:55.100> to<00:01:55.159> think<00:01:55.579> that<00:01:55.670> this<00:01:55.789> is<00:01:55.969> a

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:55.999 
so you know to think that this is a

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:58.389 
so you know to think that this is a
prologue<00:01:56.569> and<00:01:57.139> it<00:01:57.259> still<00:01:57.499> contains<00:01:57.889> a<00:01:58.039> bit<00:01:58.280> of

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
prologue and it still contains a bit of

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.399 
prologue and it still contains a bit of
replay<00:01:58.549> value<00:01:58.939> is<00:01:59.179> pretty<00:01:59.509> awesome<00:01:59.749> hence<00:02:00.229> the

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
replay value is pretty awesome hence the

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.080 
replay value is pretty awesome hence the
reason<00:02:00.530> why<00:02:00.829> I<00:02:00.859> cannot<00:02:01.310> wait<00:02:01.639> for<00:02:01.670> the

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
reason why I cannot wait for the

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.209

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
that it didn't head that direction but

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.510
