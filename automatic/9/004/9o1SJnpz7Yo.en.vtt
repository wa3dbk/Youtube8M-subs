00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.820
 Or are they planning to let us party? 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.220

 so if you want to know the tips that 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.789
 I'll give 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.199
 keep watching the video first 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.780
 arrange in advance 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.930
 whatever you do you plan 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.070
 much in advance for example in 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.430
 my party 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.700
 the hall went wrong because people 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.680
 planned a hall and did not work and 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.610
 last time and we had to run behind 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.739
 from another 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.660
 let two halls in your head not 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.360
 Think only of me, I think of two because 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.360
 If something happens, it's something wrong. 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.660
 with you have the other already because he like 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.019
 I said my wrong because 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:06.960
 Unfortunately, I do not want to talk about it. 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.000
 but I wrong and had to last 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.479
 time to run after another 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.710
 invest in attractions attractions that I speak 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:20.430
 It's hair from photos if you prefer is DJ. 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.250
 band at my party for example is had 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.710
 the jay heaps and I dance 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.850
 I do not particularly like the band. 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.619
 so I chose the DJ and got a lot of 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.560
 because you do not want the 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.000
 people are sleeping at your party is 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.950
 a very special date for people 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.799
 stay asleep right then I think it is well 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.780
 cool english in dance club because 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.340
 will cheer up your friends will cheer all over 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.340
 The world that is there at your party is in the 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.259
 truth is essential in a party dj cia 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.439
 dance with people like vice in 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.630
 Something surprising my party had 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.110
 waltz with my father that we made a 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.299
 choreography and became super beautiful all 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.920
 world praised 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:09.369
 and it was so everyone liked it then 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.049
 take something like that too 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.700
 out not telling people what 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:15.010
 will have at your party 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.959
 hey if you go out so everyone 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.640
 that will get people will get there and 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.580
 They will know that there is not going to be 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.230
 grace know is you've told it had 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.900
 it will not be unsurprising 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.700
 no one for that person and then I 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.280
 I do not know how to tell everything that's going to happen in your 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.200
 party for others 5 do things 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.579
 different for example in my party I 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.950
 I did some things I never had 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:38.200
 seen in any party that had already gone 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.090
 here in my city so I did some 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.060
 different things that no one ever 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.160
 I had seen here I think it's a party . 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.970
 15th birthday, I'll get to 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.920
 you who the internet should have seen 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.859
 and I just had it here we go 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.569
 search to host dversario but here 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:57.849
 in my city no one had ever 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.840
 placed and without birthday party already 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.440
 have that mean 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.970
 and they also had for him and so 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.489
 no one had ever done this, there's a party 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.909
 here still and I did it and if I mourinho 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:12.310
 had baloney in here and invest 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:14.139
 much because this not only had 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.069
 Other things too but I conquered 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:19.720
 This to have some things so different. 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.090
 that no one had ever seen the 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.349
 label the things about your party and I'll give 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:29.739
 an example of the new dollar had it has 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:34.000
 inscribed that Julia 15 years and the date then 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:35.889
 this kind of label so it's pretty cool 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.139
 people remember that it was your 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:43.180
 party and when you take it home and that's it 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:44.560
 here for example you can not put 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.230
 several things in here can put 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.849
 well buy a pair of small earrings and 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.030
 people will remember that from your party 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:58.569
 because the business has it so I think it's fine 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:04:00.699
 cool it here it 's labeled 57 theme theme is 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:04.540
 It's a very complicated thing. 

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:08.080
 complicated has a costume party has 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:13.660
 movie theme and you can 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:17.470
 if you like theme has pink clothes 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:19.690
 white pink and black blue and white and 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:24.730
 case of my party was blue pink and 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:27.310
 white is black and brown I know it's going to be 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.770
 the face believe your creativity to 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.170
 It 's important that people come in 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:36.850
 there at your party and see that all that 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:39.400
 There is your face and that party. 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:42.160
 could it be your people to think 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.470
 so the party has your face 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.230
 eight this I think a very tip 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:50.320
 It's important to tell you that I do not 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:53.290
 I did it at my party, but I should have. 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.710
 done and now that it's over I have to 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:59.350
 give this tip to you what it is to do the 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.720
 script of your party for this example 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.030
 At what time will I check in? 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.150
 I'm going to waltz this time. 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:10.180
 for the homage is because otherwise it will 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:13.000
 stay very organized and this will leave 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:16.870
 more organized and not party I did not 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.140
 a script and she had it at the time so she 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:23.290
 the hours of things and I think a lot 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:26.470
 important, so make it a 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:29.230
 Great tip you'll be to 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:32.980
 enjoy and it is very important to listen 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:36.820
 see it has to be to your liking or if you 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:38.710
 prefer not to defect 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:42.010
 you'll have a job to more than 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.990
 do not no one had bp but after 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.180
 My party, my mother noticed the people. 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.580
 realized that it would have been more or less 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.130
 the same price at least in my city 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.830
 the buffet and do separate depending on the 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.360
 proportion of the party, so I 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.390
 I wanted to stay more or less the same price 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.070
 and did not get so much headache 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:02.919
 because only you choose the things that 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.060
 Did you want to party and get there? 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:06.520
 ready 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.430
 and sometimes the hall also comes with the 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.110
 Mayor, no problem. 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:15.970
 there in the hall that I had in my 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:18.490
 and you would have been better off not having the 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.690
 people only realized this and then it was 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.460
 really late 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.560
 the choice if you are going to make a steak 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.440
 look for in society how much you will be 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.960
 Just like he did I like it if you 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:31.450
 Do you want it hard, do not you want it? 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.750
 preference is always doing the things of 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:37.120
 Your party in your taste for people. 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.850
 get there is not only to make that person 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:42.880
 It's not how it's all over the face. 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:47.050
 The way she likes it then do it for 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:49.030
 that does everything that you in your taste that 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:51.910
 people will ride for sure let's go 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.500

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:57.300
 tips were that hope you 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:59.830
