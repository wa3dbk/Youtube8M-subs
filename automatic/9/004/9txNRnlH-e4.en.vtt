00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:09.639
 I'm excited to read even can not 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:12.429
 lest I write one thing I can say 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:14.769
 thankful first for that reward 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:17.800
 a big reward of Kazakhstan which I 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:20.490
 presented by the distinguished president of Kazakhstan 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:25.450
 you will set Nazarbayev but even more than me 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:30.190
 touch something truly sincere 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:33.520
 fraternal attitude that I have every time 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:36.339
 I see by the distinguished itself babischa 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:40.089
 and when can I openly say today 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:42.760
 every time I see a meeting running like 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:45.579
 to meet your brother 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.010
 a man who always listens to me 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.890
 tell you what to do in one way or another 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.749
 situations especially in difficult situations 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:57.729
 when we talked in a narrow circle 

00:00:52.749 --> 00:01:00.399
 Dash Gifts itself apparently did not want me to 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:03.449
 somehow something requested or begged for it 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:06.880
 he raised all the questions he put out of 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.040
 decided it certainly touched and you honestly 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.200
 I will say especially in politics always 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.939
 politicians are trying to somehow bargain 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.430
 something about each other give something and 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:17.890
 something else big throw it away what 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:23.320
 the fire is truly on step over these 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:26.740
 we have the most fastest questions 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.530
 such a saying stars ardak akhaldaba ral 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:33.219
 tendon bar flowed it in Russian 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:36.070
 translate so that we do not appreciate 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:40.689
 losing cry as they say so i 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:43.960
 would say i would admit in a narrow circle i 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.729
 always regretted the fact that not we 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.950
 the first president was you Nazarbayev 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.640
 still value take care of your 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.640
 president
