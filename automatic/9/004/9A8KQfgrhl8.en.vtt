 we launch it we do everything as mine 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.810
 flash drive we need at least four 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.810

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.640
 and press start after this our flash drive 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.430
 will be recorded you can proceed to 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:02.879
 installing windows on the tablet for this 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:06.600
 we need the tablet itself 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.770
 Here is a garbage called usb hub in which 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.970
 we insert a flash drive with our Windows 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.830
 connect the keyboard and mouse 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.509
 I have a wireless mouse 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.680
 then we need here such 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:26.420
 cable game so that you can connect 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:32.550
 hub with the tablet in this way 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:39.560
 we connect it to the tablet after all 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:39.560
 this kind of keyboard lipstick here 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:02:01.590
 and the mouse should be turned off 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:04.700
 now we turn it on then click on 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.700
 keyboard button drives 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.720
 after that we fall into this 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:24.770
 menu where we choose this one here 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:25.280
 drawing chosen and here we choose our 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.060
 flash drive 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.700
 I have it here here is the third item 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:37.820
 goes choose on the keyboard in the third 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:44.530
 point and click enter all went 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:44.530
 loading from a flash drive waiting 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.980
 and further the installation continues just 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.989
 like on a regular computer 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.090
 so what appears here such 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:59.459
 there is nothing further in the window 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:02.180
 click install here we enter our 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:06.769
 the key that is on the official website 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.769
 when the mile key is clicked we accept 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.019
 license terms they further click 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.489
 custom installation right here 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.159
 the fun begins 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.959
 but there is nothing complicated if you are still 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:21.060
 never reinstall the system on 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.000
 your tablet will appear here 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.709
 many sections if you have a tablet with 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.480
 two operating systems and you 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.939
 want to suspend only windows not 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.620
 affecting android we are looking for a section with 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:36.720
 windows I have it 17 for 13 and 8 gigabytes 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.530
 you can safely format it if you have 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.980
 there are no 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.709
 the necessary files and at the same time you can delete 18 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.139
 recovery section it is 5 4 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.790
 gigabyte and combine them seventeenth 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:50.159
 section to place for Windows was 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.810
 more just a recovery partition he 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.760
 they don't usually need anyone anyway 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.190
 does not use all other sections 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.379
 better not to touch they are responsible for android 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.479
 if you have a tablet version with only 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:00.989
 windows, you can completely delete all 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:03.090
 sections 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.069
 again if your important ones are not there 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.079
 files and this method is suitable for 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.329
 to remove android after all 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.889
 done push further further 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:15.900
 windows becomes the usual way 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:21.449
 nothing will be difficult that's all Windows 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:23.909
 it works fine here's how 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:26.870
 you see under Windows I have 19 2 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:30.449
 gigabyte place in principle is not bad 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.789
 it turns out you how to install Windows you 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:35.099
 the touchscreen won't work for him 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:37.080
 will install drivers you driver 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:40.409
 find in the description of the video I'm on them 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.050
 I'll take off the link here as you see from me 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:45.139
 It has all the drivers are installed all over the 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.139
