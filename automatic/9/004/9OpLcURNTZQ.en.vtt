00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.660 
finer control over how much pressure is
required<00:03:09.660> to<00:03:10.660> move<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:10.960> camera<00:03:11.140> around<00:03:11.670> it

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
required to move the camera around it

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.400 
required to move the camera around it
seems<00:03:12.910> like<00:03:13.030> I<00:03:13.120> could<00:03:13.270> walk<00:03:13.510> it<00:03:13.720> in<00:03:13.810> place<00:03:14.110> with

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
seems like I could walk it in place with

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.220 
seems like I could walk it in place with
either<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:14.920> big<00:03:15.130> knob<00:03:15.340> or<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:15.790> small<00:03:16.090> hub<00:03:16.330> I'm

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
either the big knob or the small hub I'm

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.280 
either the big knob or the small hub I'm
guessing<00:03:17.620> I<00:03:17.710> should<00:03:19.110> adjust<00:03:20.110> the

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
guessing I should adjust the

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.610 
guessing I should adjust the
big-mountain<00:03:20.680> first<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.370> smaller<00:03:21.670> one

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
big-mountain first and the smaller one

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.130 
big-mountain first and the smaller one
it's<00:03:23.620> also<00:03:23.800> got<00:03:24.070> a<00:03:26.190> can<00:03:27.190> tilt<00:03:27.520> here<00:03:28.050> for<00:03:29.050> the

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
it's also got a can tilt here for the

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.620 
it's also got a can tilt here for the
entire<00:03:30.390> tripod<00:03:31.390> base<00:03:33.150> I'll<00:03:34.150> probably<00:03:34.390> beat

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
entire tripod base I'll probably beat

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.500 
entire tripod base I'll probably beat
that<00:03:34.780> locked<00:03:35.250> unless<00:03:36.250> these<00:03:36.640> knobs<00:03:36.940> get<00:03:37.270> in<00:03:37.390> my

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
that locked unless these knobs get in my

that locked unless these knobs get in my
way<00:03:37.540> and<00:03:38.020> I<00:03:38.770> can<00:03:38.950> rotate<00:03:39.280> those<00:03:39.730> out<00:03:39.970> of<00:03:40.000> the

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
way and I can rotate those out of the

way and I can rotate those out of the
way

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200
