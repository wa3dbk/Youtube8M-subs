I<00:00:02.879> was<00:00:03.879> really<00:00:04.120> excited<00:00:04.390> when<00:00:04.660> I<00:00:05.130> was<00:00:06.130> asked<00:00:06.460> to

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:06.520 
I was really excited when I was asked to

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.640 
I was really excited when I was asked to
be<00:00:06.610> part<00:00:07.390> of<00:00:07.570> phase<00:00:07.690> one<00:00:07.930> of<00:00:07.960> the<00:00:08.169> rostering

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:08.650 
be part of phase one of the rostering

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.829 
be part of phase one of the rostering
because<00:00:09.429> I<00:00:09.820> can<00:00:10.120> see<00:00:10.269> the<00:00:10.360> could<00:00:10.660> see<00:00:10.749> the

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:10.839 
because I can see the could see the

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:12.839 
because I can see the could see the
benefit<00:00:11.259> very<00:00:11.650> early<00:00:11.799> on<00:00:11.980> the<00:00:12.370> time<00:00:12.610> it<00:00:12.789> was

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:12.849 
benefit very early on the time it was

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:15.959 
benefit very early on the time it was
going<00:00:13.059> to<00:00:13.150> save<00:00:13.389> me<00:00:13.719> and<00:00:13.929> my<00:00:14.379> team<00:00:14.440> the<00:00:15.280> access

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:15.969 
going to save me and my team the access

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:18.480 
going to save me and my team the access
that<00:00:15.999> we<00:00:16.330> were<00:00:16.449> going<00:00:16.660> to<00:00:16.750> be<00:00:16.869> able<00:00:16.929> to<00:00:17.490> achieve

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
that we were going to be able to achieve

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.700 
that we were going to be able to achieve
quite<00:00:19.000> quickly<00:00:19.300> at<00:00:19.720> the<00:00:19.900> touch<00:00:20.080> of<00:00:20.109> a<00:00:20.259> button<00:00:20.289> I

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 
quite quickly at the touch of a button I

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.939 
quite quickly at the touch of a button I
was<00:00:21.220> really<00:00:21.429> excited<00:00:21.670> I<00:00:22.410> was<00:00:23.410> probably<00:00:23.679> a<00:00:23.859> bit

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:23.949 
was really excited I was probably a bit

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.759 
was really excited I was probably a bit
more<00:00:24.039> apprehensive<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:25.689> think<00:00:26.199> I<00:00:26.320> was<00:00:26.470> worried

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:26.769 
more apprehensive I think I was worried

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.099 
more apprehensive I think I was worried
about<00:00:26.949> the<00:00:27.220> learning<00:00:28.000> curve<00:00:28.419> and<00:00:28.750> how<00:00:28.960> much

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.109 
about the learning curve and how much

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:31.290 
about the learning curve and how much
time<00:00:29.349> that<00:00:29.380> would<00:00:29.769> take<00:00:30.039> before<00:00:30.279> we<00:00:30.759> were

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
time that would take before we were

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.510 
time that would take before we were
really<00:00:31.449> able<00:00:31.570> to<00:00:31.839> get<00:00:32.619> on<00:00:32.770> board<00:00:32.920> know<00:00:33.219> what<00:00:33.399> we

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
really able to get on board know what we

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.090 
really able to get on board know what we
were<00:00:33.610> doing<00:00:34.410> but<00:00:35.410> maybe<00:00:35.620> that<00:00:35.800> was<00:00:35.890> because<00:00:35.920> I

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
were doing but maybe that was because I

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.410 
were doing but maybe that was because I
don't<00:00:36.250> know<00:00:36.280> enough<00:00:36.460> about<00:00:36.579> it<00:00:36.760> before<00:00:37.300> we

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
don't know enough about it before we

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.600 
don't know enough about it before we
started<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:40.600> training<00:00:40.840> was<00:00:41.289> had<00:00:42.250> been<00:00:42.399> really

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
started the training was had been really

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.310 
started the training was had been really
thought<00:00:42.850> through<00:00:43.120> it<00:00:43.690> was<00:00:43.840> great<00:00:44.020> that<00:00:44.050> we

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
thought through it was great that we

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.599 
thought through it was great that we
were<00:00:44.410> able<00:00:44.559> to<00:00:44.739> come<00:00:44.920> away<00:00:45.010> from<00:00:45.160> the<00:00:45.460> work

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:45.609 
were able to come away from the work

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:49.139 
were able to come away from the work
environment<00:00:46.090> and<00:00:46.480> go<00:00:46.859> away<00:00:47.859> from<00:00:48.250> the<00:00:48.370> ward<00:00:48.579> so

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
environment and go away from the ward so

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.250 
environment and go away from the ward so
we<00:00:49.359> could<00:00:49.510> concentrate<00:00:49.870> on<00:00:50.230> it<00:00:50.579> completely

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
we could concentrate on it completely

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.330 
we could concentrate on it completely
the<00:00:53.260> projecting<00:00:53.739> were<00:00:53.829> all<00:00:53.920> really<00:00:54.070> helpful

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
the projecting were all really helpful

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.900 
the projecting were all really helpful
and<00:00:54.879> friendly<00:00:56.430> there<00:00:57.430> was<00:00:57.550> lots<00:00:57.730> of

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
and friendly there was lots of

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.099 
and friendly there was lots of
preparation<00:00:58.210> for<00:00:58.929> us<00:00:59.019> to<00:00:59.170> do<00:01:00.239> which<00:01:01.239> was<00:01:01.929> on

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109 
preparation for us to do which was on

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:03.389 
preparation for us to do which was on
top<00:01:02.320> of<00:01:02.350> the<00:01:02.530> work<00:01:02.739> though<00:01:02.920> that<00:01:03.070> we<00:01:03.129> already

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
top of the work though that we already

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.850 
top of the work though that we already
had<00:01:03.609> but<00:01:04.030> the<00:01:04.600> benefits<00:01:05.049> were<00:01:05.229> being<00:01:05.470> told<00:01:05.650> as

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
had but the benefits were being told as

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.240 
had but the benefits were being told as
all<00:01:05.979> the<00:01:06.100> time<00:01:06.340> so<00:01:06.880> you<00:01:07.810> know<00:01:07.930> I<00:01:08.290> found<00:01:09.130> the

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
all the time so you know I found the

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.810 
all the time so you know I found the
training<00:01:09.580> all<00:01:09.640> right<00:01:09.790> I<00:01:10.110> think<00:01:11.110> for<00:01:11.650> me<00:01:11.820> once

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
training all right I think for me once

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.520 
training all right I think for me once
we<00:01:13.210> really<00:01:13.509> started<00:01:13.840> working<00:01:14.200> on<00:01:14.229> our<00:01:14.380> own

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
we really started working on our own

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.240 
we really started working on our own
rosters<00:01:15.130> that's<00:01:15.729> when<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:17.140> really<00:01:17.920> found<00:01:18.070> it

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
rosters that's when I really found it

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.560 
rosters that's when I really found it
beneficial<00:01:18.369> when<00:01:18.909> you<00:01:19.060> could<00:01:19.210> actually<00:01:19.240> see

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
beneficial when you could actually see

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.319 
beneficial when you could actually see
you<00:01:19.840> working<00:01:20.409> with<00:01:20.530> your<00:01:20.650> own<00:01:20.770> staff<00:01:21.329> rather

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
you working with your own staff rather

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:25.289 
you working with your own staff rather
than<00:01:22.450> just<00:01:22.659> dummy<00:01:22.869> staff<00:01:23.170> so<00:01:23.790> having<00:01:24.790> having

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
than just dummy staff so having having

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.020 
than just dummy staff so having having
done<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:25.720> basics<00:01:26.229> with<00:01:26.530> dummy<00:01:27.159> style<00:01:27.490> fun<00:01:27.820> and

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
done the basics with dummy style fun and

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.660 
done the basics with dummy style fun and
different<00:01:28.450> exercises<00:01:29.250> starting<00:01:30.250> our<00:01:30.640> own

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
different exercises starting our own

different exercises starting our own
wrote<00:01:31.119> to<00:01:31.299> us<00:01:31.360> and<00:01:31.509> playing<00:01:31.720> around<00:01:31.869> with<00:01:32.110> them

wrote to us and playing around with them

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.440 
wrote to us and playing around with them
was<00:01:33.009> when<00:01:33.040> I<00:01:33.220> really<00:01:33.640> started<00:01:33.970> to<00:01:34.090> learn<00:01:34.210> a<00:01:34.270> lot

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.630 

the<00:01:38.990> information<00:01:39.500> that<00:01:39.530> you<00:01:39.740> needed<00:01:40.159> for<00:01:40.520> us

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
the information that you needed for us

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.130 
the information that you needed for us
to<00:01:40.789> do<00:01:40.939> the<00:01:41.090> training<00:01:41.360> to<00:01:41.689> start<00:01:41.899> your

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
to do the training to start your

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.340 
to do the training to start your
stirring<00:01:42.560> perhaps<00:01:42.920> if<00:01:43.100> we'd<00:01:43.789> have<00:01:43.909> have<00:01:43.939> more

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
stirring perhaps if we'd have have more

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.889 
stirring perhaps if we'd have have more
time<00:01:45.350> to<00:01:45.619> gather<00:01:45.829> that<00:01:46.039> information<00:01:46.310> together

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
time to gather that information together

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.770 
time to gather that information together
all<00:01:47.899> the<00:01:48.110> staff<00:01:48.530> details<00:01:49.600> getting<00:01:50.600> everything

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
all the staff details getting everything

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.660 
all the staff details getting everything
onto<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.200> system<00:01:51.560> i<00:01:51.679> think<00:01:51.860> that<00:01:52.009> would<00:01:52.100> we'd

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
onto the system i think that would we'd

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.730 
onto the system i think that would we'd
have<00:01:52.759> had<00:01:52.850> that<00:01:52.939> sooner<00:01:53.479> it<00:01:54.259> all<00:01:54.409> seemed<00:01:54.649> a<00:01:54.710> bit

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
have had that sooner it all seemed a bit

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.740 
have had that sooner it all seemed a bit
of<00:01:55.009> a<00:01:55.039> rush<00:01:55.310> as<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:56.030> training<00:01:56.299> started<00:01:56.659> we

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
of a rush as the training started we

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.480 
of a rush as the training started we
needed<00:01:57.020> to<00:01:57.079> do<00:01:57.200> lots<00:01:57.350> and<00:01:57.560> lots<00:01:57.679> of<00:01:57.799> things<00:01:58.009> it

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
needed to do lots and lots of things it

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.770 
needed to do lots and lots of things it
would<00:01:58.640> have<00:01:58.729> been<00:01:58.789> useful<00:01:59.030> to<00:01:59.329> have<00:01:59.450> a<00:01:59.509> little

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
would have been useful to have a little

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.510 
would have been useful to have a little
bit<00:01:59.869> more<00:02:00.079> information<00:02:00.619> before<00:02:00.770> we<00:02:01.159> started

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
bit more information before we started

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.410 
bit more information before we started
the<00:02:01.700> initial<00:02:02.360> training<00:02:02.780> I<00:02:03.530> think<00:02:04.399> person<00:02:05.179> if<00:02:05.329> I

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
the initial training I think person if I

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.139 
the initial training I think person if I
have<00:02:05.539> been<00:02:05.630> able<00:02:05.750> to<00:02:05.899> read<00:02:06.200> through<00:02:06.530> the

read-through handbook or have a little

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.160 
read-through handbook or have a little
bit<00:02:10.069> more<00:02:10.759> information<00:02:11.360> first<00:02:11.599> being<00:02:11.930> able<00:02:12.110> to

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
bit more information first being able to

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.110 
bit more information first being able to
look<00:02:12.260> at<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.470> exercises<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:13.400> know<00:02:13.849> a<00:02:13.880> little

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
look at the exercises and know a little

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.910 
look at the exercises and know a little
bit<00:02:14.360> before<00:02:14.660> actually<00:02:15.260> went<00:02:15.440> in<00:02:15.590> for<00:02:15.709> training

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
bit before actually went in for training

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.550 
bit before actually went in for training
would<00:02:16.190> have<00:02:16.340> helped<00:02:16.519> me<00:02:20.019> it's<00:02:21.019> taken<00:02:21.410> me<00:02:21.530> a

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
would have helped me it's taken me a

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.589 
would have helped me it's taken me a
while<00:02:21.709> to<00:02:21.769> really<00:02:22.549> remember<00:02:22.819> everything<00:02:23.239> and

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
while to really remember everything and

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.569 
while to really remember everything and
still<00:02:24.019> now<00:02:24.290> every<00:02:25.099> now<00:02:25.220> and<00:02:25.310> again<00:02:25.340> I<00:02:25.489> find

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
still now every now and again I find

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.000 
still now every now and again I find
something<00:02:26.420> that<00:02:26.720> I<00:02:26.750> can't<00:02:27.110> remember<00:02:27.440> how<00:02:27.980> to

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
something that I can't remember how to

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.890 
something that I can't remember how to
do<00:02:28.310> but<00:02:28.819> the<00:02:28.910> team<00:02:29.120> Roy's<00:02:29.329> there<00:02:29.569> at<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.780> end

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
do but the team Roy's there at the end

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.360 
do but the team Roy's there at the end
the<00:02:29.989> phone<00:02:30.230> or<00:02:30.590> an<00:02:31.190> email<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:33.260> help<00:02:33.410> me<00:02:33.590> if<00:02:33.680> I<00:02:33.799> do

the phone or an email to help me if I do

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.520 
the phone or an email to help me if I do
get<00:02:34.549> stuck<00:02:34.819> I<00:02:35.230> think<00:02:37.569> eventually<00:02:38.569> we<00:02:38.989> will<00:02:39.410> be

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
get stuck I think eventually we will be

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.350 
get stuck I think eventually we will be
saving<00:02:39.980> a<00:02:40.040> lot<00:02:40.220> of<00:02:40.280> time<00:02:40.610> I<00:02:40.640> think<00:02:41.000> at<00:02:41.269> the

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
saving a lot of time I think at the

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.180 
saving a lot of time I think at the
moment<00:02:41.390> that<00:02:42.079> we're<00:02:42.260> still<00:02:42.410> finding<00:02:42.769> things

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
moment that we're still finding things

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.099 
moment that we're still finding things
as<00:02:43.370> we<00:02:43.489> go<00:02:43.519> along<00:02:43.730> but<00:02:44.150> need<00:02:44.359> changing<00:02:44.930> in<00:02:45.049> the

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109 
as we go along but need changing in the

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.590 
as we go along but need changing in the
rules<00:02:45.680> that<00:02:45.829> have<00:02:46.040> been<00:02:46.130> set<00:02:46.340> up<00:02:46.389> and<00:02:47.389> things

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
rules that have been set up and things

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.849 
rules that have been set up and things
like<00:02:47.750> that<00:02:47.810> that<00:02:48.230> it's<00:02:48.380> not<00:02:48.470> until<00:02:48.769> you're

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:48.859 
like that that it's not until you're

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.190 
like that that it's not until you're
really<00:02:49.190> using<00:02:49.609> it<00:02:49.910> all<00:02:50.090> the<00:02:50.120> time<00:02:50.239> that<00:02:51.170> you

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
really using it all the time that you

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.129 
really using it all the time that you
can<00:02:51.500> refine<00:02:52.160> those<00:02:52.750> so<00:02:53.750> it's<00:02:53.900> still<00:02:54.079> a

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:54.139 
can refine those so it's still a

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:56.920 
can refine those so it's still a
learning<00:02:54.350> process<00:02:54.709> now<00:02:55.639> as<00:02:55.970> we<00:02:56.180> as<00:02:56.389> we<00:02:56.420> still

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
learning process now as we as we still

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.140 
learning process now as we as we still
getting<00:02:57.170> used<00:02:57.350> to<00:02:57.440> it<00:02:57.620> I<00:02:57.889> like<00:02:58.670> being<00:02:58.910> able<00:02:59.000> to

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
getting used to it I like being able to

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.449 
getting used to it I like being able to
have<00:02:59.359> it<00:02:59.389> on<00:02:59.720> my<00:03:00.019> computer<00:03:00.079> desktop<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:01.220> flick
