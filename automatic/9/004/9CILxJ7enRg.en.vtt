Sam: Well Wade, I suppose that means we back to square one.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.960
What, now?

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.360
Wade: Let's bake something.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.360
Wade: Cool, I got it right, man.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.700
Sam: I think that was the doorbell, Wade.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.920
And who could this be?

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.920
Wade: Even the doorbell know how smart I'm,

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.380

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.020
Dr.Chalmers: Oh, you again.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.420
Wade: What do you mean me again?

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.780
What are you doing back here?

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.240
Dr.Chalmers: Don't Quiver with me, huh.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.320
I have a note, huh.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.640
Really, huh.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.500
Sam: What the?

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:53.780
Sam: Who are all these people?

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.040
Dr.Chalmers: They have note too, (cough).

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.640
Sam: Hey, can someone tell me what the heck is doing on here?

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.900
Dr.Chalmers: Hey now, watch your language,

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.100
let's not get ridiculous.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.660
Nikki: We all found these notes,

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.160
telling us to come here.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.900
Sam: From who?

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.020
Dr.Chalmers: From WHOM?

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.960
I told you, watch your language.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.080
Dutchmiller: Hey, Party People.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.540
Sorry I'm late, who are mystery host, huh?

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.580
Catherine: Nice suit, nice hair

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.640
I think, I can make use of this one.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.160
Nikki: Did you say something?

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.180
Catherine: No! Of course not.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.660
Damn, my incredibly loud internal monologue.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.580
Nikki: What?!

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.080
Griggs: What your challenge, Charlie?

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.960
Tovar: Yea been from another country.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.840
Griggs: Yeah, probably some foreign country, like Maine.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.160
Tovar: Also, yea burned down my house,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.400
and burned off mustachio.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.100
Wade: After the last party,

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.640
I didn't think you throw another one,

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.640
but I'm glad you did!

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.780
Sam: Me? Why would I invite these people?

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.920
I don't know them.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.040
Wade: I guess it was me...

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.980
...I'm forgetting lots of stuff, Frank.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.080
Sam: Sam, Wade.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.280
Wade: Dirk, Dude.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.780
Nikki: What?!

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.040
I think the TV came on, by itself.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.280
Dutchmiller: Hey, must be TiVo.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.480
Fantastic.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.520
???: Attention!

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.400
Do not attempt to alter your view-screen device,

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.120
we control the vertical and the horizontal.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.640
Wade: Woah! I call diagonal!

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.480
Dutchmiller: This TiVo sure is bossy.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.740
Dr.Chalmers: Oh, good grief.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.220
???: Silence, organic creature!

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.640
Griggs: Who are you calling organic?!

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.420
I'll fight you, your hippie!

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.680
Nikki: If is it's God, I don't think I believe in you.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.700
I'm aperthiet.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.120
Sam: Don't you need Agnostic?

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.620
Nikki: Ugh, whatever.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.000
???: You are being kept here at our discretion,

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.160
we control everything about how you live.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.860
Tovar: Yea!

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.420
That's why yea be burning down yea house.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.720
???: No! That was all you, moron.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.520
Catherine: Who are you?

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.420
And what are we doing here?

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.980
Dr.Chalmers: And why can't we remember anything?

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.320
???: Silence, assorted stereotypes!

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.060
All your question will be answered in due time.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.300
Dutchmiller: Come on, seriously?

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.460
???: No! Not seriously!

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.160
We're very secretive.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.460
Griggs: I knew it! It's a conspiracy!

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.380
I suspect the government.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.380
Wade: Me to, Man.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.080
Griggs: Ah can it, you moron.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.800
???: Some of are choices, you will not understand.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.360
For instance, food and water are now forbidden.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.680
Sam: B-But water and food is what makes us go!

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.360
???...All right, What I meant was,

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.020
cookies and Tang are forbidden.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.020
Wade: What?! No cookies and Tang?!

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.540
We'll be dead in 3 Days!

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.740
(Laughter)

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.360
Catherine: What the hell, was that?

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.220
Nikki: It was kinda of hard to hear over your internal monologue.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.980
(Ooh!)

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.000
Catherine: Nosy Tweek!

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.220
Dutchmiller: Whoo Hoo! Cat-fight!

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.320
Tovar: Ladies, let's settle with the spinning bottle game.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.340
Sam: Now what's happening?

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.660
???: You will notice many changes,

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.760
some of them will be pleasureful,

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.860
Wade: Dude, someone put peanut butter in my pants!

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.240
some, will not.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.180
Wade: Wait. It's just peanuts.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.760
???: Know this, you will never expect what to expect.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.060
Nikki: How predictable.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.000
Sam: What are you saying?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.700
???: When this transmission has ended, one of you will be dead.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.420
(Gasps)

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.640
(Shock and confusion!)

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.140
Dutchmiller: If this is TiVo,

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.160
I have to say, not such a fan.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.720
???: Stay tuned for future broadcasts,

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.860
transmission, over.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.500
(Thud)

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.640
Wade: Oh, Man!

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.140
I hope that wasn't me that just died!
