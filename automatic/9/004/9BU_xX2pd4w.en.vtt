00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.331
 Fascias are soft parts of connective tissue. 

00:00:06.565 --> 00:00:09.800
 Even tendons and ligaments are fascial structures. 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.160
 They go through our whole body 

00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:14.300
 as a white fiber network. 

00:00:16.405 --> 00:00:18.400
 Fascia fulfills diverse tasks. 

00:00:19.565 --> 00:00:21.560
 They help us keep our upright position 

00:00:21.725 --> 00:00:23.601
 holding organs in the right position 

00:00:23.805 --> 00:00:26.270
 they transmit mechanical attractive forces 

00:00:26.435 --> 00:00:30.470
 and make sure that muscles and organs 

00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:34.070
 they could slide freely in the gel-like substance. 

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:41.005
 Fascias are nothing new. 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.805
 Especially in complementary medicine 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.840
 such as acupuncture, osteopathy, 

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:47.960
 or even in healing 

00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:50.055
 fascias have been known for a long time. 

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:52.205
 But in classical medicine 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.375
 the fascia is rather neglected - the reason is, 

00:00:54.581 --> 00:00:58.440
 that they cannot be accurately quantified. 

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:03.000
 Muscle tissue with its structure 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.941
 resembles fresh orange. 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.475
 The whole muscle is wrapped in a hard case, 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.666
 similar to orange peel. 

00:01:10.835 --> 00:01:13.510
 But even individual bundles of muscle fibers are 

00:01:13.675 --> 00:01:16.110
 as well as the fruit pulp held together by their own membrane. 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.045
 Fascia can be understood as a sensory organ. 

00:01:20.245 --> 00:01:22.245
 You could even say that from the point of view 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.350
 perception of our body 

00:01:24.515 --> 00:01:26.811
 the fascia is the most important sensory organ. 

00:01:26.981 --> 00:01:28.980
 It is particularly important for coordination. 

00:01:29.285 --> 00:01:32.411
 If I don't see my arm, 

00:01:32.575 --> 00:01:34.496
 yet I feel if I still have two three centimeters 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.615
 until the end of the movement. 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.780
 I can feel how far my right arm is 

00:01:38.946 --> 00:01:40.880
 stretched forward or backward. 

00:01:41.081 --> 00:01:43.080
 This perception is primarily transmitted 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.246
 fascial thrust receptors. 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.650
 There are also important cells in the fascias, 

00:01:56.965 --> 00:01:58.960
 which enable them 

00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:01.116
 adapt to different situations. 

00:02:01.356 --> 00:02:03.816
 They can create more lubricants as needed, 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.725
 or even more fibers. 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.051
 And the creation of lubricant is really fast. 

00:02:10.215 --> 00:02:12.790
 New research also suggests 

00:02:12.951 --> 00:02:16.155
 that in manual therapy, yoga, 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.455
 Lubricant formation can be activated within minutes. 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.955
 In the absence of movement 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.025
 or incorrect posture 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.790
 creating fascial cells little lubricant 

00:02:33.951 --> 00:02:35.356
 fascias may stiffen 

00:02:35.525 --> 00:02:37.090
 and the individual layers can be glued together. 

00:02:37.255 --> 00:02:39.205
 Because they are connected as a spider web, 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.325
 can cause pain 

00:02:41.486 --> 00:02:43.425
 throughout the locomotor system.
