for<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.710> NES<00:00:59.039> but<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.789> one<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.059> seems<00:01:00.420> good

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
for the NES but the one that seems good

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.630 
for the NES but the one that seems good
overlooked<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.199> lot<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.859> Turtles<00:01:02.250> three<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
Manhattan Project and I think that's

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.649

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
beat'em ups on the nes and the nes had a

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.929 
beat'em ups on the nes and the nes had a
lot<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.750> great<00:01:22.020> read<00:01:22.229> em<00:01:22.350> ups<00:01:22.500> but<00:01:22.759> anyway<00:01:23.759> yeah

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
lot of great read em ups but anyway yeah

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.499 
lot of great read em ups but anyway yeah
it<00:01:24.240> sort<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.900> took<00:01:25.110> what<00:01:25.470> turtles<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.310> did<00:01:26.580> to

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
it sort of took what turtles to did to

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.929 
it sort of took what turtles to did to
the<00:01:27.630> next<00:01:27.930> sort<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.409> logical<00:01:28.860> step<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.430> you

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
the next sort of logical step and you

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.340 
the next sort of logical step and you
know<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.150> added<00:01:30.450> some<00:01:30.659> some<00:01:30.960> different<00:01:31.320> moves

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
know it added some some different moves

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.499 
know it added some some different moves
for<00:01:31.890> each<00:01:31.950> turtle<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.640> guess<00:01:33.090> one<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.329> the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
for each turtle I guess one of the

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.690 
for each turtle I guess one of the
drawbacks<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.799> know<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:34.979> Turtles<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.520> you

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
drawbacks is you know in Turtles to you

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.300 
drawbacks is you know in Turtles to you
can<00:01:35.850> do<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.060> jump<00:01:36.479> attack<00:01:36.740> that<00:01:37.740> didn't<00:01:38.100> cost

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
can do that jump attack that didn't cost

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.740 
can do that jump attack that didn't cost
any<00:01:38.579> health<00:01:38.790> because<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.240> wasn't<00:01:39.540> like<00:01:39.659> a

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
any health because it wasn't like a

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.170 
any health because it wasn't like a
special<00:01:40.200> move<00:01:40.409> in<00:01:41.130> terms<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.430> three<00:01:41.759> each

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
special move in terms of three each

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.569 
special move in terms of three each
turtle<00:01:42.630> has<00:01:42.780> their<00:01:42.960> own<00:01:42.990> special<00:01:43.229> ability<00:01:43.979> but

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
turtle has their own special ability but

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.999 
turtle has their own special ability but
