stuck an airlock Ian basically I filled

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.920 
stuck an airlock Ian basically I filled
the<00:01:27.509> carboy<00:01:27.990> up<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:29.070> Shinto<00:01:29.340> shoulders<00:01:29.930> to

the carboy up to the Shinto shoulders to
allow<00:01:31.140> for<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.380> fermentation<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.250> the

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
allow for the fermentation and the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.370 
allow for the fermentation and the
excess<00:01:33.060> has<00:01:33.210> gone<00:01:33.390> into<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.720> bottle<00:01:34.049> next<00:01:34.320> to

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
excess has gone into the bottle next to

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.469 
excess has gone into the bottle next to
it<00:01:34.530> that's<00:01:35.340> going<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.610> ferment<00:01:36.000> at<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.270> same

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
it that's going to ferment at the same

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.929 
it that's going to ferment at the same
time<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.110> then<00:01:37.350> hopefully<00:01:37.640> when<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.670> do<00:01:38.790> the

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
time and then hopefully when I do the

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.990 
time and then hopefully when I do the
first<00:01:39.150> racking<00:01:39.450> i'll<00:01:40.380> have<00:01:40.619> enough<00:01:41.070> wine<00:01:41.400> from

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
first racking i'll have enough wine from

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.179 
first racking i'll have enough wine from
the<00:01:42.119> same<00:01:42.329> batch<00:01:42.600> they'll<00:01:43.079> be<00:01:43.170> able<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.500> top<00:01:44.009> up

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
the same batch they'll be able to top up

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.060 
the same batch they'll be able to top up
with<00:01:44.430> that's<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.270> idea<00:01:45.540> anyway<00:01:45.979> but<00:01:46.979> they

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
with that's the idea anyway but they

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.069 
with that's the idea anyway but they
wrapped<00:01:47.250> up<00:01:47.490> basically<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.570> one<00:01:48.720> on<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.899> left

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
wrapped up basically the one on the left

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.749 
wrapped up basically the one on the left
in<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.259> paper<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.860> other<00:01:49.979> one<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.340> bubble

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
in the paper and the other one in bubble

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.670 
in the paper and the other one in bubble
wrap<00:01:50.790> just<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.689> try<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.380> keep<00:01:52.530> the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
wrap just to try and keep the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.740 
wrap just to try and keep the
temperature<00:01:53.220> constant<00:01:53.420> we've<00:01:54.420> had<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.540> bit<00:01:54.720> of

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
temperature constant we've had a bit of

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.109 
temperature constant we've had a bit of
snow<00:01:55.020> here<00:01:55.049> recently<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.759> don't<00:01:56.939> want<00:01:57.060> it

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
snow here recently and I don't want it

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.630 
snow here recently and I don't want it
affecting<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.600> fermentation<00:01:58.259> as<00:01:58.490> you<00:01:59.490> can

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
affecting the fermentation as you can

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.260 
affecting the fermentation as you can
see<00:01:59.930> there's<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:01.020> nice<00:02:01.200> steady<00:02:01.909> ferment<00:02:02.909> going

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
see there's a nice steady ferment going

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.480 
see there's a nice steady ferment going
on<00:02:03.590> some<00:02:04.590> bubbles<00:02:04.950> coming<00:02:05.219> out<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.340> there

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
on some bubbles coming out of there

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.240 
on some bubbles coming out of there
quite<00:02:05.670> nicely

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
quite nicely

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.190 
quite nicely
should<00:02:08.250> be<00:02:08.369> okay<00:02:08.759> give<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.869> couple<00:02:10.140> of

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
should be okay give that a couple of

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.690 
should be okay give that a couple of
months<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.649> then<00:02:10.769> I'll<00:02:10.920> take<00:02:11.370> me<00:02:11.489> off<00:02:11.580> the

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
months and then I'll take me off the

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.420 
months and then I'll take me off the
sediment<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.800> just<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.010> left<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.310> can

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
sediment and just to the left you can

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.009 
sediment and just to the left you can
also<00:02:14.519> see<00:02:14.790> I've<00:02:14.879> got<00:02:14.940> some<00:02:15.269> beer<00:02:15.599> bottles

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
also see I've got some beer bottles

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.470 
also see I've got some beer bottles
there<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.620> slightly<00:02:17.099> further<00:02:17.400> up<00:02:17.700> there's

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
there and slightly further up there's

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.750 
there and slightly further up there's
some<00:02:18.750> more<00:02:18.989> and<00:02:19.170> bits<00:02:19.319> and<00:02:19.500> pieces<00:02:19.830> there<00:02:20.069> do

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
some more and bits and pieces there do

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.900 
some more and bits and pieces there do
make<00:02:20.940> some<00:02:21.150> beer<00:02:21.330> also<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:22.319> cider<00:02:22.910> anyway

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910
