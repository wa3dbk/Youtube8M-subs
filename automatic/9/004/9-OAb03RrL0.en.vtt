much for me to watch in so little time

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.300 
much for me to watch in so little time
so<00:04:15.450> there<00:04:16.109> we<00:04:16.260> have<00:04:16.410> it<00:04:16.440> this<00:04:16.680> is<00:04:16.859> season<00:04:17.190> 3<00:04:18.020> and

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
so there we have it this is season 3 and

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.060 
so there we have it this is season 3 and
let's<00:04:20.310> move<00:04:20.489> on<00:04:20.670> to<00:04:21.030> the<00:04:21.390> movie<00:04:21.960> and<00:04:22.200> the<00:04:23.040> movie

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
let's move on to the movie and the movie

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.190 
let's move on to the movie and the movie
I<00:04:23.340> believe<00:04:23.640> it<00:04:23.760> follows<00:04:24.120> right<00:04:24.300> after<00:04:24.419> season

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
I believe it follows right after season

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.760 
I believe it follows right after season
1

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
1

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.010 
1
so<00:04:25.860> you<00:04:26.340> don't<00:04:26.520> watch<00:04:26.669> this<00:04:26.970> after<00:04:27.360> season<00:04:27.720> 3<00:04:27.990> I

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
so you don't watch this after season 3 I

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.790 
so you don't watch this after season 3 I
think<00:04:28.349> this<00:04:28.530> follows<00:04:28.830> right<00:04:29.069> after<00:04:29.190> season<00:04:29.759> 1

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
think this follows right after season 1

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.980 
think this follows right after season 1
but<00:04:31.800> I'll<00:04:31.889> have<00:04:32.069> to<00:04:32.160> double<00:04:32.280> check<00:04:32.490> on<00:04:32.789> that

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990
