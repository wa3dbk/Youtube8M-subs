00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.830 
number number 99 and then of course 2013
and<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.310> believe<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:50.909> shoe<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.420> in

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
and I believe this shoe is in

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.050 
and I believe this shoe is in
commemoration<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.829> him<00:01:53.070> being<00:01:53.310> inducted<00:01:53.700> into

commemoration of him being inducted into

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.350 
commemoration of him being inducted into
the<00:01:54.420> Pro<00:01:54.890> Football<00:01:55.890> Hall<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.460> Fame<00:01:56.670> if<00:01:57.180> you

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
the Pro Football Hall of Fame if you

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.569 
the Pro Football Hall of Fame if you
will<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.500> believe<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.770> was<00:01:59.100> just<00:01:59.130> this

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
will and I believe that was just this

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.880 
will and I believe that was just this
year<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.000> that's<00:02:00.119> why<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.329> 2013<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.439> on<00:02:01.680> one<00:02:01.860> of

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
year so that's why a 2013 is on one of

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.679 
year so that's why a 2013 is on one of
the<00:02:02.009> heel<00:02:02.159> tabs<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:02.880> believe<00:02:03.149> Tampa<00:02:03.540> Bay

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
the heel tabs and I believe Tampa Bay

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.780 
the heel tabs and I believe Tampa Bay
just<00:02:04.380> recently<00:02:04.770> or<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:04.979> few<00:02:05.189> years<00:02:05.219> ago<00:02:05.579> maybe

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
just recently or a few years ago maybe

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.570 
just recently or a few years ago maybe
retired<00:02:06.689> his<00:02:06.990> number<00:02:07.020> 99<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.129> no<00:02:08.220> one<00:02:08.369> else<00:02:08.429> is

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
retired his number 99 so no one else is

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.010 
retired his number 99 so no one else is
going<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.759> be<00:02:08.849> wearing<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.209> anymore<00:02:09.599> and

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
going to be wearing that anymore and

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.720 
going to be wearing that anymore and
then<00:02:10.140> as<00:02:10.259> far<00:02:10.410> as<00:02:10.500> other<00:02:10.590> details<00:02:11.039> go<00:02:11.250> on<00:02:11.459> both

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
then as far as other details go on both

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.910 
then as far as other details go on both

material is somewhat unique it's kind of
a<00:02:36.600> it<00:02:37.080> obviously<00:02:37.500> is<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.650> synthetic<00:02:37.980> material

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220

little<00:02:45.360> piece<00:02:45.510> of<00:02:45.630> plastic<00:02:45.959> here<00:02:46.140> that<00:02:46.290> you

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
little piece of plastic here that you

little piece of plastic here that you
guys<00:02:46.500> can<00:02:46.709> see<00:02:46.860> is<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.069> slightly<00:02:47.519> different

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
guys can see is a slightly different

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.940 
guys can see is a slightly different
color<00:02:48.120> than<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.480> rest<00:02:48.720> of<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.080> upper<00:02:49.260> that<00:02:49.890> is

color than the rest of the upper that is

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.530 
color than the rest of the upper that is
because<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.459> is<00:02:50.610> plastic<00:02:51.120> so<00:02:51.269> it's<00:02:51.390> almost

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
because it is plastic so it's almost

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.600 
because it is plastic so it's almost
like<00:02:51.720> an<00:02:51.989> external<00:02:52.500> heel<00:02:52.680> counter<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.489> that

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
gray areas right here also a rubber with

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.659 
gray areas right here also a rubber with
that<00:04:42.169> kind<00:04:42.380> of<00:04:42.410> diamond<00:04:42.860> pattern<00:04:43.099> throughout

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
that kind of diamond pattern throughout

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.370 
that kind of diamond pattern throughout
and<00:04:44.120> then<00:04:44.180> back<00:04:44.449> in<00:04:44.630> the<00:04:44.690> heel<00:04:44.900> these<00:04:45.139> two

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
and then back in the heel these two

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.770 
and then back in the heel these two
separated<00:04:45.979> parts<00:04:46.310> are<00:04:46.550> also<00:04:47.030> in<00:04:47.360> rubber<00:04:47.569> and

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
separated parts are also in rubber and

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.809 
separated parts are also in rubber and
all<00:04:47.930> of<00:04:48.020> this<00:04:48.139> is<00:04:48.319> that<00:04:48.530> Nike<00:04:48.860> free<00:04:49.069> setup<00:04:49.430> so

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:49.819 
all of this is that Nike free setup so

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:51.490 
all of this is that Nike free setup so
it<00:04:49.940> is<00:04:50.060> relatively<00:04:50.569> flexible<00:04:50.840> is<00:04:51.229> actually

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
it is relatively flexible is actually

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.689 
it is relatively flexible is actually
stuffing<00:04:51.889> in<00:04:51.979> the<00:04:52.069> shoe<00:04:52.220> so<00:04:52.340> that's<00:04:52.490> why<00:04:52.610> it's

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
stuffing in the shoe so that's why it's

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:54.610 
stuffing in the shoe so that's why it's
not<00:04:52.789> bending<00:04:53.180> so<00:04:53.330> freely<00:04:53.569> and<00:04:53.900> then<00:04:54.349> all<00:04:54.590> of

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
not bending so freely and then all of

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.290 
not bending so freely and then all of
the<00:04:55.160> black<00:04:55.370> areas<00:04:55.819> are<00:04:55.849> pretty<00:04:56.120> much<00:04:56.240> just

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
the black areas are pretty much just

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.420 
the black areas are pretty much just
hard<00:04:56.810> foam<00:04:57.110> there's<00:04:57.380> no<00:04:57.500> actual<00:04:57.830> grip<00:04:58.130> on<00:04:58.310> the

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
hard foam there's no actual grip on the

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.129 
hard foam there's no actual grip on the
bottom<00:04:58.580> of<00:04:58.729> the<00:04:58.789> shoe<00:04:59.000> and<00:04:59.509> I'm<00:04:59.599> not<00:04:59.780> sure<00:04:59.960> it's

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
bottom of the shoe and I'm not sure it's

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:01.990 
bottom of the shoe and I'm not sure it's
entirely<00:05:00.500> necessary<00:05:00.860> through<00:05:01.460> the<00:05:01.580> mid<00:05:01.759> foot

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
entirely necessary through the mid foot

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.820 
entirely necessary through the mid foot
either<00:05:02.240> so<00:05:02.930> I<00:05:02.990> pretty<00:05:03.139> much<00:05:03.229> it<00:05:03.440> as<00:05:03.560> far<00:05:03.590> as

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
either so I pretty much it as far as

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.469 
either so I pretty much it as far as
just<00:05:04.430> the<00:05:04.580> detailed<00:05:04.970> look<00:05:05.150> and<00:05:05.330> all<00:05:05.389> the

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
just the detailed look and all the

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:07.149 
just the detailed look and all the
technical<00:05:05.900> specifications<00:05:06.650> of<00:05:06.860> the<00:05:07.009> shoe

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:07.159 
technical specifications of the shoe

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:09.550 
technical specifications of the shoe
itself<00:05:07.490> and<00:05:08.030> move<00:05:08.150> on<00:05:08.330> next<00:05:08.509> to<00:05:08.840> a<00:05:08.870> quick<00:05:09.380> on

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
itself and move on next to a quick on

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.499 
itself and move on next to a quick on
feet<00:05:09.949> so<00:05:10.130> I<00:05:10.159> can<00:05:10.250> get<00:05:10.340> a<00:05:10.400> better<00:05:10.550> idea<00:05:10.669> as<00:05:11.270> to

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:11.509 
feet so I can get a better idea as to

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:14.409 
feet so I can get a better idea as to
how<00:05:11.630> these<00:05:11.840> shoes<00:05:12.199> look<00:05:12.819> all<00:05:13.819> right<00:05:14.030> here's<00:05:14.360> a

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:51.349

which is what is designed for at the end

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:10.749 
which is what is designed for at the end
of<00:06:09.319> the<00:06:09.409> day<00:06:09.590> so<00:06:10.159> that's<00:06:10.280> pretty<00:06:10.400> much<00:06:10.460> it<00:06:10.639> as

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:10.759 
of the day so that's pretty much it as

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:12.399 
of the day so that's pretty much it as
far<00:06:10.789> as<00:06:11.000> what<00:06:11.150> it<00:06:11.210> looks<00:06:11.389> like<00:06:11.509> on<00:06:11.719> feet<00:06:12.110> with<00:06:12.380> a

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:12.409 
far as what it looks like on feet with a

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:14.589 
far as what it looks like on feet with a
pair<00:06:12.710> of<00:06:12.740> shorts<00:06:13.009> mu<00:06:13.669> on<00:06:13.819> next<00:06:14.120> what<00:06:14.270> they<00:06:14.389> look

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:14.599 
pair of shorts mu on next what they look

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:17.379 
pair of shorts mu on next what they look
like<00:06:14.780> with<00:06:15.110> a<00:06:15.319> pair<00:06:15.590> of<00:06:15.800> pants<00:06:16.340> all<00:06:17.330> right

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:17.389 
like with a pair of pants all right

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:20.200 
like with a pair of pants all right
here's<00:06:17.840> a<00:06:17.900> quick<00:06:18.139> look<00:06:18.409> at<00:06:18.620> the<00:06:18.860> Nike<00:06:19.210> 37.0

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210 
here's a quick look at the Nike 37.0

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.719 
here's a quick look at the Nike 37.0
trainers<00:06:20.780> on<00:06:21.020> feet<00:06:21.560> with<00:06:21.889> a<00:06:21.919> pair<00:06:22.250> of<00:06:22.280> pants

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:22.729 
trainers on feet with a pair of pants

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:23.950 
trainers on feet with a pair of pants
and<00:06:22.849> again<00:06:23.120> I<00:06:23.150> think<00:06:23.270> these<00:06:23.539> shoes<00:06:23.810> look

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
and again I think these shoes look

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.659 
and again I think these shoes look
pretty<00:06:24.319> good<00:06:24.560> especially<00:06:25.430> in<00:06:25.550> this

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:25.669 
pretty good especially in this

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:27.520 
pretty good especially in this
particular<00:06:25.969> colorway<00:06:26.569> that<00:06:26.599> it<00:06:27.289> is

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:27.530 
particular colorway that it is

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.050 
particular colorway that it is
performance<00:06:28.130> oriented<00:06:28.370> but<00:06:28.759> at<00:06:28.819> the<00:06:28.909> same

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.060 
performance oriented but at the same

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.760 
performance oriented but at the same
time<00:06:29.330> it<00:06:29.539> has<00:06:29.659> something<00:06:29.900> special<00:06:30.500> about<00:06:30.620> it

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:30.770 
time it has something special about it

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.430 
time it has something special about it
that<00:06:31.340> I<00:06:31.370> think<00:06:31.669> fares<00:06:31.940> well<00:06:32.210> as<00:06:32.509> a<00:06:32.539> casual<00:06:33.259> wear

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 
that I think fares well as a casual wear

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.920 
that I think fares well as a casual wear
shoe<00:06:33.770> the<00:06:34.520> black<00:06:34.759> and<00:06:35.060> grave<00:06:35.360> really<00:06:35.630> looks

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 
shoe the black and grave really looks

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.779 
shoe the black and grave really looks
good<00:06:36.080> together<00:06:36.289> it's<00:06:36.680> subtle<00:06:37.339> but<00:06:37.490> at<00:06:37.699> the

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:37.789 
good together it's subtle but at the

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:38.290 
good together it's subtle but at the
same<00:06:37.969> time

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:38.300 
same time

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.850 
same time
just<00:06:38.539> a<00:06:38.599> little<00:06:38.780> bit<00:06:38.930> flashy<00:06:39.199> which<00:06:39.530> is<00:06:39.650> why<00:06:39.830> I

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:39.860 
just a little bit flashy which is why I

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.800 
just a little bit flashy which is why I
was<00:06:40.099> a<00:06:40.159> really<00:06:40.460> big<00:06:40.610> fan<00:06:40.909> of<00:06:40.940> this<00:06:41.449> particular

colorway and overall definitely a pair

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.399 
colorway and overall definitely a pair
of<00:06:44.270> shoes<00:06:44.569> that<00:06:44.599> you<00:06:44.750> can<00:06:44.810> get<00:06:45.020> away<00:06:45.110> with
