 I leave the compressed mods they have to 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.010
 unzip so they can grab one 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.600
 and pass them to the block launcher pro that is 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.080
 the application with which we are going to 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.310

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.930

 start everything is in the description of 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.559
 video and 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.579
 The first thing we are going to do is open the 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.899
 blog launcher pro and let's see what 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.519
 above we will see a little key 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:47.930
 where minecraft says to you is going to 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.300
 appear a little key to me not me 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.980
 appears because I hide it but only 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.690
 Click here give the little key and go to them 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.640
 to open this menu there they give you where 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.040
 says launcher options and it's going to 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.229
 open another menu when the first one we go 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.839
 to activate the texture package we are going to 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:04.430
 give in using packages and down we go 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.619
 to give to click also where it says 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.790
 texture pack and there we're going to look 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.500
 the package that I leave in the 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.229
 description of the video is that of es fortÃ­ 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.960
 one that I've been asked so much just what 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.310
 you select and ready you do not have 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.050
 to find the place where they saved 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.119
 his texture pack I had it there 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.190
 why look for it and there we will activate 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.570
 the mods first we have to have 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.030
 receptive to safe mode we will see 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.130
 in administering patches and here are the 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.619
 ways that I'm going to pass on to you is the one 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.080
 vic spider the free crafting and you will not 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.060
 animated state texture that is for 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.940
 remove texture animations 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.990
 because because this texture package has 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:44.149
 a book of the flame in blocks of 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.750
 and then with the pause a little bit has a 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:49.880
 book of the flame in blocks of earth and 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.369
 with this this mode we can remove it 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.630
 so to use this texture there 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.930
 they have to use this mode too 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.659
 so that they remove that little book and 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.009
 the others because the spider and is for 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.840
 a larger spider and the breaker 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.740
 crafting is for kraft eo free or 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.930
 Crafter anything for 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.060
 to install it, we will give you where 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.920
 says import and we're going to look for our 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.680
 ways as I tell them I pass them 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.630
 tablets and you have to 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.819
 unpack already from there look for those from 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.010
 here where it says to matter and ready not that 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.130
 is everything I would already have these mods installed 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.630
 now this one where he says hide the button 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.190
 of the game yes use to hide the 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.069
 little key that appears above as in 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.319
 summer right now I do not appear that 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.239
 key if it is for those who wanted it 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.800
 do not like to hide or display the 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.840
 key if it is in the game as well it is 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.180
 hide not now I'm going to present you what 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.910
 which is the the mods and the package 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.080
 texture 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.750
 the hardtop package when they go to 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.300
 see everything is around the entire map 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.470
 as a change in front of me because I have 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.170
 the spider that is the one 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.870
 it's bigger these spiders so they look 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.490
 better when we are at night because 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.660
 they look bigger they shine eyes 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.850
 and it does not look great 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.920
 even so they cause the same damage they 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.870
 they die the same fast the only thing they do 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.230
 is to make them bigger and it seems that 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.970
 until the pendejas but good here I have 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.380
 a kraft box and today I'm going to fiddle 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.180
 everything I want without needing 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.280
 have that material this is what it does 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.560
 the freud drafting is graffiti book be 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.880
 processed is anything is as if 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.440
 this is now the creative mode because 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.880
 because then you can get any 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.900
 thing or even more things than the mode 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.900
 creative you do not have 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.319
 and good here so that they see that if 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.980
 it works so I'm going to add everything 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.720
 what I have 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.370
 that is the skin that the skin leaves you 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.800
 I bring is the skin that automatically 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.180
 the texture package so 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.159
 and from there finally 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.620
 I'm going to give a tour of what is 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:44.870
 the map just for them to see that they do not 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.909
 they have book here where I'm seeing in 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.760
 in front of me there is land and they gave 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:51.739
 account does not have the book of the flame or 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.680
 they saw quite a lot of textures packages 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.599
 with this ship that you could see the 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.239
 Flame effect in the parts of the 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:01.159
 sides of the earth boxes or in the 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.319
 cubes of earth with him 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:05.450
 with the mode there is no texture 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.069
 because with this one we disappear it and 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.989
 good friends that's pretty much everything 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.659
 I hope you liked about the club 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.810
 see you until next time 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.810
