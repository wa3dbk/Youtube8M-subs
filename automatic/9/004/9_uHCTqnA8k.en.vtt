15<00:01:17.700> plus<00:01:17.909> at<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.360> moment<00:01:18.750> enough<00:01:19.340> well

but I think he's really calling for as

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.249 
but I think he's really calling for as
the<00:01:24.090> censorship<00:01:24.420> board<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.869> be<00:01:25.020> in<00:01:25.080> this

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
the censorship board to be in this

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.330 
the censorship board to be in this
particular<00:01:25.500> product<00:01:26.540> because<00:01:27.540> he's<00:01:28.340> he's

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
particular product because he's he's

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.460 
particular product because he's he's
saying<00:01:29.700> effectively<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.869> should<00:01:31.200> not<00:01:31.320> be

and for him to say that means that it

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.609

it<00:01:42.150> but<00:01:42.299> one<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.869> my<00:01:42.960> kids<00:01:43.200> had<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.380> know<00:01:43.530> how<00:01:43.649> to

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
it but one of my kids had it know how to

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.980 
it but one of my kids had it know how to
look<00:01:43.860> at<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.240> eighth<00:01:45.630> game

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
look at it and this is the eighth game

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.980 
look at it and this is the eighth game
in<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.320> whole<00:01:46.470> series<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:47.280> games<00:01:47.520> and

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
in a whole series of games and

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.050 
in a whole series of games and
consequently<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.320> there<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:50.130> generation

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
consequently that there is a generation

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.630 
consequently that there is a generation
of<00:01:51.149> kids<00:01:51.210> in<00:01:51.540> some<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.840> our<00:01:51.930> now<00:01:52.079> 24<00:01:52.560> 25<00:01:53.040> who

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
of kids in some of our now 24 25 who

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.969 
of kids in some of our now 24 25 who
have<00:01:54.030> grown<00:01:54.270> up<00:01:54.509> with<00:01:54.720> this<00:01:54.810> particular<00:01:55.200> game

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
have grown up with this particular game

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.560 
have grown up with this particular game
and<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.280> gets<00:01:56.460> more<00:01:56.610> violet<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.149> more<00:01:57.270> violet

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
and it gets more violet and more violet

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.060 
and it gets more violet and more violet
and<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.689> think<00:01:57.930> my<00:01:58.049> great<00:01:58.380> problem<00:01:58.829> with<00:01:58.950> this

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
and I think my great problem with this

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.300 
and I think my great problem with this
is<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.549> that<00:02:00.180> video<00:02:00.479> games<00:02:00.899> have<00:02:01.469> got<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.280> a

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
is is that video games have got to a

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.219 
is is that video games have got to a
stage<00:02:02.430> where<00:02:02.880> we<00:02:02.969> have<00:02:03.000> desensitized<00:02:03.630> a

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
stage where we have desensitized a

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.350 
stage where we have desensitized a
generation<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.950> kids<00:02:05.159> about<00:02:05.850> graphic

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
generation of kids about graphic

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.500 
generation of kids about graphic
violence<00:02:06.899> and

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
violence and

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.170 
violence and
in<00:02:07.720> many<00:02:07.930> respects<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:08.560> push<00:02:08.770> for<00:02:09.070> an<00:02:09.310> hour<00:02:09.760> 18

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
in many respects the push for an hour 18

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.110 
in many respects the push for an hour 18
plus<00:02:10.660> rating<00:02:11.230> is<00:02:11.560> really<00:02:12.100> a<00:02:12.130> push<00:02:12.520> for<00:02:12.790> more

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
plus rating is really a push for more

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.510 
plus rating is really a push for more
violent<00:02:13.780> videos<00:02:14.170> and<00:02:14.470> I<00:02:14.530> have<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:14.830> say<00:02:14.980> I<00:02:15.220> have

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
current system now that clearly we need

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.090 
current system now that clearly we need
to<00:03:37.090> reach<00:03:37.570> out<00:03:37.780> that<00:03:37.930> system<00:03:38.140> so<00:03:38.470> that<00:03:38.620> because

to reach out that system so that because
right<00:03:39.250> now<00:03:39.370> parents<00:03:39.670> are<00:03:39.850> being<00:03:40.030> pressured<00:03:40.300> by

right now parents are being pressured by

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.930 
right now parents are being pressured by
it's<00:03:40.780> a<00:03:40.959> 14<00:03:41.380> year<00:03:41.560> old<00:03:41.680> say<00:03:41.920> well<00:03:42.100> this<00:03:42.459> is<00:03:42.610> okay

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
it's a 14 year old say well this is okay

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.120 
it's a 14 year old say well this is okay
for<00:03:43.000> me<00:03:43.239> because<00:03:43.540> I'm<00:03:43.660> almost<00:03:43.870> 15<00:03:44.500> inside

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
for me because I'm almost 15 inside

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.530 
for me because I'm almost 15 inside
that's<00:03:45.310> not<00:03:45.489> really<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:45.880> case<00:03:46.060> and<00:03:46.390> I<00:03:46.480> think

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
that's not really the case and I think

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.850 
that's not really the case and I think
what<00:03:46.780> we<00:03:46.900> really<00:03:47.110> need<00:03:47.230> to<00:03:47.260> see<00:03:47.470> here<00:03:47.739> is<00:03:47.830> that

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
what we really need to see here is that

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.380 
what we really need to see here is that

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
clear direction so you don't get conned

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.660 
clear direction so you don't get conned
by<00:04:24.140> your<00:04:24.440> children<00:04:24.650> into<00:04:25.100> getting<00:04:25.370> that<00:04:25.490> is

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
by your children into getting that is

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.210 
by your children into getting that is

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
going so turning 15 yeah and I mean we

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.950 
going so turning 15 yeah and I mean we
basically<00:04:28.550> have<00:04:28.790> two<00:04:29.000> parts<00:04:29.390> with<00:04:29.540> the<00:04:29.630> status

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
basically have two parts with the status

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.110 
basically have two parts with the status
quo<00:04:30.140> of<00:04:30.230> this<00:04:30.650> you<00:04:31.100> know<00:04:31.190> we<00:04:31.370> either<00:04:31.490> have<00:04:31.790> more

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
quo of this you know we either have more

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.090 
quo of this you know we either have more
games<00:04:32.420> that<00:04:33.050> are<00:04:33.230> very<00:04:33.470> violent<00:04:33.710> being

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
games that are very violent being

available to fifteen year old children

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.570 
available to fifteen year old children
and<00:04:35.840> that's<00:04:36.410> not<00:04:36.560> really<00:04:36.770> for<00:04:37.040> the<00:04:37.100> best<00:04:37.130> or

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
and that's not really for the best or

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.010 
and that's not really for the best or
the<00:04:37.640> alternative<00:04:38.540> is<00:04:38.750> that<00:04:38.810> we<00:04:39.200> do<00:04:39.410> try<00:04:39.680> to<00:04:39.800> ban

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
the alternative is that we do try to ban

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.780 
the alternative is that we do try to ban

a<00:04:45.770> higher<00:04:45.950> rating<00:04:46.250> overseas<00:04:46.790> so<00:04:47.510> we<00:04:47.780> either

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
a higher rating overseas so we either

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.600

censorship boards going to look at it

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.550 
censorship boards going to look at it
next<00:05:04.100> month<00:05:04.600> hopefully<00:05:05.600> a<00:05:05.930> decision<00:05:06.380> will<00:05:06.530> be

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
next month hopefully a decision will be

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.740 
next month hopefully a decision will be
made<00:05:06.650> because<00:05:07.280> to<00:05:07.400> make<00:05:07.550> it<00:05:07.700> 15<00:05:08.120> is<00:05:08.270> a<00:05:08.300> cop-out

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
made because to make it 15 is a cop-out

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.700 
made because to make it 15 is a cop-out
I<00:05:08.930> reckon<00:05:09.730> well<00:05:10.730> if<00:05:11.210> it<00:05:11.360> means<00:05:11.540> though<00:05:11.930> that<00:05:12.500> by

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
I reckon well if it means though that by

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.070 
I reckon well if it means though that by
if<00:05:13.490> the<00:05:13.670> standard<00:05:14.120> is<00:05:14.240> maintained<00:05:14.780> is<00:05:14.960> the

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
if the standard is maintained is the

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.200 
if the standard is maintained is the
same<00:05:15.320> standard<00:05:15.890> and<00:05:16.040> just<00:05:16.490> moved<00:05:16.730> to<00:05:16.880> sort<00:05:17.150> of

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
same standard and just moved to sort of

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.090 
same standard and just moved to sort of
say<00:05:17.390> oh<00:05:17.420> the<00:05:17.600> advisory<00:05:18.200> for<00:05:18.440> parents<00:05:18.800> is<00:05:18.920> that

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
say oh the advisory for parents is that

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.980 
say oh the advisory for parents is that
your<00:05:19.850> children<00:05:20.180> shouldn't<00:05:20.360> be<00:05:20.480> watching<00:05:20.690> this

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
your children shouldn't be watching this

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.900 
your children shouldn't be watching this
unless<00:05:21.560> they<00:05:21.770> are<00:05:21.830> looking<00:05:22.340> at<00:05:22.430> this<00:05:22.580> game<00:05:22.760> or

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
unless they are looking at this game or

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.310 
unless they are looking at this game or
playing<00:05:23.120> this<00:05:23.270> game<00:05:23.450> unless<00:05:23.630> they're<00:05:23.840> 18<00:05:24.110> if

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
playing this game unless they're 18 if

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.750 
playing this game unless they're 18 if
we<00:05:24.410> just<00:05:24.560> move<00:05:24.740> that<00:05:24.950> standard<00:05:25.370> way<00:05:25.490> then

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
we just move that standard way then

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.640 
we just move that standard way then
maybe<00:05:26.120> that's<00:05:26.420> a<00:05:26.510> legitimate<00:05:26.990> argument<00:05:27.260> and

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
maybe that's a legitimate argument and

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.280 
maybe that's a legitimate argument and
we<00:05:27.710> have<00:05:27.860> two<00:05:28.130> standards<00:05:28.660> it'll<00:05:29.660> be<00:05:29.780> the<00:05:29.900> PG

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
we have two standards it'll be the PG

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.790 
we have two standards it'll be the PG

film literature classification industry

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.310 
film literature classification industry
is<00:05:43.730> based<00:05:43.940> on<00:05:44.150> decisions<00:05:44.720> that<00:05:44.750> were<00:05:44.870> made<00:05:44.930> 20

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
is based on decisions that were made 20

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.810 
is based on decisions that were made 20
years<00:05:45.350> ago<00:05:45.560> I<00:05:45.740> think<00:05:45.950> I<00:05:46.190> think<00:05:46.460> everybody

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
years ago I think I think everybody

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.940 
years ago I think I think everybody
basically<00:05:47.300> agrees<00:05:47.600> that<00:05:47.630> we<00:05:47.900> need<00:05:48.200> to<00:05:48.440> revisit

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
basically agrees that we need to revisit

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.950 
basically agrees that we need to revisit
the<00:05:49.310> whole<00:05:49.460> system<00:05:49.910> and<00:05:50.090> actually<00:05:50.360> set<00:05:50.750> up<00:05:50.780> a

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
the whole system and actually set up a

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.330 
the whole system and actually set up a
set<00:05:51.170> of<00:05:51.200> guidelines<00:05:51.440> for<00:05:51.770> parents<00:05:52.040> that

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
set of guidelines for parents that

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.130 
set of guidelines for parents that
actually<00:05:52.640> makes<00:05:52.820> sense<00:05:52.970> for<00:05:53.660> all<00:05:53.780> this

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.140 
actually makes sense for all this

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.070 
actually makes sense for all this
because<00:05:55.070> it<00:05:55.520> as<00:05:56.060> Mel<00:05:56.360> was<00:05:56.540> saying<00:05:56.810> I've<00:05:56.930> been

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
because it as Mel was saying I've been

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.650 
because it as Mel was saying I've been
putting<00:05:57.380> it<00:05:57.440> off<00:05:57.560> for<00:05:57.670> it's<00:05:58.670> decision<00:05:59.480> time

00:05:59.650 --> 00:05:59.660 
putting it off for it's decision time
