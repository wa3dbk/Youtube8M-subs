00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.100 
cattle over these two foot screws on the
base<00:01:05.100> undo<00:01:06.000> these<00:01:06.150> two<00:01:06.210> Phillips<00:01:06.720> screws<00:01:06.750> and

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
base undo these two Phillips screws and

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.990 
base undo these two Phillips screws and
remove<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.710> panel<00:01:07.950> that's<00:01:08.549> covering<00:01:08.850> the

remove the panel that's covering the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.380 
remove the panel that's covering the
element<00:01:09.330> switch<00:01:09.540> gear<00:01:10.070> and<00:01:11.180> there's<00:01:12.180> two

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
element switch gear and there's two

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.700 
element switch gear and there's two
screws<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.840> art<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.140> they<00:01:13.229> hold<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.530> switch

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
screws that art so they hold the switch

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.640 
screws that art so they hold the switch
answer<00:01:14.549> we<00:01:14.640> undo<00:01:14.880> them<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:16.229> leave<00:01:16.500> the

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
answer we undo them and just leave the

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.870 
answer we undo them and just leave the
switch<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.040> one<00:01:17.189> side<00:01:18.830> and<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.009> then<00:01:20.310> allows

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
switch to one side and that then allows

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.030 
switch to one side and that then allows
access<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.990> three<00:01:22.229> screws<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.560> hold<00:01:22.890> in

access to the three screws that hold in

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.010 
access to the three screws that hold in
the<00:01:23.220> element<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:24.030> switch<00:01:24.210> gear<00:01:24.450> arm<00:01:24.659> we'll<00:01:24.900> do

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
the element of switch gear arm we'll do

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.020 
the element of switch gear arm we'll do
these<00:01:25.170> three<00:01:25.439> screws<00:01:25.680> now<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.640> little<00:01:26.820> come<00:01:26.970> up

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
these three screws now in little come up

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.580 
these three screws now in little come up
on<00:01:27.180> side<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.630> switch<00:01:27.869> gear<00:01:28.170> off<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.470> other

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
on side and switch gear off the other

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.980 
on side and switch gear off the other
I'll<00:01:29.490> leave<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.060> seal<00:01:30.299> that's<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.689> kettle

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
I'll leave the seal that's in the kettle

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.719 
I'll leave the seal that's in the kettle
which<00:01:31.140> we'll<00:01:31.320> use<00:01:31.350> in<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.799> little<00:01:32.040> while

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.889 

on<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.850> other<00:01:38.909> side<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.829> switchgear<00:01:40.850> and

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
on the other side of the switchgear and

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.440 
on the other side of the switchgear and
there<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.049> disc<00:01:43.500> which<00:01:43.920> we<00:01:44.579> remove<00:01:44.969> this

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
there is a disc which we remove this

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.840 
there is a disc which we remove this
discourse<00:01:46.109> out<00:01:46.319> the<00:01:46.530> switch<00:01:46.829> when<00:01:47.670> they

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
discourse out the switch when they

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.760 
discourse out the switch when they
kettle<00:01:48.450> reached<00:01:48.840> boiling<00:01:49.109> temperature

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
kettle reached boiling temperature

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.830 
kettle reached boiling temperature
obviously<00:01:49.979> we<00:01:50.429> don't<00:01:50.549> want<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.850> switch<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.780> be

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
obviously we don't want the switch to be

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.069 
obviously we don't want the switch to be
cutting<00:01:52.109> out<00:01:52.229> every<00:01:52.409> time<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.770> starts<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.159> boil

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
cutting out every time it starts to boil

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.809 
cutting out every time it starts to boil
so<00:01:55.079> we've<00:01:55.319> got<00:01:55.469> the<00:01:55.560> two<00:01:55.740> 38<00:01:56.189> millimeter<00:01:56.640> holes

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
so we've got the two 38 millimeter holes

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:01.039 
so we've got the two 38 millimeter holes
in<00:01:56.969> into<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.990> fermenter<00:01:58.439> side<00:01:59.750> we<00:02:00.750> want<00:02:00.929> the

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
in into the fermenter side we want the

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.660 
in into the fermenter side we want the
two<00:02:01.380> elements<00:02:01.770> quite<00:02:01.920> close<00:02:02.130> together<00:02:02.310> to

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
two elements quite close together to

two elements quite close together to
create<00:02:02.880> thermals<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.569> the<00:02:03.659> pocket<00:02:04.350> when<00:02:04.530> we're

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
create thermals in the pocket when we're

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.270

we refit them I'd fill the bucket with
water<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.560> check<00:02:25.739> for<00:02:25.769> any<00:02:25.950> leaks<00:02:26.099> if<00:02:26.940> you

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
water and check for any leaks if you

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.280 
water and check for any leaks if you
have<00:02:27.120> any<00:02:27.269> leaks<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.569> can<00:02:27.720> put<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.900> slight<00:02:28.140> a

causing it to leak so once we've got no
leaks<00:02:37.440> we<00:02:37.680> can<00:02:37.860> then<00:02:38.040> wire<00:02:38.549> the<00:02:39.030> two<00:02:39.060> elements

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
leaks we can then wire the two elements

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.699 
leaks we can then wire the two elements
up<00:02:39.750> so<00:02:40.019> remove<00:02:40.349> the<00:02:40.470> base<00:02:41.239> off<00:02:42.239> the<00:02:42.510> cattle<00:02:42.750> and

now you can buy a Celt socket from a

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.979 
now you can buy a Celt socket from a
plains<00:03:32.669> about<00:03:32.849> three<00:03:33.060> pound<00:03:33.299> each<00:03:33.480> a<00:03:33.780> hot

plains about three pound each a hot

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.809 
plains about three pound each a hot
condition<00:03:34.410> socket<00:03:34.799> which<00:03:34.980> will<00:03:35.190> fit<00:03:35.489> straight

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
condition socket which will fit straight

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.670 
condition socket which will fit straight
onto<00:03:35.970> them<00:03:36.180> three<00:03:36.419> prongs<00:03:36.690> so<00:03:37.290> you<00:03:37.380> can<00:03:37.500> wire

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
onto them three prongs so you can wire

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.559 
onto them three prongs so you can wire
the<00:03:38.130> Flex<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:38.579> that<00:03:38.730> if<00:03:38.819> you<00:03:38.940> wish<00:03:39.120> but<00:03:39.419> I'm

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
the Flex to that if you wish but I'm

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:40.909 
the Flex to that if you wish but I'm
trying<00:03:39.810> to<00:03:39.870> do<00:03:39.930> is<00:03:40.019> cheap<00:03:40.200> as<00:03:40.349> possible<00:03:40.380> so<00:03:40.829> I'm

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
trying to do is cheap as possible so I'm

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:44.540 
trying to do is cheap as possible so I'm
just<00:03:41.069> doing<00:03:41.220> it<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.880> cheapest<00:03:42.329> way

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.340 

so<00:03:44.910> then<00:03:45.060> we<00:03:45.150> make<00:03:45.300> the<00:03:45.420> hot<00:03:45.570> filter<00:03:46.020> which

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
so then we make the hot filter which

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.450 
so then we make the hot filter which
will<00:03:46.380> go<00:03:46.620> on<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.740> back<00:03:46.830> of<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.040> spigot<00:03:47.280> to

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
will go on the back of the spigot to

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.330 
will go on the back of the spigot to
fill<00:03:47.790> out<00:03:48.000> the<00:03:48.260> material<00:03:49.260> so<00:03:49.920> just<00:03:49.980> cut<00:03:50.310> a

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
fill out the material so just cut a

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.910 
fill out the material so just cut a
length<00:03:50.460> a<00:03:50.580> cup<00:03:50.730> of<00:03:50.820> pipe<00:03:51.030> hammer<00:03:51.300> over<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.630> end

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
length a cup of pipe hammer over the end

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
length a cup of pipe hammer over the end
mark<00:03:52.920> out<00:03:53.100> the<00:03:53.250> holes<00:03:53.400> were<00:03:53.550> going<00:03:53.580> to<00:03:53.730> drill

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
mark out the holes were going to drill

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.660 
mark out the holes were going to drill
with<00:03:54.120> a<00:03:54.450> hammer<00:03:54.810> and<00:03:55.050> a<00:03:55.110> nail<00:03:55.140> and<00:03:55.950> then<00:03:56.220> drill

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
with a hammer and a nail and then drill

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.190 
with a hammer and a nail and then drill
the<00:03:56.700> holes<00:03:57.000> with<00:03:57.360> a<00:03:57.660> one<00:03:57.990> and<00:03:58.080> a<00:03:58.170> half
