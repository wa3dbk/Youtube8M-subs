00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.649
 friends welcome today I want to talk to you 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:12.010
 of a very delicate subject something that is going to 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:12.010
 happen here in the municipality of papantla 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.920
 atizapÃ¡n and a little bit of naucalpan 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.950
 It is at this time of construction 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.090
 from the second floor 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:28.000
 the company electro lx something like that 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:31.630
 the name that I will leave the description 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.070
 good is to let the detail pass here 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.309
 What I want to comment on is that they are 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.980
 doing the second floor of the peripheral 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.670
 and it's going to happen exactly where are the 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:45.160
 Lateral or pasted on the side entrance 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.140
 and the fast ones or in exactly here 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.480
 here 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.879
 and they're going to tear down all those trees not 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.579
 I know I will go a little more space or 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.829
 least for you to see all the 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.379
 trees that you see in the center we 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.780
 they are going to throw us they are going to cut 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:05.619
 that on the other side cutting the trees 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.530
 that they had back to the side of at least 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:11.080
 a thousand trees from here to open in a 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.570
 golden valley but the second floor is going to 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.180
 happen exactly here so they're going to 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.369
 throw the many trees all that 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.160
 they are seeing trees in a few months already 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:25.100
 they will not exist I do not know what the 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:27.549
 destination if you simply cut them 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.990
 I do not know if the company is responsible 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:32.600
 or created in recently I saw a 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.220
 construction here in the world and I'm 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.560
 doing the extension of the square 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.890
 and the trees take it out with a machine 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.740
 I do not know of a machine as special of the 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.150
 tree root is very similar those trees 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.280
 they are 20 years younger 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:52.570
 and good in the world where he commented 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.240
 a little while ago a successful musician 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.890
 they took out the root trees and they're going to 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.450
 transplant I do not know what will happen here 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.850
 see how many trees are not said to 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.520
 Take the time to count them 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.280
 I do not know that some thousand trees and if it is not 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.010
 that more missions are more adverse 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.670
 with the mentions they will throw away because 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.130
 are 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.500
 are not suitable let's say the ones for 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.670
 interests of those people why by 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.620
 what's going to happen on that floor below 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.590
 removed trees were just like these 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:31.050
 in the central ridge very similar to 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.580
 this one where they were thrown 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.440
 I 'm almost going to arrive 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.040
 well almost almost when it's going to truncate 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.230
 the second floor that the satellite 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.060
 exactly in those areas all these 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.689
 trees are not going to exist in a little 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.790
 time that coincided with me I hope that 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:49.250
 someone who is watching this video with 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.750
 this some authority some legislator 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.439
 announcer someone someone 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.750
 because they approach the president of the 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:03:00.329
 republic if it is that they serve 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.680
 governor of the state of mexico live 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.920
 that situation what will happen to your 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.810
 trees 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.209
 it's easy and some close cut the 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.610
 really big trees that I think that 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:13.300
 We are 20 years old, this is for example 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.950
 he is 30 years younger 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.750
 and I do not know if it's so easy to get there and 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:22.830
 cut them to make a way 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:25.470
 because I know he has that help does not help 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.860
 the system of villains have more 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.010
 Realities 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.319
 but what about all the trees do not 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.500
 I do not know, it's a little unfair to have 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:38.530
 a 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.530
 a life and cut kill them 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.030
 that's what happened to the other side but 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.770
 some seedlings there are ugly palm trees are not 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.110
 the same oxygen follow this 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.450
 foliage 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.880
 I hope someone who knows the area 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.980
 percent of what I'm talking about in the other 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:02.099
 side that are approximate from 6 kilometers 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.099
 they removed all similar trees 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:11.520
 in the license that traveled 6 km 5 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:14.200
 kilometers traveled living 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.510
 I arrived here is this world 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.430
 in the square with second where cut 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.500
 the students that I tell them did not cut them 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.139
 they were taken out by the roots to show them for 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:27.160
 transplant another side I hope that here 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:29.680
 pay the same to avoid this short 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.750
 for these trees please if someone 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.360
 someone who is seeing knows another 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.120
 person who can be something is not 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.190
 says in the green environmentalist of all 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.180
 that the second they wash off they help the 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.370
 ecology 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:47.030
 I want that in this detail exactly 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.800
 here here is where the work comes 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.370
 this is where I was connecting the second 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.020
 part and here if you realize here no longer 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.660
 there is no tree all the Saturdays we 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.270
 they cut and put in place these 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.330
 small trees are there 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.979
 please see 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.970
 what is the difference not to force 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:08.590
 trees that do something or get this 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.229
 that is only for the benefit of 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.990
 them because it's not even free it 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:16.480
 they charge to get on the second floor and 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:19.840
 a lot is something expensive 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:22.200
 at the service of the second floor here in 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:26.190
 satellite allowed us because the 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.190
 colors very difficult solutions 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.860
 floor to floor 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.220
 and good study to make you more 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:39.720
 long this video I hope someone 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:42.210
 know someone who can help us 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.550
 spread this news are more than a thousand 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.830
 trees that are going to pull to make the 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.910
 second floor asks for migration 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.280
 writing to the part below is the 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.110
 subscribe button will reach us 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.020
 our videos and we make apart from 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.340
 these social videos and videos of 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:01.190
 know in our city we did 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:02.990
 some tutorials and interesting things 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.350
 many friends because we are in the 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.350
 next
