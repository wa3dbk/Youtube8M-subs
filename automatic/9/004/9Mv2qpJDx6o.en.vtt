00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
would say though that you know having a

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.980 
would say though that you know having a
birdie<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.210> probably<00:01:06.450> easier<00:01:06.659> than<00:01:06.810> half<00:01:06.960> a

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
birdie is probably easier than half a

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.810 
birdie is probably easier than half a
nap<00:01:07.140> are<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.560> always<00:01:08.010> feel<00:01:08.189> like<00:01:08.220> making<00:01:08.610> birdie

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
or take to do something is easier than

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.429 
or take to do something is easier than
pouring<00:01:10.619> kind<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.280> play<00:01:11.430> safe<00:01:11.670> with<00:01:11.880> par<00:01:12.090> but
