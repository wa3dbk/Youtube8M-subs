00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.320
 it was not really a resumption of competition as you might expect 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.819
 africa 

00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:12.559
 long live love 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.309
 definitely against nac inside because we are at home 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.249
 Quite an easy miracle but it is certainly another game 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:21.759
 with which first half hour 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:25.329
 after that was of course very bad the ball could get forward as your mother 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:28.749
 tried los angeles in defense so we didn't 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:32.590
 as usual trying to play football fell our position game and that was one 

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:35.960
 problem they did exactly what they had to do where the first and not 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.440
 against strong competition on the altar 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.110
 it is true 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.010
 shame but that's how life is 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.390
 and no matter how he does not recover and share is a fixed value but after six months 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.050
 finally he can play again 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.430
 but I think the one at the first affair did not play well and that 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.930
 used to be 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.430
 yes that is unfortunate but for the rest there is no position yet 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.730
 overpelt in the base and spoken two names directly or through natural after all 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.280
 completely broken in a career for both Christmas and explaining 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.950
 after years of strong pressure so 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.100
 In recent weeks, the economic space is a real one 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.360
 checker it is therefore not aware any more either 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.030
 and we saw a training camp in alanya 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.400
 then you still have to wonder if you were not used to being predicted by ajax players 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.430
 must use 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.650
 have done well 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.490
 with that, better than expected every day is also that Thursday we would 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.290
 actually not such a situation sometimes in the second half are religious council 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.720
 satisfied that's the difference 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.120
 between nac and ajax with nathan akÃ© second company participated one 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.120
 explanation for the strong first half of her hand 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.440
 I have to show more guts 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.940
 have to play more football 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.890
 we didn't do that 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.150
 we take ourselves 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.270
 there is free and the polos player who too 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.090
 it's an overview 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.090
 especially after those heavy blows can feed what are you waiting for 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.740
 visitors to dijk always prepare his own actions he was playing 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.849
 you shouldn't forget to add that some seventeen years 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.549
 so as far as we are concerned the big promise is 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.839
 well also in the first half year old angel on a good 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:20.619
 moment 

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:22.669
 yes that was very important for the team 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:26.010
 because there is not a good match in the game and then the last fifteen minutes of recovery 

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:27.899
 I think we should 

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:32.659
 yes more being able to play football yet it was about knowing the second half 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:35.659
 we also played better in the last four of the first half 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.079
 to what extent that might have been conquered in the problems were the better team and yes 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.139
 I expect that too 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:44.759
 we also have better players in it 

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:47.849
 this way, there will be three major opportunities for all traffic 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.849
 yes if you make then nothing really is wrong but a media 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:54.999
 it remains of course a very poor housing market and the other side 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:58.169
 yes it is with trial and error that today again some young players 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:02:58.989
 to have 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.989
 paying out his coupons is already four vision side 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.900
 that is also a bit of an agent to play our team actually none 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.059
 gennaker year year finally played goal again was made may of 

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:11.999
 can disable geforce map 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:15.449
 besides not feeling good behind ten, that is worth a lot 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:18.519
 the normal circumstances 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.510
 If you are a really strong apple competitor you can point it sometime 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.009
 leaving out and doing in our situation is annoying 

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:29.539
 but it is a reality it is of course not for yesterday today you 

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:31.859
 can't expect though here and there food security
