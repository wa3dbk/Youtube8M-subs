00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.520
 if you have one of all telecel sa of all as the main publication for 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:33.850
 manage your music 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.160
 so maybe he's one of those people who would not be 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.720
 have all olivia with the cover of the and that without presence mind because all 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.390
 They knew how to customize your collection 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.750
 There are several applications that I will not go to the lagun artea you 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.429
 collection 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:52.529
 which charged us forward but that will focus on acts 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.360
 the simplest way comes 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.980
 there are things on the covers automatically 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.140
 and this is assuming that you dock the music 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.900
 add correct formation as the artist the song and the name of the 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.560
 album 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.850
 after doing 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.120
 the project that is right 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.380
 in the song selections that was an abortion 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.930
 and this will make the consortium like the roofs 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.000
 there are only two small tests to make it work the first is that you have or 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.860
 do not tell everyone 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.340
 so you need to divide the united states or anywhere else where 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.660
 You can buy music through this service 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.940
 and the second is that the wedding is from an artist who has his music is punishable 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.590
 through habits 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.780
 manual mode 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.240
 is really 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.280
 simple 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.600
 and one of the advantages that unlike the motu skeletal motu has ever 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.090
 added to the song feet and this will be available yes I have reproduced 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.620
 out there all 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.620
 to add it to vote by hundred manually 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.800
 what you have to be to oscar the image you want to use certainly recommended 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.430
 that telecinco cobem is to be first eight mazon ago capcom 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.039
 once it is controlled 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.039
 the image you want 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:20.199
 find the image you want to use 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:31.219
 sulfur clinical problems 

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:34.899
 back in has done annoyed 

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:39.279
 select the most usual song criticism then elections that the info 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.239
 that appears from this menu with different options and chooses where it says abortion 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.959
 then I started cemetery cement this picture 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:50.949
 despite his position 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:53.349
 and ready 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.349
 Laporta will be added automatically 

00:02:58.589 --> 00:03:01.589
 and if you need adams 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.929
 add a port to different songs 

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:08.839
 In addition to a song, all you have to do is 

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:12.779
 pressing control if it is while you click on the songs and then 

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:15.459
 Logically they are the same steps 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.689
