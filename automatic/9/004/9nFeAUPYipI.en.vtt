00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
start using teflon tape which is a PTFE

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.679 
start using teflon tape which is a PTFE
tip<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.180> it's<00:02:04.219> like<00:02:05.219> plumbers<00:02:05.850> tape<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.659> you

tip and it's like plumbers tape and you
can<00:02:07.110> just<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.590> only<00:02:07.740> sticks<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.160> itself<00:02:08.399> and

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
can just it only sticks to itself and

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.820 
can just it only sticks to itself and
its<00:02:08.879> not<00:02:09.119> porous<00:02:09.629> so<00:02:10.140> it's<00:02:10.259> really<00:02:10.440> good<00:02:10.679> for

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
its not porous so it's really good for

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.890 
its not porous so it's really good for
you<00:02:10.920> use<00:02:11.129> like<00:02:11.400> electrical<00:02:12.060> tape<00:02:12.300> is<00:02:12.450> porous

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
you use like electrical tape is porous

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.490 
you use like electrical tape is porous
and

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
and

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.380 
and
years<00:02:13.680> will<00:02:13.920> grow<00:02:14.100> into<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:14.550> that's<00:02:14.970> not<00:02:15.210> very

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
years will grow into it that's not very

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.960 
years will grow into it that's not very
nice<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:15.840> have<00:02:15.990> to<00:02:16.050> have<00:02:16.140> them<00:02:16.230> cut<00:02:16.440> out

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
nice and you have to have them cut out

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.450 
nice and you have to have them cut out
so<00:02:17.970> if<00:02:18.420> you<00:02:18.570> use<00:02:18.900> teflon<00:02:19.410> tape<00:02:19.440> you<00:02:20.070> can<00:02:20.220> wrap

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
so if you use teflon tape you can wrap

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.140 
so if you use teflon tape you can wrap
it<00:02:20.490> around<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:21.210> plug<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.350> it<00:02:23.130> will<00:02:23.400> make<00:02:24.000> your

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
it around the plug and it will make your

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.410 
it around the plug and it will make your
years<00:02:24.470> stretch<00:02:25.470> over<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.430> period<00:02:26.700> of<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:27.390> couple

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
years stretch over a period of a couple

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.040 
years stretch over a period of a couple
of<00:02:27.750> days<00:02:27.900> if<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.590> do<00:02:28.740> about<00:02:28.980> like<00:02:29.220> three<00:02:29.400> and

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
of days if you do about like three and

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.240 
of days if you do about like three and
three<00:02:31.050> kind<00:02:31.950> of<00:02:32.040> roll<00:02:32.250> bits<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.959> um<00:02:34.250> each

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
three kind of roll bits of it um each

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.100 
three kind of roll bits of it um each
day<00:02:35.580> then<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:35.820> year<00:02:36.090> will<00:02:36.390> obviously<00:02:36.630> expand

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
day then a year will obviously expand

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.530 
day then a year will obviously expand
over<00:02:37.590> certain<00:02:38.190> amount<00:02:38.400> of<00:02:38.490> time<00:02:38.730> so<00:02:39.330> that's

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
over certain amount of time so that's

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.360 
over certain amount of time so that's
really<00:02:39.840> good<00:02:40.170> if<00:02:40.320> you<00:02:40.470> don't<00:02:40.709> wanna<00:02:40.860> go

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
really good if you don't wanna go

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.130 
really good if you don't wanna go
splashing<00:02:41.640> out<00:02:41.850> on<00:02:42.000> new<00:02:42.120> tables<00:02:42.600> or<00:02:42.720> pinches

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
splashing out on new tables or pinches

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
splashing out on new tables or pinches
so<00:02:43.560> use<00:02:43.800> teflon<00:02:44.310> tape<00:02:45.260> you<00:02:46.260> sort<00:02:46.590> socks<00:02:46.890> if<00:02:47.130> you

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.039 
inside the plug or the stretcher I think
fully<00:04:09.450> healed<00:04:09.780> because<00:04:11.269> what<00:04:12.269> is<00:04:12.510> like<00:04:12.780> holes

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
fully healed because what is like holes

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.099 
fully healed because what is like holes
in<00:04:13.260> it<00:04:13.410> and<00:04:13.650> you<00:04:13.680> guys<00:04:14.220> really<00:04:14.640> flashy<00:04:15.030> and<00:04:15.480> you

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
in it and you guys really flashy and you

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.840 
in it and you guys really flashy and you
know<00:04:16.290> it's<00:04:16.470> just<00:04:16.530> been<00:04:16.799> stretch<00:04:17.130> is<00:04:17.340> quite<00:04:17.640> raw

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
know it's just been stretch is quite raw

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.490 
know it's just been stretch is quite raw
so<00:04:18.329> then<00:04:18.540> it's<00:04:18.900> going<00:04:19.019> to<00:04:19.079> end<00:04:19.200> up<00:04:19.290> growing

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
so then it's going to end up growing

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.319 
so then it's going to end up growing
inside<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:20.310> wood<00:04:20.489> and<00:04:20.790> then<00:04:21.120> you're<00:04:21.239> gonna

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
inside the wood and then you're gonna

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:22.940 
inside the wood and then you're gonna
have<00:04:21.479> to<00:04:21.599> have<00:04:21.690> a<00:04:21.720> like<00:04:21.930> cut<00:04:22.140> out<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:22.560> huskily

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.040 
have to have a like cut out and huskily
really<00:04:23.520> nasty<00:04:24.060> and<00:04:24.330> you<00:04:24.419> don't<00:04:24.660> want<00:04:24.840> to<00:04:24.930> end

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050

up doing
and<00:04:25.840> also<00:04:26.560> silicon<00:04:27.280> and<00:04:27.700> is<00:04:28.000> porous<00:04:28.450> and<00:04:28.600> can

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
and also silicon and is porous and can

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.380 
and also silicon and is porous and can
do<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:29.560> same<00:04:29.740> thing<00:04:29.920> as<00:04:30.100> wood<00:04:30.340> so<00:04:30.940> only

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390
