00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.400
 yes people what is going on from their studios under 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.560
 trained a few facts about this 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.500
 new zombie mode of call of duty of 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.390
 was' surfer and you can find some here 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.940
 Seeing cards are all of us 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.670
 stage 1 cards and yes there are here 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.530
 different levels up to level 4 and 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.110
 Each level needs 100 rounds to you 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.220
 played through and yes the 100 rounds 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.080
 you actually get pretty fast 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.360
 because they are all counted together 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.310
 means if you go ko after ten rounds 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.560
 then you have ten rounds and 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.150
 needs only 90 is logical and 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.190
 is actually pretty easy going 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.589
 pretty fast and all the extra 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.450
 for the suit suit you always get in 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.850
 you completely deregistered your weapon 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.950
 or your armor always improved 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.040
 the maximum level and then you get 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.140
 a nice extra and yes if you are then 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.540
 all round and have at the last web 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.979

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.380
 only the round eleven or twelve too 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.509
 play and then comes the kombi round 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.430
 and this actually pretty cool 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.899
 and if you did that and 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.940
 I survive then you also get the 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.560
 zombie and with the character you can 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.970
 then of course playing online is 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.850
 In any case, really cool 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.440
