00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
ocean but it was in a plastic bag so it

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.589 
ocean but it was in a plastic bag so it

and also it's a waterproof what so it

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.610 
and also it's a waterproof what so it
certainly<00:03:08.079> would<00:03:08.500> survive<00:03:09.159> another<00:03:09.549> day<00:03:10.620> the
