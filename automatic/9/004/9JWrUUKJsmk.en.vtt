00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.010
 hey people what is going back 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.410
 comes to another video to glass 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.240
 There where five in the last days there were 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.119
 every now and then minor changes 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.250
 in the gta 5 online mode by small 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.750
 patches and many of you have even 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.390
 I did not notice what I actually did 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.029
 That's why I want to change you 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.140
 these changes in this video 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.359
 imagine 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.540
 First, you can now no reported 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.450
 more vehicles in gta 5 online mode 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.610
 there has been a lately use 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.670
 Method by the registered vehicle 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.649
 like eg the YOUCAT in gt5 must 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.300
 could save and use this 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.930
 Method brings a network but even 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.210
 nothing more 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.550
 because the vehicle when you look at this 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.410
 into it just explodes and explodes 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.199
 many assume that this is one 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.149
 warning rockstar to the players 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.640
 they probably want to say that 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.039
 you know exactly what the modder the 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.530
 glacier etc everything im going fuller 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.450
 make mode and with that they should open 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.299
 stop every case if you do not 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.640
 want to be banned 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:14.880
 In addition, the characters of some 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.250
 people are awakened by that means 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.650
 the heat just right times crooked from 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.979
 sand at some facebook groups 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.869
 gta 5 had something to do with it 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.189
 There were lots of pictures of the characters before 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.229
 that means it just completely normal 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.479
 looked and without people something 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.670
 the characters were made 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.579
 then really crazy out of bow 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.049
 suddenly 400 kilo more when make-up 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.700
 and so in the summer really 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.700
 did not mind one could 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.930
 then in the end do nothing more but 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.689
 these characters have been restored now 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.729
 These are fixed as they look 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.000
 the hot dlc looked 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:54.329
 at the same time the graphic of gta 5 became 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.799
 nobody improves in online mode again 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.530
 knows exactly why 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.719
 rockstar the graphic with that means something 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.030
 has screwed down in the background 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.320
 you see two now 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.450
 Compared pictures there you see how the 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.580
 graphic when does the hero call her and now 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.090
 after this little updates looks 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.750
 that means dlc became pretty pretty 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.790
 two-dimensional that to me personally 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.980
 not even noticed as strongly as 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.840
 I played normally but if 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.000
 you really pay attention to the details then 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.580
 you can see that and it really is 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.230
 all three-dimensional as it is 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.460
 should be and so it looks 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.040
 a hundred times better 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.920
 in addition, there has been one lately 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.330
 Beard by the people in the race 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.430
 Loading screen simply stuck 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.910
 and then restart the console 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.340
 had 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.990
 This bug was based on rockstar 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.310
 and at the same time has roczen 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.640
 Of course he also started 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.620
 to start some smaller glitches 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.270
 thinks is other even before that was the 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.770
 Anyway, all luck is gone 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.900
 not so great and I invite 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.360
 Of course, only some of the high I am 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.420
 would really recommend you 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.550
 that were all the changes so far 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.890
 through the last matches in the game 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.380
 came to great if you go yes 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.740
 have presented five for the pc 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.990
 you play this game from the seventh april 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.900
 of course you can download it already 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.420
 only gamble from the 14th april but have so 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.970
 you play already and so you can 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.220
 be sure that the game on 14 april 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.850
 can therefore play directly at 0 o'clock 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.340
 I would recommend to anyone the gta 5 for 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.410
 the pc at steam or directly at 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.930
 Rockstar has introduced this game 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.700
 already satisfied that was today from this 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.290
 video if you liked the video 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:40.410
 I want to fuck my thumb 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.410
 I am happy to be out and see 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.640
 the
