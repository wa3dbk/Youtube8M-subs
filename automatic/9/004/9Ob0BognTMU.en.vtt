00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.879
 Welcome guys to this first video 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:09.170
 I am the wizard of wood today vi 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.519
 I'll show you how to make a knife 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.110
 artisan part to some objects 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.969
 Pets 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.010
 then we present to invent that there 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.850
 will serve the first thing that will follow us is 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.289
 a warning possibly made of wood because 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.900
 the easiest material to work with 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.519
 objects name is sc 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.189
 this is so oh well it is one of the courtesy of the 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.090
 finished but the first one I made pacts 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.500
 it's not really very well 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.420
 I put it here to highlight the 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.160
 hand and what we need because 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.079
 otherwise that was not right with this 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.660
 obviously the blade is too long a blade 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.390
 of a sports piece kitchen knife 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.010
 or that can be created if not 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.750
 I'm wrong also for starting from one 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.699
 steel plate that then to make me 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.670
 cut though if you don't have it but do it 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:01.949
 tell a kitchen that is better one 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.949
 small self-tapping screw because one 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.560
 hydraulic clamp from electric 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:11.610
 those needed to tighten the tubes 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.830
 an English clarion possibly that 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.869
 we will need it to tighten cable ties from 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.640
 plumbing which must be smaller 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:22.560
 possible I recommend that it tightens to 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.450
 better the warning and a hacksaw a 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.490
 hacksaw is one of the things of the state goes 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.500
 honor is the drill that I can't 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.790
 bring it here because we are leaving 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.310
 the first thing to do is just 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:40.110
 took the handle make this cut 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:43.950
 with the saw you see you put in this 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.470
 way and then you go to score 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:52.410
 until the hand has a nice inter 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:54.560
 piece so that some kind of comes 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.660
 split inside 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.810
 if you can't make it yourself bitter 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.420
 put it inside this tool 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:07.459
 sand to keep it steady carried out 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:12.350
 precision surgical cutting 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:14.040
 second step made this cut 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.140
 take the ix 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.790
 if you've ever noticed when you break 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.950
 a kitchen knife 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.120
 his money inside is present 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.800
 a hole this hole is needed for 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.450
 allow the knife to sit still and 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.010
 don't move I don't know if you've ever seen it 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.280
 a kitchen knife here usually 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.190
 two allowances of metals or facts here is 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:41.760
 here that seems like our little quarrel 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:45.060
 with the drill that you dared a tip 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.820
 by 3 and a half 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.190
 let's go first in series to but 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.200
 within this more or less ad hoc 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.940
 and this is a very difficult part that 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:59.850
 you will not be able to do it immediately 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:04.410
 hole trying to understand better 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:06.239
 where where I can not say that the 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.370
 hole in which the will be inserted 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.709
 allow it will come then it wants you 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.630
 enter here and from here you will succeed more or 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.970
 less to see him naked almost not there 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.160
 you will succeed to the last to the first 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.820
 sorry attempt that is a very thing 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.160
 difficult in my name succeeds 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:26.820
 made this hole I could go to 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.709
 verify that our ninth enters the 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.780
 perfectly inside 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.310
 look exactly where the 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.500
 bouquet this is some very 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.989
 precise and that will make him snuff 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.730
 commits damned taken to yours 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.549
 allowing ie the life adopted up 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.019
 many will be inserted into the 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:48.439
 hole 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:51.739
 using a centered hammer 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:55.340
 the attention is inserted in without Milan 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:59.560
 you always have to do it on a surface 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.560
 deep enough with a hammer 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:09.099
 go beat up until this one 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:14.930
 will have entered completely or 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:17.620
 completely in this way the blade 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:22.460
 it will be incorporated into the wood 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.840
 unfortunately without, unfortunately, without 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.520
 only with this will he have lost 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.460
 only on the single part and then washes 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.169
 but will tend to move by making a 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.009
 simple movement with the strength of 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.360
 severity 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:36.919
 and to this that you will need ours 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:40.039
 band go to insert at height 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:42.349
 see you can no longer down a little 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:45.169
 in short, exactly at the height of 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:47.960
 base of the initial wood where the 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:51.370
 rome with once what she had 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.750
 English go and hold it until you 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.970
 it will not be completely to starboard to the wood 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:59.630
 see it does not fall 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:04.430
 and this would be the finished product ie 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:08.389
 your knife that doesn't move is 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:10.320
 completely hard even if I do 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:14.410
 strength does not come 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.900
 then see if your portal does not 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.270
 it would be completely entrusted to do so 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:22.540
 use a grinding wheel to make us wash 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.650
 then if in the comments you can write me if 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.900
 you don't know how to be a mother there 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.800
 I will teach that toe because 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.920
 this knife was before it is 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:33.400
 fully rounded and those 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:36.210
 that does not pass sees instead so it is 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.320
 precise precise but surgical manner 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:42.640
 I hope this video has been a 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:45.040
 help if I haven't been clear 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.690
 you ask me and I do you just a 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.210
 knife right now I did it in 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:52.180
 so I couldn't do it 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:54.640
 now that I don't have the blade needed 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.430
 because I can't take another me 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.500
 you ask and I will do it for you 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:04.290
 see just how to do it in a way 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.290
 total from the magician of my all I close
