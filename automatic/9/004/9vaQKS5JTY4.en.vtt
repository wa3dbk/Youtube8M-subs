because<00:00:37.289> of<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.649> technique<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.579> we're

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
because of the technique that we're

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.520 
because of the technique that we're
going<00:00:38.909> to<00:00:39.030> learn<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.659> that's<00:00:39.839> right<00:00:40.109> it<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.499> a

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
going to learn and that's right it is a

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.739 
going to learn and that's right it is a
technique<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.489> wish<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.089> could<00:00:42.300> say<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.570> was

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:42.749 
technique I wish I could say it was

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:46.160 
technique I wish I could say it was
talent<00:00:43.199> but<00:00:43.499> it<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.829> step<00:00:44.519> by<00:00:44.699> step<00:00:45.089> you<00:00:45.390> are

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
talent but it is step by step you are

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.959 
talent but it is step by step you are
going<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.530> be<00:00:46.649> able<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.980> pick<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:47.429> up<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.909> put

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
going to be able to pick this up and put

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.549 
going to be able to pick this up and put
it<00:00:48.239> down<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.690> could<00:00:48.839> leave<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.170> for<00:00:49.350> six

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
it down you could leave it for six

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.860 
it down you could leave it for six
months<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.039> then<00:00:50.219> start<00:00:50.550> painting<00:00:50.969> again<00:00:51.089> so

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
months and then start painting again so

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.750 
months and then start painting again so
these<00:00:52.019> are<00:00:52.229> the<00:00:52.260> materials<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:53.069> we<00:00:53.339> require

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
these are the materials that we require
