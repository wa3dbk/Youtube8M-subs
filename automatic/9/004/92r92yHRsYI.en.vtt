overall pick for a reason when he was

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.280 
overall pick for a reason when he was
healthy<00:01:05.820> was<00:01:06.119> pretty<00:01:06.360> good<00:01:06.540> at<00:01:06.750> his<00:01:06.990> younger

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
healthy was pretty good at his younger

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.289 
healthy was pretty good at his younger
age<00:01:07.409> for<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.890> past<00:01:08.280> few<00:01:08.460> seasons<00:01:08.700> he's<00:01:09.000> been

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
age for the past few seasons he's been

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.859 
age for the past few seasons he's been
injury-prone<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.820> if<00:01:11.820> he<00:01:12.150> continues<00:01:12.630> doing

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
injury-prone so if he continues doing

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.200 
injury-prone so if he continues doing
that<00:01:13.020> it'll<00:01:13.740> make<00:01:13.920> them<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.700> next<00:01:14.880> look<00:01:15.030> bad

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
that it'll make them the next look bad

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.399 
that it'll make them the next look bad
because<00:01:15.360> they<00:01:15.570> had<00:01:15.689> Novak<00:01:15.960> who<00:01:16.110> can<00:01:16.259> shoot

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
because they had Novak who can shoot

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.350 
because they had Novak who can shoot
some<00:01:16.710> threes<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.159> again<00:01:17.790> they<00:01:17.939> gave<00:01:18.119> away

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
some threes and again they gave away

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.940 
some threes and again they gave away
another<00:01:18.540> draft<00:01:18.869> pick<00:01:19.110> for<00:01:19.350> Toronto<00:01:19.799> this

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
who is making some money I think four

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.840

million<00:01:24.689> only<00:01:24.869> one<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.350> guaranteed<00:01:25.890> but<00:01:26.220> he's

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
million only one is guaranteed but he's

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.730 
million only one is guaranteed but he's
old<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.299> he's<00:01:27.840> been<00:01:28.020> getting<00:01:28.170> injured<00:01:28.500> too

old and he's been getting injured too

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.010 
old and he's been getting injured too
but<00:01:29.520> Novak<00:01:29.790> would<00:01:30.060> probably<00:01:30.570> be<00:01:30.659> able<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.869> make

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
but Novak would probably be able to make

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.630 
but Novak would probably be able to make
a<00:01:31.049> lot<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.290> threes<00:01:31.560> for<00:01:31.770> them<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.070> their<00:01:32.400> pick
