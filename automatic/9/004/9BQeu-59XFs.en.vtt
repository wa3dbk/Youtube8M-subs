00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
realize that snow is a very good

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.230 
realize that snow is a very good
insulator<00:01:27.200> so<00:01:27.830> down<00:01:28.130> underneath<00:01:28.610> the<00:01:28.730> snow<00:01:29.090> on

insulator so down underneath the snow on

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.910 
insulator so down underneath the snow on
the<00:01:29.270> ground<00:01:29.360> it's<00:01:29.870> almost<00:01:30.110> always<00:01:30.470> near

the ground it's almost always near

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.920 
the ground it's almost always near
freezing<00:01:31.220> and<00:01:31.670> then<00:01:31.909> the<00:01:32.000> snow<00:01:32.240> surface<00:01:32.570> is

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
freezing and then the snow surface is

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.110 
freezing and then the snow surface is
actually<00:01:33.290> quite<00:01:33.590> cold<00:01:34.010> and<00:01:34.400> so<00:01:34.760> you<00:01:34.850> have<00:01:35.000> this

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
actually quite cold and so you have this

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.910 
actually quite cold and so you have this
big<00:01:35.420> difference<00:01:35.750> in<00:01:36.110> temperature<00:01:36.590> from<00:01:36.770> the
