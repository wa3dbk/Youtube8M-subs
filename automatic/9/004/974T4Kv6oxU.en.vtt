think<00:01:52.590> I've<00:01:52.860> noticed<00:01:53.220> something<00:01:54.060> may<00:01:54.240> be

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
think I've noticed something may be

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.170 
think I've noticed something may be
amiss<00:01:54.750> with<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.110> ACR<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.740> believe<00:01:56.250> again<00:01:57.060> this

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
amiss with the ACR I believe again this

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.810 
amiss with the ACR I believe again this
is<00:01:57.360> just<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.600> hunch<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:58.110> my<00:01:58.259> part<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.340> ACR

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
is just a hunch on my part that the ACR

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.209 
is just a hunch on my part that the ACR
may<00:02:00.119> be<00:02:00.390> suffering<00:02:00.780> from<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.380> same<00:02:01.409> glitch

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
may be suffering from the same glitch

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.209 
may be suffering from the same glitch
that<00:02:02.520> allowed<00:02:02.820> for<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.149> cm<00:02:03.509> 901<00:02:03.979> to<00:02:04.979> have<00:02:05.189> a

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
that allowed for the cm 901 to have a

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.850 
that allowed for the cm 901 to have a
faster<00:02:05.909> fire<00:02:06.299> rate<00:02:06.630> with<00:02:07.170> an<00:02:07.320> underbarrel

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.790 
the ACR with an underbarrel attached

silencer attachment I've noticed that I
think<00:02:44.850> it<00:02:45.000> shoots<00:02:45.240> faster<00:02:45.660> I<00:02:45.720> don't<00:02:45.930> know

maybe<00:02:46.170> I'm<00:02:46.290> just<00:02:46.560> fooling<00:02:46.920> myself<00:02:47.240> with<00:02:48.240> with

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
maybe I'm just fooling myself with with

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
silencer with the ACR it sounds like it

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.040 
silencer with the ACR it sounds like it
shoots<00:02:54.900> just<00:02:55.380> as<00:02:55.650> fast<00:02:56.010> as<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.970> m4a1<00:02:57.870> it

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.640 
that of the m4a1 because if you listen
to<00:03:35.670> an<00:03:35.760> ACR<00:03:36.060> shoot<00:03:36.420> without<00:03:36.840> a<00:03:37.050> silencer<00:03:37.620> and

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
to an ACR shoot without a silencer and

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.380 
to an ACR shoot without a silencer and
then<00:03:37.830> listen<00:03:38.160> to<00:03:38.250> it<00:03:38.340> shoot<00:03:38.550> with<00:03:38.790> a<00:03:38.820> silencer

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
then listen to it shoot with a silencer

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.690 
then listen to it shoot with a silencer
it<00:03:39.780> sounds<00:03:40.290> like<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.500> RPM<00:03:41.010> is<00:03:41.190> definitely

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
it sounds like the RPM is definitely

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.949 
it sounds like the RPM is definitely
different<00:03:41.850> or<00:03:42.150> at<00:03:42.209> least<00:03:42.390> it<00:03:42.510> does<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.810> me<00:03:42.930> I

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
different or at least it does to me I

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.660 
different or at least it does to me I
don't<00:03:43.200> know<00:03:43.260> again<00:03:43.530> if<00:03:43.650> anybody<00:03:44.010> else<00:03:44.160> has

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
don't know again if anybody else has

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.090 
don't know again if anybody else has
that<00:03:44.940> feeling<00:03:45.300> but<00:03:45.959> I<00:03:46.110> think<00:03:46.800> it's<00:03:46.920> possible

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
that feeling but I think it's possible

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.550 
that feeling but I think it's possible
now<00:03:47.459> again<00:03:47.790> normally<00:03:48.240> I<00:03:48.270> wouldn't<00:03:48.630> I<00:03:48.900> wouldn't

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
now again normally I wouldn't I wouldn't

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.290 
now again normally I wouldn't I wouldn't
be<00:03:49.980> saying<00:03:50.190> this<00:03:50.280> you<00:03:50.670> know<00:03:50.790> it<00:03:50.940> would<00:03:51.030> just<00:03:51.120> be

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
be saying this you know it would just be

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.630 
be saying this you know it would just be
me<00:03:51.330> searching<00:03:51.840> for<00:03:51.959> something<00:03:52.140> to<00:03:52.320> talk<00:03:52.500> about

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
me searching for something to talk about

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.430 
me searching for something to talk about
but<00:03:53.640> there<00:03:53.880> is<00:03:53.910> precedence<00:03:54.780> for<00:03:54.870> this<00:03:55.020> kind<00:03:55.380> of

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
but there is precedence for this kind of

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.250 
but there is precedence for this kind of
thing<00:03:55.500> happening<00:03:56.100> in<00:03:56.310> modern<00:03:56.640> warfare<00:03:56.820> 3

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
thing happening in modern warfare 3

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.580 
thing happening in modern warfare 3
allowed<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:59.010> cm<00:03:59.459> 901<00:03:59.760> the<00:04:00.720> cm<00:04:00.990> 901<00:04:01.170> had

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
allowed the the cm 901 the cm 901 had

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:02.630 
allowed the the cm 901 the cm 901 had
that<00:04:01.740> glitch<00:04:02.010> where<00:04:02.190> the<00:04:02.280> underbarrel

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
that glitch where the underbarrel

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.280 
that glitch where the underbarrel
attachment<00:04:02.820> would<00:04:03.360> increase<00:04:03.720> the<00:04:03.750> fire<00:04:04.080> rate

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
attachment would increase the fire rate

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.380 
attachment would increase the fire rate
and<00:04:04.500> that<00:04:04.530> has<00:04:04.770> been<00:04:04.950> since<00:04:05.459> fixed<00:04:05.940> by

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
and that has been since fixed by

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.020 
and that has been since fixed by
infinity<00:04:06.870> ward<00:04:07.050> so<00:04:07.830> but<00:04:08.190> since<00:04:08.520> there<00:04:08.760> is<00:04:08.850> that

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
infinity ward so but since there is that

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.560 
infinity ward so but since there is that
precedent<00:04:09.390> set<00:04:09.840> I'm<00:04:10.830> that<00:04:11.400> gives<00:04:11.670> credence<00:04:12.150> to

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
precedent set I'm that gives credence to

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.260 
precedent set I'm that gives credence to
the<00:04:13.080> to<00:04:13.350> the<00:04:13.380> my<00:04:14.070> thoughts<00:04:14.370> on<00:04:14.580> the<00:04:14.700> silencer
