00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 okay we'll come to the next tutorial 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:09.139
 from the pm system kreuzelbe yes we show 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.450
 you as we what variation we make 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.559
 Okay, let's make that important 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.179
 is also a cross-lift 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.500
 royal discipline is also a demanding one 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.869
 Exercise therefore less weight again 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.730
 correct execution then you increase 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:33.690
 your performance is much better and that 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:35.120
 Risk of injury is minimized as well 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.710
 do it once 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.930
 important here is in our system 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.760
 we have air standing that is 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.780
 Feet bit closer 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.190
 a little bit tighter still a bit tighter 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.070
 a little tighter everything clear 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.280
 as soon as this position we have in ours 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.890
 our system worth the rod again 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.640
 pulled to the shin bone 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:59.989
 We now pay attention to that 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.550
 our knees do not go over the top 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.280
 that means we want to be completely normal 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.080
 cruiser positions hands are again 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.020
 outside the arms are outside the outside again 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.520
 we're trying to get toe 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.729
 Keep going as easily with the popo 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.750
 down so crouch down and out of this 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.280
 position now we pull our ham 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.740
 strings up that is in blue chips 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.180
 maximus near stop stop the mountain we 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.009
 Try to relax first 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.520
 yes that's the first phase is really 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.770
 take care that we are behind there 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.509
 Tension on it if you still there 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.130
 no tensions on it have in the 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.659
 Rear thighs The helmet springs 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.890
 if you have no stress because it 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.400
 then do not pull 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.579
 Okay, let's get back to you 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.409
 pull back so the knees move 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.470
 Not this area here from here 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.649
 until here is fixed because moves 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.500
 not you are just fixed here apropos 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.780
 push up straight and pull up 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.310
 stretch your hips and try 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.509
 her beautiful along the main 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.509
 along the thigh 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:11.980
 nice detlef good weight lift that 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:14.150
 means we always put off completely ok 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.580
 and another point was important too 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.570
 Note, weight transfer is nice 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.920
 on his heels 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.080
 on the whole foot but especially on 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.920
 heels 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:31.430
 super high voltage which I like very much 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.550
 hope the breathing, the breath is in 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.160
 his demanding exercises very much 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.770
 important we work here with the breathing 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.420
 that is also crucial that you still have 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.040
 more rum stapi war and that the 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.050
 it stays nice and stable that you do not 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.820
 One says that the back does not ski 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.240
 is curved so you go on 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.740
 okay, many see in the positions 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.450
 you get videos or cruising 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.700
 always a red head so that depends 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.090
 it always depends on you because you are now 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.400
 Inhale deeply 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.070
 high air and then high and now breathing 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.870
 Do not breathe out in the movement 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.330
 but only when I stretched 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.030
 I'll breathe it out yes and now 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.400
 Do not take a deep breath again 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:18.110
 back up and exhale 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.850
 that is not breathing in the air 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.130
 very important here in our system 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.100
 we do not breathe in motion but 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.900
 Only if we settle we breathe when 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.330
 We have been breathing out like we have stretched out 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.840
 out and then breathe up again and again 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.840
 out again 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.830
 Super 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.240
 Okay, we'll show you some more now 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.800
 small mistakes that happen yes we 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.560
 Often people have seen the system 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.020
 So have the cross lifting done that 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.320
 have applied 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:53.600
 okay man position for position rod 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:57.050
 first too far away 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.150
 yes, it's way too far away 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.590
 does not work that way is one 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.070
 weight shift no longer after 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.760
 behind 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:06.410
 yes you also fall here mostly flies 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.930
 im having your weight transfer 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.640
 then on your toes yes and then 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.920
 that no more correct Kreuzheben more 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.720
 that means the rod pull to you 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.910
 bring the ruler tension 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.260
 divis shift on his heels 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:23.330
 straight head in extension of 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:26.120
 breathe in the spine and highly accurately 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.480
 now second mistake the people over 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.300
 do not stretch but stretch 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.250
 try to keep the hip stable 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.040
 because yes you can go through the legs quietly 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:40.610
 stretch out the chest and the right 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:43.670
 belly tense ok second one more 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.430
 error is never from this position 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.870
 lift a weight 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.370
 because here if you do not move your back 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.430
 just as a hull not relaxation 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.750
 have loaded so extremely the intervertebral discs 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.970
 yes I think twice or 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.310
 You have three times the weight here 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:01.100
 what is often an intervertebral disc and that 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.710
 should not be because of it again and again 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.590
 in positions just keep the 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:10.970
 prisoners now relaxation exactly and 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:12.710
 I'm ashamed that you're still up 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.780
 what kind of 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.780
 So it has to be explained correctly 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.650
 The dog back is very important too 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.710
 avoid 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.420
 that's actually the biggest instruction 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.070
 which one can indulge in the cross 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.570
 Of course it comes about if 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.600
 you are not agile enough in the sky 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.220
 strings're back the old theme 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.080
 preparatory exercise that's why you have to 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.170
 that will definitely do what else 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.570
 a common mistake is that at the 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:41.600
 raise and lower this weight is 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.310
 many in an ex bavaria is coming now 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.810
 we have 40 kilo on it is still 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.030
 Not so much but if we go with it 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.550
 100 and 120 kilo work and be 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.380
 An ex bavarian will be the first expert 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.080
 that we avoid in any case 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.030
 that we let go extremely well 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.310
 So always make sure that you are this 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.620
 Hip wide position remains and both 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:04.780
 when lifting and when lowering 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:07.370
 always in this position remains accurate 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.750
 and pay attention to it when settling 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.030
 that you are really back with the pole 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:14.720
 down the shin bone and down 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:17.780
 there is always the tension there is more 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.090
 really nothing to say if you 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.700
 you are still uncertain look for one 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.880
 experienced trainer the studio is like 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.380
 I always say or new friends 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:31.780
 and let you help in any case 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:35.210
 because only to watch such a video 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:37.040
 it brings something but still have 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.180
 someone else will join you too 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.820
 can correct a bit 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.570
 because you yourself is mostly yours 

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.260
 own mistakes 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:47.260
 we okay to go to the next tutorial 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260
 it's
