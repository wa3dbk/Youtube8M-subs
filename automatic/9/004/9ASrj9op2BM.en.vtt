here so just make sure you get in here
no<00:01:03.140> zombies<00:01:03.500> around<00:01:03.589> so<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:03.979> Maxis<00:01:04.280> drone

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
no zombies around so the Maxis drone

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.580 
no zombies around so the Maxis drone
knows<00:01:04.640> what<00:01:04.820> it's<00:01:04.970> doing<00:01:05.030> and<00:01:05.390> we<00:01:06.170> just<00:01:06.350> let<00:01:06.470> it

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
knows what it's doing and we just let it

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.980 
knows what it's doing and we just let it
destroy<00:01:07.310> that<00:01:07.520> and<00:01:07.760> that'll<00:01:08.299> be<00:01:08.540> the<00:01:08.570> second

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
destroy that and that'll be the second

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.130 
destroy that and that'll be the second
one<00:01:09.110> and<00:01:09.229> then<00:01:09.320> you<00:01:09.409> only<00:01:09.530> have<00:01:09.620> two<00:01:09.920> more<00:01:10.130> left

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
one and then you only have two more left

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.750 
one and then you only have two more left
um<00:01:12.369> so<00:01:13.900> that<00:01:14.900> third<00:01:15.350> one<00:01:15.680> is<00:01:16.010> down<00:01:16.370> this<00:01:16.520> path

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
um so that third one is down this path

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.420 
um so that third one is down this path
back<00:01:17.150> towards<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:17.770> original<00:01:18.770> kind<00:01:19.190> of<00:01:19.250> spawn

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
back towards the original kind of spawn

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.790 
back towards the original kind of spawn
area<00:01:19.640> and<00:01:20.000> it's<00:01:20.870> going<00:01:20.960> to<00:01:21.050> be<00:01:21.200> in<00:01:21.410> this<00:01:21.560> little

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
area and it's going to be in this little

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.860 
area and it's going to be in this little
fireplace<00:01:22.370> area<00:01:22.610> you<00:01:22.910> can<00:01:23.060> see<00:01:23.240> right<00:01:23.270> there

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
fireplace area you can see right there

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.790 
fireplace area you can see right there
behind<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:24.500> flames<00:01:25.190> um<00:01:26.380> so<00:01:27.380> just<00:01:27.560> make<00:01:27.680> sure

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
there's no zombies around and just let

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.580 
there's no zombies around and just let
them<00:01:29.330> don't<00:01:29.540> fly<00:01:29.720> on<00:01:29.840> over<00:01:29.930> and<00:01:30.200> it'll<00:01:30.350> shoot

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
them don't fly on over and it'll shoot

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.350 
them don't fly on over and it'll shoot
it<00:01:30.740> up<00:01:30.890> and<00:01:31.280> then<00:01:31.460> you<00:01:31.490> only<00:01:31.670> have<00:01:31.850> one<00:01:32.150> more

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
it up and then you only have one more

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.620 
it up and then you only have one more
left<00:01:32.570> after<00:01:32.990> that<00:01:33.170> so<00:01:34.070> the<00:01:34.940> very<00:01:35.120> final<00:01:35.420> one<00:01:35.540> is

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
left after that so the very final one is

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.390 
left after that so the very final one is
