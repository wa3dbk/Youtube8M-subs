slips<00:01:08.189> while<00:01:08.430> you're<00:01:08.580> cutting<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:09.140> just<00:01:10.140> used<00:01:10.320> a

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
slips while you're cutting I just used a

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.140 
slips while you're cutting I just used a
little<00:01:10.530> bit<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.979> painters<00:01:11.310> tape<00:01:11.340> here<00:01:11.970> and

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
little bit of painters tape here and

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.429 
little bit of painters tape here and
then<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.270> went<00:01:12.600> over<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.990> with<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> little

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
then I went over it with a little

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.350 
then I went over it with a little
electrical<00:01:14.100> tape<00:01:14.159> just<00:01:14.549> because<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.060> seemed<00:01:15.270> a

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
electrical tape just because it seemed a

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.149 
electrical tape just because it seemed a
little<00:01:15.450> bit<00:01:15.570> more<00:01:15.689> durable<00:01:16.259> but<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.890> actually

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
little bit more durable but I actually

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.810 
little bit more durable but I actually
didn't<00:01:17.640> slip<00:01:17.939> at<00:01:18.060> all<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.720> was<00:01:18.840> fine

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.940 

now<00:01:22.450> put<00:01:22.840> a<00:01:22.870> cut-off<00:01:23.140> disc<00:01:23.560> bear<00:01:23.800> on<00:01:23.920> your

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
now put a cut-off disc bear on your

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.980 
now put a cut-off disc bear on your
dremel<00:01:24.490> and<00:01:24.670> you're<00:01:25.270> going<00:01:25.450> to<00:01:25.510> want<00:01:25.690> to<00:01:25.780> cut

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
dremel and you're going to want to cut

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.540 
dremel and you're going to want to cut
right<00:01:26.260> after<00:01:27.250> the<00:01:27.430> threads<00:01:27.970> and<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:30.040> the<00:01:30.340> disc

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
right after the threads and so the disc

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.340 
right after the threads and so the disc
that<00:01:30.700> I'm<00:01:30.820> using<00:01:31.030> right<00:01:31.150> here<00:01:31.570> is<00:01:31.660> actually<00:01:32.320> a

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
that I'm using right here is actually a

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.190 
that I'm using right here is actually a
little<00:01:32.860> bit<00:01:32.980> too<00:01:33.970> small<00:01:34.360> to<00:01:34.600> cut<00:01:34.810> straight

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
little bit too small to cut straight

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.680 
little bit too small to cut straight
through<00:01:35.260> so<00:01:35.950> you'll<00:01:36.280> see<00:01:36.550> in<00:01:36.610> a<00:01:36.670> minute<00:01:36.940> where

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
through so you'll see in a minute where

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.990 
through so you'll see in a minute where
I<00:01:37.720> have<00:01:38.290> to<00:01:38.410> kind<00:01:38.590> of<00:01:38.650> break<00:01:39.160> it<00:01:39.190> off<00:01:39.430> with<00:01:39.760> some

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
I have to kind of break it off with some

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.070 
I have to kind of break it off with some
pliers<00:01:40.650> which<00:01:41.650> ends<00:01:42.130> up<00:01:42.160> being<00:01:42.220> okay<00:01:42.760> I<00:01:43.540> like

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
pliers which ends up being okay I like

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.780 
pliers which ends up being okay I like
using<00:01:44.290> the<00:01:44.470> dremel<00:01:44.830> because<00:01:45.100> it<00:01:45.280> gave<00:01:45.430> a<00:01:45.490> real

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
using the dremel because it gave a real

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.280 
using the dremel because it gave a real
clean<00:01:46.030> cut<00:01:46.300> I<00:01:46.510> didn't<00:01:46.750> really<00:01:46.930> have<00:01:47.050> to<00:01:47.170> go

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
clean cut I didn't really have to go

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.650

between the rod blank

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.610

but<00:04:13.790> you<00:04:14.060> want<00:04:14.300> to<00:04:14.360> make<00:04:14.480> sure<00:04:14.510> also<00:04:14.930> that<00:04:15.380> it's

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
but you want to make sure also that it's

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.350 
but you want to make sure also that it's
not<00:04:15.830> clanging<00:04:16.160> around<00:04:16.580> in<00:04:16.790> there<00:04:16.940> as<00:04:17.150> you're

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:17.360 
not clanging around in there as you're

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.560 
not clanging around in there as you're
casting<00:04:18.700> so<00:04:19.700> after<00:04:19.970> you<00:04:20.060> combine<00:04:20.390> these<00:04:20.510> two

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
casting so after you combine these two

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.960 
casting so after you combine these two
sections<00:04:21.200> that's<00:04:21.470> really<00:04:21.980> all<00:04:22.250> there<00:04:22.490> is<00:04:22.670> to

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
sections that's really all there is to

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.820 
sections that's really all there is to
it<00:04:23.120> you<00:04:23.150> just<00:04:23.420> gotta<00:04:23.810> let<00:04:24.020> it<00:04:24.050> cure<00:04:24.350> and<00:04:24.620> then

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
it you just gotta let it cure and then

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.440 
it you just gotta let it cure and then
it<00:04:25.310> should<00:04:25.460> be<00:04:25.610> ready<00:04:25.820> to<00:04:25.880> go<00:04:26.000> out<00:04:26.090> in<00:04:26.360> the

between casting a graphite or a bamboo

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.420 
between casting a graphite or a bamboo
rod<00:04:55.250> is<00:04:55.930> compared<00:04:56.930> to<00:04:57.050> a<00:04:57.080> fiberglass<00:04:57.710> yeah

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
rod is compared to a fiberglass yeah

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.180 
rod is compared to a fiberglass yeah
this<00:04:58.670> isn't<00:04:58.850> a<00:04:59.000> high-end<00:04:59.420> rod<00:04:59.690> and<00:05:00.140> it<00:05:00.740> it

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
this isn't a high-end rod and it it

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.580 
this isn't a high-end rod and it it
doesn't<00:05:01.550> offer<00:05:01.700> the<00:05:02.450> same<00:05:02.690> benefits<00:05:03.440> that

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
doesn't offer the same benefits that

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.590 
doesn't offer the same benefits that
some<00:05:04.010> of<00:05:04.130> the<00:05:04.400> more<00:05:04.640> expensive<00:05:04.880> blanks<00:05:05.420> have

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
some of the more expensive blanks have

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.320 
some of the more expensive blanks have
it's<00:05:06.470> still<00:05:06.650> a<00:05:06.680> fun<00:05:06.950> way<00:05:07.130> that<00:05:07.370> you<00:05:07.490> can<00:05:07.670> get<00:05:08.300> a

would<00:05:26.540> be<00:05:26.660> the<00:05:26.810> perfect<00:05:27.020> rod<00:05:27.410> so<00:05:27.940> there's<00:05:28.940> a

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
would be the perfect rod so there's a

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.400 
would be the perfect rod so there's a
lot<00:05:29.150> of<00:05:29.180> benefits<00:05:29.690> I<00:05:29.840> think<00:05:29.870> this<00:05:30.110> is<00:05:30.200> going<00:05:30.320> to

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
lot of benefits I think this is going to

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.290 
lot of benefits I think this is going to
be<00:05:30.500> a<00:05:30.530> really<00:05:30.770> fun<00:05:30.950> rod<00:05:31.190> and<00:05:31.460> I<00:05:31.670> can't<00:05:32.090> wait<00:05:32.270> to

be a really fun rod and I can't wait to

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.260 
be a really fun rod and I can't wait to
test<00:05:33.290> it<00:05:33.440> out<00:05:33.560> I<00:05:33.890> promise<00:05:34.220> to<00:05:34.490> take<00:05:34.640> it<00:05:34.820> with<00:05:35.030> me
