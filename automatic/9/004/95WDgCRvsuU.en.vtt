here talks of the car and lets us my
computer<00:03:36.470> actually<00:03:36.650> things<00:03:37.160> like<00:03:37.250> steering

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
computer actually things like steering

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.820 
computer actually things like steering
brake<00:03:38.600> and<00:03:38.870> gas<00:03:39.370> bottle<00:03:40.370> then<00:03:41.360> also<00:03:42.110> important

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
brake and gas bottle then also important

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.920 
brake and gas bottle then also important
is<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.520> section<00:03:44.030> of<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.240> vehicle<00:03:44.540> so<00:03:44.660> you<00:03:44.750> see

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
is the section of the vehicle so you see

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.650 
is the section of the vehicle so you see
down<00:03:45.080> here<00:03:45.470> sensors<00:03:46.280> on<00:03:46.490> the<00:03:46.550> wheel<00:03:47.030> over<00:03:47.330> here

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
down here sensors on the wheel over here

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.510 
down here sensors on the wheel over here
these<00:03:48.110> guys<00:03:48.350> over<00:03:48.680> here<00:03:48.800> slightly<00:03:49.130> dusty

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
these guys over here slightly dusty

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.310 
these guys over here slightly dusty
their<00:03:49.700> sensors<00:03:50.150> and<00:03:50.390> they<00:03:50.810> are<00:03:50.870> able<00:03:51.170> to

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
their sensors and they are able to

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.960 
their sensors and they are able to
perceive<00:03:51.560> the<00:03:52.040> environment<00:03:52.070> and<00:03:52.640> build<00:03:52.880> a

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
perceive the environment and build a

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.910 
perceive the environment and build a
model<00:03:53.209> inside<00:03:53.630> the<00:03:53.840> vehicle<00:03:54.200> as<00:03:54.590> to<00:03:54.770> how<00:03:54.860> the

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
model inside the vehicle as to how the

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.680 
model inside the vehicle as to how the
environment<00:03:55.160> looks<00:03:55.459> like<00:03:55.730> the<00:03:56.510> last

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
environment looks like the last

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:57.940 
environment looks like the last
important<00:03:57.170> thing<00:03:57.350> is<00:03:57.440> when<00:03:57.590> you<00:03:57.680> get<00:03:57.800> inside

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
important thing is when you get inside

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.880 
important thing is when you get inside
the<00:03:58.280> driver's<00:03:58.640> cabin<00:03:58.880> this<00:03:59.600> looks<00:03:59.900> very<00:04:00.709> much

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
the driver's cabin this looks very much

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.470 
the driver's cabin this looks very much
that's<00:04:01.130> like<00:04:01.340> a<00:04:01.430> very<00:04:01.670> normal<00:04:01.880> driver<00:04:02.209> Kevin

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
that's like a very normal driver Kevin

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.810 
that's like a very normal driver Kevin
except<00:04:03.290> there's<00:04:03.530> a<00:04:03.590> few<00:04:03.860> extra<00:04:03.950> switches<00:04:04.610> and

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
except there's a few extra switches and

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.370 
except there's a few extra switches and
these<00:04:04.940> are<00:04:05.120> the<00:04:05.239> switches<00:04:05.450> where<00:04:06.140> we<00:04:06.200> go<00:04:06.350> from

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
these are the switches where we go from

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.680 
these are the switches where we go from
human<00:04:06.950> control<00:04:07.280> to<00:04:07.489> computer<00:04:07.820> control<00:04:07.940> so

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
human control to computer control so

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.420 
human control to computer control so
when<00:04:08.840> you<00:04:08.959> slip<00:04:09.500> those<00:04:09.709> the<00:04:09.980> car<00:04:10.160> drives

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
when you slip those the car drives

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.830 
when you slip those the car drives
itself<00:04:10.580> and<00:04:11.060> you<00:04:11.120> have<00:04:11.239> multiple<00:04:11.450> switches

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
itself and you have multiple switches

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.720 
itself and you have multiple switches
for<00:04:12.140> things<00:04:12.320> like<00:04:12.410> gearbox<00:04:12.980> and<00:04:13.190> throttle<00:04:13.610> and

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
for things like gearbox and throttle and

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.940 
for things like gearbox and throttle and
turn<00:04:13.910> signals<00:04:14.300> and<00:04:14.420> so<00:04:14.540> on<00:04:14.660> then<00:04:15.470> all<00:04:15.620> together

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
turn signals and so on then all together

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.610 
turn signals and so on then all together
is<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:16.370> car<00:04:16.600> the<00:04:17.600> last<00:04:17.900> thing<00:04:18.200> that<00:04:18.230> I<00:04:18.410> can

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
is the car the last thing that I can

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.490 
is the car the last thing that I can
show<00:04:18.890> you<00:04:18.950> is<00:04:19.280> called<00:04:19.760> software<00:04:20.480> so<00:04:21.230> what<00:04:21.350> V

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
show you is called software so what V

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.200 
show you is called software so what V
drives<00:04:21.799> this<00:04:21.950> machine<00:04:22.310> is<00:04:22.460> not<00:04:22.669> the<00:04:22.850> hardware
