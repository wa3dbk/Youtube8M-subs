00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.670 
loader as we sort of pan around it you
can<00:00:17.760> see<00:00:18.020> on<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.859> back<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.609> loader<00:00:20.820> setup<00:00:21.680> as

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
can see on the back the loader setup as

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.070 
can see on the back the loader setup as
well<00:00:22.710> as<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.640> tire<00:00:24.060> protector<00:00:24.810> which<00:00:24.930> we'll

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
well as the tire protector which we'll

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.769 
well as the tire protector which we'll
talk<00:00:25.230> about<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.560> little<00:00:25.650> bit<00:00:25.800> more<00:00:25.859> in<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.160> minute

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:33.440 
talk about a little bit more in a minute
you<00:00:27.779> can<00:00:27.990> see<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.500> diverter<00:00:29.070> valve<00:00:29.490> there<00:00:32.450> the

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
you can see the diverter valve there the

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.000 
you can see the diverter valve there the
right<00:00:33.690> wing<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.260> then<00:00:34.380> we'll<00:00:34.559> swing<00:00:34.860> around

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
right wing and then we'll swing around

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:42.910 
right wing and then we'll swing around
and<00:00:37.309> we'll<00:00:38.450> take<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.510> look<00:00:39.920> at<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.750> HELOC

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
and we'll take a look at the HELOC

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.970 
and we'll take a look at the HELOC
rotary<00:00:43.920> actuator<00:00:44.809> which<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:46.200> something<00:00:46.860> that

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
rotary actuator which is something that

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.160 
rotary actuator which is something that
makes<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.489> wing<00:00:47.940> very<00:00:48.570> very<00:00:48.809> unique<00:00:51.170> these

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
makes this wing very very unique these

hydraulic ram setups which typically

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.889 
hydraulic ram setups which typically
uses<00:00:57.870> two<00:00:58.500> Rams<00:00:58.770> on<00:00:59.039> each<00:00:59.190> side<00:00:59.489> to<00:01:00.480> get<00:01:00.690> the
