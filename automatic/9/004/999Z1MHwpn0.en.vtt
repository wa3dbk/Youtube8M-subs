lessons I've noticed a fundamental
roadblock<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.320> improvement<00:00:28.949> manifested<00:00:29.789> by

roadblock to improvement manifested by

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.510 
roadblock to improvement manifested by
tension<00:00:30.660> in<00:00:30.840> their<00:00:31.109> plane<00:00:31.410> we<00:00:32.369> will

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
tension in their plane we will

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.000 
tension in their plane we will
demonstrate<00:00:32.809> concepts<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.050> exercises<00:00:34.829> that

demonstrate concepts and exercises that

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.459 
demonstrate concepts and exercises that
I<00:00:35.399> have<00:00:35.550> found<00:00:35.820> useful<00:00:36.149> in<00:00:36.690> understanding<00:00:36.780> how

I have found useful in understanding how

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.250 
I have found useful in understanding how
to<00:00:37.500> disarm<00:00:38.190> tension<00:00:38.879> in<00:00:39.120> your<00:00:39.450> violin<00:00:39.960> playing

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
to disarm tension in your violin playing

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
in this segment of the lesson we'll be

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.010 
in this segment of the lesson we'll be
discussing<00:00:51.469> left-hand<00:00:52.309> tension<00:00:52.969> now<00:00:53.629> a<00:00:53.660> very

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
discussing left-hand tension now a very

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.740 
discussing left-hand tension now a very
good<00:00:54.260> exercise<00:00:54.590> for<00:00:55.520> the<00:00:55.850> left<00:00:56.120> hand<00:00:56.420> in<00:00:56.600> order

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
good exercise for the left hand in order

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.080 
good exercise for the left hand in order
to<00:00:56.899> loosen<00:00:57.500> it<00:00:57.620> and<00:00:57.800> not<00:00:58.309> have<00:00:58.519> that<00:00:58.670> sort<00:00:59.000> of

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
to loosen it and not have that sort of

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.270 
to loosen it and not have that sort of
death<00:00:59.360> like<00:00:59.629> grip<00:01:00.079> on<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:00.739> neck<00:01:01.040> of<00:01:01.070> the

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
death like grip on the neck of the

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.970 
death like grip on the neck of the
instrument<00:01:01.309> we<00:01:02.239> execute<00:01:02.840> harmonics<00:01:03.710> and

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
instrument we execute harmonics and

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.690 
instrument we execute harmonics and
initially<00:01:04.940> I'll<00:01:05.150> be<00:01:05.330> doing<00:01:05.740> long<00:01:06.740> Lassonde

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
initially I'll be doing long Lassonde

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.880 
initially I'll be doing long Lassonde
harmonic<00:01:08.270> shifting<00:01:08.840> and<00:01:09.050> then<00:01:09.500> we'll<00:01:09.680> talk

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
harmonic shifting and then we'll talk

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.430 
harmonic shifting and then we'll talk
about<00:01:10.149> individual<00:01:11.149> fingering<00:01:11.659> harmonics<00:01:12.259> so

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
about individual fingering harmonics so

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.399 
about individual fingering harmonics so
let<00:01:12.950> me<00:01:13.070> show<00:01:13.280> you<00:01:13.310> first<00:01:13.820> with<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:14.780> bow<00:01:15.050> a

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
let me show you first with the bow a

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.430 
let me show you first with the bow a
little<00:01:16.040> secret<00:01:16.430> about<00:01:16.670> executing<00:01:17.659> a<00:01:17.869> harmonic

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
little secret about executing a harmonic

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.529 
little secret about executing a harmonic
and<00:01:19.040> what<00:01:19.159> I<00:01:19.190> mean<00:01:19.460> by<00:01:19.610> that<00:01:19.640> is<00:01:20.030> we<00:01:20.179> want<00:01:20.390> the

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
and what I mean by that is we want the

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:24.370 
and what I mean by that is we want the
clearest<00:01:21.170> most<00:01:21.860> reliable<00:01:22.700> sound<00:01:23.060> possible<00:01:23.869> so

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
clearest most reliable sound possible so

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.590 
clearest most reliable sound possible so
we<00:01:24.590> go<00:01:24.770> a<00:01:24.800> little<00:01:25.130> bit<00:01:25.310> against<00:01:25.880> logic<00:01:26.090> here

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
we go a little bit against logic here

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.480 
we go a little bit against logic here
when<00:01:26.750> doing<00:01:27.080> that<00:01:27.259> normally<00:01:28.160> if<00:01:28.340> you're

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
when doing that normally if you're

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.130 
when doing that normally if you're
executing<00:01:29.060> a<00:01:29.149> normal<00:01:29.630> note<00:01:31.450> we<00:01:32.450> have<00:01:32.720> the

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
executing a normal note we have the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.499 
executing a normal note we have the
hairs<00:01:33.380> anywhere<00:01:33.860> from<00:01:34.160> oh<00:01:34.399> three<00:01:35.000> quarters<00:01:35.360> of

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
hairs anywhere from oh three quarters of

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.450 
hairs anywhere from oh three quarters of
an<00:01:35.600> inch<00:01:35.720> to<00:01:35.869> a<00:01:36.050> full<00:01:36.710> inch<00:01:36.979> inch<00:01:37.250> and<00:01:37.340> a<00:01:37.429> half

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460

away<00:01:37.789> from<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.300> bridge<00:01:38.570> when<00:01:39.170> you're

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
away from the bridge when you're

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.029 
away from the bridge when you're
executing<00:01:39.800> a<00:01:40.310> harmonic<00:01:44.289> what<00:01:45.289> we<00:01:45.440> want<00:01:45.710> to<00:01:45.860> do

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
executing a harmonic what we want to do

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.969 
executing a harmonic what we want to do
is<00:01:46.340> tilt<00:01:47.210> the<00:01:47.479> bow<00:01:47.630> slightly<00:01:47.690> as<00:01:48.470> if<00:01:48.740> for

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
is tilt the bow slightly as if for

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.910 
is tilt the bow slightly as if for
instance<00:01:49.039> if<00:01:49.429> you<00:01:49.550> do<00:01:49.700> spicata<00:01:50.619> the<00:01:51.619> way<00:01:51.740> we

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
instance if you do spicata the way we

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.399 
instance if you do spicata the way we
tilt<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.340> bow<00:01:52.610> and<00:01:53.030> you<00:01:53.270> actually<00:01:53.540> push<00:01:54.170> the

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
tilt the bow and you actually push the

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.429 
tilt the bow and you actually push the
hairs<00:01:54.680> within<00:01:55.670> a<00:01:55.939> quarter<00:01:56.479> half<00:01:56.930> inch<00:01:57.200> to<00:01:57.290> a

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
hairs within a quarter half inch to a

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.830 
hairs within a quarter half inch to a
quarter<00:01:57.770> inch<00:01:58.100> from<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:59.509> bridge<00:02:00.909> and<00:02:01.909> by

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
quarter inch from the bridge and by

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.690 
quarter inch from the bridge and by
doing<00:02:03.170> this<00:02:03.439> we<00:02:03.500> get<00:02:03.770> a<00:02:03.829> very<00:02:04.280> reliable

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
doing this we get a very reliable

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.039 
doing this we get a very reliable
harmonic<00:02:07.700> sound<00:02:07.969> a<00:02:08.090> lot<00:02:08.269> of<00:02:08.329> times<00:02:08.600> people<00:02:08.780> try

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.049 
harmonic sound a lot of times people try

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.699 
harmonic sound a lot of times people try
to<00:02:09.140> use<00:02:09.290> a<00:02:09.320> lot<00:02:09.500> of<00:02:09.560> bow<00:02:09.799> speed<00:02:10.540> they<00:02:11.540> try<00:02:11.900> to<00:02:11.959> do

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
to use a lot of bow speed they try to do

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.380 
to use a lot of bow speed they try to do
any<00:02:12.890> number<00:02:13.100> of<00:02:13.250> things<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.730> sort<00:02:13.970> of<00:02:14.060> finesse

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
any number of things to sort of finesse

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.699 
any number of things to sort of finesse
our<00:02:14.959> mind<00:02:15.350> but<00:02:15.650> really<00:02:16.070> what<00:02:16.700> you<00:02:16.850> need<00:02:17.090> is<00:02:17.709> a

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
our mind but really what you need is a

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.300 
our mind but really what you need is a
little<00:02:19.040> bit<00:02:19.370> a<00:02:19.959> little<00:02:20.959> bit<00:02:21.230> bolder<00:02:21.590> approach

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
little bit a little bit bolder approach

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.729 
little bit a little bit bolder approach
with<00:02:22.579> the<00:02:22.700> bow<00:02:22.880> and<00:02:23.209> you<00:02:23.530> get<00:02:26.350> so<00:02:27.350> that's<00:02:27.560> the

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
with the bow and you get so that's the

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.289 
with the bow and you get so that's the
first<00:02:27.980> thing<00:02:28.100> so<00:02:28.489> for<00:02:28.670> those<00:02:28.850> of<00:02:29.030> you<00:02:29.150> that

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
first thing so for those of you that

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.539 
first thing so for those of you that
know<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.630> terms<00:02:29.900> sound<00:02:30.410> point<00:02:30.950> that's

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
know the terms sound point that's

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.819 
know the terms sound point that's
precisely<00:02:32.120> what<00:02:32.510> we're<00:02:32.720> playing<00:02:33.320> with<00:02:33.590> here

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
precisely what we're playing with here

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.300 
precisely what we're playing with here
is<00:02:34.760> we<00:02:35.030> have<00:02:35.060> a<00:02:35.630> sound<00:02:36.140> point<00:02:36.500> that<00:02:36.709> is<00:02:36.829> closer

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
is we have a sound point that is closer

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.110 
is we have a sound point that is closer
to<00:02:37.519> the<00:02:38.450> bridge<00:02:38.720> now<00:02:39.709> let's<00:02:40.010> go<00:02:40.250> to<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:40.910> first

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
to the bridge now let's go to the first

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.039 
to the bridge now let's go to the first
exercise<00:02:41.810> I<00:02:42.620> call<00:02:43.160> this<00:02:43.310> a<00:02:43.370> harmonic<00:02:44.090> shifting

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
exercise I call this a harmonic shifting

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.009 
exercise I call this a harmonic shifting
exercise<00:02:45.560> what<00:02:46.400> I've<00:02:46.489> found<00:02:46.790> in<00:02:47.180> talking<00:02:47.690> with

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
exercise what I've found in talking with

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.170 
exercise what I've found in talking with
my<00:02:48.170> students<00:02:48.739> is<00:02:48.890> that<00:02:49.670> when<00:02:49.850> they're<00:02:49.970> trying

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
my students is that when they're trying

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.569 
my students is that when they're trying
to<00:02:50.299> execute<00:02:50.660> various<00:02:51.200> exercises<00:02:51.739> that<00:02:52.430> I've

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
to execute various exercises that I've

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.330 
to execute various exercises that I've
given<00:02:52.790> in<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.299> past<00:02:53.570> a<00:02:53.900> lot<00:02:54.290> of<00:02:54.440> times<00:02:54.709> there's

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
given in the past a lot of times there's

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.090 
given in the past a lot of times there's
simply<00:02:55.760> too<00:02:56.180> much<00:02:56.419> tension<00:02:56.900> in<00:02:57.410> their<00:02:57.859> left

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
simply too much tension in their left

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.250 
simply too much tension in their left
hand<00:02:58.370> in<00:02:58.519> other<00:02:58.669> words<00:02:58.910> they're<00:02:59.449> gripping<00:02:59.930> the

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
hand in other words they're gripping the

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.520 
hand in other words they're gripping the
instrument<00:03:00.709> between<00:03:00.829> their

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
instrument between their

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.580 
instrument between their
an<00:03:01.980> index<00:03:02.700> finger<00:03:02.970> or<00:03:03.330> this<00:03:03.810> part<00:03:04.110> of<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.319> hand

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
an index finger or this part of the hand

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.180 
an index finger or this part of the hand
in<00:03:04.800> such<00:03:05.490> a<00:03:05.520> way<00:03:05.880> that<00:03:06.209> makes<00:03:07.190> executing

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
in such a way that makes executing

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.650 
in such a way that makes executing
certain<00:03:08.520> exercises<00:03:08.970> for<00:03:09.390> instance<00:03:11.660> vibrato

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
certain exercises for instance vibrato

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.650 
certain exercises for instance vibrato
exercises<00:03:13.620> it<00:03:14.010> makes<00:03:14.610> it<00:03:14.880> a<00:03:15.240> lot<00:03:15.600> more

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
exercises it makes it a lot more

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.420 
exercises it makes it a lot more
difficult<00:03:16.410> because<00:03:16.590> of<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:16.950> inherent

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
difficult because of the inherent

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.699 
difficult because of the inherent
tension<00:03:17.700> involved<00:03:18.090> this<00:03:18.900> is<00:03:19.110> an<00:03:19.230> exercise

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
tension involved this is an exercise

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.890 
tension involved this is an exercise
that<00:03:20.100> I've<00:03:20.970> come<00:03:21.180> up<00:03:21.209> with<00:03:21.540> that<00:03:21.750> I<00:03:21.840> think

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
that I've come up with that I think

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.770 
that I've come up with that I think
helps<00:03:22.319> to<00:03:22.470> disarm<00:03:22.950> that<00:03:23.550> tension<00:03:24.150> so<00:03:24.510> let<00:03:24.690> me

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
helps to disarm that tension so let me

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.860 
helps to disarm that tension so let me
demonstrate<00:03:24.930> first<00:03:25.650> let's<00:03:26.250> take<00:03:26.520> AG<00:03:27.239> natural

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
demonstrate first let's take AG natural

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.730 
demonstrate first let's take AG natural
on<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:31.590> D<00:03:31.800> string

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
on the D string

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.890 
on the D string
this<00:03:34.740> is<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.069> G<00:03:35.250> natural<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:36.000> then<00:03:36.569> let's

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
this is the G natural and then let's

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.600 
this is the G natural and then let's
remember<00:03:37.230> first<00:03:37.650> we<00:03:38.430> light<00:03:38.819> the<00:03:39.120> pressure<00:03:39.390> of

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
remember first we light the pressure of

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.230 
remember first we light the pressure of
the<00:03:41.610> left<00:03:41.850> finger<00:03:42.450> on<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:43.050> D<00:03:43.230> string<00:03:43.260> and<00:03:44.240> then

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
the left finger on the D string and then

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.440 
the left finger on the D string and then
of<00:03:45.390> course<00:03:45.630> we<00:03:45.840> use<00:03:46.110> our<00:03:46.380> new<00:03:46.940> bow<00:03:47.940> technique

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
of course we use our new bow technique

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.310 
of course we use our new bow technique
idea<00:03:48.930> with<00:03:49.650> producing<00:03:50.459> a<00:03:50.580> harmonic<00:03:51.150> so<00:03:52.080> get

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
idea with producing a harmonic so get

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.990 
idea with producing a harmonic so get
comfortable<00:03:52.890> with<00:03:53.190> that<00:03:53.340> first<00:03:55.670> it's<00:03:56.670> really

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
comfortable with that first it's really

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.229 
comfortable with that first it's really
important<00:03:57.860> then<00:03:58.860> we<00:03:58.950> have<00:03:59.100> those<00:03:59.370> two<00:03:59.730> basics

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
important then we have those two basics

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.840 
important then we have those two basics
in<00:04:00.390> place<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:01.080> very<00:04:01.860> light<00:04:02.190> pressure<00:04:02.489> if

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
in place the very light pressure if

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.670 
in place the very light pressure if
you've<00:04:03.000> never<00:04:03.180> played<00:04:03.390> a<00:04:03.510> harmonic<00:04:04.110> on<00:04:04.290> the

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
you've never played a harmonic on the

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.040 
you've never played a harmonic on the
violin<00:04:05.069> before<00:04:05.480> coming<00:04:06.480> from<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:06.810> left

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
violin before coming from the left

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.870 
violin before coming from the left
finger<00:04:07.530> almost<00:04:08.220> you<00:04:08.370> could<00:04:08.520> call<00:04:08.730> it

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
finger almost you could call it

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.780 
finger almost you could call it
feather-light<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:10.130> then<00:04:11.130> of<00:04:11.280> course<00:04:11.310> with

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
feather-light and then of course with

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.360 
feather-light and then of course with
the<00:04:11.910> bow<00:04:12.239> we<00:04:13.019> actually<00:04:13.440> do<00:04:13.590> not<00:04:13.860> approach<00:04:14.310> it

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
the bow we actually do not approach it

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.610 
the bow we actually do not approach it
with<00:04:14.670> the<00:04:14.760> feather-light<00:04:15.350> touch<00:04:16.350> but

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
with the feather-light touch but

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.000 
with the feather-light touch but
actually<00:04:16.980> pretty<00:04:17.250> bold<00:04:18.169> we<00:04:19.169> want<00:04:19.410> good<00:04:19.769> weight

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
actually pretty bold we want good weight

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.949 
actually pretty bold we want good weight
distribution<00:04:20.220> and<00:04:21.060> we<00:04:21.209> want<00:04:21.419> those<00:04:21.600> hairs

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
distribution and we want those hairs

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:31.330 
distribution and we want those hairs
coming<00:04:22.350> toward<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.650> bridge

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.369 

nice<00:04:32.340> clear<00:04:32.819> reliable<00:04:33.389> sound<00:04:33.659> harmonics<00:04:34.289> can

00:04:34.369 --> 00:04:34.379 
nice clear reliable sound harmonics can

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:37.040 
nice clear reliable sound harmonics can
be<00:04:34.500> difficult<00:04:34.979> to<00:04:35.219> execute<00:04:35.520> now<00:04:36.270> once<00:04:36.719> you<00:04:36.900> get

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
be difficult to execute now once you get

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.850 
be difficult to execute now once you get
comfortable<00:04:37.590> with<00:04:39.169> producing<00:04:40.169> a<00:04:40.319> harmonic

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
comfortable with producing a harmonic

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.520 
comfortable with producing a harmonic
then<00:04:41.550> we<00:04:41.789> go<00:04:41.969> to<00:04:42.030> the<00:04:42.330> shifting<00:04:42.719> exercise<00:04:43.199> and

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
then we go to the shifting exercise and

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.320 
then we go to the shifting exercise and
it<00:04:44.069> doesn't<00:04:44.400> matter<00:04:44.639> if<00:04:44.969> you're<00:04:45.180> not

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
it doesn't matter if you're not

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.020 
it doesn't matter if you're not
accustomed<00:04:45.689> to<00:04:46.110> playing<00:04:46.740> in<00:04:47.129> a<00:04:47.340> multitude<00:04:47.789> of

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
accustomed to playing in a multitude of

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.119 
accustomed to playing in a multitude of
positions<00:04:48.479> on<00:04:48.629> the<00:04:48.719> violin<00:04:49.139> this<00:04:49.560> is<00:04:49.770> a<00:04:49.800> very

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:50.129 
positions on the violin this is a very

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:53.029 
positions on the violin this is a very
general<00:04:50.939> sort<00:04:51.210> of<00:04:51.300> generic<00:04:51.930> shift<00:04:52.289> what<00:04:52.889> you

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
general sort of generic shift what you

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:57.999 
general sort of generic shift what you
want<00:04:53.219> to<00:04:53.310> look<00:04:53.490> for<00:04:54.469> is<00:04:56.000> that<00:04:57.000> the<00:04:57.150> thumb

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:58.009 
want to look for is that the thumb

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:01.999 
want to look for is that the thumb
follows<00:04:59.009> the<00:04:59.370> contour<00:05:00.210> of<00:05:00.509> the<00:05:00.779> neck<00:05:01.199> and<00:05:01.770> for

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:02.009 
follows the contour of the neck and for

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:03.709 
follows the contour of the neck and for
those<00:05:02.129> with<00:05:02.430> smaller<00:05:02.789> hands<00:05:03.180> you<00:05:03.330> can<00:05:03.479> even

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:03.719 
those with smaller hands you can even

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:06.499 
those with smaller hands you can even
bring<00:05:03.900> the<00:05:04.050> thumb<00:05:04.289> up<00:05:04.500> around<00:05:04.889> the<00:05:05.759> neck<00:05:06.000> stock

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:06.509 
bring the thumb up around the neck stock

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:09.290 
bring the thumb up around the neck stock
what<00:05:06.900> we<00:05:07.020> don't<00:05:07.349> want<00:05:07.740> to<00:05:07.889> do<00:05:08.099> is<00:05:08.340> bring<00:05:09.180> the

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
what we don't want to do is bring the

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.100 
what we don't want to do is bring the
thumb<00:05:09.569> up<00:05:09.719> along<00:05:10.259> the<00:05:10.500> rib<00:05:10.710> area<00:05:10.889> because<00:05:11.759> that

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
thumb up along the rib area because that

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.659 
thumb up along the rib area because that
disassociates<00:05:13.110> the<00:05:13.409> hand<00:05:13.740> from<00:05:14.460> the

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
disassociates the hand from the

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.309 
disassociates the hand from the
fingerboard<00:05:15.029> we<00:05:15.360> definitely<00:05:15.840> don't<00:05:16.020> want

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:16.319 
fingerboard we definitely don't want

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:18.709 
fingerboard we definitely don't want
that<00:05:16.560> so<00:05:17.219> let<00:05:17.430> me<00:05:17.520> execute<00:05:17.909> the<00:05:18.210> first<00:05:18.479> shift

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:18.719 
that so let me execute the first shift

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:23.929 
that so let me execute the first shift
this<00:05:19.469> one<00:05:19.710> doesn't<00:05:20.219> go<00:05:20.310> quite<00:05:20.520> as<00:05:20.789> high<00:05:22.939> what

00:05:23.929 --> 00:05:23.939 
this one doesn't go quite as high what

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:26.540 
this one doesn't go quite as high what
we're<00:05:24.090> doing<00:05:24.389> is<00:05:24.509> we're<00:05:24.719> duplicating<00:05:25.550> the

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
we're doing is we're duplicating the

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.469 
we're doing is we're duplicating the
pitch<00:05:26.939> here<00:05:27.659> and<00:05:27.840> here<00:05:28.770> so<00:05:28.979> you<00:05:29.039> go<00:05:29.340> about<00:05:30.240> an

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
pitch here and here so you go about an

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:34.550 
pitch here and here so you go about an
inch<00:05:31.610> below<00:05:32.610> the<00:05:32.849> top<00:05:33.599> of<00:05:33.629> the<00:05:33.870> fingerboard<00:05:34.259> if

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
inch below the top of the fingerboard if

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.019 
inch below the top of the fingerboard if
you<00:05:34.650> want<00:05:34.830> to<00:05:34.919> think<00:05:35.099> of<00:05:35.190> it<00:05:35.339> that<00:05:35.370> way<00:05:35.819> and

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:36.029 
you want to think of it that way and

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:40.240 
you want to think of it that way and
then<00:05:36.509> of<00:05:36.599> course<00:05:36.810> you<00:05:36.900> have<00:05:37.050> to<00:05:37.169> use<00:05:37.199> your<00:05:37.529> ears

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.860 

to<00:05:41.250> determine<00:05:41.940> that<00:05:42.270> you're<00:05:42.479> duplicating

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
to determine that you're duplicating

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:48.170 
to determine that you're duplicating
that<00:05:43.529> pitch<00:05:45.620> now<00:05:46.620> let's<00:05:47.490> get<00:05:47.669> to<00:05:47.729> one<00:05:48.000> of<00:05:48.120> the

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
that pitch now let's get to one of the

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.959 
that pitch now let's get to one of the
pitfalls<00:05:48.539> that<00:05:49.319> I<00:05:49.740> found<00:05:50.159> encountered<00:05:50.819> when<00:05:50.940> I

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:50.969 
pitfalls that I found encountered when I

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:54.350 
pitfalls that I found encountered when I
teach<00:05:51.270> this<00:05:51.479> exercise<00:05:52.050> one<00:05:52.469> is<00:05:53.180> that<00:05:54.180> the

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
teach this exercise one is that the

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.589 
teach this exercise one is that the
student<00:05:54.599> begins<00:05:55.560> with<00:05:55.770> the<00:05:55.860> harmonic<00:05:56.599> but

00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:57.599 
student begins with the harmonic but

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:02.959 
student begins with the harmonic but
then<00:05:57.900> they<00:05:58.080> use<00:05:58.319> a<00:05:58.349> glissando<00:05:58.919> technique<00:06:01.969> now

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:02.969 
then they use a glissando technique now

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:06.379 
then they use a glissando technique now
the<00:06:03.029> only<00:06:03.449> reason<00:06:03.750> that's<00:06:04.050> happening<00:06:05.389> is

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:06.389 
the only reason that's happening is

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:08.179 
the only reason that's happening is
because<00:06:06.659> they're<00:06:07.020> not<00:06:07.199> maintaining<00:06:08.009> the

00:06:08.179 --> 00:06:08.189 
because they're not maintaining the

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:10.279 
because they're not maintaining the
lightness<00:06:08.879> in<00:06:09.150> their<00:06:09.509> finger<00:06:09.900> which<00:06:10.080> is<00:06:10.199> of

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:10.289 
lightness in their finger which is of

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:13.360 
lightness in their finger which is of
course<00:06:10.439> what<00:06:10.710> the<00:06:10.740> whole<00:06:10.949> exercise<00:06:11.279> is<00:06:11.520> about

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
course what the whole exercise is about

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.570 
course what the whole exercise is about
you<00:06:14.370> should<00:06:14.789> encounter

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:16.580 
you should encounter

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.510 
you should encounter
all<00:06:17.210> kinds<00:06:17.900> of<00:06:18.020> natural<00:06:18.289> harmonics<00:06:19.189> on<00:06:19.400> the

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
all kinds of natural harmonics on the

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.309 
all kinds of natural harmonics on the
way<00:06:19.639> up<00:06:19.789> to<00:06:20.000> fingerboard<00:06:20.479> which<00:06:21.020> is<00:06:21.199> an

00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:21.319 
way up to fingerboard which is an

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:23.529 
way up to fingerboard which is an
indicator<00:06:21.800> that<00:06:22.069> you're<00:06:22.400> executing<00:06:22.879> the

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:23.539 
indicator that you're executing the

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:33.429 
indicator that you're executing the
exercise<00:06:24.259> in<00:06:24.439> the<00:06:24.530> proper<00:06:24.919> way<00:06:28.780> okay<00:06:31.780> so<00:06:32.780> yes

00:06:33.429 --> 00:06:33.439 
exercise in the proper way okay so yes

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:36.429 
exercise in the proper way okay so yes
the<00:06:33.949> bow<00:06:34.129> technique<00:06:34.550> is<00:06:34.699> important<00:06:35.439> shifting

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:36.439 
the bow technique is important shifting

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:38.559 
the bow technique is important shifting
is<00:06:36.560> important<00:06:37.069> but<00:06:37.219> also<00:06:37.400> you<00:06:37.639> have<00:06:37.789> to<00:06:37.969> listen

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:38.569 
is important but also you have to listen

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:40.480 
is important but also you have to listen
and<00:06:38.780> determine<00:06:39.500> just<00:06:39.620> like<00:06:39.830> you<00:06:40.009> would<00:06:40.250> if<00:06:40.370> you

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.490 
and determine just like you would if you

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.580 
and determine just like you would if you
were<00:06:40.610> listening<00:06:40.789> to<00:06:41.060> intonation<00:06:41.750> or

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:42.590 
were listening to intonation or
