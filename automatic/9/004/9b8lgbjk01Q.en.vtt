knew no one was gonna find it I knew her

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.469 
knew no one was gonna find it I knew her
at<00:01:58.979> foul<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.640> wasn't<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.030> big<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.329> deal

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
at foul so it wasn't that big of a deal

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.969 
at foul so it wasn't that big of a deal

so I went down and the watch was
perfectly<00:02:02.340> fine<00:02:02.430> nothing<00:02:02.969> happened<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.329> it

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
perfectly fine nothing happened to it

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.630 
perfectly fine nothing happened to it

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
cuts in the band probably because it hit

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.240

he<00:02:24.720> has<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.870> pretty<00:02:25.050> solid<00:02:25.350> one<00:02:25.650> but<00:02:26.010> this<00:02:26.160> is

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
he has a pretty solid one but this is

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.040 
he has a pretty solid one but this is
really<00:02:26.460> just<00:02:26.580> kind<00:02:26.910> of<00:02:27.000> an<00:02:27.180> overview<00:02:27.570> and<00:02:27.870> if

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
really just kind of an overview and if

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.760 
really just kind of an overview and if
the<00:02:28.290> watch<00:02:28.440> is<00:02:28.620> worth<00:02:28.800> it<00:02:29.010> in<00:02:29.640> my<00:02:29.850> opinion<00:02:30.770> you

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
the watch is worth it in my opinion you

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.230 
the watch is worth it in my opinion you
can<00:02:31.800> see<00:02:32.100> it's<00:02:32.220> an<00:02:32.340> analogue<00:02:32.730> that's<00:02:33.120> how

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
can see it's an analogue that's how

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.360 
can see it's an analogue that's how
you're<00:02:33.330> going<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.480> tell<00:02:33.630> your<00:02:33.690> time<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:34.950> you

seconds which is pretty cool and do

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.360 
the time the timer and stuff like that
so<00:03:30.240> you<00:03:30.900> definitely<00:03:31.260> have<00:03:31.350> a<00:03:31.380> lot<00:03:31.680> of<00:03:31.710> awesome

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
so you definitely have a lot of awesome

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.900 
so you definitely have a lot of awesome
options<00:03:32.850> on<00:03:32.970> here<00:03:33.210> which<00:03:33.390> I<00:03:33.510> like<00:03:34.790> on<00:03:35.790> the

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
options on here which I like on the

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.130 
options on here which I like on the
watch<00:03:36.090> but<00:03:36.390> you<00:03:36.420> know<00:03:36.630> I<00:03:36.660> don't<00:03:36.750> really<00:03:36.900> use

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
watch but you know I don't really use

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.200 
watch but you know I don't really use
much<00:03:37.350> of<00:03:37.500> it<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:37.830> then<00:03:38.700> over<00:03:38.880> here<00:03:38.910> you<00:03:39.060> have

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 
much of it and then over here you have

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.820 
much of it and then over here you have
all<00:03:39.450> your<00:03:39.600> sets<00:03:39.960> for<00:03:40.110> your<00:03:40.200> stopwatch<00:03:40.410> and

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
all your sets for your stopwatch and

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.500 
all your sets for your stopwatch and
such<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.340> up<00:03:41.490> here<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:41.910> can<00:03:42.090> adjust<00:03:42.180> your

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
such and up here you can adjust your

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.620 
such and up here you can adjust your
time<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:44.370> one<00:03:44.520> thing<00:03:44.670> I<00:03:44.820> II<00:03:44.880> would<00:03:45.330> say<00:03:45.540> I

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
time the one thing I II would say I

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.790 
time the one thing I II would say I
don't<00:03:46.070> necessarily<00:03:47.070> like<00:03:47.370> about<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:48.800> watch

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
don't necessarily like about the watch

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.760 
don't necessarily like about the watch
itself<00:03:50.250> is<00:03:50.720> probably<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.959> light<00:03:52.170> kind<00:03:52.680> of

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
itself is probably the light kind of

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.150 
itself is probably the light kind of
sucks<00:03:53.100> it's<00:03:53.760> like<00:03:53.880> a<00:03:53.910> little<00:03:54.120> LED<00:03:54.600> and<00:03:55.160> it

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
sucks it's like a little LED and it

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.600 
sucks it's like a little LED and it
doesn't

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
doesn't

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.540 
doesn't
I<00:03:56.840> mean<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:58.080> really<00:03:58.260> doesn't<00:03:58.500> glow<00:03:58.920> you<00:03:59.430> know

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
I mean it really doesn't glow you know

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.280 
I mean it really doesn't glow you know
like<00:04:00.090> look<00:04:00.270> at<00:04:00.360> this<00:04:00.480> I<00:04:00.690> mean<00:04:00.810> you<00:04:00.900> can't<00:04:01.170> the

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
like look at this I mean you can't the

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.660 
like look at this I mean you can't the
cool<00:04:01.470> thing<00:04:01.620> is<00:04:01.740> you<00:04:01.770> can<00:04:02.010> keep<00:04:02.040> it<00:04:02.310> on<00:04:02.430> for<00:04:02.610> a

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
cool thing is you can keep it on for a

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.030 
cool thing is you can keep it on for a
longer<00:04:02.910> but<00:04:03.720> what<00:04:04.200> you<00:04:04.320> guys<00:04:04.500> are<00:04:04.650> gonna<00:04:04.740> see

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
longer but what you guys are gonna see

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.600 
longer but what you guys are gonna see
right<00:04:05.250> now<00:04:05.430> is<00:04:05.790> exactly<00:04:06.060> what<00:04:06.330> I<00:04:06.360> see<00:04:07.610> yeah

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
right now is exactly what I see yeah

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.670 
right now is exactly what I see yeah
it's<00:04:08.790> just<00:04:08.880> orange<00:04:09.300> so<00:04:10.080> it's<00:04:10.200> kind<00:04:10.350> of<00:04:10.380> a<00:04:10.470> pain

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
it's just orange so it's kind of a pain

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.270 
it's just orange so it's kind of a pain
I<00:04:11.070> don't<00:04:11.610> really<00:04:11.790> like<00:04:12.030> it<00:04:12.240> but<00:04:12.420> I<00:04:13.250> kind<00:04:14.250> of

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
I don't really like it but I kind of

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.000 
I don't really like it but I kind of
wish<00:04:14.430> I<00:04:14.459> had<00:04:14.580> the<00:04:14.700> black<00:04:14.910> back<00:04:15.540> glow<00:04:16.140> instead

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
wish I had the black back glow instead

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.349 
wish I had the black back glow instead
of<00:04:17.160> this<00:04:17.340> but<00:04:17.670> you<00:04:17.970> know<00:04:18.060> what<00:04:18.150> are<00:04:18.209> you<00:04:18.270> gonna

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
of this but you know what are you gonna

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.080 
of this but you know what are you gonna
do<00:04:19.040> typically<00:04:20.040> I<00:04:20.160> don't<00:04:20.250> need<00:04:20.640> to<00:04:20.700> look<00:04:20.850> at<00:04:20.970> it

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
do typically I don't need to look at it

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.540 
do typically I don't need to look at it
at<00:04:21.239> night<00:04:21.660> but<00:04:22.410> when<00:04:22.560> I<00:04:22.590> do<00:04:22.680> it<00:04:22.950> does<00:04:23.280> give<00:04:23.430> me

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
at night but when I do it does give me

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.240 
at night but when I do it does give me
enough<00:04:23.790> light<00:04:24.090> that<00:04:24.300> I<00:04:24.330> can<00:04:24.600> see<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.710> time

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
enough light that I can see the time

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.129 
enough light that I can see the time
something<00:04:27.820> cold<00:04:28.000> I<00:04:28.210> would<00:04:28.360> like<00:04:28.480> to<00:04:28.600> point<00:04:28.840> out

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
something cold I would like to point out

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:33.600 
something cold I would like to point out
that<00:04:29.470> is<00:04:29.680> kind<00:04:30.250> of<00:04:30.370> a<00:04:30.600> miniscule<00:04:31.980> feature<00:04:32.980> is

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
that is kind of a miniscule feature is

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.890 
that is kind of a miniscule feature is
in<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:34.389> back<00:04:34.630> here<00:04:34.960> look<00:04:35.290> at<00:04:35.410> the<00:04:35.530> background

let me point out it here any type of

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.020 
let me point out it here any type of
pointer<00:04:43.660> but<00:04:44.040> look<00:04:45.040> at<00:04:45.160> the<00:04:45.310> background<00:04:45.820> right

here here here here it has a really cool
almost<00:04:50.380> like<00:04:50.590> a<00:04:50.620> frag<00:04:51.220> type<00:04:51.669> of<00:04:51.820> pattern<00:04:52.180> on<00:04:52.300> it

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
almost like a frag type of pattern on it

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.500 
almost like a frag type of pattern on it
looks<00:04:54.250> really<00:04:54.550> nice<00:04:54.700> and<00:04:54.760> it<00:04:54.970> adds<00:04:55.120> a<00:04:55.210> really

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
looks really nice and it adds a really

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.570 
looks really nice and it adds a really
cool<00:04:55.720> accent<00:04:56.230> to<00:04:56.290> the<00:04:56.320> watch<00:04:56.530> and<00:04:57.070> you<00:04:57.250> can<00:04:57.400> see

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
cool accent to the watch and you can see

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.000 
cool accent to the watch and you can see
here<00:04:57.820> all<00:04:57.970> the<00:04:58.090> dials<00:04:58.510> or<00:04:58.810> not<00:04:59.410> the<00:04:59.500> dials<00:04:59.830> but

you<00:05:07.840> can<00:05:08.020> see<00:05:08.200> there<00:05:08.380> it<00:05:08.620> is<00:05:08.680> waterproof<00:05:09.130> I

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
you can see there it is waterproof I

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.290 
you can see there it is waterproof I
don't<00:05:09.970> know<00:05:10.060> how<00:05:10.180> deep<00:05:11.790> however<00:05:12.790> deep<00:05:13.060> you

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
don't know how deep however deep you

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.900 
don't know how deep however deep you
want<00:05:13.510> it<00:05:13.660> how<00:05:13.870> about<00:05:13.930> that<00:05:14.280> now<00:05:15.280> not<00:05:15.550> really

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
want it how about that now not really

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.090 
want it how about that now not really
but<00:05:16.570> you<00:05:16.810> can<00:05:17.020> probably<00:05:17.230> deep<00:05:17.470> I<00:05:17.680> would<00:05:17.860> say

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
but you can probably deep I would say

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.700 
but you can probably deep I would say
you're<00:05:19.000> safe<00:05:19.210> at<00:05:19.390> 100<00:05:19.690> meters<00:05:19.960> but<00:05:19.990> typically

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
you're safe at 100 meters but typically

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.950 
you're safe at 100 meters but typically
if<00:05:21.190> you're<00:05:21.910> thinking<00:05:22.150> about<00:05:22.330> an<00:05:22.390> actual<00:05:22.630> dive

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
if you're thinking about an actual dive

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.480 
if you're thinking about an actual dive
watch<00:05:23.260> you're<00:05:23.680> probably<00:05:23.979> gonna<00:05:24.190> get<00:05:24.370> an

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
watch you're probably gonna get an

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.170

pretty<00:05:43.930> affordable<00:05:44.229> I<00:05:44.500> think<00:05:44.620> it's<00:05:44.710> like<00:05:44.800> 100

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
pretty affordable I think it's like 100

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.700 
pretty affordable I think it's like 100
bucks<00:05:45.310> or<00:05:45.490> something<00:05:46.200> you<00:05:47.200> can<00:05:47.289> see<00:05:47.470> there

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
bucks or something you can see there

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.000 
bucks or something you can see there
it's<00:05:48.070> has<00:05:48.580> the<00:05:48.789> dual<00:05:49.270> holes<00:05:49.810> which<00:05:50.740> looks

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
it's has the dual holes which looks

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.450 
it's has the dual holes which looks
coming<00:05:51.660> unique<00:05:52.660> and<00:05:52.990> kind<00:05:53.410> of<00:05:53.530> stays<00:05:54.010> true<00:05:54.430> to

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
coming unique and kind of stays true to

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.370 
coming unique and kind of stays true to
the<00:05:54.820> G<00:05:55.360> shocks<00:05:55.600> which<00:05:56.350> I<00:05:56.470> like<00:05:56.669> and<00:05:58.289> that's<00:05:59.289> a

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
the G shocks which I like and that's a

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.990 
the G shocks which I like and that's a
good<00:05:59.500> contrast<00:05:59.979> overall<00:06:00.370> you<00:06:00.640> know<00:06:00.729> I<00:06:00.760> thought

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
good contrast overall you know I thought

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.430 
good contrast overall you know I thought
it<00:06:01.120> was<00:06:01.210> gonna<00:06:01.300> be<00:06:01.390> all<00:06:01.600> blocked<00:06:01.990> out<00:06:02.200> but

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 
it was gonna be all blocked out but

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.600 
it was gonna be all blocked out but
turned<00:06:02.800> out<00:06:02.890> to<00:06:03.010> have<00:06:03.070> a<00:06:03.160> little<00:06:03.370> bit<00:06:03.460> more

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
turned out to have a little bit more

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.100 
turned out to have a little bit more
sober<00:06:03.880> than<00:06:04.120> I<00:06:04.210> thought<00:06:04.419> so<00:06:04.690> you<00:06:04.750> have<00:06:04.870> silver

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
sober than I thought so you have silver

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.880 
sober than I thought so you have silver
here<00:06:05.350> so<00:06:05.620> they're<00:06:05.919> silver<00:06:06.450> silver<00:06:07.500> silver<00:06:08.500> and

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:08.890 
here so they're silver silver silver and

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.430 
here so they're silver silver silver and
white<00:06:09.789> which<00:06:10.510> I<00:06:10.660> guess<00:06:10.810> you<00:06:10.840> can<00:06:11.110> consider

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 
white which I guess you can consider

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.409 
white which I guess you can consider
silver<00:06:11.860> if<00:06:11.979> you<00:06:12.130> wish<00:06:12.310> you<00:06:13.090> know<00:06:13.180> but<00:06:13.300> your
