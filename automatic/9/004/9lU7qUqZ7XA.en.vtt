hi everyone
Kremlin<00:00:06.270> here<00:00:06.629> for<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:06.870> techies<00:00:07.259> today<00:00:07.980> I'm

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
Kremlin here for the techies today I'm

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.129 
Kremlin here for the techies today I'm
going<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.429> be<00:00:08.610> showing<00:00:08.849> you<00:00:09.120> how<00:00:09.389> to<00:00:09.420> use<00:00:09.750> the

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
going to be showing you how to use the

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.259 
going to be showing you how to use the
havoc<00:00:10.590> reactor<00:00:11.130> in<00:00:11.370> 3ds<00:00:12.120> max<00:00:12.769> so<00:00:13.910> our<00:00:14.910> project

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
havoc reactor in 3ds max so our project

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.450 
havoc reactor in 3ds max so our project
is<00:00:15.660> going<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:15.929> be<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.320> make<00:00:16.440> these<00:00:16.650> six<00:00:17.070> spheres

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
is going to be to make these six spheres

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.310 
is going to be to make these six spheres
right<00:00:17.760> here<00:00:18.029> we're<00:00:18.359> going<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.570> want<00:00:18.779> them<00:00:19.050> to

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
right here we're going to want them to

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.980 
right here we're going to want them to
roll<00:00:19.680> down<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:20.130> ramp<00:00:20.369> into<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.449> blue<00:00:21.720> bowl

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
roll down the ramp into the blue bowl

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.480 
roll down the ramp into the blue bowl
right<00:00:22.289> here<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.710> then<00:00:22.980> we're<00:00:23.160> going<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.310> make

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
right here and then we're going to make

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.150 
right here and then we're going to make
the<00:00:23.670> ball<00:00:23.820> move<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.420> drop<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.869> spheres<00:00:25.260> into

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
the ball move and drop the spheres into

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.599 
the ball move and drop the spheres into
the<00:00:26.430> box<00:00:26.789> over<00:00:27.300> here<00:00:27.769> so<00:00:28.769> as<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.460> might

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
the box over here so as you might

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.690 
the box over here so as you might
imagine<00:00:29.760> if<00:00:30.330> we<00:00:30.539> tried<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:31.340> recreate<00:00:32.340> all

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
imagine if we tried to recreate all

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.420 
imagine if we tried to recreate all
these<00:00:32.880> animations<00:00:33.450> by<00:00:33.660> hand<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.860> would<00:00:34.980> first

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
these animations by hand it would first

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.880 
these animations by hand it would first
of<00:00:35.550> all<00:00:35.670> be<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:36.059> very<00:00:36.510> tedious<00:00:36.809> process<00:00:37.079> it

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
of all be a very tedious process it

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.770 
of all be a very tedious process it
would<00:00:37.980> take<00:00:38.250> an<00:00:38.399> enormous<00:00:39.030> amount<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.600> time

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
would take an enormous amount of time

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.410 
would take an enormous amount of time
and<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:41.010> won't<00:00:41.129> look<00:00:41.309> very<00:00:41.370> realistic<00:00:42.030> as

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
and it won't look very realistic as

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.650 
and it won't look very realistic as
we're<00:00:42.600> trying<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:43.079> simulate<00:00:44.040> real-world

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
we're trying to simulate real-world

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.869 
we're trying to simulate real-world
forces<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:46.260> instead<00:00:46.649> we're<00:00:47.039> gonna<00:00:47.100> use<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
forces so instead we're gonna use the

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.290 
forces so instead we're gonna use the
reactor<00:00:48.770> the<00:00:49.770> havoc<00:00:50.129> reactor<00:00:50.670> which<00:00:50.969> can<00:00:51.180> be

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
reactor the havoc reactor which can be

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.310 
reactor the havoc reactor which can be
found<00:00:51.539> under<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.079> utilities<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:54.020> right<00:00:55.020> here

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
found under the utilities and right here

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.229 
found under the utilities and right here
so<00:00:55.770> you're<00:00:56.010> gonna<00:00:56.160> want<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.520> open<00:00:56.550> up<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
so you're gonna want to open up the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.660 
so you're gonna want to open up the
preview<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.989> animation<00:00:58.620> tab<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.280> havoc

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
preview and animation tab and the havoc

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.580 
preview and animation tab and the havoc
1<00:01:00.449> world

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
1 world

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.189 
1 world
tab<00:01:02.190> that'll<00:01:02.879> be<00:01:03.000> very<00:01:03.030> useful<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.750> also

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199

tab that'll be very useful and also
you're<00:01:04.680> gonna<00:01:05.070> want<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.400> have<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.939> toolbar

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
you're gonna want to have this toolbar

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.780 
you're gonna want to have this toolbar
up<00:01:06.630> here<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:07.140> reactor<00:01:07.619> toolbar<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.280> right

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
up here the reactor toolbar so right

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.550 
up here the reactor toolbar so right
click<00:01:08.970> up<00:01:09.180> here<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.510> make<00:01:09.659> sure<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.020> reactor

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
click up here and make sure that reactor

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.830 
click up here and make sure that reactor
is<00:01:10.619> selected<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.729> you'll<00:01:11.909> get<00:01:12.299> this<00:01:12.450> toolbar

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
is selected and you'll get this toolbar

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.859 
is selected and you'll get this toolbar
right<00:01:12.930> here<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:14.010> first<00:01:14.909> thing<00:01:15.299> we<00:01:15.450> need<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.630> do

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
right here so first thing we need to do

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.320 
right here so first thing we need to do
is<00:01:16.409> select<00:01:16.710> everything<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.610> make<00:01:17.850> sure<00:01:17.880> that

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
is select everything and make sure that

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.840 
is select everything and make sure that
the<00:01:18.780> forces<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.409> physics<00:01:19.560> apply<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.400> to

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
the forces of physics apply to it to

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.240 
the forces of physics apply to it to
make<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.540> happen<00:01:21.750> we're<00:01:22.110> gonna<00:01:22.170> press<00:01:22.590> this

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
make that happen we're gonna press this

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.179 
make that happen we're gonna press this
create<00:01:24.000> rigidbody<00:01:24.720> collection<00:01:25.229> button<00:01:25.439> and

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
create rigidbody collection button and

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.590 
create rigidbody collection button and
we'll<00:01:26.310> get<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.580> symbol<00:01:26.939> right<00:01:27.030> here<00:01:27.090> we<00:01:27.450> can

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
we'll get this symbol right here we can

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.140 
we'll get this symbol right here we can
just<00:01:27.630> move<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.350> out<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.650> way<00:01:28.799> now

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
just move that out of the way now

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.030 
just move that out of the way now
alright<00:01:30.150> now<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.689> forces<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.409> physics<00:01:31.530> apply

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
alright now the forces of physics apply

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.969 
alright now the forces of physics apply
now<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.090> make<00:01:33.360> these<00:01:33.570> drop<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.439> balls<00:01:34.680> and

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
now to make these drop the balls and

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.039 
now to make these drop the balls and
specific<00:01:35.579> specifically<00:01:36.420> I'm<00:01:36.810> going<00:01:36.990> to

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
specific specifically I'm going to

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.620 
specific specifically I'm going to
select<00:01:37.320> them<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.860> we're<00:01:38.700> going<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.880> go<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.119> the

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
select them and we're going to go to the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.219 
select them and we're going to go to the
property<00:01:40.590> editor<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.250> we're<00:01:42.180> gonna<00:01:42.329> set<00:01:43.049> the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
property editor and we're gonna set the

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.880 
property editor and we're gonna set the
master<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.829> alright<00:01:44.280> that's<00:01:44.549> good<00:01:44.790> there<00:01:45.030> and

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
master to alright that's good there and

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.609 
master to alright that's good there and
elasticity<00:01:46.890> maybe<00:01:47.759> point<00:01:48.149> two<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.810> just<00:01:49.140> set

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
elasticity maybe point two and just set

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.270 
elasticity maybe point two and just set
friction<00:01:50.460> at<00:01:50.610> 0.5<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.869> think<00:01:52.829> that'd<00:01:52.979> be<00:01:53.100> good

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
friction at 0.5 I think that'd be good

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.510 
friction at 0.5 I think that'd be good
and<00:01:53.850> um<00:01:54.350> that's<00:01:55.350> all<00:01:55.649> we<00:01:55.829> need<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.009> do<00:01:56.250> for<00:01:56.460> the

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
and um that's all we need to do for the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.330 
and um that's all we need to do for the
spheres<00:01:56.909> now<00:01:57.689> for<00:01:57.960> all<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.290> others<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:59.219> want

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
spheres now for all the others you want

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.550 
spheres now for all the others you want
to<00:01:59.520> select<00:01:59.729> them<00:02:00.060> all<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:01.049> want<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.350> make<00:02:01.530> sure

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
to select them all you want to make sure

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.240

that they are selected as the concave

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.150 
that they are selected as the concave

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
the ramp here if you take a look at it

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.750 
the ramp here if you take a look at it
closely<00:02:14.590> it's<00:02:15.010> indented<00:02:15.540> right<00:02:16.540> there<00:02:17.760> the

that<00:02:26.740> one<00:02:26.950> option<00:02:27.180> so<00:02:28.860> yeah

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
that one option so yeah

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.070 
that one option so yeah
let's<00:02:30.430> make<00:02:30.670> sure<00:02:30.700> that<00:02:31.030> that's<00:02:31.390> selected

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
let's make sure that that's selected

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.100 
let's make sure that that's selected
once<00:02:32.320> more<00:02:33.060> there<00:02:34.060> we<00:02:34.150> go<00:02:34.300> and<00:02:34.630> we<00:02:34.780> want<00:02:35.020> to

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
once more there we go and we want to

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.830 
once more there we go and we want to
leave<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.530> mass<00:02:35.800> at<00:02:36.160> zero<00:02:36.670> since<00:02:37.420> we<00:02:37.630> don't

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
leave the mass at zero since we don't

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.630 
leave the mass at zero since we don't
want<00:02:38.020> these<00:02:38.170> to<00:02:38.380> be<00:02:38.470> affected<00:02:38.890> by<00:02:39.040> gravity<00:02:39.070> we

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
want these to be affected by gravity we

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.280 
want these to be affected by gravity we
just<00:02:39.910> want<00:02:40.090> them<00:02:40.270> further<00:02:40.510> collisions<00:02:41.110> with

play and there you go

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.570 
play and there you go
these<00:03:27.850> balls<00:03:28.209> drop<00:03:28.540> in<00:03:28.780> to<00:03:29.110> the<00:03:29.380> bowl<00:03:30.280> and

these balls drop in to the bowl and

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.360 
these balls drop in to the bowl and
there<00:03:31.480> we<00:03:31.570> go<00:03:31.690> they<00:03:31.959> stay<00:03:32.200> there<00:03:32.380> they<00:03:32.620> don't

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
there we go they stay there they don't

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.340 
there we go they stay there they don't
fall<00:03:33.580> through<00:03:33.850> and<00:03:34.140> everything<00:03:35.140> is

fall through and everything is

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.560 
fall through and everything is
calculated<00:03:35.740> by<00:03:36.220> the<00:03:36.280> computer<00:03:36.490> you<00:03:37.420> don't

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
calculated by the computer you don't

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.500 
calculated by the computer you don't
have<00:03:37.750> to<00:03:37.900> do<00:03:38.020> any<00:03:38.410> animation<00:03:39.130> at<00:03:39.250> all<00:03:39.510> except

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
have to do any animation at all except

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.330 
have to do any animation at all except
for<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.720> bolt<00:03:40.900> movement<00:03:41.260> which<00:03:41.440> we're<00:03:41.680> gonna

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
for the bolt movement which we're gonna

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.250 
for the bolt movement which we're gonna
do<00:03:42.580> right<00:03:42.760> now<00:03:42.930> so<00:03:44.850> to<00:03:45.850> gauge<00:03:46.240> when<00:03:46.720> we<00:03:46.930> want<00:03:47.170> to

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
do right now so to gauge when we want to

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.770 
do right now so to gauge when we want to
start<00:03:47.680> moving<00:03:48.340> this<00:03:48.640> bowl<00:03:48.940> we're<00:03:49.180> going<00:03:49.270> to<00:03:49.330> go

start moving this bowl we're going to go

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.830 
start moving this bowl we're going to go
ahead<00:03:49.900> and<00:03:50.200> want<00:03:50.350> to<00:03:50.820> create<00:03:51.820> animation<00:03:52.630> which

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
ahead and want to create animation which

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.720 
ahead and want to create animation which
is<00:03:52.870> above<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:53.410> preview<00:03:53.800> and<00:03:53.920> window<00:03:54.250> button

workspace<00:04:08.110> right<00:04:08.709> here<00:04:09.010> and<00:04:09.190> as<00:04:10.150> I<00:04:10.390> said<00:04:10.450> it

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
workspace right here and as I said it

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.650 
workspace right here and as I said it
might<00:04:11.050> take<00:04:11.440> a<00:04:11.470> bit<00:04:11.709> of<00:04:11.770> time<00:04:12.160> so<00:04:12.580> uh<00:04:12.660> fastest

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
might take a bit of time so uh fastest

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.449 
might take a bit of time so uh fastest

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
this part forward all right so it has

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.940 
this part forward all right so it has
been<00:04:18.700> completed<00:04:19.210> now<00:04:20.080> if<00:04:20.410> you<00:04:20.560> move<00:04:20.739> this

been completed now if you move this
track<00:04:21.280> over<00:04:21.489> here<00:04:21.609> we<00:04:21.970> can<00:04:22.090> see<00:04:22.270> this<00:04:22.419> balls

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
track over here we can see this balls

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.810 
track over here we can see this balls
roll<00:04:23.020> and<00:04:23.320> then

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
roll and then

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.540 
roll and then
stop<00:04:24.270> in<00:04:24.510> the<00:04:24.630> bowl<00:04:24.780> right<00:04:24.990> here<00:04:25.020> so<00:04:25.980> we<00:04:26.400> want

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
on such a key I want to set that at zero

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.140 
on such a key I want to set that at zero
just<00:04:36.900> for<00:04:37.200> safety<00:04:37.740> I<00:04:37.770> like<00:04:37.980> to<00:04:38.130> do<00:04:38.250> that<00:04:38.490> all

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
just for safety I like to do that all

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.050 
just for safety I like to do that all
right<00:04:39.240> and<00:04:39.690> now<00:04:40.410> we<00:04:40.440> can<00:04:40.980> start<00:04:41.310> moving<00:04:41.700> this

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
right and now we can start moving this

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.670 
right and now we can start moving this
guy<00:04:42.240> up<00:04:42.620> set<00:04:43.620> it<00:04:43.650> at<00:04:43.830> a<00:04:43.860> hundred

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
guy up set it at a hundred

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.960 
guy up set it at a hundred
this<00:04:46.680> guy<00:04:46.920> over<00:04:47.070> here<00:04:47.220> and<00:04:49.340> it's<00:04:50.340> okay<00:04:50.700> that

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
this guy over here and it's okay that

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.020 
this guy over here and it's okay that
the<00:04:51.060> balls<00:04:51.270> are<00:04:51.480> still<00:04:51.600> right<00:04:51.870> there<00:04:52.110> since

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
the balls are still right there since

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.960 
the balls are still right there since
the<00:04:54.030> reactor<00:04:54.540> is<00:04:54.660> not<00:04:55.340> updated<00:04:56.340> automatically

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
the reactor is not updated automatically

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.770 
the reactor is not updated automatically
we'll<00:04:57.240> have<00:04:57.450> to<00:04:57.600> take<00:04:57.780> that<00:04:57.930> into<00:04:58.200> account<00:04:58.290> and

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
we'll have to take that into account and

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.800 
we'll have to take that into account and
okay<00:05:00.780> that<00:05:01.200> looks<00:05:01.380> good<00:05:01.680> and<00:05:02.630> set<00:05:03.630> another

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
okay that looks good and set another

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.560 
okay that looks good and set another
keyframe<00:05:04.080> for<00:05:04.560> safety<00:05:05.040> and<00:05:05.370> we'll<00:05:06.150> make<00:05:06.360> this

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
keyframe for safety and we'll make this

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:13.820 
keyframe for safety and we'll make this
guy<00:05:06.780> tip<00:05:07.560> over<00:05:07.950> into<00:05:10.370> here<00:05:11.370> and<00:05:12.680> let's<00:05:13.680> go

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
guy tip over into here and let's go

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.020 
guy tip over into here and let's go
ahead<00:05:13.920> and<00:05:14.160> move<00:05:14.910> it<00:05:15.090> a<00:05:15.330> bit<00:05:15.900> further<00:05:16.410> in<00:05:17.030> there

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
ahead and move it a bit further in there

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.360 
ahead and move it a bit further in there
we<00:05:18.180> go<00:05:18.330> so<00:05:19.200> there<00:05:19.320> we<00:05:19.440> go<00:05:19.500> the<00:05:19.830> bowl<00:05:20.070> is<00:05:20.190> gonna

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
we go so there we go the bowl is gonna

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.880 
we go so there we go the bowl is gonna
move<00:05:20.640> over<00:05:20.970> here<00:05:21.120> and<00:05:21.690> then<00:05:21.990> dump<00:05:22.320> into<00:05:22.590> the

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
move over here and then dump into the

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.970 
move over here and then dump into the
box<00:05:23.660> let's<00:05:24.660> go<00:05:24.810> ahead<00:05:24.930> and<00:05:25.290> create<00:05:25.710> the

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
box let's go ahead and create the

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.040 
box let's go ahead and create the
animation<00:05:26.310> of<00:05:26.730> this<00:05:26.910> and<00:05:27.180> we'll<00:05:27.720> see<00:05:27.930> how<00:05:27.990> it

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
animation of this and we'll see how it

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.370 
animation of this and we'll see how it
looks<00:05:28.290> all<00:05:29.010> right<00:05:29.070> it<00:05:29.370> is<00:05:29.700> done<00:05:30.060> so<00:05:30.270> let's<00:05:31.200> see

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
looks all right it is done so let's see

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.620 
looks all right it is done so let's see
how<00:05:31.560> it<00:05:31.650> looks<00:05:31.860> you<00:05:32.160> can<00:05:32.940> see<00:05:33.120> that<00:05:33.240> the<00:05:33.390> balls

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
how it looks you can see that the balls

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.320 
how it looks you can see that the balls
drop<00:05:33.870> into<00:05:34.320> the<00:05:34.410> bowl<00:05:34.650> bowl<00:05:35.400> starts<00:05:35.910> moving

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
drop into the bowl bowl starts moving

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.200 
drop into the bowl bowl starts moving
the<00:05:36.480> balls<00:05:36.720> move<00:05:37.110> move<00:05:37.560> with<00:05:37.890> it<00:05:38.120> and<00:05:39.120> it

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
the balls move move with it and it

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.420 
the balls move move with it and it
starts<00:05:39.570> tipping<00:05:39.990> let's<00:05:40.200> get<00:05:40.440> a<00:05:40.470> better<00:05:40.920> angle

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
starts tipping let's get a better angle

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.670 
starts tipping let's get a better angle
on<00:05:41.520> that<00:05:42.980> bowls<00:05:43.980> tips<00:05:44.760> and<00:05:45.290> then<00:05:46.290> the<00:05:46.500> balls

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
on that bowls tips and then the balls

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.540 
on that bowls tips and then the balls
fall<00:05:47.070> in<00:05:47.960> all<00:05:48.960> right<00:05:49.140> now<00:05:49.800> you<00:05:49.860> might<00:05:50.400> have

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
fall in all right now you might have

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.890 
fall in all right now you might have
noticed<00:05:51.090> that<00:05:52.820> when<00:05:53.820> the<00:05:53.850> balls<00:05:54.180> were<00:05:54.420> rolling

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
noticed that when the balls were rolling

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.790 
noticed that when the balls were rolling
on<00:05:55.140> the<00:05:55.650> ramp<00:05:56.450> you<00:05:57.450> can<00:05:57.600> see<00:05:57.900> that<00:05:58.080> there<00:05:58.440> is

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
on the ramp you can see that there is

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.150 
on the ramp you can see that there is
actually<00:05:59.520> quite<00:05:59.820> a<00:05:59.850> bit<00:06:00.060> of<00:06:00.180> space<00:06:00.630> in<00:06:00.660> between

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 
actually quite a bit of space in between

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.800 
actually quite a bit of space in between
the<00:06:02.160> spheres<00:06:02.220> and<00:06:02.700> the<00:06:02.910> ramp<00:06:03.120> as<00:06:03.360> you<00:06:03.540> can<00:06:03.660> see

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
the spheres and the ramp as you can see

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:10.220 
the spheres and the ramp as you can see
right<00:06:03.990> there<00:06:04.290> now<00:06:05.070> that<00:06:05.430> is<00:06:06.620> used<00:06:07.620> for<00:06:09.230> just

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.230 
right there now that is used for just

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.390 
right there now that is used for just
safety<00:06:10.860> so<00:06:11.310> that<00:06:11.550> on<00:06:11.730> if<00:06:12.120> the<00:06:12.780> balls<00:06:13.260> if<00:06:13.620> the<00:06:14.130> if

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
safety so that on if the balls if the if

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.340 
safety so that on if the balls if the if
the<00:06:14.580> force<00:06:14.820> is<00:06:14.880> too<00:06:15.000> great<00:06:15.450> the<00:06:15.810> spheres<00:06:16.170> will

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:16.350 
the force is too great the spheres will

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.890 
the force is too great the spheres will
actually<00:06:16.680> end<00:06:16.860> up<00:06:17.010> going<00:06:17.610> through<00:06:18.090> the<00:06:18.210> object

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 
actually end up going through the object

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.230 
actually end up going through the object
and<00:06:19.050> they<00:06:19.260> will<00:06:19.440> just<00:06:19.620> kind<00:06:19.830> of<00:06:19.940> treat<00:06:20.940> it<00:06:21.090> as

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
and they will just kind of treat it as

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.660 
and they will just kind of treat it as
it's<00:06:21.450> not<00:06:21.630> as<00:06:21.930> if<00:06:22.140> it's<00:06:22.290> not<00:06:22.470> there<00:06:22.890> so<00:06:23.610> to

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:23.670 
it's not as if it's not there so to

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.210 
it's not as if it's not there so to
negate<00:06:24.090> that<00:06:24.120> since<00:06:24.630> we<00:06:24.750> don't<00:06:24.900> have<00:06:25.020> any

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220 
negate that since we don't have any

so<00:06:47.880> I'm<00:06:48.270> not<00:06:48.330> gonna<00:06:48.510> render<00:06:48.840> this<00:06:49.140> again<00:06:49.410> you

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:49.710 
so I'm not gonna render this again you

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.290 
so I'm not gonna render this again you
get<00:06:49.860> the<00:06:49.980> gist<00:06:50.220> of<00:06:50.400> what<00:06:50.460> I'm<00:06:50.700> saying

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780 
and there you go that's pretty much all

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.440 
and there you go that's pretty much all
there<00:06:54.990> is<00:06:55.020> to<00:06:55.140> rigid<00:06:55.950> bodies<00:06:56.400> there's<00:06:57.090> a<00:06:57.210> whole

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:57.450 
there is to rigid bodies there's a whole

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.990 
there is to rigid bodies there's a whole
lot<00:06:57.690> whole<00:06:58.170> lot<00:06:58.590> more<00:06:58.830> that<00:06:59.040> you<00:06:59.160> can<00:06:59.310> do<00:06:59.490> with

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 
lot whole lot more that you can do with

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.110 
lot whole lot more that you can do with
reactor<00:07:00.690> but<00:07:01.440> um<00:07:01.620> this<00:07:02.220> is<00:07:02.370> just<00:07:02.610> the<00:07:02.700> basics

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 
reactor but um this is just the basics

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.590 
reactor but um this is just the basics
and<00:07:03.360> it's<00:07:03.540> a<00:07:03.690> good<00:07:04.130> starting<00:07:05.130> point<00:07:05.370> for

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:05.600 
and it's a good starting point for
