00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
you might have expected it's actually

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
there wasn't a safety issue actually it

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.649 
there wasn't a safety issue actually it
meant<00:01:23.890> that<00:01:23.979> we<00:01:24.159> got<00:01:24.340> a<00:01:24.369> lot<00:01:24.609> of<00:01:24.640> coverage<00:01:25.359> and

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
meant that we got a lot of coverage and

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.870 
meant that we got a lot of coverage and
increased<00:01:25.990> awareness<00:01:26.280> but<00:01:27.280> also<00:01:27.399> that<00:01:27.789> our

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
increased awareness but also that our

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.910 
increased awareness but also that our
customers<00:01:28.119> were<00:01:28.570> were<00:01:28.929> happy<00:01:29.229> continuing<00:01:29.770> to

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
customers were were happy continuing to

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.739 
customers were were happy continuing to
travel<00:01:30.399> with<00:01:30.520> us<00:01:30.549> so<00:01:30.880> we've<00:01:31.299> actually<00:01:31.450> seen

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:31.749 
travel with us so we've actually seen

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:34.080 
travel with us so we've actually seen
more<00:01:31.990> business<00:01:32.350> rather<00:01:32.530> than<00:01:32.679> last<00:01:32.950> I<00:01:33.219> think

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
more business rather than last I think

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.569 
more business rather than last I think
it's<00:01:34.479> fair<00:01:34.659> say<00:01:34.869> the<00:01:34.990> media's<00:01:35.289> portrayal<00:01:36.039> of

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
it's fair say the media's portrayal of

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:38.849 
it's fair say the media's portrayal of
the<00:01:36.759> recall<00:01:36.969> has<00:01:37.329> been<00:01:37.570> a<00:01:37.780> lot<00:01:38.439> more<00:01:38.590> than<00:01:38.649> it

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:38.859 
the recall has been a lot more than it

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:40.289 
the recall has been a lot more than it
would<00:01:38.979> have<00:01:39.100> been<00:01:39.189> with<00:01:39.340> another<00:01:39.609> car<00:01:39.880> maker<00:01:40.149> I

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
would have been with another car maker I

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.260 
would have been with another car maker I
think<00:01:40.600> because<00:01:40.749> Toyota's<00:01:41.320> up<00:01:41.439> on<00:01:41.560> a<00:01:41.590> pedestal

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
think because Toyota's up on a pedestal

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.510 
think because Toyota's up on a pedestal
for<00:01:43.289> reliability<00:01:44.289> safety<00:01:44.770> and<00:01:45.100> also<00:01:45.340> what

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
for reliability safety and also what

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.639 
for reliability safety and also what
it's<00:01:45.670> doing<00:01:45.909> about<00:01:46.030> climate<00:01:46.509> change<00:01:46.649> and

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
it's doing about climate change and

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.499 
it's doing about climate change and
because<00:01:48.100> there<00:01:48.340> was<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:48.789> previous<00:01:48.999> recall

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
because there was the previous recall

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.599 
because there was the previous recall
with<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.689> accelerator<00:01:50.200> pedals<00:01:50.649> I<00:01:50.829> think<00:01:51.429> the

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:51.609 
with the accelerator pedals I think the

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:53.940 
with the accelerator pedals I think the
Prius<00:01:51.969> issue<00:01:52.179> became<00:01:53.109> much<00:01:53.350> more<00:01:53.380> of<00:01:53.649> a<00:01:53.740> story

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
Prius issue became much more of a story

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.940 
Prius issue became much more of a story
than<00:01:54.280> than<00:01:54.579> it<00:01:54.729> really<00:01:54.880> was<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:56.140> think<00:01:56.799> that's

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
than than it really was I think that's

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.649 
than than it really was I think that's
understandable<00:01:57.579> that's<00:01:57.909> that's<00:01:58.299> the<00:01:58.450> way<00:01:58.539> the

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
understandable that's that's the way the

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.480 
understandable that's that's the way the
press<00:01:58.840> works<00:01:59.049> I<00:01:59.229> guess<00:01:59.439> but<00:01:59.979> in<00:02:00.100> terms<00:02:00.130> of

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
press works I guess but in terms of

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.340 
press works I guess but in terms of
actually<00:02:00.909> the<00:02:01.329> significance<00:02:01.960> of<00:02:02.079> the<00:02:02.200> issue

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
actually the significance of the issue

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.129 
actually the significance of the issue
it's<00:02:02.679> certainly<00:02:03.299> given<00:02:04.299> a<00:02:04.359> lot<00:02:04.539> more<00:02:04.659> coverage

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:05.139 
it's certainly given a lot more coverage

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:07.440 
it's certainly given a lot more coverage
than<00:02:05.170> you<00:02:05.649> would<00:02:05.770> have<00:02:05.859> expected<00:02:06.159> the<00:02:07.060> recall

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
than you would have expected the recall

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.449 
than you would have expected the recall
