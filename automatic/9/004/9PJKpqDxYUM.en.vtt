in terms of the impact that it will have
on<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.990> environment<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.650> risk<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.400> bird

on the environment the risk of bird

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.340 
on the environment the risk of bird
strike<00:01:18.090> which<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.619> significant<00:01:20.299> and<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
strike which is significant and and the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.289 
strike which is significant and and the
economics<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.040> just<00:01:23.220> don't<00:01:23.369> stack<00:01:23.640> up<00:01:23.670> it

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
economics that just don't stack up it

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.300 
economics that just don't stack up it
seems<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.630> be<00:01:24.750> an<00:01:25.170> idea<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.650> gets<00:01:25.860> recycled

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
seems to be an idea that gets recycled

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.440 
seems to be an idea that gets recycled
and<00:01:26.790> crops<00:01:27.450> up<00:01:27.720> fairly<00:01:28.650> regularly<00:01:29.190> and<00:01:30.180> it's<00:01:30.360> a

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
and crops up fairly regularly and it's a

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.610 
and crops up fairly regularly and it's a
worry<00:01:30.660> for<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.900> people<00:01:31.230> on<00:01:31.410> the<00:01:31.500> who

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
worry for the people on the who

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.310 
worry for the people on the who
Peninsula<00:01:32.130> because<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.940> on<00:01:33.600> Chevy<00:01:34.020> as<00:01:34.110> well

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
Peninsula because and on Chevy as well

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.020 
Peninsula because and on Chevy as well
so<00:01:34.560> it's<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.800> an<00:01:35.040> idea<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.580> keeps<00:01:35.760> getting

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
so it's a an idea that keeps getting

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.550 
so it's a an idea that keeps getting
recycle<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.630> keeps<00:01:36.840> worrying<00:01:37.080> the<00:01:37.260> local

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.400 
build it immense then where they've got
with<00:03:50.520> facilities<00:03:50.910> anyway<00:03:52.700> it's<00:03:53.700> off<00:03:53.820> you<00:03:53.940> said

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
with facilities anyway it's off you said

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.680 
with facilities anyway it's off you said
it's<00:03:55.410> no<00:03:55.620> way<00:03:55.830> it's<00:03:55.980> gonna<00:03:56.070> happen<00:03:56.660> not<00:03:57.660> a

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
it's no way it's gonna happen not a

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.560 
it's no way it's gonna happen not a
chance<00:03:58.020> who<00:03:58.650> wants<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.190> have<00:03:59.970> an<00:04:00.180> airport

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
chance who wants to have an airport

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
chance who wants to have an airport
where<00:04:01.400> are<00:04:02.400> we<00:04:02.520> in<00:04:02.640> the<00:04:02.730> middle<00:04:02.910> of<00:04:02.970> pink<00:04:03.240> no<00:04:03.690> it

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
where are we in the middle of pink no it

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.320 
where are we in the middle of pink no it
won't<00:04:04.800> happen<00:04:06.590> and<00:04:07.590> I<00:04:08.310> think<00:04:08.760> it's<00:04:08.910> a<00:04:09.030> very

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
won't happen and I think it's a very

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:15.410 
won't happen and I think it's a very
very<00:04:10.020> very<00:04:10.170> bad<00:04:10.800> idea<00:04:11.540> very<00:04:12.540> bad<00:04:12.750> and<00:04:14.030> it<00:04:15.030> won't

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
very very bad idea very bad and it won't

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.750 
very very bad idea very bad and it won't
I'm<00:04:15.720> sure<00:04:16.109> it<00:04:16.260> won't<00:04:16.380> happen<00:04:16.620> I'm<00:04:17.040> positive<00:04:17.370> it

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
I'm sure it won't happen I'm positive it

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.819 
I'm sure it won't happen I'm positive it
won't<00:04:17.880> happen<00:04:18.120> but<00:04:18.570> we<00:04:19.290> never<00:04:19.410> know<00:04:19.620> doing

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
won't happen but we never know doing

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.249 
won't happen but we never know doing
it<00:04:22.610> is<00:04:23.000> interesting<00:04:23.539> and<00:04:23.689> it<00:04:23.870> so<00:04:24.080> that

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:24.259 
it is interesting and it so that

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:26.710 
it is interesting and it so that
perennial<00:04:24.620> sort<00:04:25.280> of<00:04:25.370> a<00:04:25.460> stock<00:04:26.150> keeps<00:04:26.419> coming

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
perennial sort of a stock keeps coming

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.369 
perennial sort of a stock keeps coming
round<00:04:26.870> the<00:04:27.050> game<00:04:27.550> we<00:04:28.550> heard<00:04:28.669> it<00:04:28.849> all<00:04:28.939> before

00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:29.379 
round the game we heard it all before

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:31.770 
round the game we heard it all before
yeah<00:04:30.379> it's<00:04:30.740> got<00:04:30.860> its<00:04:31.009> merits<00:04:31.400> but

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
yeah it's got its merits but

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.670 
yeah it's got its merits but
realistically<00:04:32.780> it's<00:04:33.229> not<00:04:33.349> going<00:04:33.439> to<00:04:33.530> get<00:04:33.590> off

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
realistically it's not going to get off

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.679 
realistically it's not going to get off
the<00:04:33.770> ground<00:04:33.949> with<00:04:34.310> the<00:04:34.460> the<00:04:34.879> cost<00:04:35.090> involved<00:04:35.210> on

00:04:35.679 --> 00:04:35.689 
the ground with the the cost involved on

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:37.929 
the ground with the the cost involved on
ride<00:04:36.110> and<00:04:36.409> with<00:04:36.770> a<00:04:36.800> lot<00:04:37.039> of<00:04:37.129> interest<00:04:37.490> upon<00:04:37.669> an

00:04:37.929 --> 00:04:37.939 
ride and with a lot of interest upon an

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:40.179 
ride and with a lot of interest upon an
interesting<00:04:38.449> negro<00:04:38.840> I<00:04:39.139> don't<00:04:39.680> think<00:04:39.770> that

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:40.189 
interesting negro I don't think that

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:41.740 
interesting negro I don't think that
people<00:04:40.580> there<00:04:40.699> will<00:04:40.909> really<00:04:41.300> want<00:04:41.449> to<00:04:41.509> let<00:04:41.599> go

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
people there will really want to let go

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.070 
people there will really want to let go
that<00:04:42.050> the<00:04:42.229> of<00:04:42.830> it<00:04:43.509> with<00:04:44.509> the<00:04:44.539> feasibility

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
that the of it with the feasibility

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.409 
that the of it with the feasibility
study<00:04:45.620> underway<00:04:46.039> only<00:04:46.909> time<00:04:47.150> will<00:04:47.210> tell

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
study underway only time will tell

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.300 
study underway only time will tell
whether<00:04:48.020> there'll<00:04:48.349> be<00:04:48.379> a<00:04:48.500> very<00:04:48.949> different

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
whether there'll be a very different

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.700 
whether there'll be a very different
sort<00:04:49.639> of<00:04:49.789> wings<00:04:50.090> over<00:04:50.659> the<00:04:50.780> skies<00:04:51.050> of<00:04:51.080> North
