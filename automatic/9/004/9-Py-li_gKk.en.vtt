00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.410
 You once said in the interview 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.559
 a concert is like one to you 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.820
 intense sports unit why that is 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.199
 Of course I care a lot 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.240
 move the stage and then when in the 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.520
 summer with such fantastic weather as 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.100
 here in bad mergentheim is traveling 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.020
 then you can easily get into it 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.060
 After that I sweat noticeably afterwards 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.490
 really done something so much water 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.840
 Drinking helps a career 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.129
 in rapid light then illuminate 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.050
 came the first big successes 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:35.460
 Annette Humpe with me and I solo 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.380
 career is just as successful 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.880
 There are certainly many fans would like 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.540
 Both wish but that will not quite 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.760
 to be possible 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.470
 how is the future considered yes 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.130
 Of course I was a wonderful time 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.840
 but we made three albums and 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.340
 That was nothing for the moment 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.140
 to have said okay now 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.180
 we do something else first, both as 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.030
 both had the feeling that we are somewhat 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.800
 want to do something new and still 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.210
 But I work very closely with Annette 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.469
 together that advises you to all 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.719
 possible things also write songs 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.090
 and for me that has not changed 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.460
 I felt great too 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.620
 before alone on stage and on 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.210
 tour and now it is just another 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.350
 a bit more personal the album and me 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.210
 work on the next 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.100
 if not album 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.420
 I would be able to do that someday 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.619
 I do not know yet 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.440
 Maybe not at some point 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.500
 funny never never says but next 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.790
 time first opens you always have 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.200
 a little lamp fever is right 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.060
 that of course I always have 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.310
 lampfieber so if you look at the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.680
 people there look out that there are 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.390
 already several thousand people who 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.759
 Of course expectations one wants this 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.590
 to meet expectations one has yes 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.740
 sometimes a little worry what could 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.619
 Everything goes wrong if you stay long on the 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.000
 stage was like me, of course 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.560
 many things went wrong on the 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.179
 stage and that's why it comes 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.590
 Lampfever, that's easy though 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.410
 also good feels somehow 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.229
 Exciting about it is this famous the 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.060
 bridge butterflies in the belly and me 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.009
 I'm just looking forward to going up now 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.830
 and then it's gone relatively quickly 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.289
 So when you are on it and see 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.580
 runs then you have fun and really something 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.690
 said you got yourself a bit 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.979
 looked at we are in bad mergentheim 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.790
 always so proud of me 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.750
 the location here 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.120
 it really is a bit too 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.590
 what special or say you are stage 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.480
 stage represent people and have to go 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.820
 it no, of course that's something really 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.709
 special here the ambience 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.230
 I 'm currently on the mayor 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.950
 hit that is quite great 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.670
 location 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.230
 I do that and I love that 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.269
 open-air concerts are played out there 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.890
 the dreamlike backdrop that makes it 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.930
 really with the audience so what 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.680
 I think that's a different story 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.450
 energy and bad mergentheim in general is 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.280
 beautiful the environment is beautiful and 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.650
 I'm definitely looking forward to it 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.329
 The concert is as much fun as it is now 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.329
 also thank you very much thank you
