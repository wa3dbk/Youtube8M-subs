ok<00:00:02.399> so<00:00:02.460> these<00:00:02.790> are<00:00:02.850> the<00:00:03.000> things<00:00:03.300> that<00:00:03.389> you

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
ok so these are the things that you

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.450 
ok so these are the things that you
should<00:00:03.689> use<00:00:04.230> to<00:00:04.500> solve<00:00:04.650> abetik<00:00:05.040> pedigree

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
should use to solve abetik pedigree

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.889 
should use to solve abetik pedigree
charts<00:00:05.879> these<00:00:06.060> are<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.240> steps<00:00:06.540> you<00:00:06.660> take

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
charts these are the steps you take

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.080 
charts these are the steps you take
every<00:00:07.290> time<00:00:07.470> you<00:00:07.560> get<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:07.710> pedigree<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.790> first

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
every time you get a pedigree the first

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.120 
every time you get a pedigree the first
step<00:00:09.450> is<00:00:09.780> that<00:00:09.870> you<00:00:10.050> need<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.500> number<00:00:10.769> each

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
step is that you need to number each

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.900 
step is that you need to number each
person<00:00:11.670> now<00:00:12.660> sometimes<00:00:13.259> if<00:00:13.590> you<00:00:13.710> get<00:00:13.799> a

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
person now sometimes if you get a

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.200 
person now sometimes if you get a
pedigree<00:00:15.049> let<00:00:16.049> me<00:00:16.109> show<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.379> quick<00:00:16.560> example

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
pedigree let me show you a quick example

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.210 
pedigree let me show you a quick example
for<00:00:18.210> example<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:18.720> one<00:00:18.930> right<00:00:19.050> here<00:00:19.410> that's

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
for example this one right here that's

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.320 
for example this one right here that's
your<00:00:20.369> worksheet<00:00:20.789> that<00:00:20.820> we're<00:00:21.060> going<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.210> be

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
your worksheet that we're going to be

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.090 
your worksheet that we're going to be
doing<00:00:21.570> later<00:00:21.689> notice<00:00:22.560> that<00:00:22.680> these<00:00:22.830> people

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
doing later notice that these people

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.730 
doing later notice that these people
have<00:00:23.369> names<00:00:23.750> usually<00:00:24.750> people<00:00:25.410> don't<00:00:25.529> have

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
have names usually people don't have

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.410 
have names usually people don't have
names<00:00:26.099> on<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.369> pedigree<00:00:26.880> when<00:00:27.060> we're<00:00:27.240> solving

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
names on a pedigree when we're solving

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.019 
names on a pedigree when we're solving
it<00:00:27.660> in<00:00:27.779> science<00:00:28.199> because<00:00:28.710> like<00:00:29.609> any<00:00:29.910> normal

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
it in science because like any normal

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.609 
it in science because like any normal
family<00:00:30.420> sometimes<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.050> names<00:00:31.260> are<00:00:31.410> passed

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
family sometimes the names are passed

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.799 
family sometimes the names are passed
down<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.219> might<00:00:32.369> have<00:00:32.550> like<00:00:32.790> an<00:00:33.059> uncle

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
down so you might have like an uncle

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.540 
down so you might have like an uncle
blobby<00:00:34.230> but<00:00:34.469> then<00:00:34.559> your<00:00:34.680> dad's<00:00:34.890> also<00:00:35.160> names

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
blobby but then your dad's also names

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.520 
blobby but then your dad's also names
you<00:00:35.850> know<00:00:35.969> or<00:00:36.540> your<00:00:36.690> brothers<00:00:37.050> also<00:00:37.350> named

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
you know or your brothers also named

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.020 
you know or your brothers also named
Bobby<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:37.950> that's<00:00:38.100> very<00:00:38.309> confusing<00:00:38.489> so

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
Bobby and that's very confusing so

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.959 
Bobby and that's very confusing so
normally<00:00:39.510> we<00:00:40.410> number<00:00:41.340> these<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.820> way<00:00:41.910> you

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
normally we number these the way you

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.700 
normally we number these the way you
number<00:00:42.390> them<00:00:42.510> as<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.780> go<00:00:42.899> from<00:00:43.050> left<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.440> right

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
number them as you go from left to right

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.440 
number them as you go from left to right
so<00:00:44.040> let<00:00:44.219> me<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.460> show<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.640> an<00:00:44.789> example<00:00:44.910> so

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
so let me just show you an example so

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:57.020 
so let me just show you an example so
this<00:00:46.020> would<00:00:46.230> be<00:00:48.800> 1<00:00:50.660> 2<00:00:51.660> 3<00:00:53.989> 4<00:00:55.070> 5<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:56.640> on<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.879> so

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
this would be 1 2 3 4 5 and so on and so

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.939 
this would be 1 2 3 4 5 and so on and so
forth<00:00:57.420> another<00:00:58.170> thing<00:00:58.410> that's<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.770> most

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
forth another thing that's in most

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.529 
forth another thing that's in most
pedigrees<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.640> isn't<00:00:59.879> on<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.090> one<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:00.420> is

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
pedigrees that isn't on this one this is

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.360 
pedigrees that isn't on this one this is
just<00:01:00.690> an<00:01:00.780> introductory<00:01:01.199> sheet<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.250> they

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
just an introductory sheet is that they

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.009 
just an introductory sheet is that they
number<00:01:02.699> each<00:01:02.820> generation<00:01:03.300> with<00:01:03.690> Roman

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
number each generation with Roman

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.340 
number each generation with Roman
numerals<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:04.589> this<00:01:04.710> would<00:01:04.830> be<00:01:04.920> generation<00:01:05.460> 1

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
numerals so this would be generation 1

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.940 
numerals so this would be generation 1
generation<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:08.930> generation<00:01:09.930> 3<00:01:10.290> we'll<00:01:10.680> get<00:01:10.799> to

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
generation to generation 3 we'll get to

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.710 
generation to generation 3 we'll get to
that<00:01:10.979> it's<00:01:11.960> 3<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.520> generation<00:01:14.520> 4<00:01:17.659> ok<00:01:18.659> so

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
that it's 3 and generation 4 ok so

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.240 
that it's 3 and generation 4 ok so
that's<00:01:19.140> your<00:01:19.259> step<00:01:19.590> number<00:01:19.770> one<00:01:20.070> you're<00:01:20.189> gonna

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
that's your step number one you're gonna

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.580 
that's your step number one you're gonna
number<00:01:20.640> each<00:01:20.759> person<00:01:21.380> second<00:01:22.380> you're<00:01:22.530> gonna

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
number each person second you're gonna

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.350 
number each person second you're gonna
identify<00:01:23.040> your<00:01:23.640> dominant<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.330> recessive

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
identify your dominant and recessive

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.080 
identify your dominant and recessive
traits<00:01:25.170> ok<00:01:25.950> Alex<00:01:26.280> can<00:01:26.490> please<00:01:26.670> sit<00:01:26.820> back<00:01:26.970> in

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
traits ok Alex can please sit back in

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.980 
traits ok Alex can please sit back in
your<00:01:27.119> desk<00:01:29.000> so<00:01:30.000> when<00:01:30.180> you're<00:01:30.299> identifying

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
your desk so when you're identifying

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.270 
your desk so when you're identifying
your<00:01:31.110> dominant<00:01:31.560> recessive<00:01:31.770> traits<00:01:32.159> that

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
your dominant recessive traits that

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.010 
your dominant recessive traits that
means<00:01:32.460> you're<00:01:32.579> gonna<00:01:32.670> identify<00:01:33.210> what<00:01:33.509> is

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
means you're gonna identify what is

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.990 
means you're gonna identify what is
gonna<00:01:34.200> be<00:01:34.290> your<00:01:34.560> capitalized<00:01:35.310> letter<00:01:35.670> and

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
gonna be your capitalized letter and

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.780 
gonna be your capitalized letter and
what's<00:01:36.180> gonna<00:01:36.360> be<00:01:36.479> your<00:01:36.509> lowercase<00:01:36.840> letter<00:01:37.790> so

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
what's gonna be your lowercase letter so

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.280 
what's gonna be your lowercase letter so
again<00:01:39.000> that's<00:01:39.119> identifying<00:01:39.720> your<00:01:39.840> dominant

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
again that's identifying your dominant

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.060 
again that's identifying your dominant
recessive<00:01:40.530> traits<00:01:41.720> number<00:01:42.720> 3<00:01:43.110> you're

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
recessive traits number 3 you're

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.859 
recessive traits number 3 you're
supposed<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.640> write<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.909> genotypes<00:01:45.479> for<00:01:45.750> as

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
supposed to write the genotypes for as

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.260 
supposed to write the genotypes for as
many<00:01:46.049> people<00:01:46.170> as<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.619> can<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.640> there<00:01:48.149> will

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
many people as you can so there will

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.910 
many people as you can so there will
usually<00:01:48.450> be<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.750> little<00:01:49.049> word<00:01:49.229> problem<00:01:49.680> or<00:01:49.860> a

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
usually be a little word problem or a

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.149 
usually be a little word problem or a
sentence<00:01:50.460> before<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.390> start<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.689> pedigree

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
sentence before you start a pedigree

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.620 
sentence before you start a pedigree
like<00:01:53.159> on<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.520> one<00:01:53.759> there's<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.030> whole<00:01:54.270> little

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
like on this one there's a whole little

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.149 
like on this one there's a whole little
paragraph<00:01:55.049> about<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.320> background<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.070> the

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
paragraph about the background of the

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.310 
paragraph about the background of the
family<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.759> they<00:01:57.180> will<00:01:57.240> tell<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:58.049> little

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
family and they will tell you a little

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.520 
family and they will tell you a little
bit<00:01:58.469> about<00:01:58.740> them<00:01:58.979> so<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.250> can<00:01:59.460> identify<00:01:59.759> what

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
bit about them so you can identify what

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.010 
bit about them so you can identify what
genotype<00:02:01.530> some<00:02:01.829> people<00:02:02.130> are

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
genotype some people are

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.600 
genotype some people are
so<00:02:05.020> again<00:02:05.290> you<00:02:05.440> write<00:02:05.620> genotypes<00:02:06.190> for<00:02:06.370> as<00:02:06.460> many

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
so again you write genotypes for as many

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.530 
so again you write genotypes for as many
people<00:02:07.000> as<00:02:07.090> you<00:02:07.240> can<00:02:08.790> okay<00:02:09.790> number<00:02:10.060> four

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
people as you can okay number four

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.120 
people as you can okay number four
you're<00:02:10.750> supposed<00:02:11.050> to<00:02:11.140> use<00:02:11.290> a<00:02:11.320> Punnett<00:02:11.680> square

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
you're supposed to use a Punnett square

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.100 
you're supposed to use a Punnett square
to<00:02:12.490> solve<00:02:12.790> for<00:02:13.030> unknowns<00:02:13.060> eno<00:02:13.630> types<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:14.080> i

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
to solve for unknowns eno types and i

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.330 
to solve for unknowns eno types and i
will<00:02:14.260> show<00:02:14.380> you<00:02:14.440> how<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:14.680> do<00:02:14.830> that<00:02:14.920> in<00:02:15.040> just<00:02:15.070> a

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
will show you how to do that in just a

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.970 
will show you how to do that in just a
minute<00:02:15.780> so<00:02:16.780> you're<00:02:17.050> gonna<00:02:17.170> be<00:02:17.350> using<00:02:17.470> punnett

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
minute so you're gonna be using punnett

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.380 
minute so you're gonna be using punnett
squares<00:02:18.310> anytime<00:02:18.820> you<00:02:18.940> don't<00:02:19.090> know<00:02:19.270> who

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
squares anytime you don't know who

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.960 
squares anytime you don't know who
someone<00:02:19.630> is<00:02:19.750> or<00:02:20.170> what<00:02:20.470> their<00:02:20.620> genotype<00:02:21.070> is<00:02:21.310> you

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
someone is or what their genotype is you

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.380 
someone is or what their genotype is you
usually<00:02:22.150> do<00:02:22.480> two<00:02:22.750> punnett<00:02:23.110> squares<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:24.390> then

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
usually do two punnett squares and then

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.150 
usually do two punnett squares and then
something<00:02:25.930> that's<00:02:25.960> very<00:02:26.320> important<00:02:26.830> or<00:02:27.040> that

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
something that's very important or that

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.980 
something that's very important or that
you<00:02:27.250> should<00:02:27.490> always<00:02:27.700> do<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.330> help<00:02:28.480> you<00:02:28.660> so<00:02:28.870> your

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
you should always do to help you so your

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.360 
you should always do to help you so your
paper<00:02:29.200> doesn't<00:02:29.530> get<00:02:29.650> messy<00:02:29.920> is<00:02:30.040> to<00:02:30.190> have<00:02:30.340> a

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
paper doesn't get messy is to have a

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.490 
paper doesn't get messy is to have a
scratch<00:02:30.700> piece<00:02:30.940> of<00:02:31.090> paper<00:02:31.270> out<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:32.290> once

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
scratch piece of paper out so once

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.840 
scratch piece of paper out so once
you're<00:02:32.650> done<00:02:32.680> writing<00:02:33.100> these<00:02:33.220> notes<00:02:33.280> i<00:02:33.730> would

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
you're done writing these notes i would

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.490 
you're done writing these notes i would
take<00:02:33.970> a<00:02:34.030> scratch<00:02:34.450> piece<00:02:34.630> of<00:02:34.780> paper<00:02:34.960> out<00:02:35.080> so<00:02:35.380> we

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
take a scratch piece of paper out so we

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
take a scratch piece of paper out so we
can<00:02:35.650> do<00:02:35.740> these<00:02:35.860> problems<00:02:36.250> together<00:02:38.340> so<00:02:39.340> again

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
can do these problems together so again

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.710 
can do these problems together so again
you<00:02:39.610> should<00:02:39.640> be<00:02:39.880> writing<00:02:40.090> this<00:02:40.300> on<00:02:40.570> your

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
you should be writing this on your

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.860 
you should be writing this on your
pedigree<00:02:41.050> notes<00:02:41.320> that<00:02:41.650> we<00:02:41.890> have<00:02:42.720> next<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:43.780> the

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
pedigree notes that we have next to the

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.270 
pedigree notes that we have next to the
symbols<00:02:44.200> there's<00:02:44.350> just<00:02:44.470> a<00:02:44.530> nice<00:02:44.650> blank<00:02:45.010> column

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
symbols there's just a nice blank column

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.180 
symbols there's just a nice blank column
you<00:02:45.340> can<00:02:45.400> write<00:02:45.580> this<00:02:45.700> all<00:02:45.850> down<00:02:45.880> on
