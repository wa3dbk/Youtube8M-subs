00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
heart ram which is the highest you can

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.600 
heart ram which is the highest you can
get<00:02:20.960> on<00:02:21.960> my<00:02:22.170> laptop<00:02:22.380> but<00:02:22.740> it's<00:02:23.370> not<00:02:23.490> really

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
inside as you can see the screen there's

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.530 
inside as you can see the screen there's
a<00:02:55.260> screen<00:02:55.590> obviously<00:02:56.220> um<00:02:58.070> it's<00:02:59.070> pretty<00:02:59.540> small

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
a screen obviously um it's pretty small

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.570 
a screen obviously um it's pretty small
but<00:03:00.989> if<00:03:01.230> it's<00:03:01.890> not<00:03:02.550> made<00:03:02.910> for<00:03:03.950> watching<00:03:04.950> videos

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580

but if it's not made for watching videos
it's<00:03:06.180> basically<00:03:06.930> made<00:03:07.320> well<00:03:08.070> it's<00:03:08.220> like<00:03:08.400> a

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
it's basically made well it's like a

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.540 
it's basically made well it's like a
like<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.290> little<00:03:10.590> DVD<00:03:10.920> that<00:03:11.070> i<00:03:11.130> wouldíve<00:03:11.400> those

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
like a little DVD that i wouldíve those

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.460 
like a little DVD that i wouldíve those
portable<00:03:11.940> DVD<00:03:12.060> players<00:03:12.510> so<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.050> same<00:03:13.290> size

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
portable DVD players so the same size

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.600 
portable DVD players so the same size
you<00:03:13.620> could<00:03:13.709> watch<00:03:13.920> it<00:03:13.950> if<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:14.220> put<00:03:14.430> it<00:03:14.489> in<00:03:14.550> your

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
you could watch it if you put it in your

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.420 
you could watch it if you put it in your
little<00:03:14.820> card<00:03:15.239> on<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:16.620> keypad<00:03:16.950> is<00:03:17.100> pretty

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
little card on the keypad is pretty

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.070 
little card on the keypad is pretty
small<00:03:17.730> take<00:03:18.090> some<00:03:18.330> getting<00:03:18.570> used<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:18.870> but<00:03:18.900> I

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
small take some getting used to but I

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.420 
small take some getting used to but I
got<00:03:19.290> used<00:03:19.500> to<00:03:19.650> it<00:03:19.680> pretty<00:03:19.830> fast<00:03:20.220> that

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
got used to it pretty fast that

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.620 
got used to it pretty fast that
shouldn't<00:03:20.670> really<00:03:20.700> take<00:03:20.970> you<00:03:21.030> that<00:03:21.150> long<00:03:21.300> so

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
shouldn't really take you that long so

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
shouldn't really take you that long so
you<00:03:21.720> kind<00:03:21.900> of<00:03:21.959> squared<00:03:22.290> up<00:03:22.730> so<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:23.790> could<00:03:23.850> fit<00:03:24.180> um

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
you kind of squared up so I could fit um

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.400 
you kind of squared up so I could fit um
this<00:03:25.650> comes<00:03:25.950> with<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.280> intel<00:03:26.700> atom<00:03:26.970> processor

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
this comes with the intel atom processor

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.930 
this comes with the intel atom processor
it's<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.560> newest<00:03:28.860> one<00:03:28.890> out<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:29.489> it's

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
pretty much all about the laptop so we

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.430 
pretty much all about the laptop so we
move<00:03:56.930> on<00:03:57.080> to<00:03:57.110> Abu<00:03:58.420> 21<00:03:59.420> X<00:03:59.630> is<00:03:59.780> a<00:03:59.810> new<00:04:00.020> operating

move on to Abu 21 X is a new operating

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:08.910 
move on to Abu 21 X is a new operating
system<00:04:01.270> it<00:04:02.270> is<00:04:03.100> tons<00:04:04.100> better<00:04:04.660> than<00:04:06.700> Windows

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
system it is tons better than Windows

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.250 
system it is tons better than Windows
Mac<00:04:09.970> it's<00:04:10.970> basically<00:04:11.660> a<00:04:11.780> mix<00:04:12.230> between<00:04:12.640> mac<00:04:13.640> and

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
Mac it's basically a mix between mac and

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.259 
Mac it's basically a mix between mac and
Windows<00:04:15.260> but<00:04:15.800> it's<00:04:16.040> pretty<00:04:16.190> customized<00:04:16.880> it's

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
Windows but it's pretty customized it's

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.140
