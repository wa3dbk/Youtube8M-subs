00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.350

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:52.580
 this link is not mine but it is his 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:56.240
 and good people were recommended to them both 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.549
 channels and let's start when when 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.060
 they let him down to cry and the sheet 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.060
 from this folder 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:10.330
 this is the 4d cinema if you have 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:13.990
 64 bits and 64 bits 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:18.070
 32 bits in 32 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.810
 but I took the 32 so I open the one in 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.700
 32 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.870
 good as they see when we give double 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.380
 click 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.540
 and then accept an error 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.360
 it was application in rock 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.120
 We will accept it if it appears that 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.180
 error are going to do now what I 'm going to 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.180
 do 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.780
 and click on they will go to your 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.319
 right click desktop properties 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.319
 graphics 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.440
 but let's renew the other 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.440
 graphics 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.790
 and here a basic mode where they have what 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.790
 you accept 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.319
 and this minimizes it 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.500
 they go to the folder where they have the cinema 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.500
 4d 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.930
 and in the click the right itself is 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.860
 here on the cinema 4d property they give 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:24.810
 in compatibility 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:29.950
 and run with 296 colors 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:33.599
 milan in applying and accepting 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.599
 how did he start to open 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.569
 and it's going 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.569
 and put the graph 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.080
 we wait 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.989
 As you can see there is already changing 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:57.989
 colors 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.830
 and how come they start water 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.750
 cold 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:17.890
 so let's go where we open the one that 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:21.480
 it prevailed first and here it will be in 8 bits 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:23.860
 they change it to 32 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:27.510
 good as you see the cinema opened 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:30.970
 businessman then the table in apply 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:34.450
 as you see it returns to normal water 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.450
 you want to keep 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:41.660
 good as in him the cinema was opened to them 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.199
 we're going to keep four of them 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.199
 with those 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:53.870
 with that property so when you 

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:57.410
 They open it you're going to do that and ready 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:01.030

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.030

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:10.460
