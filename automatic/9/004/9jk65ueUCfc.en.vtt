the hard thing about this elevator is

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.059 
the hard thing about this elevator is
this<00:02:11.610> water<00:02:11.879> elevator<00:02:12.330> it

slower now slows your climbing a ladder
in<00:02:15.920> Minecraft<00:02:16.400> so<00:02:16.879> that's<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.269> only<00:02:17.299> downfall

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:17.689

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.420 
for this one and this one is actually
easier<00:02:22.189> to<00:02:22.280> create<00:02:22.489> is<00:02:22.900> easier<00:02:23.900> to<00:02:23.930> create

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
easier to create is easier to create

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.089 
easier to create is easier to create
survival<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:25.609> creative<00:02:26.269> mode<00:02:26.859> you<00:02:27.859> can<00:02:27.889> make

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.900 
that and then like um alright so let's
test<00:05:58.810> it<00:05:58.960> out<00:05:59.080> then<00:05:59.380> let's<00:05:59.710> test<00:06:00.010> up<00:06:00.220> the<00:06:00.550> water

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:00.910 
test it out then let's test up the water

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.900 
test it out then let's test up the water
elevator<00:06:01.320> okay<00:06:02.320> so<00:06:02.380> you<00:06:03.040> just<00:06:03.070> get<00:06:03.310> in<00:06:03.430> here

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
elevator okay so you just get in here

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.400 
elevator okay so you just get in here
and<00:06:04.060> then<00:06:04.570> you<00:06:04.690> just<00:06:04.870> keep<00:06:05.080> walking<00:06:05.380> forward

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.410 
and then you just keep walking forward

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:10.910 
and then you just keep walking forward
like<00:06:05.830> this<00:06:05.940> and<00:06:08.040> basically<00:06:09.040> you<00:06:09.460> can<00:06:09.610> read<00:06:09.880> um

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:10.920 
like this and basically you can read um

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.510 
like this and basically you can read um
you<00:06:11.920> can<00:06:12.100> read<00:06:12.280> that's<00:06:12.430> why<00:06:12.640> and<00:06:13.290> yeah<00:06:14.290> cuz<00:06:14.950> and

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
you can read that's why and yeah cuz and

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.880 
you can read that's why and yeah cuz and
you<00:06:16.450> can<00:06:16.600> make<00:06:16.750> it<00:06:16.870> as<00:06:16.990> high<00:06:17.560> as<00:06:17.620> you<00:06:17.860> want

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:17.890 
you can make it as high as you want

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.550 
you can make it as high as you want
let's<00:06:18.280> say<00:06:18.430> you<00:06:18.490> want<00:06:18.850> to<00:06:18.880> make<00:06:19.030> it<00:06:19.180> a<00:06:19.530> bit<00:06:20.530> more

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
let's say you want to make it a bit more

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.920 
let's say you want to make it a bit more
taller<00:06:20.980> like<00:06:21.340> the<00:06:21.520> size<00:06:21.730> of<00:06:21.880> this<00:06:22.000> that<00:06:22.810> right

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
taller like the size of this that right

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.400 
taller like the size of this that right
there<00:06:23.140> that<00:06:23.350> building<00:06:23.950> oh<00:06:24.070> I<00:06:24.310> missed<00:06:24.520> um<00:06:25.410> you

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:26.410 
there that building oh I missed um you

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.860 
there that building oh I missed um you
can<00:06:26.530> make<00:06:26.650> as<00:06:26.830> tall<00:06:27.070> as<00:06:27.220> you<00:06:27.310> want<00:06:27.520> just<00:06:27.870> always

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 
can make as tall as you want just always

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.500 
can make as tall as you want just always
make<00:06:29.260> sure<00:06:29.290> to<00:06:29.470> put<00:06:29.800> sign<00:06:30.640> then<00:06:31.030> waterblock

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:31.510 
make sure to put sign then waterblock

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.390 
make sure to put sign then waterblock
signed<00:06:31.780> and<00:06:31.960> water<00:06:32.080> block<00:06:32.350> you<00:06:33.010> can<00:06:33.220> do<00:06:33.280> this

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:33.400 
signed and water block you can do this

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.920 
signed and water block you can do this
in<00:06:33.580> survival<00:06:34.090> but<00:06:34.270> the<00:06:34.300> previous<00:06:34.720> water

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:34.930 
in survival but the previous water

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.520 
in survival but the previous water
elevator<00:06:35.350> because<00:06:36.310> actually<00:06:36.670> we<00:06:37.500> sign<00:06:38.500> up

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:38.530 
elevator because actually we sign up

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:38.879 
elevator because actually we sign up
with

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:38.889 
with

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:43.649 
with
little<00:06:39.249> bit<00:06:39.659> um<00:06:40.659> because<00:06:41.999> one<00:06:42.999> person<00:06:43.389> want<00:06:43.599> to

00:06:43.649 --> 00:06:43.659 
little bit um because one person want to

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:45.270 
little bit um because one person want to
make<00:06:43.870> this<00:06:43.990> in<00:06:44.169> survival<00:06:44.770> mode<00:06:44.800> that's<00:06:45.069> why

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 
make this in survival mode that's why

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.360 
make this in survival mode that's why
and<00:06:45.900> instead<00:06:46.900> it<00:06:47.020> was<00:06:47.080> too<00:06:47.229> difficult<00:06:47.379> and<00:06:48.009> he

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:48.370 
and instead it was too difficult and he

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.219 
and instead it was too difficult and he
told<00:06:48.520> me<00:06:48.669> is<00:06:48.819> there<00:06:48.999> another<00:06:49.389> water<00:06:49.719> elevator

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:50.229 
told me is there another water elevator

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:52.709 
told me is there another water elevator
or<00:06:50.469> another<00:06:50.770> type<00:06:51.009> of<00:06:51.039> elevator<00:06:51.490> I<00:06:51.759> asked

00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:52.719 
or another type of elevator I asked

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:55.439 
or another type of elevator I asked
earlier<00:06:53.520> another<00:06:54.520> type<00:06:54.729> of<00:06:54.759> elevator<00:06:55.180> I<00:06:55.240> can

00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:55.449 
earlier another type of elevator I can

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:57.119 
earlier another type of elevator I can
use<00:06:55.629> that<00:06:55.749> very<00:06:55.990> easier<00:06:56.319> to<00:06:56.439> build<00:06:56.560> in

00:06:57.119 --> 00:06:57.129 
use that very easier to build in

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:02.640 
use that very easier to build in
survival<00:06:58.120> mode<00:06:58.150> parentheses<00:06:59.699> so<00:07:01.080> I<00:07:02.080> replied

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:02.650 
survival mode parentheses so I replied

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.399 
survival mode parentheses so I replied
there<00:07:02.889> is<00:07:03.270> one<00:07:04.270> away<00:07:04.389> and<00:07:04.900> i<00:07:05.020> will<00:07:05.199> create<00:07:05.319> a

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:05.409 
there is one away and i will create a

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:07.739 
there is one away and i will create a
view<00:07:05.650> so<00:07:06.159> that's<00:07:06.580> the<00:07:06.789> easier<00:07:07.180> water<00:07:07.360> elevator

00:07:07.739 --> 00:07:07.749 
view so that's the easier water elevator

00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:12.300 
view so that's the easier water elevator
guys<00:07:08.759> um<00:07:09.990> the<00:07:10.990> only<00:07:11.020> downfall<00:07:11.529> about<00:07:11.949> that<00:07:12.159> is

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:12.310 
guys um the only downfall about that is

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.640 
guys um the only downfall about that is
to<00:07:12.430> go<00:07:12.550> slower<00:07:13.020> the<00:07:14.020> good<00:07:14.169> thing<00:07:14.199> about<00:07:14.379> the

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:14.650 
to go slower the good thing about the

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.499 
to go slower the good thing about the
harder<00:07:15.069> elevator<00:07:15.490> to<00:07:15.699> create<00:07:15.969> is<00:07:16.180> it<00:07:16.360> goes

00:07:16.499 --> 00:07:16.509 
harder elevator to create is it goes

00:07:16.509 --> 00:07:19.129 
harder elevator to create is it goes
much<00:07:16.719> more<00:07:16.900> faster<00:07:17.229> like<00:07:18.069> this

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:19.139 
much more faster like this

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:21.390
