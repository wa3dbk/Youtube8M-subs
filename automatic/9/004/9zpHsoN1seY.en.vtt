00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.380
 Obama decided to goal 

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:13.369
 you have more 1 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.269
 not 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:21.669
 so simple 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:23.550
 so here 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.960
 so here are sold 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.189
 the most 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.509
 good way really 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.509
 that's all 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.150
 the politician thinks that 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.050
 she is 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.899
 600 thousand 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.610
 Doll 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.280
 so interesting how much he doesn't 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.050
 going to 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.450
 It seems not very good, but there is 1 bad 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.030
 moment 5 5 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.110
 we coped with it 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.110
 we coped with it and I just 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.160
 I am amazed that we coped with it on 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.550
 really with so many lives 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.800
 this level I'm still 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.800
 never passed 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.580
 Well, it will not be a lesson 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.860
 and now perhaps 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.600
 and now we need 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.630
 and run 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.550
 Volyn and still remember 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.550
 I'm really surprised 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.520
 for the guys I did not think that on the hard really 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.090
 so hard to play but how do i really 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.990
 showed that it is difficult 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.689
 but I myself check this here 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.780
 since i say three times 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.130
 the operation took place means me targets 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.560
 will not stop 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.800
 let's 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.840
 save and 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.830
 reference 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:56.530
 perhaps 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.900
 in the next part 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.900
 applications are accepted 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.170
 I most likely light
