Animal<00:00:26.160> Jam<00:00:26.359> was<00:00:27.359> down<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.720> believe<00:00:27.990> Tuesday

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
Animal Jam was down I believe Tuesday

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.890 
Animal Jam was down I believe Tuesday
and<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.640> lot<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:29.789> jammers<00:00:30.150> were<00:00:30.269> confused<00:00:30.689> but

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
and a lot of jammers were confused but

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.049 
and a lot of jammers were confused but
what<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.439> world<00:00:31.590> was<00:00:31.800> happening<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.369> it

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
what in the world was happening and it

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.940 
what in the world was happening and it
appears<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.719> was<00:00:33.870> one<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.410> servers<00:00:34.770> they

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
appears this was one of the servers they

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.110 
appears this was one of the servers they
were<00:00:35.010> working<00:00:35.460> on<00:00:35.579> because<00:00:35.940> they<00:00:36.030> were

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
were working on because they were

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.510 
were working on because they were
working<00:00:36.270> on<00:00:36.540> expanding<00:00:36.989> servers<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:38.100> they're

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
working on expanding servers so they're

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.490 
working on expanding servers so they're
starting<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.270> have<00:00:39.390> language<00:00:39.780> servers<00:00:40.140> now<00:00:40.290> I

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
starting to have language servers now I

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.680 
starting to have language servers now I
guess<00:00:40.710> French<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.309> one<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.730> top<00:00:41.940> users<00:00:42.329> so

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
guess French is one of the top users so

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.750 
guess French is one of the top users so
they<00:00:42.809> have<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:42.989> French<00:00:43.350> server<00:00:43.649> I'm<00:00:44.399> hoping

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
they have a French server I'm hoping

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.100 
they have a French server I'm hoping
they'll<00:00:44.940> get<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> Spanish<00:00:45.510> server<00:00:45.750> because<00:00:46.050> I

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
they'll get a Spanish server because I

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.970 
they'll get a Spanish server because I
need<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.289> practice<00:00:46.500> my<00:00:46.860> Spanish<00:00:47.180> but<00:00:48.980> anyway

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
need to practice my Spanish but anyway

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.729 
need to practice my Spanish but anyway

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.790 
seem to be working out because with this
one<00:02:07.610> you<00:02:08.610> just<00:02:08.819> say<00:02:09.000> something<00:02:09.390> blank<00:02:09.800> not

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
one you just say something blank not

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.890 
one you just say something blank not
sure<00:02:10.979> how<00:02:11.099> that<00:02:11.160> works<00:02:11.520> but<00:02:11.730> you're<00:02:12.540> also<00:02:12.660> able

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
sure how that works but you're also able

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.590 
sure how that works but you're also able
to<00:02:12.989> type<00:02:13.260> into

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
to type into

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.740 
to type into
chat<00:02:13.750> box<00:02:13.990> but<00:02:14.320> only<00:02:14.500> French<00:02:14.860> words<00:02:15.720> so<00:02:16.720> I

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
chat box but only French words so I

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.540 
chat box but only French words so I
don't<00:02:17.110> know<00:02:17.200> how<00:02:17.320> to<00:02:17.380> type<00:02:17.680> into<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.370> chat<00:02:18.400> box

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
don't know how to type into the chat box

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.080 
don't know how to type into the chat box
so<00:02:19.060> I<00:02:19.420> don't<00:02:19.720> have<00:02:19.930> any<00:02:20.110> words<00:02:20.350> to<00:02:20.530> say

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
so I don't have any words to say

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.370 
so I don't have any words to say
everyone<00:02:22.090> else<00:02:22.210> calls<00:02:22.480> me<00:02:22.690> snowboard<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.320> I

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
everyone else calls me snowboard and I

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.880 
everyone else calls me snowboard and I
get<00:02:23.560> really<00:02:23.740> confused<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:25.500> then<00:02:26.500> made<00:02:26.740> all

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
get really confused and then made all

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.810 
get really confused and then made all
this<00:02:27.130> very<00:02:28.090> French<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:28.750> stuff<00:02:29.080> so<00:02:29.820> it's

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
this very French and stuff so it's

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.370 
this very French and stuff so it's
likely<00:02:31.240> that<00:02:31.450> you<00:02:31.660> can<00:02:31.810> get<00:02:31.930> into<00:02:32.050> a<00:02:32.140> French

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.020 
likely that you can get into a French
