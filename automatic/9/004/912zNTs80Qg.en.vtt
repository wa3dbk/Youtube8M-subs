00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
some random like dubstep version of the

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.360 
some random like dubstep version of the
Star<00:04:29.390> Wars<00:04:29.419> theme<00:04:29.660> I<00:04:29.930> would<00:04:29.990> be<00:04:30.110> like<00:04:30.289> for<00:04:31.250> like

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
Star Wars theme I would be like for like

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.980 
Star Wars theme I would be like for like
a<00:04:31.460> rap<00:04:31.700> version<00:04:31.910> over<00:04:32.300> a<00:04:32.330> dubstep<00:04:32.570> I'll<00:04:32.870> tell

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
a rap version over a dubstep I'll tell

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.580 
a rap version over a dubstep I'll tell
you<00:04:33.050> right<00:04:33.110> now

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
you right now

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.529 
you right now
although<00:04:34.280> dubstep<00:04:34.760> would<00:04:35.120> make<00:04:35.300> more<00:04:35.479> sense

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
although dubstep would make more sense

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:36.909 
although dubstep would make more sense
because<00:04:35.990> it's<00:04:36.110> like<00:04:36.229> space<00:04:36.470> so<00:04:36.680> it's<00:04:36.800> like

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
because it's like space so it's like

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.370 
because it's like space so it's like
intergalactic<00:04:37.669> and<00:04:37.820> like<00:04:37.910> you<00:04:38.870> don't<00:04:39.050> people

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
intergalactic and like you don't people

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
intergalactic and like you don't people
don't<00:04:39.470> rap<00:04:39.680> in<00:04:39.860> space<00:04:40.070> they<00:04:40.220> probably

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
don't rap in space they probably

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.140 
don't rap in space they probably
