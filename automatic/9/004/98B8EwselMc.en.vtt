anything I'm gonna put it on second

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.210 
anything I'm gonna put it on second
because<00:02:55.700> it's<00:02:55.820> gonna<00:02:55.940> blend<00:02:56.470> my<00:02:57.470> lashes<00:02:57.740> and

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
because it's gonna blend my lashes and

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.250 
because it's gonna blend my lashes and
the<00:02:58.790> false<00:02:59.000> lashes<00:02:59.240> together<00:02:59.570> so<00:02:59.930> they<00:03:00.020> look<00:03:00.170> a

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
the false lashes together so they look a

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.930 
the false lashes together so they look a
little<00:03:00.410> bit<00:03:00.620> more<00:03:00.740> natural<00:03:01.220> so<00:03:03.340> I'm<00:03:04.340> not<00:03:04.730> gonna

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
little bit more natural so I'm not gonna

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.840 
little bit more natural so I'm not gonna

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:09.979 

pop<00:03:55.270> your<00:03:55.420> lash<00:03:55.569> L<00:03:58.200> my<00:03:59.200> tweezers<00:04:02.459> pop<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:03.700> glue

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.320 

sometimes<00:04:10.989> you'll<00:04:11.319> find<00:04:11.590> that<00:04:12.310> the<00:04:12.489> number

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
sometimes you'll find that the number

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.930 
sometimes you'll find that the number
seven<00:04:13.600> lashes<00:04:13.959> because<00:04:14.680> the<00:04:14.860> stem<00:04:15.190> is<00:04:15.340> so<00:04:15.580> fine

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
seven lashes because the stem is so fine

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.690 
seven lashes because the stem is so fine
are<00:04:16.239> very<00:04:16.720> easy<00:04:17.200> to<00:04:17.470> put<00:04:17.620> on<00:04:17.859> the<00:04:18.310> ones<00:04:18.519> that

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
are very easy to put on the ones that

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.099 
are very easy to put on the ones that
had<00:04:18.820> the<00:04:18.850> black<00:04:19.180> stem<00:04:19.480> are<00:04:19.630> normally<00:04:19.959> a<00:04:19.989> lot

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
had the black stem are normally a lot

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.449 
had the black stem are normally a lot
harder<00:04:20.350> because<00:04:20.590> they<00:04:20.799> haven't<00:04:20.980> got<00:04:21.220> as<00:04:21.310> much

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
harder because they haven't got as much

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.020 
harder because they haven't got as much
give<00:04:22.080> because<00:04:23.080> they're<00:04:23.320> a<00:04:23.350> lot<00:04:23.560> sturdier<00:04:24.030> so

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
give because they're a lot sturdier so

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.760 
give because they're a lot sturdier so
it's<00:04:25.180> even<00:04:25.480> more<00:04:25.510> importantly<00:04:26.260> wait<00:04:26.530> for<00:04:26.680> the

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
it's even more importantly wait for the

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:33.200 
it's even more importantly wait for the
glue<00:04:26.919> to<00:04:26.950> drive<00:04:27.280> on<00:04:27.460> dry<00:04:27.730> on<00:04:27.850> these<00:04:28.030> ones<00:04:29.250> okay

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:42.459 

and<00:04:34.210> pop<00:04:34.390> it<00:04:34.540> on

00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:42.469 

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:44.409 

who<00:04:43.099> needs<00:04:43.429> to<00:04:43.580> be<00:04:43.669> slightly<00:04:43.879> dry<00:04:44.179> on<00:04:44.239> these

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
who needs to be slightly dry on these

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.469 
who needs to be slightly dry on these
because<00:04:44.659> they<00:04:45.789> haven't<00:04:46.789> got<00:04:47.029> much<00:04:47.179> give<00:04:47.389> at

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
because they haven't got much give at

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:59.400 
because they haven't got much give at
all

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.390 

but<00:04:59.980> there<00:05:00.070> you<00:05:00.160> have<00:05:00.190> it<00:05:00.550> they<00:05:00.790> won<00:05:00.970> as<00:05:01.090> well

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
but there you have it they won as well

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:12.469 
but there you have it they won as well
probably<00:05:03.400> get<00:05:03.550> a<00:05:03.670> bit<00:05:03.880> closer

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.420 

so<00:05:13.379> I'm<00:05:13.469> hoping<00:05:13.770> this<00:05:13.889> has<00:05:14.039> helped<00:05:14.309> some

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
so I'm hoping this has helped some

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.480 
so I'm hoping this has helped some
people<00:05:15.439> to<00:05:16.439> know<00:05:16.559> how<00:05:16.740> to<00:05:16.800> put<00:05:17.009> lashes<00:05:17.189> on<00:05:17.430> a

little bit better

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:20.779 
little bit better
they<00:05:18.900> aren't<00:05:19.110> difficult<00:05:19.469> it<00:05:20.249> takes<00:05:20.460> a<00:05:20.639> while

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:20.789 
they aren't difficult it takes a while

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:22.249 
they aren't difficult it takes a while
to<00:05:20.999> get<00:05:21.120> used<00:05:21.150> to<00:05:21.509> it<00:05:21.659> but<00:05:21.809> it's<00:05:21.870> a<00:05:22.050> case<00:05:22.229> of

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259 
to get used to it but it's a case of

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:25.219
