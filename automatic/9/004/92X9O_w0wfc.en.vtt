what else that's much covers it I think

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.870 
what else that's much covers it I think
that<00:01:36.509> pretty<00:01:36.659> much<00:01:36.780> covers<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.140> and

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
that pretty much covers it and

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.370 
that pretty much covers it and
underneath<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.420> had<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.840> get<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:39.990> bit<00:01:40.229> more

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
underneath it I had to get a bit more

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.700 
underneath it I had to get a bit more
storage<00:01:40.680> as<00:01:41.180> obviously<00:01:42.180> 160<00:01:42.899> gigs<00:01:43.079> nowadays

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
storage as obviously 160 gigs nowadays

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.380 
storage as obviously 160 gigs nowadays
isn't<00:01:44.220> really<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> lot<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.619> I<00:01:46.729> got<00:01:47.729> myself<00:01:47.880> for<00:01:48.180> I

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
isn't really a lot so I got myself for I

which basically it looks flush with the

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.660 
which basically it looks flush with the
mac<00:01:55.649> mini<00:01:55.680> way<00:01:56.040> because<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.310> actually

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
mac mini way because is actually

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.850 
mac mini way because is actually
designed<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.390> actually<00:01:57.630> sit<00:01:57.990> underneath<00:01:58.619> the
