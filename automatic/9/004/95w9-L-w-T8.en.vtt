from now on kind of just like whatever I

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.230 
from now on kind of just like whatever I
think<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.680> good<00:01:37.920> because<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.610> know<00:01:38.670> when<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.000> game

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
think is good because I know when a game

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.740 
think is good because I know when a game
was<00:01:39.390> good<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.720> exciting<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.570> he<00:01:42.570> says

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
was good and exciting so and he says

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.899
