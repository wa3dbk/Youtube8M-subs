pre-made ones or you can choose random

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.319 
pre-made ones or you can choose random
islands<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.190> we'll<00:00:47.309> just<00:00:47.430> do<00:00:47.550> random<00:00:47.760> island

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
islands so we'll just do random island

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.029 
islands so we'll just do random island
and<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.539> will<00:00:49.410> give<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.649> little<00:00:49.829> bit<00:00:49.920> more

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
and that will give you a little bit more

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.750 
and that will give you a little bit more
customized<00:00:50.489> ability<00:00:50.910> for<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.829> if<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.250> want

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
customized ability for it if you want

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.510 
customized ability for it if you want
you<00:00:54.600> can<00:00:54.809> mess<00:00:55.140> with<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.530> otherwise<00:00:56.219> you

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
you can mess with this otherwise you

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.920 
you can mess with this otherwise you
just<00:00:56.550> hit<00:00:56.850> generate<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.539> going<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.750> be<00:00:57.840> the

just hit generate it's going to be the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.840 
just hit generate it's going to be the
same<00:00:58.109> system<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.649> we<00:00:58.739> had<00:00:58.890> as<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.309> random

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850

always<00:01:05.159> have<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.489> little<00:01:05.640> volcano<00:01:07.400> so<00:01:08.400> we're

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
always have this little volcano so we're

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.210 
always have this little volcano so we're
going<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.820> let<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.000> load<00:01:09.650> okay<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:10.830> here<00:01:11.100> we

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
going to let that load okay so here we

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.310 
going to let that load okay so here we
are<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:12.000> can<00:01:12.119> see<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.390> user<00:01:12.570> interface<00:01:12.810> is

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
are you can see the user interface is

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.240 
are you can see the user interface is
pretty<00:01:13.380> simple<00:01:15.320> it's<00:01:16.320> going<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.680> be<00:01:16.860> fairly

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
pretty simple it's going to be fairly

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.830 
pretty simple it's going to be fairly
similar<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.700> if<00:01:17.909> you've<00:01:18.090> ever<00:01:18.240> used<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.630> map

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
similar to if you've ever used the map

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.510 
similar to if you've ever used the map
editor<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.350> like<00:01:19.470> rollercoaster<00:01:20.009> tycoon<00:01:20.040> or

editor and like rollercoaster tycoon or
anything<00:01:20.850> you're<00:01:20.970> going<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.180> have<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> race

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
anything you're going to have the race

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.960 
anything you're going to have the race
terrain<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.409> then<00:01:22.979> your<00:01:23.100> brush<00:01:23.280> size<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.549> over

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
terrain and then your brush size is over

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.219 
terrain and then your brush size is over
here<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.390> if<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.570> want<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.780> do<00:01:24.869> small<00:01:25.200> little

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
here so if you want to do small little

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.100 
here so if you want to do small little
Hills<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:26.700> can<00:01:26.850> do<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.240> if<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.530> want<00:01:28.710> larger

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
Hills you can do that if you want larger

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.050 
Hills you can do that if you want larger
just<00:01:31.110> hold<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.650> mouse<00:01:31.829> down<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.430> will<00:01:32.579> keep

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
just hold the mouse down it will keep

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.859 
just hold the mouse down it will keep
rising<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.630> however<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.960> want<00:01:35.450> you<00:01:36.450> can<00:01:36.630> fill

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
rising and however you want you can fill

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.600 
rising and however you want you can fill
in<00:01:37.049> if<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.409> have<00:01:37.530> these<00:01:37.680> internal<00:01:38.009> lakes<00:01:38.340> you

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
in if you have these internal lakes you

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.520 
in if you have these internal lakes you
can<00:01:38.759> use<00:01:38.909> just<00:01:39.299> raise<00:01:39.540> terrain<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.170> fill<00:01:40.380> those

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
can use just raise terrain to fill those

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.310 
can use just raise terrain to fill those
in

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.650 

and<00:01:44.580> that<00:01:45.580> works<00:01:45.760> the<00:01:45.910> other<00:01:45.940> way<00:01:46.090> as<00:01:46.210> well<00:01:46.480> if

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
and that works the other way as well if

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.830 
and that works the other way as well if
you<00:01:46.750> do<00:01:46.930> lower<00:01:47.500> terrain<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:49.360> will<00:01:49.540> actually

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
you do lower terrain that will actually

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.390 
you do lower terrain that will actually
create<00:01:50.110> a<00:01:50.200> lake<00:01:50.440> so<00:01:50.680> there's<00:01:50.860> no<00:01:50.980> separate

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
create a lake so there's no separate

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.280 
create a lake so there's no separate
option<00:01:51.730> for<00:01:51.940> creating<00:01:52.030> water<00:01:52.450> it's<00:01:52.840> just<00:01:52.990> if

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
option for creating water it's just if

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.960 
option for creating water it's just if
you<00:01:53.380> get<00:01:53.590> below<00:01:53.830> sea<00:01:54.220> level<00:01:54.580> when<00:01:54.850> you're

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
you get below sea level when you're

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.390 
you get below sea level when you're
lowering<00:01:55.180> the<00:01:55.360> terrain<00:01:55.920> you'll<00:01:56.920> have<00:01:57.130> water

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
lowering the terrain you'll have water

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.240 
lowering the terrain you'll have water
and<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.960> will<00:01:59.050> be<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.260> same<00:01:59.470> over<00:01:59.800> here<00:01:59.830> if

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
and that will be the same over here if

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.520 
and that will be the same over here if
you<00:02:00.280> want<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:00.790> coastline<00:02:01.270> to<00:02:01.300> be<00:02:01.630> smaller<00:02:02.110> you

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
you want the coastline to be smaller you

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.170 
you want the coastline to be smaller you
can<00:02:02.620> do<00:02:02.770> that<00:02:02.920> if<00:02:03.280> you<00:02:03.370> want<00:02:03.520> to<00:02:03.580> be<00:02:03.700> bigger<00:02:03.940> you

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
can do that if you want to be bigger you

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.690 
can do that if you want to be bigger you
can<00:02:04.300> fill<00:02:04.510> it<00:02:04.630> in<00:02:04.690> and<00:02:05.020> then<00:02:05.740> if<00:02:06.040> you<00:02:06.190> want<00:02:06.430> like

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
can fill it in and then if you want like

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.490 
can fill it in and then if you want like
say<00:02:06.880> you<00:02:06.940> lower<00:02:07.720> it<00:02:07.840> out<00:02:08.020> and<00:02:08.170> you<00:02:08.229> have<00:02:08.380> these

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
say you lower it out and you have these

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.680 
say you lower it out and you have these
trees<00:02:08.830> here<00:02:09.220> you're<00:02:10.030> going<00:02:10.179> to<00:02:10.240> just<00:02:10.450> go<00:02:10.630> to

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
trees here you're going to just go to

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.930 
trees here you're going to just go to
delete<00:02:11.110> objects<00:02:11.650> and<00:02:11.950> then<00:02:12.490> I'll<00:02:12.610> take<00:02:12.790> them

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
delete objects and then I'll take them

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.800 
delete objects and then I'll take them
all<00:02:13.030> out<00:02:13.590> so<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:15.400> next<00:02:15.610> option<00:02:15.850> here<00:02:16.480> well

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
all out so the next option here well

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.720 
all out so the next option here well
there's<00:02:16.990> level<00:02:17.350> terrain<00:02:17.709> so<00:02:18.130> that'll<00:02:18.459> be

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
there's level terrain so that'll be

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.140 
there's level terrain so that'll be
helpful<00:02:19.270> like<00:02:19.990> it<00:02:20.200> fits<00:02:20.640> get<00:02:21.640> that<00:02:21.790> annoying

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
helpful like it fits get that annoying

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.640 
helpful like it fits get that annoying
option<00:02:22.570> that<00:02:22.720> you<00:02:22.810> can't<00:02:23.020> build<00:02:23.200> something

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
option that you can't build something

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.440 
option that you can't build something
because<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.160> terrain<00:02:24.370> can't<00:02:24.760> be<00:02:24.880> leveled<00:02:25.270> you

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
because the terrain can't be leveled you

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.850 
because the terrain can't be leveled you
can<00:02:25.570> go<00:02:25.720> ahead<00:02:25.810> and<00:02:26.050> make<00:02:26.170> your<00:02:26.320> whole<00:02:26.620> map

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
can go ahead and make your whole map

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.270 
can go ahead and make your whole map
level<00:02:28.470> note<00:02:29.470> that<00:02:29.650> that<00:02:29.800> does<00:02:30.010> make<00:02:30.220> it

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
level note that that does make it

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.250 
level note that that does make it
perfectly<00:02:30.850> level<00:02:30.910> it<00:02:31.450> doesn't<00:02:31.810> like<00:02:31.990> just

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
perfectly level it doesn't like just

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.630 
perfectly level it doesn't like just
smooth<00:02:32.560> it<00:02:32.740> so<00:02:33.100> if<00:02:33.220> you<00:02:33.340> want<00:02:33.490> to<00:02:33.550> actually

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
smooth it so if you want to actually

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.180 
smooth it so if you want to actually
smooth<00:02:34.120> it<00:02:34.300> you<00:02:34.390> go<00:02:34.570> to<00:02:34.600> smooth<00:02:35.020> and<00:02:35.380> that<00:02:36.040> will

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
smooth it you go to smooth and that will

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.510 
smooth it you go to smooth and that will
for<00:02:36.370> example<00:02:36.400> make<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:38.470> gradients<00:02:39.100> on<00:02:39.370> these

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
for example make the gradients on these

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.479 
for example make the gradients on these
hills<00:02:39.730> a<00:02:39.940> little<00:02:40.180> less<00:02:40.330> steep<00:02:40.720> or<00:02:41.200> if<00:02:42.040> you<00:02:42.250> want

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
hills a little less steep or if you want

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.090 
hills a little less steep or if you want
to<00:02:42.870> after<00:02:43.870> you<00:02:43.989> raise<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.380> terrain<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:44.950> want

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
to after you raise the terrain you want

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.440 
to after you raise the terrain you want
to<00:02:45.220> make<00:02:45.340> a<00:02:45.370> little<00:02:45.610> a<00:02:45.820> little<00:02:46.090> bit<00:02:46.300> more

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
to make a little a little bit more

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.320 
to make a little a little bit more
natural<00:02:46.600> you<00:02:47.110> can<00:02:47.230> just<00:02:47.560> go<00:02:47.680> to<00:02:47.739> smooth<00:02:48.330> and

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
natural you can just go to smooth and

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.910 
natural you can just go to smooth and
that<00:02:49.480> will<00:02:49.570> create<00:02:49.690> more<00:02:49.930> natural<00:02:50.380> Hills<00:02:50.620> for

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
that will create more natural Hills for

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.670 
that will create more natural Hills for
you<00:02:51.540> if<00:02:52.540> you<00:02:52.720> want<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:52.989> change<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.470> terrain

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
you if you want to change the terrain

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.490 
you if you want to change the terrain
itself<00:02:54.130> you<00:02:54.670> go<00:02:54.820> right<00:02:55.239> here<00:02:55.600> it<00:02:55.989> will<00:02:56.050> be<00:02:56.200> the

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
itself you go right here it will be the

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.740 
itself you go right here it will be the
fifth<00:02:57.040> option<00:02:57.250> and<00:02:58.150> you<00:02:58.239> have<00:02:58.390> these<00:02:58.570> options

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
fifth option and you have these options

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.330 
fifth option and you have these options
so<00:02:59.050> you<00:02:59.140> have<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.410> sand<00:02:59.680> the<00:03:00.160> flowers<00:03:00.989> desert

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
so you have the sand the flowers desert

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.440 
so you have the sand the flowers desert
trees<00:03:03.340> this<00:03:03.640> is<00:03:03.730> going<00:03:03.850> to<00:03:03.910> be<00:03:03.970> how<00:03:04.090> if<00:03:04.360> you

trees this is going to be how if you
want<00:03:04.630> to<00:03:04.690> have<00:03:04.780> more<00:03:04.959> trees<00:03:05.320> you<00:03:06.280> go<00:03:06.489> in<00:03:06.790> this

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
want to have more trees you go in this

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.210 
want to have more trees you go in this
menu<00:03:07.510> for<00:03:07.750> terrain<00:03:08.019> types<00:03:08.290> so<00:03:08.470> you<00:03:08.500> can<00:03:08.709> add<00:03:08.920> a

menu for terrain types so you can add a

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.520 
menu for terrain types so you can add a
bunch<00:03:10.090> of<00:03:10.209> trees<00:03:10.450> here<00:03:10.810> a<00:03:10.840> bunch<00:03:11.200> of<00:03:11.290> trees

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
bunch of trees here a bunch of trees

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.160 
bunch of trees here a bunch of trees
here<00:03:11.799> and<00:03:11.860> then<00:03:12.570> that'll<00:03:13.570> have<00:03:13.720> plenty<00:03:14.080> of

so you can say iron for example I want a

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.289 
so you can say iron for example I want a
bunch<00:03:25.840> of<00:03:25.959> iron<00:03:26.190> mills<00:03:27.190> and<00:03:27.610> this<00:03:27.910> is<00:03:28.030> great

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
bunch of iron mills and this is great

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.030 
bunch of iron mills and this is great
because<00:03:28.900> it<00:03:29.049> doesn't<00:03:29.200> limit<00:03:29.440> you<00:03:29.590> you<00:03:29.890> can
