00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.450
 I am often asked what I am like that 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.350
 Join in when I'm in the wild 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:13.360
 I'm on the road to the film, of course 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.889
 painkillers or plaster with it 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.619
 but lately I always have 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.090
 these live patches with in one 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.150
 camera bag that's a combination 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.699
 from painkillers and plaster, so to speak 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.500
 which you can easily stick yourself 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.060
 Of course I did not stay with them 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.769
 the wild horses and these too 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.660
 treat but if I have 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.210
 somewhere I have a problem I use them 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.520
 to myself but how are you doing these patches 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.200
 Use at your own horse now 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.150
 can be acute or chronic 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.790
 to treat pain that shows you 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.850
 My wife has been around for many years 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.050
 years on the treatment of pain 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.270
 specializes and she certainly will 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.440
 some tips for application and 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.450
 then you can do it yourself 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.070
 Try it because we have a little 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.070
 test package put together for you 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.050
 I have here for demonstration purposes 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.910
 once the ramona brought the fresh 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.190
 from the pasture so not great 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.119
 cleaned or something and the only thing I did 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:18.400
 stop as preparation if I do 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.009
 then my horse wants to stick it is 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.729
 that the dust and loose hair 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:27.280
 once from the body bring down 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:31.710
 mostly a towel and go 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.710
 here once briefly over the horse 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.460
 so that everything is loose then easy 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.140
 once wiped off and that's 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.030
 everything I prepare for 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.509
 need and then I can stick to it 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.490
 pass over 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.590
 In the test, I have two patches 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.130
 these are the patches that i put 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:01.149
 Always use to treat pain 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.979
 chronic or even acute pain and 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.409
 we'll just start with the ice 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:10.299
 cluster that I show like this 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:13.739
 Eiswelt plaster on the horse to stick to it 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:18.070
 let's just go over to the ramona 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:20.769
 ramona has, inter alia, one 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.920
 problem in the front leg and thereby always 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:27.250
 pain in the foot joint below 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.930
 and here I bring some of these 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.989
 iceberg pavement 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:36.010
 Here I have a white and a brown one 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:38.290
 Paving and it is so that the brown 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.750
 plaster always glued left officiated 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.540
 will and the white plaster always 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:47.380
 I can rightfully glued to it here 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:53.070
 simply the protective film kink again 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:55.500
 and subtract and then I bring that 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:59.760
 just match here 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:03.990
 on the joint makes the problem like 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:07.280
 said brew once left and white 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:10.140
 the same height once right 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.140
 that's the glueing technique that i do 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.820
 use if I have joint pain 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.070
 I can of course to the 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.020
 but also on the front 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:23.480
 make background so that's the 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:27.090
 joint a parent is called that 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:32.660
 second technique when I make larger surfaces 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:34.890
 have or hurt the muscles 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.200
 Again, ramona is a good one again 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.530
 for example because your problematic is you 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.860
 has always been in the 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.570
 Shoulder muscles by that means 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.540
 she always has a problem in the left 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.190
 shoulder musculature and here I can 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.360
 again with left and right 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:56.940
 I just work 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.940
 I now find a point where that 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.680
 horse reacts here i have to 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.019
 a pain point in the 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.920
 Musculature and here I take too 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:13.739
 again the brown plaster is kink 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:15.810
 short and withdraws into the protection and 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.930
 then give it to the trigger point 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:23.070
 the left side now we have to go once 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:25.169
 change and I hope the camera is coming 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:29.790
 with the same position the horse 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:32.640
 a little bit around and about on the 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:37.350
 same height then I take the white 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:42.180
 plaster and stick it in parallel here as well 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:46.140
 To the brown on the muscles the ice world 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:49.860
 patches have the effect that the 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.870
 Muscles relaxed and the pain the 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.850
 she's in there now 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.479
 shoulder muscles that the 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.479
 is alleviated 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.820
 in acute pain, it is usually enough 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.160
 even if he alone only the icesave 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.650
 Vices used now is ramona 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.660
 example with chronic pain and 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.730
 I always like the effect 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.530
 that means I use it 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:16.110
 the second pavement what they set a review 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.230
 have the glutathione plaster this 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.630
 Glutathione plaster is one 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:23.880
 Glutathione is one 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.890
 active ingredient is an endogenous active substance 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.160
 and this plaster makes that one 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:31.770
 Active substance from the body of the horse body 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:34.740
 Increased production will be thereby 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:37.710
 the organs increase the organ services 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.870
 and the tissue what aches and pains 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.490
 Tension always poorly supplied with blood 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.650
 is and is poorly supplied with 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.960
 nutrients or even the transport of 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.420
 is toxins and slag materials 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.750
 diminished is thus better supplied 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:54.110
 so it is easier for the horse to 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:58.110
 to fight pain 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:06:03.510
 The glutathione plaster is a single one 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:07.830
 plaster and basically works the same way 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:09.690
 Treated like the ice world I plaster 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.460
 have the shared again here 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.680
 Adhesive area that means I can do that 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:17.340
 remove the film 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:19.590
 and now it is so that it is certain 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.540
 points per gm drives where I have these 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.980
 Install plaster very effectively 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.720
 can 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.520
 I have the best experience with it 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.410
 When I'm in the front area of ​​the 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.480
 horse, the problem does that 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.790
 The glutathione plaster also in the front 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.950
 area of ​​the horse if I bring 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:37.200
 the back worked on the horse so one 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.160
 backhand problematics then bring 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.220
 I put it on the back 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.710
 Now I have it here in the front area 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:46.550
 worked and then I glue that 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:53.190
 Glutathione plaster is always on top 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:57.050
 of the thorax so up here 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:57.050
 the chest short and at the neck approach 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.350
 I would work with the horse in the back 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.080
 So I have the problem behind 

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:09.820
 I would use the glutathione plaster here 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.820
 stick to the highest point of the group 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.380
 Many Thanks 

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.630
 and thank you also ramona for the 

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.639
 short demonstration here live 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:21.590
 patches these two main ones 

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:23.360
 We have livepages in the test package 

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:25.100
 of course, there are even more 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.229
 different plaster with 

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.130
 various application areas 

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:30.500
 later more 

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:33.080
 should now come up to ask 

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:36.470
 use of these livepages heike da 

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:38.270
 also in live webinars with tips 

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:40.610
 and advice to the side 

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:42.770
 and so only the around at 

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:45.800
 good health to the horse 

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:48.070
 and spend a nice time together 

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.070
 can
