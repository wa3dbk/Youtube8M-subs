00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
system so this is basically how it works

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.940

so<00:02:18.920> we're<00:02:19.100> going<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:19.280> use<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.550> SD<00:02:19.850> 501<00:02:20.330> as<00:02:20.510> an

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
so we're going to use the SD 501 as an

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:21.820 
so we're going to use the SD 501 as an
example<00:02:21.050> that's<00:02:21.170> actually<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.620> one<00:02:21.740> I'd

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
example that's actually the one I'd

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.300 
example that's actually the one I'd
celled<00:02:22.040> 90%<00:02:22.640> of<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.760> time<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:24.100> so<00:02:25.100> I<00:02:25.130> use

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
celled 90% of the time and so I use

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.220 
celled 90% of the time and so I use
myself<00:02:25.490> as<00:02:25.790> an<00:02:25.940> example<00:02:26.030> I<00:02:26.420> went<00:02:26.630> out<00:02:26.750> and<00:02:26.990> I
