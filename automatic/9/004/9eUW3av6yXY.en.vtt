00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:21.169 
got the iphone 3g doc though the box is
probably<00:01:19.350> twice<00:01:19.770> as<00:01:19.829> long<00:01:20.159> as<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:21.060> all

00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:21.179 
probably twice as long as this and all

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:22.879 
probably twice as long as this and all
it<00:01:21.240> was<00:01:21.270> was<00:01:21.389> the<00:01:21.630> dock<00:01:21.810> at<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.049> bottom<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.530> a

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:22.889 
it was was the dock at the bottom and a

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:25.249 
it was was the dock at the bottom and a
big<00:01:23.219> piece<00:01:23.429> of<00:01:23.490> cardboard<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:24.090> between<00:01:24.479> so

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
big piece of cardboard in between so

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.989 
big piece of cardboard in between so
they<00:01:25.590> definitely<00:01:25.710> cut<00:01:26.130> down<00:01:26.429> from<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:26.989 --> 00:01:26.999 
they definitely cut down from the

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:29.239 
they definitely cut down from the
packaging<00:01:27.389> on<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.600> phone<00:01:27.749> which<00:01:27.929> is<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.249> great

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:29.249 
packaging on the phone which is a great

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:31.389 
packaging on the phone which is a great
idea<00:01:29.399> so<00:01:29.999> you<00:01:30.119> open<00:01:30.359> it<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.539> those<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:30.810> tab

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
idea so you open it and those this tab

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:36.039 
idea so you open it and those this tab
and<00:01:32.399> pull<00:01:32.609> this<00:01:32.729> tab<00:01:32.969> I<00:01:33.350> know<00:01:34.350> here's<00:01:35.249> the<00:01:35.280> dock

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
and pull this tab I know here's the dock

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.819 
and pull this tab I know here's the dock

so the very small dock it's on the back
simple<00:01:41.340> 30<00:01:41.579> pin<00:01:41.819> and<00:01:42.149> the<00:01:42.299> line<00:01:42.600> out<00:01:42.630> which<00:01:43.439> is
