00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:09.410
 good a 0 to 0 I've wanted Martin 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.810
 predictable predictable completely 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:16.070
 we knew that he was going to play this 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:18.380
 we were not surprised by anything 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.020
 there is no novel approach there is no 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.910
 a risk taking by none 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.490
 of the two technicians can be understood 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.439
 from a perspective it's a final but 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.710
 also at the end they win by risking 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.570
 putting something different in agreement I think 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.760
 that at the end of accounts as well what 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.500
 mentions from the beginning the party 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.930
 is more than sung the two teams are 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.400
 they know too well and only that 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.070
 team that is encouraged to do something 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.019
 different will have to try to mark 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.489
 the difference I think apart from the 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:48.230
 Nervousness has not only ended 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.789
 remove from above have been very accurate 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.800
 mainly when they cross the middle 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:54.079
 terrain we are talking about that louis 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.789
 go more than 567 of touches but there are 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:00.469
 Tecos on a couple of occasions will get 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:02.180
 the best move that ends up flying around 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.729
 the subject we are seeing of course 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.770
 images of the highlights of this 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.550
 first time is yes so we have 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.800
 seen by what we know the teams of 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.790
 football are right now on 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.620
 the court have something more 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.600
 I think that if for example in the case of 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.810
 black lions I insist without rodrigo 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.580
 Soler this Brazilian shaved if he had 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.220
 a little bit more consistently 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.160
 you risk to generate a little more 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.450
 of defensive lack of control I think that 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.300
 technicians are the ones who are taking 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.370
 too many precautions when still on 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.900
 the field have greater potential and the 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.330
 people who come from behind normally the 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.190
 that gives you the surprise and when they have 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.140
 tried mainly by this sector 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.120
 left as you well mention the case 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.830
 of paulette have been imprecise to the 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.750
 time to get the ball to him he has 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.670
 made the journey to stand in a 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.140
 position in which I may have an option 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.610
 to make the ball but every time 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.860
 who transfer the ball or stay 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.840
 short or it stays very long and when this one 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.340
 it has arrived that the final has been scarce 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.650
 of account the play has not transcended 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.350
 older now the subject louis we said 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.170
 with the elements that are in banking of 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.560
 the two sets there are to raise a 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.020
 different party or definitely 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.120
 we have to accept that the second 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.070
 time and with the possibility of leaving 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.840
 Even overtime is going to be 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.960
 I believe that they will continue to be the same 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.370
 because the euro that has us on horseback 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.890
 forward although he is an expert in finals 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.600
 but they have not generated goal plays 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.580
 I have blocks of goal the equipment of an axis 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.560
 and on the other side I think it has stuck 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.140
 in the style of ayestarán one and he has left 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.420
 Of course I do not know if they are betting well 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.790
 you said it with possibility to play at 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.140
 The rival's mistake seems to me that's how it is 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.209
 raised the match of both technicians 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.740
 I do not get the impression that this is the case 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.840
 the fact that extra 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.670
 by the banks mainly 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.110
 to try to give a revulsive so that 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.300
 teams somehow increase 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.660
 its potential either from a look of one or 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.010
 from another of a few games of tecos 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.040
 it's clear to me that this has not happened 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.780
 with which good somehow 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.280
 let's hope they improve something because 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.590
 I finish being very precise of the match 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.220
 we already know that of being vent and heats 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:14.640
 Someone is not racketing 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.910
 we have now with open warrior is 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.910
 all right 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.750
 also attack men 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:27.230
 good the subject happens to abraham soccer 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.000
 in case it falls and simón by the 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.470
 circumstances that is caused by 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.180
 error that there are also no forcing 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.570
 too much the error the game is very 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.570
 slow 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.870
 of either of the two teams 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.269
 when you have the need to look for the 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.030
 goal how are you going to do it if that's a 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:48.000
 very good question because later it starts 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.569
 that story not of the short blanket 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.890
 for trying to attack or try to attack 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.319
 you obviously end up protecting yourself 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.970
 defensively good it seems that the 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.409
 teams are betting on this so 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.709
 soon to keep zero in his goal 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:04.140
 and then with some fleeting play or with 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:07.290
 some play from another party mark the 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.750
 difference or because you do not expect good then 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:13.489
 so far I agree with louis in 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:16.380
 that the party my dear castelo if 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.449
 let's say that it has fallen short for 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.030
 make a final that are very emotional 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:23.639
 always for this framework for this framework 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.220
 of people who have come to fill a 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:28.020
 stadium to a part of the city when 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.210
 less about is from jalisco that is 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.479
 expectant of what a team does with 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.610
 a lot of projection that falls well that generates 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:37.469
 many sympathies with a lot of image 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.849
 positive that black lions and you 

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:40.830
 you consider that they can be champion 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:42.419
 ascend without winning in the league not with 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.520
 the tie is still latent the possibility 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:46.500
 the possibility remains but good 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.650
 Well here we are going to continue 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.990
 [Applause] 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.170
 stadium is ready we come back after 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:05:01.760
 this cut 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:05:01.760
 [Music]
