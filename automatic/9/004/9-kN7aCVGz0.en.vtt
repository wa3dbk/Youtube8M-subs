00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
you don't have any icing sugar but

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.490 
you don't have any icing sugar but
you've<00:00:26.789> got<00:00:26.939> regular<00:00:27.420> sugar<00:00:27.810> or<00:00:28.019> in<00:00:28.109> this<00:00:28.230> case

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500

you've got regular sugar or in this case
castor<00:00:29.099> sugar<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.820> just<00:00:30.330> take<00:00:30.539> equal

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
castor sugar and just take equal

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.850 
castor sugar and just take equal
quantities<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.800> castor<00:00:32.250> sugar<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:33.860> corn

just stick the lid on like so and give

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.229 
just stick the lid on like so and give
it<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.960> good<00:00:52.050> old<00:00:52.170> whiz

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.440 

stick<00:00:56.840> my<00:00:56.989> hand<00:00:57.410> on<00:00:57.559> the<00:00:57.649> top<00:00:57.890> it's<00:00:58.399> about<00:00:58.670> you

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
stick my hand on the top it's about you

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.810 
stick my hand on the top it's about you
just<00:00:59.690> want<00:00:59.840> to<00:00:59.870> whiz<00:01:00.020> it<00:01:00.170> out<00:01:00.320> for<00:01:00.530> about<00:01:00.820> 15-20

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
just want to whiz it out for about 15-20

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.430 
just want to whiz it out for about 15-20
seconds<00:01:02.540> that<00:01:02.809> should<00:01:03.050> do<00:01:03.199> it

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.090 

and<00:01:06.440> actually<00:01:07.150> you<00:01:08.150> have<00:01:08.650> the<00:01:09.650> perfect

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
and actually you have the perfect

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.240 
and actually you have the perfect
texture<00:01:10.780> rising<00:01:11.780> sugar<00:01:12.170> which<00:01:12.770> you<00:01:12.950> can<00:01:13.100> then

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
texture rising sugar which you can then

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:20.109 
texture rising sugar which you can then
use<00:01:13.659> in<00:01:14.659> whichever<00:01:15.020> recipes<00:01:15.590> you<00:01:15.770> choose<00:01:19.119> so

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
use in whichever recipes you choose so

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.410 
use in whichever recipes you choose so
you<00:01:20.899> would<00:01:21.080> use<00:01:21.320> an<00:01:21.530> icing<00:01:21.950> sugar<00:01:22.190> for<00:01:22.700> salt<00:01:23.000> I

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
you would use an icing sugar for salt I

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.300 
you would use an icing sugar for salt I
think<00:01:23.690> you're<00:01:23.810> going<00:01:23.930> great<00:01:24.380> for<00:01:24.710> dusting

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
think you're going great for dusting

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.070 
think you're going great for dusting
things<00:01:25.610> when<00:01:25.850> you've<00:01:25.970> made<00:01:26.149> mistakes<00:01:26.330> if<00:01:26.960> you

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
things when you've made mistakes if you

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.169 
things when you've made mistakes if you
burnt<00:01:27.320> the<00:01:27.470> top<00:01:27.680> of<00:01:27.890> a<00:01:28.009> cake<00:01:28.310> you<00:01:28.850> just<00:01:29.030> have<00:01:29.149> to

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:29.179 
burnt the top of a cake you just have to

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:31.630 
burnt the top of a cake you just have to
cut<00:01:29.479> it<00:01:29.630> off<00:01:29.780> use<00:01:30.080> a<00:01:30.110> bread<00:01:30.380> knife<00:01:30.619> dust<00:01:31.429> it

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
cut it off use a bread knife dust it

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.820 
cut it off use a bread knife dust it
with<00:01:31.729> a<00:01:31.759> bit<00:01:31.910> of<00:01:31.940> icing<00:01:32.420> sugar<00:01:32.560> that's<00:01:33.560> going

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
with a bit of icing sugar that's going

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.350 
with a bit of icing sugar that's going
to<00:01:33.890> do<00:01:34.039> the<00:01:34.190> trick

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
to do the trick

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.230 
to do the trick
also<00:01:36.170> if<00:01:36.229> you<00:01:36.350> dose<00:01:36.979> lighter<00:01:37.490> things<00:01:37.910> I've

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
also if you dose lighter things I've

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.350 
also if you dose lighter things I've
done<00:01:38.800> fudge<00:01:39.800> in<00:01:39.979> the<00:01:40.160> past<00:01:40.399> for<00:01:40.640> example<00:01:41.149> where

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
done fudge in the past for example where

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.960 
done fudge in the past for example where
it's<00:01:41.960> really<00:01:42.289> important<00:01:42.800> to<00:01:42.890> use<00:01:43.130> a<00:01:43.580> lighter

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
it's really important to use a lighter

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.139 
it's really important to use a lighter
sugar<00:01:44.869> that's<00:01:45.530> actually<00:01:46.130> a<00:01:46.160> job<00:01:46.580> you're

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
sugar that's actually a job you're

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.660 
sugar that's actually a job you're
making<00:01:47.450> things<00:01:47.600> like<00:01:47.810> caramel<00:01:48.429> don't<00:01:49.429> use

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
making things like caramel don't use

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.240 
making things like caramel don't use
icing<00:01:50.149> sugar<00:01:50.360> it's<00:01:50.840> too<00:01:51.110> delicate<00:01:51.350> for<00:01:51.679> that<00:01:52.009> I

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
icing sugar it's too delicate for that I

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.700 
icing sugar it's too delicate for that I
think<00:01:52.700> you<00:01:52.820> get<00:01:52.940> the<00:01:53.000> basic<00:01:53.479> idea<00:01:53.929> and<00:01:54.140> I've

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
think you get the basic idea and I've

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.910 
think you get the basic idea and I've
just<00:01:54.950> had<00:01:55.069> a<00:01:55.190> thought<00:01:55.869> if<00:01:56.869> I<00:01:57.110> you<00:01:57.800> know

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
just had a thought if I you know

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.260 
just had a thought if I you know
whenever<00:01:58.130> you<00:01:58.310> make<00:01:58.399> a<00:01:58.460> frosting<00:01:59.060> cupcakes

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
whenever you make a frosting cupcakes

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.060 
whenever you make a frosting cupcakes
are<00:01:59.750> really<00:02:00.050> in<00:02:00.140> at<00:02:00.259> the<00:02:00.320> moment<00:02:00.500> if<00:02:00.740> you<00:02:00.860> make

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
are really in at the moment if you make

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.359 
are really in at the moment if you make
up<00:02:01.280> you<00:02:01.759> know<00:02:01.850> vanilla<00:02:02.149> frosting<00:02:03.159> you<00:02:04.159> will

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
up you know vanilla frosting you will

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.520 
up you know vanilla frosting you will
find<00:02:04.759> that<00:02:05.000> you<00:02:05.299> know<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:05.509> big<00:02:05.720> granulated

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
find that you know the big granulated

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.240 
find that you know the big granulated
sugar<00:02:06.560> is<00:02:06.979> too<00:02:07.220> harsh<00:02:07.549> for<00:02:07.820> that<00:02:08.500> so<00:02:09.500> you<00:02:10.130> know

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
sugar is too harsh for that so you know

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.680 
sugar is too harsh for that so you know
he<00:02:10.429> just<00:02:10.640> mix<00:02:10.820> that<00:02:10.970> with<00:02:11.239> a<00:02:11.269> bit<00:02:11.420> of<00:02:11.450> butter

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
he just mix that with a bit of butter

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.110 
he just mix that with a bit of butter
it's<00:02:12.680> beautiful<00:02:13.310> and<00:02:13.430> again<00:02:13.730> if<00:02:13.940> you're

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
it's beautiful and again if you're

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.120 
it's beautiful and again if you're
looking<00:02:14.150> at<00:02:14.510> a<00:02:14.600> Victoria<00:02:15.170> sponge<00:02:15.380> you

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
looking at a Victoria sponge you

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.800 
looking at a Victoria sponge you
wouldn't<00:02:16.430> want<00:02:16.579> to<00:02:16.640> use<00:02:16.700> a<00:02:16.880> granulated<00:02:17.780> sugar

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810
