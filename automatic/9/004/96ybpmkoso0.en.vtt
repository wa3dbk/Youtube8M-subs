from the vegetables and then in a few
minutes<00:01:56.460> I'm<00:01:56.640> going<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.850> add<00:01:57.060> some<00:01:57.420> tomatoes

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
minutes I'm going to add some tomatoes

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.600 
minutes I'm going to add some tomatoes
and<00:01:58.110> then<00:01:58.320> I'm<00:01:58.409> going<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.619> be<00:01:58.770> adding<00:01:58.979> about

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
and then I'm going to be adding about

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.870 
and then I'm going to be adding about
half<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.090> bag<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.329> frozen<00:02:01.170> peas<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.579> I'm

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
half a bag of frozen peas to that so I'm

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.980 
half a bag of frozen peas to that so I'm
at<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.210> point<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.630> think<00:02:03.689> we'll<00:02:03.930> probably

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
at that point I think we'll probably

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.899 
at that point I think we'll probably
just<00:02:04.229> add<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.500> little<00:02:04.740> bit<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:04.920> water<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.520> I

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
just add a little bit of water to it I

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.880 
just add a little bit of water to it I
don't<00:02:06.659> want<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.899> add<00:02:07.020> too<00:02:07.200> much<00:02:07.320> water<00:02:07.500> this<00:02:07.740> is

don't want to add too much water this is

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.830 
don't want to add too much water this is
not<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.099> really<00:02:08.520> really<00:02:08.759> curious<00:02:09.119> dish<00:02:09.509> but<00:02:09.810> you

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
not a really really curious dish but you

can<00:02:10.110> add<00:02:10.550> as<00:02:11.550> much<00:02:11.730> water<00:02:12.000> as<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.300> want<00:02:12.480> but<00:02:12.599> I

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
can add as much water as you want but I

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.960 
can add as much water as you want but I
like

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
to 1/3 cup of water and that's it

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.020 
to 1/3 cup of water and that's it
here's<00:02:58.300> 1/3<00:02:58.720> cup<00:02:58.900> of<00:02:59.020> water

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.030 

which<00:03:03.600> is<00:03:03.750> really<00:03:03.930> all<00:03:04.110> it<00:03:04.260> needs<00:03:04.470> I'm<00:03:04.800> going

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
to give it a good stir put the lid on so

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.090 
to give it a good stir put the lid on so
we're<00:03:09.300> going<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.480> cook<00:03:09.720> this<00:03:09.960> on<00:03:10.200> a<00:03:10.290> low<00:03:10.740> to<00:03:10.800> low

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
we're going to cook this on a low to low

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.680 
we're going to cook this on a low to low
medium<00:03:11.670> heat<00:03:11.910> just<00:03:12.120> until<00:03:12.390> it<00:03:12.660> starts

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
medium heat just until it starts

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.050 
medium heat just until it starts
sizzling<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.530> boiling<00:03:13.860> a<00:03:13.950> bit<00:03:14.100> once<00:03:14.760> it<00:03:14.910> does

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
sizzling and boiling a bit once it does

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.790 
sizzling and boiling a bit once it does
that<00:03:15.090> we're<00:03:15.450> going<00:03:15.570> to<00:03:15.630> put<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:15.960> on<00:03:16.050> in<00:03:16.470> between

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
that we're going to put it on in between

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.290 
that we're going to put it on in between
two<00:03:17.070> and<00:03:17.100> three<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:17.730> let<00:03:17.880> that<00:03:18.030> cook<00:03:18.240> for

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
two and three and let that cook for

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.360 
two and three and let that cook for
about<00:03:18.570> ten<00:03:18.990> minutes<00:03:19.170> and<00:03:19.500> then<00:03:19.560> we'll<00:03:20.190> come

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
about ten minutes and then we'll come

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.220 
about ten minutes and then we'll come
back<00:03:20.520> and<00:03:20.700> check<00:03:20.760> on<00:03:21.030> it<00:03:21.060> doesn't<00:03:21.780> it<00:03:21.840> look<00:03:21.959> so

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
back and check on it doesn't it look so

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.550 
back and check on it doesn't it look so
colorful<00:03:23.660> okay<00:03:24.660> so<00:03:24.720> it's<00:03:24.959> been<00:03:25.020> about<00:03:25.290> 10

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
colorful okay so it's been about 10

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.320 
colorful okay so it's been about 10
minutes<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:26.040> I<00:03:26.130> had<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.610> lid<00:03:26.790> on<00:03:26.910> it<00:03:27.090> so<00:03:27.240> it

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
minutes and I had the lid on it so it

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.500 
minutes and I had the lid on it so it
was<00:03:27.450> nice<00:03:27.600> and<00:03:27.840> covered<00:03:28.020> and<00:03:28.820> I<00:03:29.820> put<00:03:30.330> it<00:03:30.480> down

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
was nice and covered and I put it down

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.750 
was nice and covered and I put it down
on<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:31.350> now<00:03:31.590> so<00:03:31.890> you<00:03:31.950> should<00:03:32.100> definitely<00:03:32.610> have

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
on to now so you should definitely have

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.630 
on to now so you should definitely have
it<00:03:32.940> on<00:03:33.060> one<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:34.080> two<00:03:34.350> this<00:03:35.280> will<00:03:35.459> take<00:03:35.610> a

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
it on one to two this will take a

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.520 
it on one to two this will take a
process<00:03:36.120> because<00:03:36.330> you<00:03:36.570> do<00:03:36.720> have<00:03:36.750> potatoes<00:03:37.380> in

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
process because you do have potatoes in

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.229 
process because you do have potatoes in
there<00:03:37.650> so<00:03:37.860> potatoes<00:03:38.250> do<00:03:38.459> take<00:03:38.640> some<00:03:38.880> time<00:03:39.060> to

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
there so potatoes do take some time to

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.340 
there so potatoes do take some time to
cook<00:03:39.390> but<00:03:39.750> with<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:41.250> tomatoes<00:03:42.320> juicing<00:03:43.320> now

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
cook but with the tomatoes juicing now

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.320 
cook but with the tomatoes juicing now
I'm<00:03:43.920> becoming<00:03:44.220> more<00:03:44.489> of<00:03:44.580> a<00:03:44.640> juice<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:45.270> a

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330
