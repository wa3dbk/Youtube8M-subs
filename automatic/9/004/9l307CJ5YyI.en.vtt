00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.379
 oil art was developed to protect 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.080
 and restore power to productivity 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.080
 reliability of your diesel engine. 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.809
 besides guaranteeing all the qualities of the 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.080
 and this is only possible because 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.340
 it eliminates you and avoids 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.410
 microorganisms and the oxidation of 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.689
 reducing fuel consumption 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.619
 maintaining the consumption and 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.830
 performance 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.529
 Furthermore here O has easy application and 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.680
 prolonged action but you really need 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.750
 treat the system say yes why not 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.480
 matter the quality of the diesel that you 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.489
 purchase from the time it leaves the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.170
 refinery and goes to the tanks the 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.050
 already starting to suffer 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.390
 degradation and when the 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.390
 biodiesel this natural process is 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.640
 intensifies when the diesel is in the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.930
 tank of the filling station and in the 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.600
 your engine tank 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.699
 this process continues and this degradation 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.370
 happens in two ways 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.260
 one is the phenomenon of condensation 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.020
 takes place inside the tanks of 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.630
 storage and vehicles and equipment 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.330
 climatic conditions gave rise to 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.760
 temperature inside the tank as the 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.830
 diesel oil contains dissolved water and the 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.000
 humid air penetrates inside the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.700
 shells 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.600
 with this there is an accumulation of water at the top 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.479
 two tanks 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.729
 this water condenses and falls along with 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.729
 pieces of metal in the fuel itself 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.860
 it brings a lot of problems such as 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.030
 development of microorganisms 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.460
 bacteria yeasts the oxidation of the 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.690
 due to the presence of air and 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.940
 water in tanks 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.759
 corrosion of metal tanks and 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.220
 erosion in addition to the plastic tanks 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.409
 thermal shock caused by the return of 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.750
 hot fuel in the tank it generates 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.540
 also degrading condensation 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.340
 fuel and forming the good 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.710
 the other factor that influences the 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.679
 performance of your engine is itself 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.050
 composition of diesel fuels with 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.750
 the increase in biofuel content 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.640
 added diesel fuel and the reduction of 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.680
 sulfur content with the natural element 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.060
 which avoids the proliferation of 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:25.600
 microorganisms on the day cos 1800 s 500 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.090
 and s10 the formation of sludge and sediments 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.970
 tends to increase more and more 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.580
 as a consequence we have the obstruction of 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.610
 all fuel system spouts 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.459
 Injection pipes pipes and 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.950
 researcher this degradation impairs the 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.079
 performance of the engines which generates loss 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.360
 of power and makes it possible to 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.820
 increase in fuel consumption 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.660
 the exchange of filters and the costs of 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.579
 maintenance and this is a problem that is 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.799
 compulsory and gradual, requiring each 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:59.350
 more periodic maintenance in 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:02.170
 smaller spaces of time and care 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.930
 such as tank drainage 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.510
 care in storage and 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.519
 smaller storage to solve 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.630
 all these problems 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:16.720
 rely on a single solution art oil one 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.989
 multifunctional product and has nine 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.390
 of chemical components to treat 22 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.480
 one-time problems 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.299
 in practice what art does and is 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.299
 eliminate and prevent the reappearance of 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:34.480
 improving the lubricity of the 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:36.760
 to form a nano film of 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.390
 protection that prevents corrosion of the 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.850
 diesel 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.040
 use the particles of water and will 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.680
 them to be disposed of with the 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.840
 protect the pumps and injectors 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.720
 restoring the performance of engines 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.720
 increase the service life of the 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.450
 fuel from 30 days to 9 months 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.670
 avoid the formation of paraffin and 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.790
 crystallization of the fuel and 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.489
 transform the sludge into something so soluble 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.860
 that makes it back to fuel 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:10.220
 no matter what type of motor the 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.239
 diesel oil here is the best solution for 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.270
 protect it 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:16.070
 he is the only additive who has trusted AIDS 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.820
 homologated in brazil 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.829
 use oil art and see results 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.800
 tanks protected against corrosion and 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:27.350
 Erosion clean and good diesel system 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.130
 operation and performance of the engine 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:34.250
 restored actioil is a product of easy 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.260
