00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.970
 and you are welcome 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.410
 There is a new skin and that 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.719
 champion chips ivana as we have often done 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.759
 call for championship and championship 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.290
 TrÃ¤sch had now this 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.870
 bitch we see a lot of little ones 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.300
 details starting with the hair at 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.430
 the clown and of course the 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.220
 Now they are like real kites 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.869
 feet off and of course we have for the 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.550
 Comparison between the classic 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.320
 shimano and the new skin why the 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.910
 Shadow here so does not flicker 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.760
 but we go right through the 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:37.079
 animation with controls 1 vc both 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.820
 their hands together and pretend to be 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.670
 dragon after the schnapps control two 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.230
 the crowns of the dance are beautiful 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.020
 just see so we see generally 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.800
 now only from the control 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.300
 animation is all the same synonymous 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.530
 laugh was great sic months to go now 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.570
 the ability through them has me 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.579
 beaten their hands lit the red 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.680
 my hands are bright blue and me 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.059
 they turn bluish now we look 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.399
 the reality to us 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.830
 I have a blue circle around me 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.830
 around lights and here comes a stopped 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.320
 In any case we notice everything 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.770
 The classic cubana blue is one 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.310
 the other way around, everything that we otis here 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:24.710
 is with me there you have the kite 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.479
 blue dragon and a red dragon 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:32.189
 I think both have definitely been 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:35.750
 it will cost and has 950 skin 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.750
 he actually has the kites dancing 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:46.409
 So also the animation here are the same 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.180
 So we see the color is different 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.909
 but skills are the same and the 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:55.710
 animation otherwise 59 becomes the child 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:57.689
 would cost greven wants migros no 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.369
 others that are here so encircled here 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.030
 the new but I hope you have it 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.119
 like 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.950
 i think the chin is ok i am 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:11.819
 too bad that no new rickey animation 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:13.410
 but that was confused 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.180

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.430
