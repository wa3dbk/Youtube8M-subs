00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
use that so I've started off putting

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.149 
use that so I've started off putting
basically<00:01:41.119> the<00:01:41.299> juiciest

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.029

the most juicy vegetables at the bottom

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:53.490 
the most juicy vegetables at the bottom
we<00:01:51.039> have<00:01:51.189> our<00:01:51.369> lemons<00:01:51.960> cucumbers<00:01:52.960> and<00:01:53.259> apples

and<00:01:54.130> you<00:01:54.369> can<00:01:54.789> see<00:01:54.939> it<00:01:55.030> pretty<00:01:55.450> much<00:01:55.719> fills<00:01:56.200> the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
and you can see it pretty much fills the

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.160 
and you can see it pretty much fills the
blender<00:01:56.920> so<00:01:57.700> what<00:01:57.850> I<00:01:57.880> do<00:01:58.030> is<00:01:58.479> I<00:01:58.509> start<00:01:58.719> with

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
blender so what I do is I start with

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.380 
blender so what I do is I start with
that<00:01:59.439> and<00:01:59.740> I<00:01:59.829> add<00:01:59.979> a<00:02:00.009> little<00:02:00.130> bit<00:02:00.490> of<00:02:00.609> water<00:02:01.030> if

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
that and I add a little bit of water if

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.330 
that and I add a little bit of water if
I<00:02:01.509> need<00:02:01.719> to<00:02:01.869> usually<00:02:02.319> I<00:02:02.350> do<00:02:02.469> so<00:02:02.890> I<00:02:02.920> just<00:02:03.009> go

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
I need to usually I do so I just go

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.480 
I need to usually I do so I just go
ahead<00:02:03.399> and<00:02:03.670> do<00:02:03.789> that<00:02:04.409> maybe<00:02:05.409> a<00:02:05.560> you<00:02:06.099> know<00:02:06.219> half

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
ahead and do that maybe a you know half

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.350 
ahead and do that maybe a you know half
a<00:02:06.609> cup<00:02:06.849> and<00:02:07.840> I<00:02:08.379> blend<00:02:08.739> that<00:02:09.039> and<00:02:09.340> and<00:02:10.149> then

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
a cup and I blend that and and then

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.500 
a cup and I blend that and and then
it'll<00:02:11.260> shrink<00:02:12.220> down<00:02:12.459> and<00:02:12.760> then<00:02:12.849> I<00:02:12.940> can<00:02:13.000> add

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
it'll shrink down and then I can add

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.759 
it'll shrink down and then I can add
more<00:02:16.440> so<00:02:17.440> here<00:02:17.739> is<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.190> blended<00:02:19.769> lemon

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
more so here is the blended lemon

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.280 
more so here is the blended lemon
cucumber<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:21.489> apple<00:02:21.819> and<00:02:22.000> then<00:02:22.780> I<00:02:22.840> just<00:02:23.110> add

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
cucumber and apple and then I just add

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.660 
cucumber and apple and then I just add
to<00:02:23.319> that<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.769> rest<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:24.099> the<00:02:24.190> ingredients<00:02:26.670> all

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
to that the rest of the ingredients all

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.770 
to that the rest of the ingredients all
the<00:02:27.970> celery<00:02:32.519> and<00:02:33.519> this<00:02:33.670> is<00:02:33.790> a<00:02:33.819> Vitamix<00:02:34.360> so<00:02:34.569> it

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
the celery and this is a Vitamix so it

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.289 
the celery and this is a Vitamix so it
will<00:02:35.019> blend<00:02:35.349> things<00:02:35.819> really<00:02:36.819> well<00:02:36.970> if<00:02:37.150> you're

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
will blend things really well if you're

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.020 
will blend things really well if you're
using<00:02:37.329> a<00:02:37.690> regular<00:02:37.870> blender<00:02:38.489> you<00:02:39.489> might<00:02:39.700> want

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
using a regular blender you might want

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.580 
using a regular blender you might want
to<00:02:40.650> blend<00:02:41.650> it<00:02:41.799> in<00:02:41.920> batches<00:02:42.549> or<00:02:42.870> even<00:02:43.870> decrease

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
to blend it in batches or even decrease

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.740 
to blend it in batches or even decrease
the<00:02:44.769> amount<00:02:44.859> for<00:02:45.489> this<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.940> fit<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.329> size<00:02:46.510> of

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
the amount for this to fit the size of

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.569 
the amount for this to fit the size of
your<00:02:46.870> blender<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:47.590> do<00:02:47.890> it<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:48.190> you<00:02:48.430> know<00:02:48.549> a

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
your blender and do it and you know a

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.500 
your blender and do it and you know a
couple<00:02:48.640> different<00:02:49.180> batches<00:02:49.359> so<00:02:51.000> I<00:02:52.000> add

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
couple different batches so I add

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.270 
couple different batches so I add
everything<00:02:52.750> else<00:02:52.989> in<00:02:53.319> and<00:02:53.739> I'll<00:02:53.889> blend<00:02:54.099> that

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
everything else in and I'll blend that

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:01.850 
everything else in and I'll blend that
up

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.830 

so<00:03:02.860> here<00:03:03.129> is<00:03:03.310> what<00:03:03.489> it<00:03:03.610> looks<00:03:03.790> like<00:03:04.000> totally

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
so here is what it looks like totally

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.780 
so here is what it looks like totally
blended<00:03:05.200> it<00:03:05.379> pretty<00:03:05.620> much<00:03:05.800> fills<00:03:06.190> one<00:03:06.550> full

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
blended it pretty much fills one full

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.320 
blended it pretty much fills one full
Vitamix<00:03:07.300> and<00:03:07.510> that's<00:03:07.690> about<00:03:07.959> 8<00:03:08.260> cups<00:03:08.590> and<00:03:09.330> now

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
Vitamix and that's about 8 cups and now

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.050 
Vitamix and that's about 8 cups and now
I'm<00:03:10.390> going<00:03:10.540> to<00:03:10.599> show<00:03:10.780> you<00:03:10.840> how<00:03:11.080> to<00:03:11.110> use<00:03:11.769> a<00:03:12.700> nut

maybe see a couple cups worth and then

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.480 
maybe see a couple cups worth and then
you<00:03:48.140> pull<00:03:48.410> the<00:03:48.560> string<00:03:48.800> on<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.040> bag<00:03:49.190> if<00:03:49.400> you

end up getting a nut milk bag without a
string<00:03:51.530> you<00:03:51.680> just<00:03:51.890> kind<00:03:52.070> of<00:03:52.130> grasp<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:52.730> top

if you have a dehydrator you can make a

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.740 
if you have a dehydrator you can make a
cracker<00:04:41.110> out<00:04:41.290> of<00:04:41.530> it<00:04:41.680> or<00:04:42.120> you<00:04:43.120> can<00:04:43.150> put<00:04:43.360> it<00:04:43.660> in

cracker out of it or you can put it in
your<00:04:43.870> compost<00:04:45.180> so<00:04:46.180> that<00:04:46.390> is<00:04:46.600> how<00:04:47.550> we<00:04:48.550> make<00:04:48.700> the

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
your compost so that is how we make the

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.700 
your compost so that is how we make the
green<00:04:49.060> juice<00:04:49.360> and<00:04:49.630> you'll<00:04:50.260> do<00:04:50.380> that<00:04:50.530> in

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
green juice and you'll do that in

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.620 
green juice and you'll do that in
batches<00:04:51.250> so<00:04:51.490> you'll<00:04:51.700> do<00:04:51.820> the<00:04:51.940> last<00:04:52.120> part<00:04:52.480> in

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
batches so you'll do the last part in

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.620 
batches so you'll do the last part in
batches<00:04:53.080> you'll<00:04:53.410> you'll<00:04:54.360> drain<00:04:55.360> it<00:04:55.480> through

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
batches you'll you'll drain it through

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.680 
batches you'll you'll drain it through
the<00:04:55.720> nut<00:04:55.870> milk<00:04:56.020> bag<00:04:56.940> empty<00:04:57.940> the<00:04:58.030> pulp<00:04:58.270> out<00:04:58.450> and

the nut milk bag empty the pulp out and

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.990 
the nut milk bag empty the pulp out and
then<00:04:59.140> do<00:04:59.890> another<00:04:59.980> batch<00:05:00.340> and<00:05:00.640> you<00:05:00.730> should<00:05:00.880> end

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
then do another batch and you should end

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.850 
then do another batch and you should end
up<00:05:01.090> with<00:05:01.150> a<00:05:01.300> very<00:05:01.780> large<00:05:02.230> green<00:05:02.740> juice<00:05:03.040> enjoy
