now<00:00:00.750> that<00:00:00.900> we<00:00:00.989> have<00:00:01.140> our<00:00:01.290> material<00:00:01.740> all

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
now that we have our material all

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.400 
now that we have our material all
weighed<00:00:02.100> out<00:00:02.129> we<00:00:02.610> need<00:00:02.820> to<00:00:03.000> mix<00:00:03.449> the<00:00:03.929> dry

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
weighed out we need to mix the dry

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.760 
weighed out we need to mix the dry
materials<00:00:05.069> before<00:00:05.460> we<00:00:05.549> add<00:00:05.730> any<00:00:06.000> water<00:00:06.770> the

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
materials before we add any water the

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.290 
materials before we add any water the
reason<00:00:08.040> we<00:00:08.130> need<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:08.400> do<00:00:08.550> that<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:08.910> so<00:00:09.059> that<00:00:09.179> we

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
reason we need to do that is so that we

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:09.530 
reason we need to do that is so that we
can

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
can

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.870 
can
homogenize<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:10.860> thoroughly<00:00:11.160> distribute<00:00:11.759> all

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
homogenize and thoroughly distribute all

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.280 
homogenize and thoroughly distribute all
the<00:00:11.910> different<00:00:12.300> kinds<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.660> materials<00:00:13.049> that<00:00:13.170> we

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
the different kinds of materials that we

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.410 
the different kinds of materials that we
put<00:00:13.469> into<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.799> bucket<00:00:14.219> before<00:00:14.759> we<00:00:15.150> add<00:00:15.269> the

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
put into the bucket before we add the

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.060 
put into the bucket before we add the
water<00:00:15.599> if<00:00:15.870> we<00:00:15.929> just<00:00:16.199> add<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.560> water<00:00:16.740> now

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
water if we just add the water now

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.730 
water if we just add the water now
they'll<00:00:17.730> solidify<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.750> kind<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.080> in<00:00:19.350> strata

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
they'll solidify and kind of in strata

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.670 
they'll solidify and kind of in strata
in<00:00:20.039> layers<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:21.359> it'll<00:00:21.810> be<00:00:21.930> really<00:00:22.109> difficult

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
in layers and it'll be really difficult

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.070 
in layers and it'll be really difficult
to<00:00:23.220> thoroughly<00:00:23.760> mix<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.510> get<00:00:24.630> all<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:24.960> those

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
to thoroughly mix and get all of those

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.470 
to thoroughly mix and get all of those
materials<00:00:25.289> blended<00:00:26.160> once<00:00:26.340> we<00:00:26.580> once<00:00:27.119> we<00:00:27.330> add

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
materials blended once we once we add

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.820 
materials blended once we once we add
the<00:00:27.510> water<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.109> we<00:00:28.140> want<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.500> mix<00:00:28.680> it

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
the water so we want to mix it

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.400 
the water so we want to mix it
thoroughly<00:00:29.010> first<00:00:30.019> there<00:00:31.019> are<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.109> couple<00:00:31.260> of

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
thoroughly first there are a couple of

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.040 
thoroughly first there are a couple of
different<00:00:31.679> ways<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:32.009> do<00:00:32.189> this<00:00:32.430> behind<00:00:33.270> me<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.480> a

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
different ways to do this behind me is a

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.920 
different ways to do this behind me is a
commercial<00:00:34.829> clay<00:00:35.100> mixer<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:36.329> can<00:00:36.600> be<00:00:36.719> used

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
commercial clay mixer this can be used

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.670 
commercial clay mixer this can be used
to<00:00:37.079> mix<00:00:37.380> clay<00:00:37.710> wet<00:00:38.100> or<00:00:38.399> dry<00:00:38.930> the<00:00:39.930> drawbacks<00:00:40.410> to

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
to mix clay wet or dry the drawbacks to

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.100 
to mix clay wet or dry the drawbacks to
using<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:41.250> machine<00:00:41.879> are<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.600> it's

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
using this machine are that it's

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.229 
using this machine are that it's
expensive<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.860> not<00:00:44.040> everybody<00:00:44.489> has<00:00:44.700> one<00:00:44.969> and

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
expensive and not everybody has one and

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.020 
expensive and not everybody has one and
that<00:00:46.200> if<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.739> mix<00:00:46.950> use<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.489> mix<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.850> dry

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
that if you mix use it to mix the dry

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.729 
that if you mix use it to mix the dry
material<00:00:48.239> it's<00:00:48.809> going<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.020> make<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.200> big<00:00:49.469> cloud

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
material it's going to make a big cloud

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.639 
material it's going to make a big cloud
of<00:00:49.950> dust<00:00:50.600> so<00:00:51.600> as<00:00:51.750> an<00:00:51.899> alternative<00:00:52.350> we're<00:00:52.559> gonna

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
of dust so as an alternative we're gonna

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.040 
of dust so as an alternative we're gonna
use<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.010> five-gallon<00:00:53.610> bucket<00:00:53.969> because<00:00:54.750> with

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
use the five-gallon bucket because with

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.270 
use the five-gallon bucket because with
the<00:00:55.140> five-gallon<00:00:55.739> bucket<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.219> a

the five-gallon bucket and a
tight-fitting<00:00:56.850> lid<00:00:57.059> we<00:00:57.719> can<00:00:57.960> seal<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
tight-fitting lid we can seal the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.670 
tight-fitting lid we can seal the
material<00:00:59.460> up<00:00:59.609> inside<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.180> bucket<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.780> for<00:01:01.649> a

material up inside the bucket and for a

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.039 
material up inside the bucket and for a
small<00:01:01.949> batch<00:01:02.160> we<00:01:02.399> can<00:01:02.520> just<00:01:02.699> shake<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.000> up<00:01:03.239> or

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
small batch we can just shake it up or

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.530 
small batch we can just shake it up or
we<00:01:04.320> can<00:01:04.559> potentially<00:01:05.070> roll<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.270> back<00:01:06.510> and

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
we can potentially roll it back and

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.380 
we can potentially roll it back and
forth<00:01:06.780> across<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.560> floor

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.730 

we<00:01:12.390> work<00:01:12.600> better<00:01:12.780> if<00:01:12.960> there<00:01:13.080> wasn't<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> handle

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
we work better if there wasn't a handle

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.090 
we work better if there wasn't a handle
in<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.950> way<00:01:14.100> shake<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.909> up<00:01:15.650> in<00:01:16.650> order<00:01:16.890> to

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
in the way shake it up in order to

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.240 
in the way shake it up in order to
modernize<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.909> material<00:01:18.479> now<00:01:19.409> if<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.100> was

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
modernize this material now if I was

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.460 
modernize this material now if I was
going<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.490> create<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.030> larger<00:01:21.600> batch<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:22.320> could

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
going to create a larger batch it could

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.039 
going to create a larger batch it could
do<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.590> same<00:01:22.740> thing<00:01:22.950> using<00:01:23.909> this<00:01:24.210> large

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
do the same thing using this large

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.160 
do the same thing using this large
barrel<00:01:25.640> a<00:01:26.640> barrel<00:01:27.420> like<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:28.020> has<00:01:28.140> a

tightly locking lid roll it back and

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.870 
tightly locking lid roll it back and
forth<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:31.590> could<00:01:31.979> do<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.250> with<00:01:32.460> several

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
forth you could do this with several

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.330 
forth you could do this with several

thoroughly mixed inside the bucket we
want<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.310> slake<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.820> down<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.240> water<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:48.869> that

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
want to slake it down in water so that

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.870 
want to slake it down in water so that
it<00:01:49.110> becomes<00:01:49.380> completely<00:01:49.979> saturated<00:01:50.610> with

water I'm not concerned at the moment
with<00:01:54.659> exactly<00:01:55.290> how<00:01:55.530> much<00:01:55.710> water<00:01:55.979> I'm<00:01:56.159> going<00:01:56.310> to

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
with exactly how much water I'm going to

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.950 
with exactly how much water I'm going to
put<00:01:56.579> in<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.820> because<00:01:57.180> we're<00:01:57.719> going<00:01:57.899> to

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
put in it because we're going to

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.830 
put in it because we're going to
actually<00:01:58.200> add<00:01:58.680> more<00:01:58.710> than<00:01:59.189> we<00:01:59.520> need<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.210> we're

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
actually add more than we need and we're

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.050 
actually add more than we need and we're
going<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.020> add<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.500> slowly<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:02.969> it

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
going to add it slowly so that it

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.219 
going to add it slowly so that it
doesn't<00:02:04.820> send<00:02:05.820> dust<00:02:06.119> up<00:02:06.329> in<00:02:06.479> our<00:02:06.600> face<00:02:06.869> and

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
doesn't send dust up in our face and

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.170 
doesn't send dust up in our face and
I'm<00:02:08.619> gonna<00:02:08.800> have<00:02:09.009> to<00:02:09.160> let<00:02:09.280> this<00:02:09.520> sit<00:02:09.880> for<00:02:09.910> a

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
I'm gonna have to let this sit for a

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.920 
I'm gonna have to let this sit for a
while<00:02:10.420> while<00:02:11.380> we<00:02:11.800> while<00:02:12.490> the<00:02:12.670> water

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
while while we while the water

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.950 
while while we while the water
percolates<00:02:13.930> down<00:02:14.050> into<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.650> material<00:02:15.960> it's

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
percolates down into the material it's

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.540 
percolates down into the material it's
okay<00:02:17.320> if<00:02:17.470> it<00:02:17.620> ends<00:02:17.830> up<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:18.010> little<00:02:18.190> bit<00:02:18.340> chunky

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
okay if it ends up a little bit chunky

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.900 
okay if it ends up a little bit chunky
but<00:02:18.910> it's<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.300> easiest<00:02:19.660> way<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:19.930> let<00:02:20.830> it<00:02:21.010> to

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
but it's the easiest way to let it to

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.430 
but it's the easiest way to let it to
get<00:02:22.060> it<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.300> be<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.570> right<00:02:22.720> consistency<00:02:23.020> it's

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
get it to be the right consistency it's

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.710 
get it to be the right consistency it's
just<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:23.710> let<00:02:23.860> it<00:02:23.890> sit<00:02:24.280> for<00:02:24.550> a<00:02:24.580> while<00:02:24.790> so<00:02:25.540> I'm

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
just to let it sit for a while so I'm

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.670 
just to let it sit for a while so I'm
gonna<00:02:25.960> add<00:02:26.350> some<00:02:26.560> water<00:02:27.010> and<00:02:27.400> let<00:02:28.090> it<00:02:28.120> sit

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
gonna add some water and let it sit

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.470 
gonna add some water and let it sit
potentially<00:02:29.680> overnight<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:30.400> come<00:02:31.060> back<00:02:31.240> to

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
potentially overnight and come back to

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.990 
potentially overnight and come back to
it<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:32.410> we'll<00:02:32.680> mix<00:02:32.950> it<00:02:33.070> up<00:02:33.250> then<00:02:33.490> once<00:02:33.790> it's

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
it and we'll mix it up then once it's

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.020 
it and we'll mix it up then once it's
thoroughly<00:02:34.270> saturated
