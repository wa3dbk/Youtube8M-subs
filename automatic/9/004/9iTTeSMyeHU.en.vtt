00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello to today's video i will show 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.270
 you have some simple options and 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.710
 quick hairstyles that are perfect 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.200
 suitable for when you are 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.480
 overslept or you are in a hurry 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.970
 and there is no time to think about hair 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.890
 perfectly but nonetheless you want 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.529
 look cute and so real you 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.449
 tried over their hairdo though on 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.550
 really not really like everything if you 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.440
 interesting then stay with me for 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.840
 first hairstyle we need any 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.240
 fabric headbands like bandages that's 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.920
 for example, and why dm and such dressings 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.680
 now it is generally full in all stores 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.690
 accessories and I often do this 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.329
 hairstyle as you probably already noticed 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.399
 my video and first I separate small 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.860
 strands of face from both sides and to 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.399
 it turned out to gently put on a bandage I 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.469
 doing something incomprehensible 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.480
 inexplicable as you see but for some reason 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.739
 so really more comfortable and then I already 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.739
 directly dressing 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:12.470
 and this all super fast looks great 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.090
 and you can still strand that more 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.100
 dress up so she doesn't 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:32.030
 interfered and plus it seems to me it looks 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:34.790
 very cute and we can do all that 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.340
 the same but here I use a bandage on 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.380
 the wire is very convenient and simple 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.300
 repeat the previous steps with the separation 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.300
 strands and side tie a bow 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.500
 You can play a little with the form and all 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.690
 ready in less than a minute we did 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.130
 cool hair and again you can 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.020
 bang up if you need more 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.970
 like and this hairstyle fits 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.970
 for absolutely any hair length 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.550
 for the next hairstyle we need 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.890
 ordinary gum and the first step we do 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:41.580
 high tail is always easier for me 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:43.860
 do tilt your head down and advance 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.670
 having prepared one more elastic we twist 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.670
 hair spiral 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.500
 Further we twist hair around an elastic band 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:12.250
 and while our task is to fix it all 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:14.620
 matter as tight as possible and if some 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.170
 hairs do not obey and strongly stick out 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.600
 you can secure them invisible then we 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.490
 Feel free to relax the bundle to add 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:27.460
 volume and make our hairstyle 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:29.620
 specially a little bit careless too 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.570
 doing back and also relaxing herself 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.980
 lump so she looked bigger and 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:38.470
 longer you can still free short 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.110
 hairs street and we got here 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.880
 such a very cute sloppy bunch 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.470
 when in such a hurry 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.140
 Hairstyle can, in principle, be done 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.150
 almost on the go and it seems to me she 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:54.910
 looks pretty nice and plus 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:57.070
 hair does not interfere and the last hairstyle 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.110
 slightly more interesting but still not 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.690
 takes a lot of time first we 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.330
 separate 3 small strands and start 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.940
 weave a pigtail but at the same time each strand 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.040
 which is closer to the face add 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.040
 a strand of hair from bangs and then again 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.440
 braid once to explain it in words 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.500
 unreal but on video like everything is visible and 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.500
 are understandable 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.180
 and when the strands of the face end we 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.390
 we begin to weave the usual pigtail almost to 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.390
 the end 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:03.370
 and then wrap it like this 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:05.779
 around the head and fasten invisible and 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.120
 repeat the same thing with another 

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:11.710
 side and we fix invisible in 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.710
 same place where 1 pigtail 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.300
 and that's the kind of beauty we got 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.910
 simple and important fast and another plus in that 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.770
 that the hair is taken away from the face and does not interfere 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.120
 and overall the hairstyle was very 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.120
 neat and feminine 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:50.160
 and today it's all hope that you 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.690
 liked this video and if you liked 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.760

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.100
 fingers up will not be very nice and

 I will see you as always the next 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.460
