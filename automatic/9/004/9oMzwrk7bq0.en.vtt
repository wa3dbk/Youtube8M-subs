00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.170
 that all delighted to find on live 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.700
 During steering controls of auteuil 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.560
 for the fifth of this Saturday, September 27 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.480
 it will be the price of violin ii a steeple 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.980
 chase for well known horses in 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.730
 like society horses aged 5 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.860
 years old and above 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.719
 here is my selection I'm patient is 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.180
 number 1 the schl and bridges the horse 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.590
 remains on a pleasant success in my opinion 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.050
 nothing opposes a confirmation 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.010
 it is not a priori the weight and its 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.289
 top weight that should prevent it from 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.220
 confirm only the arrival of rains on 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.660
 the Paris region could 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.550
 possibly upset his plans 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.660
 I think a number 4 northwest of the lily 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.160
 just make a good race 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.510
 back after several months 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.160
 of absence was on the hedges to 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.540
 castlebriant it comes back well on the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.550
 style with ambitions do not forget 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.230
 that he will have for him his freshness and 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.820
 that he also finished third of 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.040
 this race last year I also 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.800
 your name morand the number 7 jamie beck 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.210
 who collects the good results and 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.010
 who should once again be at 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.110
 the arrival of this race the 2 extreme 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.850
 South who proved he was competitive 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.520
 in a similar society 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.199
 the number 8 pindar that stays on three 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.460
 consecutive wins both 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.539
 latest in date obtained on 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.149
 the steeple chase 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.140
 the ultra-lucky 12 who collects the 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.769
 podiums and that should once again 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.060
 make the arrival 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.270
 every month to get a 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.250
 then I will keep 5 on 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:16.190
 know a wave of six viviane royal 2 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.570
 mare who starts here on in the 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.620
 disabled who seems to me able to 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.510
 come scramble the cards 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:25.880
 summary figures for this quinté price 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:29.660
 violin ii at auteuil as 4 7 2 8 12 5 and 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.950
 then number 6 at caen in meeting 2 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.310
 in the second I advise you 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.510
 especially from 108 côte d'azur the sensation 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.250
 on the occasion of his debut on the 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.660
 pommeau cabourg recently that day 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.040
 she left at a gallop finding herself 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.430
 a hundred meters behind the rest 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.010
 of the peloton 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.360
 which did not stop him from very well 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.890
 conclude and perform one last 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.720
 kilometer of beauty to 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.950
 rank second no doubt it is 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.590
 close to her race she finds a 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.869
 very serious rival for the 210 chacha 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.100
 who started well ranking second 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.990
 also put on the racecourse of the 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.369
 crossed laroche 208 my favorite of 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.590
 110 for the to worry him meeting iii 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.270
 fasting now I know christophe 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.190
 closes flowers words flow 212 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.479
 abriel mozas a horse he believes 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.860
 albi horse which according to him is in 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.850
 delay of links when it is necessary 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.140
 expect to see him on putting in 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.270
 obvious especially since it is an excellent 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.650
 right-handed whose next I could 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.930
 to talk with christmas jean want 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.549
 that he presents the 308 brave tartifume he 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.450
 also presents another horse in 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.410
 this race but the horse is not 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.750
 ready will make a comeback 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.239
 he is confident with the brave 308 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.830
 tartifume the horse is at best these 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.930
 good rightful practices according to him his 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.209
 place is on the podium it will take without 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.100
 doubt outpaced the 310 brétigny who 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.580
 have seven wins in as many 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.500
 public outings 310 308 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.020
 finally in the fourth I you 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.210
 advises the 407 a o2 showing a 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.760
 horse that has already shone at this level and 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.900
 who won with the way my opinion he 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.850
 does not have the gains in relation to his 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.130
 potential he has the size of a lot 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.300
 like this one if he stays charge and he 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.370
 promises to be formidable 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.380
 you will cause him the 405 horsepower of the park 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.120
 who collects good results without 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.290
 doubt more practical 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.030
 cugnaux de montaren so these two 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.970
 horses deserves a priori a mention of 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:08.150
 more favorable 407 405 for those targeted 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:11.570
 agen meeting iii second 212 third 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.500
 308 310 fourth 405 407 finally to the 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.660
 cross laroche 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.470
 I targeted three favorites I like 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.970
 a lot the 407 blind help bellouet to 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.350
 which happens to us from scandinavia it's a 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.630
 mare who owns titles 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.430
 interesting in sweden 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.959
 it starts here or any other climb but if 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.340
 him in loop at ten goals other climbs 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.630
 in this race it's because she has to 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.120
 to have the shoe size so better 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.850
 follow it immediately our 407 blend 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.250
 bellouet whose 5th Scandinavian 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.860
 to follow is the 5 cents to 104 such 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.730
 thing presented by the organ wells tom the 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.470
 horse was the subject of noises 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.209
 favorable on the occasion of his debut 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.220
 on our floor it was sure like nancy 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.790
 recently alas for his takers he is 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.260
 galloping 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.850
 it is better to buy them as a 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.140
 priori he is late in earnings he 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.230
 find here the opportunity to fill one 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.989
 beautiful party 504 only fellini finally in 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.459
 the seventh 514 ashtian blue me 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.620
 seems able to confirm his recent 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.550
 success achieved on the course that we 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.690
 Interested on the day there she is denied 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.340
 easily he was unfeathered the four 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.560
 for the first time he will be again 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.000
 barefoot and a priori it looks like a 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.370
 again as a serious postulant 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.220
 for success 714 at thierno lô 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.949
