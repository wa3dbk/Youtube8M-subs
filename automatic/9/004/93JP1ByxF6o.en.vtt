00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:22.570
 simple and affordable infusions I will prepare 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.579
 on a rack on a dog rose with I packs for 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.259
 this tincture we need three good 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:28.840
 handfuls of hips recommend using 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.329
 dry or toasted course is much 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.550
 brighter and more expressive one apple 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:35.770
 apple should be sweet necessarily 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.110
 which means the pieces are also fragrant 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.789
 alcoholic base grain brew 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.770
 53 degrees fortress 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:44.680
 why is 50 degrees during 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.110
 some apple and rose hips 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.420
 degree will take yourself and that in the end 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.710
 get not weak tincture but 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.600
 at about 45 I took this particular degree 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.010
 I fall asleep jar hips and cut into the same 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.579
 in small lobules 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.579

 close the jar tightly lid mix 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.039
 and for two or three weeks a dark place 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.240
 exactly one and a half month passed honestly 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.520
 Speaking about this tincture, I generally forgot 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.140
 But I think ideas only benefit 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.140
 sly through a cotton filter 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.070
 start on tasting tincture on 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.750

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.520

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.600
 baked potatoes and cheese and 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.600
 skulls pour 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.760
 saturated color closer closer exactly 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:12.080
 pure orange is light so 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.080
 turbidity on smell 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.120
 the smell is very pleasant 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.069
 sweet saturated than that is 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.069

 the taste of these very dense saturated 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.430
 well manifested briar very well 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.890
 and the apple becomes and forms exactly the smell 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.250

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.250

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.939
 if you have a straight dense coin we fold 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.060
 two because incomplete like mine is better 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:36.920
