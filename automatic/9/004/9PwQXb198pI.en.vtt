used to be the owner needed it for
something<00:00:37.539> else<00:00:37.749> I<00:00:37.960> think<00:00:38.109> he<00:00:38.379> wanted<00:00:38.589> to<00:00:38.649> open

up<00:00:39.039> an<00:00:39.190> e-bike<00:00:39.760> shop<00:00:40.149> so<00:00:40.659> it's<00:00:40.839> a<00:00:40.870> bit<00:00:40.989> of<00:00:41.079> a

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
up an e-bike shop so it's a bit of a

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.189 
up an e-bike shop so it's a bit of a
sign<00:00:41.320> of<00:00:41.440> the<00:00:41.499> times<00:00:41.649> really<00:00:41.980> kind<00:00:42.969> of<00:00:42.999> sad<00:00:43.210> you

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:44.199 
sign of the times really kind of sad you

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:47.700

miles on it I think that's going to go
for<00:03:57.400> something<00:03:57.640> pretty<00:03:58.000> because<00:03:58.210> it's<00:03:58.330> a

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
for something pretty because it's a

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.080

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
again not a moped but still I'm really

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.280 
again not a moped but still I'm really
hoping<00:04:05.230> to<00:04:05.320> get<00:04:05.410> that<00:04:05.590> 99<00:04:06.070> targa<00:04:07.110> or<00:04:08.110> that

rough<00:04:10.810> and<00:04:11.110> I<00:04:11.200> don't<00:04:11.260> think<00:04:11.650> there's<00:04:11.830> going<00:04:11.950> to

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
rough and I don't think there's going to

rough and I don't think there's going to
be<00:04:12.100> too<00:04:12.280> many<00:04:12.430> people<00:04:12.730> interested<00:04:13.180> in<00:04:13.270> that

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
be too many people interested in that

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.229
