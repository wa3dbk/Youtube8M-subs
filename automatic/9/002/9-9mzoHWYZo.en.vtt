00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 I'll show you how to do the round today 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.420
 I can do transition at the rear 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.269
 have the round with a chain stitch 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.940
 closed after this chain stitch 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:20.520
 I show that in the end anyway 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:23.880
 Once again I make an air mass and in 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.660
 the same mesh where the captain mesh 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:33.660
 and air bath have come in 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:35.600
 So right next to the higher stem 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:43.399
 this side 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:43.399
 I 'm doing a good job in that 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:56.719
 We mark these implements 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:59.050
 this is the solid stitch the mark 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.050
 me me 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.560
 that was the air mass 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:23.060
 and that the chains 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:25.880
 So in a mesh three in made 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:30.819
 a chain mesh then we have air 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.819
 mesh made and a tight mesh 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:38.750
 I should have continued here my 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:44.450
 Chopsticks and at the end of the dogs we see 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:46.340
 right now I am with the 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.140
 marked stitches here I have that 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.340
 last made the chopsticks I have there 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.860
 two made into it 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.420
 because the chain mesh there is the air mass 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.420
 and there the solid mesh 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.710
 in the chain mesh , we still enter 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.580
 I have the thread straight 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.630
 withdrawn 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:16.000
 what was not in the picture I 'm still one 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:20.709
 Chopsticks then here is the air mass 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:28.840
 let as well as the fixed mesh leave 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:33.630
 we make out of and into the first chopsticks 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.630
 a chain stitch 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.040
 we skip the one can fairly 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.550
 invisible become very small now 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.580
 the tight mesh and in this half 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.240
 In the first we do the chopsticks 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.240
 chains mesh 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.400
 if you do that 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:59.470
 I just want to take it 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.470
 After this chain stitch a color 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.140
 then make the air mesh with the paint 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:17.960
 you see air mass is somehow 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.960
 still with the other color and one 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:28.850
 solid mesh again 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:31.820
 next to this air mass equal 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:38.770
 next to it pocketed and makes a firm 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:41.590
 mesh so now you see 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.920
 The mesh is in purple and the air 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.660
 mesh still in orange which will if you 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:52.390
 in the back, but draws very small that one 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:58.510
 she does not see anymore and I 'm doing now 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:04:03.000
 again chopsticks so my wound is already 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:07.600
 relatively far there are two big ones 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:12.360
 flat mesh so just lying there 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.360
 this little something the air mass 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.640
 If you think about it, you draw it a little 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.270
 I will not think so anyway 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:30.510
 does not matter if she is invisible 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:30.510
 So we make another chopstick here 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.400
 Here too we make a chopstick 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:44.590
 the little no longer visible 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:47.620
 Air masses that disappear from the sea then 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.630
 we do not do anything that makes it weird 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.500
 it is our firm mesh if now 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.560
 had marked 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:57.720
 then you see that and the first one 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.720
 I sting 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:07.270
 she is quite perfect by that 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:10.470
 some statements you can see the color 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.470
 transition nothing 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:24.680
 can carry on her back in orange 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:27.800
 if you want to do one with 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:32.650
 an air mesh then right back 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:36.280
 puncture and make a tight stitch 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.280
 and continue 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.540
 I hope the video helped you 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:44.320
 and I wish you a crochet 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.320
 happy day
