how to do the 3 by 3 this regular
Rubik's<00:00:10.380> Cube<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:11.179> learned<00:00:12.179> it<00:00:12.240> about<00:00:12.509> in<00:00:12.750> a

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
Rubik's Cube I learned it about in a

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.980 
Rubik's Cube I learned it about in a
week<00:00:13.110> or<00:00:13.290> so<00:00:13.820> never<00:00:14.820> done<00:00:14.969> before<00:00:15.240> but<00:00:15.780> they're

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
week or so never done before but they're

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.080 
week or so never done before but they're
really<00:00:16.199> fun<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.619> hoodie<00:00:17.250> joined<00:00:17.609> by<00:00:17.820> anyone

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
pick a color I do green miss the way it

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.849 
pick a color I do green miss the way it
helps<00:00:23.670> with<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:24.150> no<00:00:25.109> one<00:00:25.350> call<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.680> really

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
helps with you no one call it really

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.150 
helps with you no one call it really
good<00:00:26.099> but<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:27.170> want<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.439> try<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.740> get<00:00:29.010> one

good but I want you to try to get one

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.220 
good but I want you to try to get one
side<00:00:29.490> first<00:00:29.880> just<00:00:30.359> keep<00:00:30.630> on<00:00:30.810> trying<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.080> get

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
side first just keep on trying to get

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.959 
side first just keep on trying to get
one<00:00:31.500> side<00:00:31.800> one<00:00:32.099> side<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.550> let's<00:00:32.669> keep<00:00:32.820> on

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
one side one side and let's keep on

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.310 
one side one side and let's keep on
trying<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.210> do<00:00:33.270> all<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.540> colors<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:34.050> helps

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
trying to do all the colors it helps

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.889 
trying to do all the colors it helps
well<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.280> first<00:00:35.309> thing<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:35.700> do<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.090> as<00:00:36.510> you

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
well the first thing you do is as you

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.100 
well the first thing you do is as you
can<00:00:36.930> see<00:00:37.340> they're<00:00:38.340> just<00:00:38.640> regular<00:00:38.790> green<00:00:39.149> you

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
can see they're just regular green you

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.549 
can see they're just regular green you
have<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.410> get<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.680> cross<00:00:41.540> people<00:00:42.540> in<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.140> very

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
have to get the cross people in it very

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.350 
have to get the cross people in it very
easy<00:00:43.800> this<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.129> just<00:00:44.489> logical<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.120> should

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
easy this is just logical you should

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.389 
easy this is just logical you should
know<00:00:45.539> how<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.750> do<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:47.010> know<00:00:47.160> like

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
know how to do this you to know like

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.500 
know how to do this you to know like
John<00:00:48.559> and<00:00:49.559> then<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.980> know<00:00:50.239> algorithms<00:00:51.239> for

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
John and then you know algorithms for

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.830 
John and then you know algorithms for
this<00:00:51.719> ok<00:00:52.050> let's<00:00:52.530> get<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.570> so<00:00:54.570> it's<00:00:54.750> very

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
this ok let's get this so it's very

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:02.000 
this ok let's get this so it's very
simple<00:00:56.180> let's<00:00:57.180> see<00:00:57.980> we<00:00:58.980> got<00:00:59.010> yellow<00:01:00.829> fish<00:01:01.829> a

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
simple let's see we got yellow fish a

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.670 
simple let's see we got yellow fish a
mass<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.280> all<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.699> colors<00:01:03.680> got<00:01:04.680> white<00:01:05.450> and

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
mass of all the colors got white and

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:14.780 
mass of all the colors got white and
then<00:01:07.680> got<00:01:09.890> rid<00:01:11.900> again<00:01:12.900> arms<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:14.189> they<00:01:14.369> have<00:01:14.549> all

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
then got rid again arms so they have all

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.960 
then got rid again arms so they have all
the<00:01:15.119> other<00:01:15.689> costs<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.350> meet<00:01:17.130> all<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.700> match

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
the other costs and meet all the match

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.539 
the other costs and meet all the match
yet<00:01:18.390> yellow<00:01:19.939> arms<00:01:20.939> white<00:01:21.920> bread<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.159> should<00:01:23.400> be

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
yet yellow arms white bread it should be

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.609 
yet yellow arms white bread it should be
like<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.970> now<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.630> have<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.930> match<00:01:25.110> corners

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
like that now you have to match corners

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.109 
like that now you have to match corners
just<00:01:25.740> put<00:01:26.040> them<00:01:26.189> in<00:01:26.310> there<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.939> very

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
just put them in there it's a very

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.179 
just put them in there it's a very
simple<00:01:27.299> okay<00:01:27.689> there's<00:01:28.200> no<00:01:28.409> algorithms<00:01:29.040> with

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
simple okay there's no algorithms with

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.190 
simple okay there's no algorithms with
this<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.759> always<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.270> know<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.720> always<00:01:30.869> turn

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
this you always you know you always turn

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.260 
this you always you know you always turn
away<00:01:31.409> from<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:32.009> cost<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.490> put<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.790> corner<00:01:33.150> and

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
away from the cost to put the corner and

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.310 
away from the cost to put the corner and
because<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.600> don't<00:01:33.750> want<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.930> mess<00:01:34.079> up<00:01:34.200> the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
because you don't want to mess up the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.520 
because you don't want to mess up the
cross<00:01:34.579> so<00:01:35.579> always<00:01:35.700> thank<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.420> do<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.320> real

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
cross so always thank that do that real

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.160 
cross so always thank that do that real
quick

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.640 

I<00:01:44.259> need<00:01:45.159> to<00:01:45.250> keep<00:01:45.520> on<00:01:45.700> putting<00:01:45.939> them<00:01:46.000> in<00:01:46.150> until

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
I need to keep on putting them in until

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.140 
I need to keep on putting them in until
you<00:01:47.650> have<00:01:47.920> all<00:01:47.950> of<00:01:48.159> them<00:01:48.490> you<00:01:48.670> should<00:01:48.700> have<00:01:49.060> the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
you have all of them you should have the

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.560 
you have all of them you should have the
first<00:01:49.360> layer<00:01:50.100> done<00:01:51.100> always<00:01:51.970> turn<00:01:52.360> it<00:01:52.479> away

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
first layer done always turn it away

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.240 
first layer done always turn it away
with<00:01:52.899> one<00:01:53.170> thing<00:01:53.350> that<00:01:53.619> will<00:01:53.680> help<00:01:53.830> your<00:01:53.979> life

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
with one thing that will help your life

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.719 
with one thing that will help your life
now<00:01:54.939> you<00:01:55.390> have<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.899> whole<00:01:56.140> first<00:01:57.040> layer<00:01:57.369> done

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
now you have the whole first layer done

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.080 
now you have the whole first layer done
and<00:01:58.500> tone<00:01:59.500> color<00:01:59.740> one<00:01:59.979> which<00:02:00.190> is<00:02:00.340> great<00:02:00.610> you

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
and tone color one which is great you

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.520 
and tone color one which is great you
don't<00:02:01.210> have<00:02:01.299> to<00:02:01.420> do<00:02:01.539> green<00:02:01.750> understand<00:02:02.289> with

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
don't have to do green understand with

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.660 
don't have to do green understand with
that<00:02:02.680> now<00:02:03.430> once<00:02:03.729> you<00:02:03.850> have<00:02:03.970> gran<00:02:04.180> you<00:02:04.420> get<00:02:05.670> now

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
that now once you have gran you get now

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.859 
that now once you have gran you get now
you<00:02:07.479> have<00:02:07.720> to<00:02:08.530> put<00:02:09.069> in<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.310> edge<00:02:09.459> pieces<00:02:09.910> and

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
you have to put in the edge pieces and

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.050 
you have to put in the edge pieces and
I'll<00:02:11.140> write<00:02:11.350> down<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.590> algorithms<00:02:12.400> later<00:02:12.640> but

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
I'll write down the algorithms later but

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.570 
I'll write down the algorithms later but
it's<00:02:13.930> very<00:02:14.140> simple<00:02:14.440> algorithm<00:02:14.709> so<00:02:15.250> now<00:02:15.400> can

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
it's very simple algorithm so now can

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.150 
it's very simple algorithm so now can
put<00:02:15.819> them<00:02:15.970> on<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:16.239> can<00:02:16.420> oh<00:02:16.830> you'll<00:02:17.830> be<00:02:17.860> on<00:02:18.040> my

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
put them on you can oh you'll be on my

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.559 
put them on you can oh you'll be on my
link<00:02:18.400> so<00:02:18.700> first<00:02:19.600> let<00:02:19.750> me<00:02:19.780> do<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.650> algorithms

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
link so first let me do the algorithms

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.130 
link so first let me do the algorithms
and<00:02:22.569> you<00:02:22.720> also<00:02:23.519> see<00:02:24.519> like<00:02:24.940> see<00:02:25.239> you<00:02:25.750> have<00:02:25.930> on

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
and you also see like see you have on

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.080 
and you also see like see you have on
that<00:02:26.319> stuff<00:02:26.620> with<00:02:26.860> red<00:02:27.130> and<00:02:27.430> they<00:02:27.549> have<00:02:27.760> to<00:02:27.880> put

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
that stuff with red and they have to put

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.110 
that stuff with red and they have to put
it<00:02:28.239> in<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.569> spot<00:02:28.870> first<00:02:29.709> of<00:02:29.860> all<00:02:30.130> you<00:02:30.250> have<00:02:31.000> to

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
it in the spot first of all you have to

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.330 
it in the spot first of all you have to
turn<00:02:31.269> the<00:02:31.480> way<00:02:31.600> of<00:02:31.750> course<00:02:32.019> put<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.040> corner

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
turn the way of course put the corner

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.740 
turn the way of course put the corner
match<00:02:33.580> it<00:02:33.760> up<00:02:33.819> with<00:02:33.880> that<00:02:34.030> edge<00:02:34.299> piece<00:02:34.569> and<00:02:34.720> put

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
match it up with that edge piece and put

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.840 
match it up with that edge piece and put
it<00:02:35.019> in<00:02:35.170> you<00:02:35.890> should<00:02:36.069> do<00:02:36.160> that<00:02:36.190> with<00:02:36.610> all<00:02:36.819> of

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
it in you should do that with all of

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.460 
it in you should do that with all of
them<00:02:37.060> so<00:02:37.299> i'll<00:02:37.390> put<00:02:37.569> that<00:02:37.600> grow<00:02:37.930> things<00:02:38.230> up

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
them so i'll put that grow things up

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.949 
them so i'll put that grow things up
later<00:02:38.730> don't<00:02:39.730> eat<00:02:39.850> them<00:02:39.970> right<00:02:40.090> now<00:02:40.269> but<00:02:40.810> let

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
later don't eat them right now but let

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.570 
later don't eat them right now but let
me<00:02:40.989> finish<00:02:41.290> you<00:02:41.470> keep<00:02:41.590> doing<00:02:41.860> this<00:02:44.489> there<00:02:45.489> you

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
me finish you keep doing this there you

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:52.440 
me finish you keep doing this there you
go<00:02:45.880> and<00:02:46.299> then<00:02:47.280> do<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.519> last<00:02:48.820> one<00:02:51.239> once<00:02:52.239> you've

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
go and then do the last one once you've

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.729 
go and then do the last one once you've
been<00:02:52.570> in<00:02:52.660> this<00:02:52.780> out<00:02:52.989> rend<00:02:53.260> this<00:02:53.380> is<00:02:53.530> a<00:02:53.590> very

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
been in this out rend this is a very

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.670 
been in this out rend this is a very
important<00:02:54.430> algorithms<00:02:54.549> probably<00:02:55.359> 10<00:02:55.680> ones

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
important algorithms probably 10 ones

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.830 
important algorithms probably 10 ones
that<00:02:56.859> you<00:02:56.950> really<00:02:57.220> need<00:02:57.430> for<00:02:57.640> this<00:02:57.820> and<00:02:58.480> I<00:02:58.540> got

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
that you really need for this and I got

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.830 
that you really need for this and I got
that<00:02:59.049> now<00:02:59.260> and<00:02:59.769> have<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.519> whole<00:03:00.790> two<00:03:01.540> layers

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
that now and have the whole two layers

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.800 
that now and have the whole two layers
done<00:03:02.260> now<00:03:02.859> I<00:03:02.890> met<00:03:03.190> that<00:03:03.459> way<00:03:03.670> now<00:03:04.150> you<00:03:04.209> must

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
done now I met that way now you must

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.810 
done now I met that way now you must
have<00:03:05.019> you<00:03:05.260> have<00:03:05.380> to<00:03:05.470> do<00:03:05.590> both<00:03:05.709> lose<00:03:06.070> it<00:03:06.250> up<00:03:06.370> now

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
have you have to do both lose it up now

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.970 
have you have to do both lose it up now
as<00:03:06.880> you<00:03:07.090> can<00:03:07.209> see<00:03:07.269> you<00:03:07.720> have<00:03:07.959> this<00:03:08.410> right<00:03:08.680> here

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
as you can see you have this right here

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.390 
as you can see you have this right here
which<00:03:09.850> is<00:03:10.060> like<00:03:10.299> a<00:03:10.510> little<00:03:11.140> corner<00:03:11.530> so<00:03:12.310> you

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
which is like a little corner so you

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.530 
which is like a little corner so you
know<00:03:12.549> you<00:03:12.609> have<00:03:13.299> to<00:03:13.390> hold<00:03:13.600> it<00:03:13.810> like<00:03:14.470> this<00:03:14.500> and

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
know you have to hold it like this and

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.190 
know you have to hold it like this and
you<00:03:16.540> have<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:17.049> turn<00:03:17.290> it<00:03:17.560> away<00:03:18.750> but<00:03:19.750> i'll<00:03:19.989> put

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
you have to turn it away but i'll put

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.900 
you have to turn it away but i'll put
the<00:03:20.290> algorithm<00:03:20.709> up<00:03:20.890> we're<00:03:21.579> going<00:03:21.670> to<00:03:21.760> do<00:03:21.850> it

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
the algorithm up we're going to do it

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.090 
the algorithm up we're going to do it
one<00:03:21.970> more<00:03:22.150> time<00:03:22.269> until<00:03:22.780> you<00:03:22.810> have<00:03:22.959> a<00:03:22.989> cross<00:03:23.290> the

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
one more time until you have a cross the

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.270 
one more time until you have a cross the
Cossacks<00:03:24.579> should<00:03:25.030> look<00:03:25.180> something<00:03:25.420> like<00:03:25.570> this

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
Cossacks should look something like this

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.220 
Cossacks should look something like this
that's<00:03:27.280> what<00:03:27.459> it<00:03:27.489> should<00:03:27.549> look<00:03:27.670> like<00:03:28.170> now<00:03:29.170> you

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
that's what it should look like now you

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.380 
that's what it should look like now you
have<00:03:29.590> to<00:03:29.709> match<00:03:29.890> up<00:03:30.069> the<00:03:30.100> edge<00:03:30.310> pieces<00:03:30.609> with

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
have to match up the edge pieces with

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.750 
have to match up the edge pieces with
their<00:03:31.569> corresponding<00:03:31.720> colors<00:03:32.620> as<00:03:33.370> you<00:03:33.459> can

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
their corresponding colors as you can

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.509 
their corresponding colors as you can
see<00:03:33.970> I<00:03:34.000> have<00:03:34.150> yellow<00:03:35.019> and<00:03:35.260> I<00:03:35.920> have<00:03:36.010> a<00:03:36.160> lunch<00:03:36.370> we

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
see I have yellow and I have a lunch we

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.000 
see I have yellow and I have a lunch we
have<00:03:36.670> to<00:03:36.790> get<00:03:36.970> red<00:03:37.150> one<00:03:37.420> so<00:03:38.380> you<00:03:38.440> put<00:03:38.769> on<00:03:38.890> the

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
have to get red one so you put on the

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.110 
have to get red one so you put on the
white<00:03:39.130> and<00:03:39.579> you<00:03:39.730> do<00:03:39.910> it<00:03:40.090> hmm<00:03:41.790> again<00:03:42.790> I'll<00:03:42.940> put

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
white and you do it hmm again I'll put

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.509 
white and you do it hmm again I'll put
that<00:03:43.299> rhythm<00:03:43.540> there<00:03:43.780> then<00:03:44.769> you<00:03:44.889> got<00:03:45.010> that<00:03:45.250> so

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
that rhythm there then you got that so

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.059 
that rhythm there then you got that so
far<00:03:45.730> it's<00:03:46.299> perfect<00:03:46.750> and<00:03:46.930> then<00:03:47.560> you<00:03:47.950> have<00:03:48.040> to

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
far it's perfect and then you have to

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.460 
far it's perfect and then you have to
back<00:03:48.760> up<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:49.000> corners<00:03:49.389> and<00:03:50.019> as<00:03:50.170> you<00:03:50.290> can<00:03:50.440> see

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
back up the corners and as you can see

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.190 
back up the corners and as you can see
that<00:03:50.829> corn<00:03:51.130> is<00:03:51.280> already<00:03:51.579> in<00:03:51.700> place<00:03:52.080> also<00:03:53.080> I'll

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
that corn is already in place also I'll

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.460 
that corn is already in place also I'll
keep<00:03:53.349> it<00:03:53.470> there<00:03:53.650> I<00:03:53.860> do<00:03:54.819> algorithm<00:03:55.390> won't<00:03:56.260> mess

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
keep it there I do algorithm won't mess

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.470 
keep it there I do algorithm won't mess
up<00:03:56.500> that<00:03:56.739> corn<00:03:57.010> oats<00:03:57.099> rye

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
up that corn oats rye

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.500 
up that corn oats rye
we<00:03:57.659> have<00:03:57.750> to<00:03:57.870> imagine<00:03:58.019> all<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:58.590> corners<00:03:59.510> until

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
we have to imagine all the corners until

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.009 
we have to imagine all the corners until
right<00:04:01.349> now<00:04:03.260> I<00:04:04.260> seriously<00:04:04.769> messed<00:04:05.010> up<00:04:05.190> okay

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
right now I seriously messed up okay

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:35.160 
right now I seriously messed up okay
well<00:04:07.019> I'll<00:04:07.319> get<00:04:07.500> it<00:04:07.620> back

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.780 

mmm<00:04:36.170> I've<00:04:36.560> done<00:04:36.830> this<00:04:36.980> in<00:04:37.160> a<00:04:37.190> while<00:04:37.250> but<00:04:37.670> now
