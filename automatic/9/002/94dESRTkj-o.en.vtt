I think it was in New York this happened

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.110 
I think it was in New York this happened
and<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:13.959> old<00:03:14.110> old<00:03:14.530> Madison<00:03:15.519> Square<00:03:15.700> Garden

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120

and<00:03:16.950> I'm<00:03:17.950> not<00:03:18.220> sure<00:03:18.489> I<00:03:18.519> think<00:03:18.730> Bobby<00:03:19.090> might

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
and I'm not sure I think Bobby might

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.820 
and I'm not sure I think Bobby might
have<00:03:19.510> scored<00:03:19.720> three<00:03:20.049> goals<00:03:20.080> and<00:03:20.379> I<00:03:20.500> think<00:03:20.709> I

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
have scored three goals and I think I

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.130 
have scored three goals and I think I
got<00:03:21.010> one<00:03:21.190> or<00:03:21.340> two<00:03:21.370> okay<00:03:22.299> to<00:03:22.360> get<00:03:22.660> get<00:03:23.019> our
