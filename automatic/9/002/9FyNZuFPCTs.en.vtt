very middle stage of the tournament and
we<00:00:55.079> notice<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.379> Amy's<00:00:55.800> are<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.039> there<00:00:56.219> we

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
talked about how the amy is going to be

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.479 
talked about how the amy is going to be
similar<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.170> big<00:00:58.320> one<00:00:58.500> here's<00:00:59.070> an<00:00:59.190> example

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
similar to the big one here's an example

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.510 
similar to the big one here's an example
right<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:01.559> one<00:01:01.770> actually<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.100> pretty

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
right so this one actually is pretty

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.030 
right so this one actually is pretty
much<00:01:02.670> as<00:01:02.850> close<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.239> small<00:01:03.570> boy<00:01:03.780> now<00:01:04.439> sometimes

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
much as close to small boy now sometimes

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.740 
much as close to small boy now sometimes
as<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.519> get<00:01:05.640> deeper<00:01:05.760> in<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.030> tournament<00:01:06.330> antes

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
as you get deeper in a tournament antes

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.630 
as you get deeper in a tournament antes
are<00:01:06.900> bigger<00:01:07.080> sometimes<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:08.040> get<00:01:08.159> deeper<00:01:08.520> they

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
are bigger sometimes you get deeper they

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.190 
are bigger sometimes you get deeper they
get<00:01:08.939> smaller<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.810> could<00:01:09.930> deal<00:01:10.170> with

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
get smaller you could deal with

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.780 
get smaller you could deal with
different<00:01:10.830> players<00:01:10.979> differently<00:01:11.610> for

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
different players differently for

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.880 
different players differently for
example<00:01:12.020> average<00:01:13.020> woman's<00:01:13.439> would<00:01:13.590> be<00:01:13.650> playing

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
example average woman's would be playing

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.550 
example average woman's would be playing
very<00:01:14.100> conservatively<00:01:14.700> where<00:01:15.060> average<00:01:15.689> young

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
very conservatively where average young

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.300 
very conservatively where average young
internet<00:01:17.070> pro<00:01:17.400> will<00:01:17.610> play<00:01:17.820> very<00:01:18.229> aggressively

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
internet pro will play very aggressively

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.010 
internet pro will play very aggressively
the<00:01:20.310> average<00:01:20.729> older<00:01:21.090> man<00:01:21.299> we<00:01:21.509> playing<00:01:21.780> very

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
the average older man we playing very

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.840 
the average older man we playing very
tight<00:01:22.259> as<00:01:22.409> well<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:22.950> you're<00:01:23.549> going<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.729> adjust

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
tight as well so you're going to adjust

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.820 
tight as well so you're going to adjust
how<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.299> play<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.659> different<00:01:25.020> people<00:01:25.350> for

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
how you play to different people for

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.160 
how you play to different people for
example<00:01:26.280> we<00:01:26.460> talked<00:01:26.700> about<00:01:27.000> maybe<00:01:27.659> betting

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
example we talked about maybe betting

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.609 
example we talked about maybe betting
the<00:01:28.259> flop<00:01:28.530> against<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.460> guy<00:01:30.450> heads-up<00:01:30.960> but<00:01:31.530> if

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
the flop against a guy heads-up but if

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.140 
the flop against a guy heads-up but if
you<00:01:31.710> get<00:01:31.829> into<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.070> situation<00:01:32.400> with<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.939> bad

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
you get into a situation with a bad

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.480 
you get into a situation with a bad
candidate<00:01:33.689> maybe<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:34.470> notice<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.890> guy<00:01:35.040> looks

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
candidate maybe you notice the guy looks

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.410 
to look at it is if I'm in this spot
it's<00:03:18.950> always<00:03:19.250> at<00:03:19.430> a<00:03:19.459> disadvantage<00:03:19.519> if<00:03:20.330> you

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
it's always at a disadvantage if you

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.240 
it's always at a disadvantage if you
have<00:03:20.510> good<00:03:20.720> players<00:03:20.959> to<00:03:21.170> your<00:03:21.260> left<00:03:21.500> the

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
have good players to your left the

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.520 
have good players to your left the
reason<00:03:22.459> why<00:03:22.760> is<00:03:22.820> if<00:03:23.450> they're<00:03:23.959> to<00:03:24.110> your<00:03:24.230> left

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
reason why is if they're to your left

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.070 
reason why is if they're to your left
they<00:03:24.830> act<00:03:25.040> after<00:03:25.370> you<00:03:25.690> so<00:03:26.690> let's<00:03:26.930> say<00:03:27.019> you

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
they act after you so let's say you

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.750 
they act after you so let's say you
raised<00:03:27.380> raised<00:03:27.680> Jack<00:03:27.950> and<00:03:28.280> then<00:03:28.400> he<00:03:28.549> acts

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
raised raised Jack and then he acts

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.759 
raised raised Jack and then he acts
after<00:03:29.180> you<00:03:29.299> he<00:03:29.450> can<00:03:29.600> rear<00:03:29.750> ace<00:03:29.930> you<00:03:30.170> right<00:03:30.410> you

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
after you he can rear ace you right you

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.380 
after you he can rear ace you right you
have<00:03:30.890> a<00:03:30.920> pro<00:03:31.160> to<00:03:31.220> your<00:03:31.400> right<00:03:31.640> yeah<00:03:32.060> it's

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
have a pro to your right yeah it's

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.640 
have a pro to your right yeah it's
actually<00:03:32.630> not<00:03:32.720> that<00:03:32.780> bad<00:03:32.989> of<00:03:33.110> a<00:03:33.200> deal<00:03:33.350> because

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
actually not that bad of a deal because

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.830 
actually not that bad of a deal because
now<00:03:33.980> you<00:03:34.040> can<00:03:34.400> discriminate<00:03:34.790> whenever<00:03:35.540> you

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
now you can discriminate whenever you

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.740 
now you can discriminate whenever you
want<00:03:36.140> you<00:03:36.320> can<00:03:36.440> re<00:03:36.590> raise<00:03:36.799> them<00:03:37.040> yeah<00:03:37.430> so<00:03:37.790> just

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
want you can re raise them yeah so just

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.020 
want you can re raise them yeah so just
think<00:03:38.900> of<00:03:38.959> it<00:03:39.080> also<00:03:39.320> in<00:03:39.680> terms<00:03:39.890> of<00:03:40.160> if<00:03:40.820> you're

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
think of it also in terms of if you're

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.160 
think of it also in terms of if you're
to<00:03:41.209> the<00:03:41.239> left<00:03:41.540> of<00:03:41.660> them<00:03:41.810> you<00:03:41.959> have<00:03:42.080> an

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
to the left of them you have an

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.690 
to the left of them you have an
advantage<00:03:42.470> if<00:03:42.860> there's<00:03:43.070> a<00:03:43.160> left<00:03:43.400> that<00:03:43.519> you

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
advantage if there's a left that you

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.060 
advantage if there's a left that you
they<00:03:43.910> have<00:03:44.030> an<00:03:44.150> advantage<00:03:44.390> unless<00:03:45.290> you're<00:03:45.950> on

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
they have an advantage unless you're on

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.229 
they have an advantage unless you're on
that<00:03:46.220> button<00:03:46.640> because<00:03:46.790> if<00:03:46.970> you're<00:03:47.060> on<00:03:47.150> the

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.660 
that button because if you're on the
button<00:03:47.570> then<00:03:48.019> now<00:03:48.230> these<00:03:48.980> two<00:03:49.250> players<00:03:49.459> are
