00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.020
 geneva wild eagle cheerleader 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.650
 though a cheerleader she's going to have some 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.390
 sticks like cheerleaders finally it's 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.490
 a word that was invented but even at 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.489
 level international competition that 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.860
 is called cheerleading collection and 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.079
 cha li na sacred dance early 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.489
 and then afterwards there was fortunately the 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.400
 Swiss competitions that made me synonymous 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.019
 discover other teams and then see 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.030
 a little what it was mostly the cheer 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:46.379
 dance and tightened we perfected 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.970
 the tooth makes seeing also the soul at 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.890
 European level what did the others 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.120
 excites a lot of money from the 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.750
 competition for us but that too 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.750
 advanced 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.580
 we have Swiss prices are and vice 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.710

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.870

 companion a lot of time come 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.650
 all of geneva what they come from 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.420
 further after law is quickly that it makes 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.640
 it always goes a bit takes quite 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.340
 journey and 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.690
 it takes a long time of the four 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.130
 training hours a week two 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.170
 times two hours and then after there are 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.540
 all match animated so like a bunch 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:47.430
 of players there ie two by 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:49.350
 week it's not practical of 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.340
 choreographies to make music mixers 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.460
 of 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.740
 to choose equipment 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.090
 2 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.350
 organized by your serious does it well 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.920
 does the right 5 6 7 8 and a stadium 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.240
 achieved 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.240
 sweet tada 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:17.580
 the city on the waves the team it's 13 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.720
 years old that I 13 or 14 years old when I 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.790
 train and do a little bit of everything 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:29.370
 d'Auxerre this team is my baby 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:30.960
 as of hab smile motivated way trip to 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.220
 interested a minimum ok if not that 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.220
 would come along 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.580
 after that it's true that what we can do 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.470
 here we have its limits and even on the 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.140
 ice cream we are 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.580
 we have four special bases but we 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.080
 has its limits is level again 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.470
 movement and in the stands too 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.760
 so we're actually actually doing it for 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.840
 competition may not be felt 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.820
 here at the ice rink of early years there 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.960
 was not cool but because they were 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.970
 hid the view etc 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.680
 but now I think we're in 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.680
 is part of the scenery and the characters 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:29.760
 like that but we no longer have faith we fight 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.500
 advance marc webb its good atmosphere and 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.420

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.670
 really a nice spirit of equipped and good 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.470
 child and as much as we can we can 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.180
