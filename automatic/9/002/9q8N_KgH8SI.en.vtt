a negative and then get the emulsion
paint<00:01:07.509> on<00:01:07.780> for<00:01:08.110> printing<00:01:08.619> so<00:01:08.920> I<00:01:08.979> have<00:01:09.220> my

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
paint on for printing so I have my

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.570 
paint on for printing so I have my
negative<00:01:09.550> here<00:01:10.030> and<00:01:13.680> there<00:01:14.680> we<00:01:14.770> give<00:01:14.950> so<00:01:15.550> I

need<00:01:18.850> to<00:01:18.880> put<00:01:19.270> the<00:01:19.960> emulsion<00:01:20.259> down<00:01:20.590> so<00:01:20.830> I<00:01:20.890> made

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
need to put the emulsion down so I made

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.300 
need to put the emulsion down so I made
already<00:01:21.430> made<00:01:21.700> for<00:01:21.940> little<00:01:22.119> dots<00:01:22.890> my<00:01:23.890> pencil

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310

now<00:01:24.520> I'm<00:01:24.580> going<00:01:24.700> to<00:01:24.759> mask<00:01:24.940> it<00:01:25.180> off<00:01:27.240> go<00:01:28.240> have<00:01:28.570> the

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
now I'm going to mask it off go have the

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.630 
now I'm going to mask it off go have the
masking<00:01:29.350> tape<00:01:31.860> this<00:01:32.860> just<00:01:33.100> keeps<00:01:33.369> the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
masking tape this just keeps the

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.719 
masking tape this just keeps the
emulsion<00:01:34.420> from<00:01:35.110> getting<00:01:35.470> way<00:01:35.860> out<00:01:36.729> of<00:01:36.790> control

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
emulsion from getting way out of control

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.800 
emulsion from getting way out of control
actually<00:01:39.729> keeps<00:01:40.000> me<00:01:40.210> from<00:01:40.420> getting<00:01:40.539> out<00:01:40.780> of

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
actually keeps me from getting out of

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.940 
actually keeps me from getting out of
control<00:01:40.929> I<00:01:41.170> know<00:01:41.319> where<00:01:41.560> to<00:01:41.740> put<00:01:41.920> the<00:01:42.009> stuff

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
control I know where to put the stuff

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.969 
control I know where to put the stuff
the<00:01:44.950> fashion<00:01:45.399> really<00:01:45.520> doesn't<00:01:45.880> go<00:01:45.970> anywhere

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979

I'm<00:02:22.120> going<00:02:22.209> to<00:02:22.270> do<00:02:22.360> it<00:02:22.480> in<00:02:22.630> subdued<00:02:23.080> lighting

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
I'm going to do it in subdued lighting

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.130 
I'm going to do it in subdued lighting
because<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:23.770> is<00:02:23.980> photosensitive<00:02:25.050> notice<00:02:26.050> how

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
because it is photosensitive notice how

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.860 
because it is photosensitive notice how
I<00:02:26.170> have<00:02:26.290> it<00:02:26.470> in<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.920> brown<00:02:27.790> glass<00:02:28.180> bottle<00:02:28.690> so

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
I have it in the brown glass bottle so

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.300 
I have it in the brown glass bottle so
it<00:02:28.930> doesn't<00:02:29.170> hit<00:02:29.290> expose<00:02:29.680> this<00:02:29.890> with<00:02:30.160> the

it doesn't hit expose this with the

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.610 
it doesn't hit expose this with the
emulsion<00:02:30.610> I<00:02:31.090> like<00:02:31.959> to<00:02:32.080> use<00:02:32.230> one<00:02:32.380> of<00:02:32.500> these

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:18.680 

should<00:03:12.910> be<00:03:13.440> plenty<00:03:15.239> if<00:03:16.239> we<00:03:16.329> get<00:03:16.480> too<00:03:16.720> little<00:03:17.019> on

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
should be plenty if we get too little on

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.199 
should be plenty if we get too little on
prints<00:03:19.690> don't<00:03:20.380> turn<00:03:20.769> out<00:03:20.890> very<00:03:21.070> blue<00:03:21.519> you<00:03:22.090> get

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
prints don't turn out very blue you get

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.050 
prints don't turn out very blue you get
too<00:03:22.420> much<00:03:22.600> on<00:03:23.070> found<00:03:24.070> that<00:03:24.250> some<00:03:24.430> of<00:03:24.519> it<00:03:24.609> washes

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
too much on found that some of it washes

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.819 
too much on found that some of it washes
away<00:03:26.340> so<00:03:27.340> there's<00:03:27.549> a<00:03:27.609> happy<00:03:28.420> spot<00:03:28.870> that<00:03:29.680> I've

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
away so there's a happy spot that I've

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:38.270 
away so there's a happy spot that I've
spread<00:03:30.160> it<00:03:30.250> out<00:03:30.340> now<00:03:30.579> I'm<00:03:30.640> going<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:30.850> fit<00:03:31.030> it

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.520 

she<00:03:39.000> was<00:03:39.180> dry<00:03:39.390> and<00:03:39.570> I'm<00:03:39.660> ready<00:03:39.870> to<00:03:40.050> make<00:03:40.500> a

print<00:03:40.860> tear<00:03:41.070> so<00:03:41.370> I<00:03:41.430> determined<00:03:41.610> that<00:03:42.000> about

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
print tear so I determined that about

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.030 
print tear so I determined that about
six<00:03:42.600> minutes<00:03:43.020> and<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.260> Sun<00:03:43.500> is<00:03:43.620> about<00:03:43.830> right

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
six minutes and the Sun is about right

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.480 
six minutes and the Sun is about right
we<00:03:44.820> had<00:03:44.940> a<00:03:45.000> few<00:03:45.180> little<00:03:45.390> test<00:03:45.690> prints<00:03:46.400> here<00:03:47.400> we

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
we had a few little test prints here we

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.320 
we had a few little test prints here we
go<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:47.880> put<00:03:48.000> the<00:03:48.120> paper<00:03:48.270> down<00:03:48.570> on<00:03:50.180> again<00:03:51.180> you

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
go and put the paper down on again you

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.790

would<00:03:51.450> want<00:03:51.630> to<00:03:51.720> do<00:03:51.840> this<00:03:51.960> in<00:03:52.110> a<00:03:52.140> subdued<00:03:52.500> light

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
would want to do this in a subdued light

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.790 
would want to do this in a subdued light
but<00:03:53.370> my<00:03:53.610> camera<00:03:53.850> couldn't<00:03:54.270> capture<00:03:54.480> it<00:03:54.800> then

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
but my camera couldn't capture it then

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.010

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
I'm going to line it up how I think it

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:04.790 
I'm going to line it up how I think it
looks<00:03:58.410> good<00:03:58.650> and<00:04:01.790> here<00:04:02.790> we<00:04:02.880> go<00:04:03.060> like<00:04:03.630> that<00:04:03.930> kind

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
looks good and here we go like that kind

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
of how I planned it

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:11.660 
of how I planned it
put<00:04:07.050> the<00:04:07.140> Plexiglas<00:04:07.680> over<00:04:08.040> it<00:04:10.370> clip<00:04:11.370> it<00:04:11.520> down

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
clipped down long enough

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.020 
clipped down long enough
um<00:04:21.800> your<00:04:22.800> print<00:04:23.070> will<00:04:23.190> come<00:04:23.370> out<00:04:23.490> fuzzy

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
um your print will come out fuzzy

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.960 
um your print will come out fuzzy
because<00:04:24.180> it'll<00:04:24.419> be<00:04:24.480> out<00:04:24.570> of<00:04:24.600> focus<00:04:25.820> put<00:04:26.820> it

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
because it'll be out of focus put it

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.320 
because it'll be out of focus put it
really<00:04:27.300> good<00:04:27.620> there<00:04:28.620> we<00:04:28.710> go<00:04:28.970> and<00:04:29.970> I'll<00:04:30.060> see<00:04:30.270> you

bring it back in is I'm going to put it
in<00:04:41.340> this<00:04:41.520> water<00:04:41.910> right<00:04:42.090> here<00:04:42.419> it's<00:04:42.540> just<00:04:42.600> a

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
in this water right here it's just a

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.310 
in this water right here it's just a
plain<00:04:43.770> old<00:04:43.800> tap<00:04:44.550> water<00:04:44.820> and<00:04:45.140> I'm<00:04:46.140> going<00:04:46.229> to

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
plain old tap water and I'm going to

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.610 
plain old tap water and I'm going to
that'll<00:04:46.830> stop<00:04:47.280> it<00:04:47.310> from<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:48.960> exposure<00:04:49.320> from

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
that'll stop it from the exposure from

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.930 
that'll stop it from the exposure from
happening<00:04:49.979> so<00:04:50.160> I<00:04:50.190> put<00:04:50.370> it<00:04:50.460> in<00:04:50.550> there<00:04:50.729> and<00:04:50.850> that

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.300 
happening so I put it in there and that
stops<00:04:51.360> the<00:04:51.510> exposure<00:04:51.870> it's<00:04:52.650> like<00:04:52.740> a<00:04:52.770> stop<00:04:53.070> bath

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
stops the exposure it's like a stop bath

00:04:53.310 --> 00:05:20.689 
stops the exposure it's like a stop bath
but<00:04:53.610> it's<00:04:53.760> just<00:04:54.150> plain<00:04:54.419> water

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:23.999 

here<00:05:21.699> what<00:05:21.879> I<00:05:21.909> have<00:05:22.089> this<00:05:22.300> is<00:05:22.360> a<00:05:22.479> bath<00:05:22.809> of<00:05:23.080> just

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:24.009 
here what I have this is a bath of just

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:26.369 
here what I have this is a bath of just
plain<00:05:24.219> water<00:05:24.430> again<00:05:24.879> and<00:05:25.029> a<00:05:25.719> tiny<00:05:25.930> little<00:05:26.199> bit

00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:26.379 
plain water again and a tiny little bit

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:27.809 
plain water again and a tiny little bit
of<00:05:26.409> hydrogen<00:05:26.919> peroxide<00:05:27.099> this<00:05:27.520> is<00:05:27.639> going<00:05:27.759> to

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:27.819 
of hydrogen peroxide this is going to

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:33.119 
of hydrogen peroxide this is going to
oxidize<00:05:28.210> it<00:05:28.599> and<00:05:28.839> this<00:05:29.740> will<00:05:29.919> tell<00:05:30.129> me<00:05:32.129> what

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:33.129 
oxidize it and this will tell me what

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:34.589 
oxidize it and this will tell me what
the<00:05:33.279> final<00:05:33.580> prints<00:05:33.819> going<00:05:33.999> to<00:05:34.059> look<00:05:34.149> like

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599 
the final prints going to look like

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:36.540 
the final prints going to look like
so<00:05:35.110> it's<00:05:35.229> going<00:05:35.319> to<00:05:35.379> get<00:05:35.529> a<00:05:35.589> really<00:05:36.099> blue<00:05:36.309> all<00:05:36.520> a

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
so it's going to get a really blue all a

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.459 
so it's going to get a really blue all a
sudden<00:05:36.819> just<00:05:37.569> got<00:05:37.719> a<00:05:37.749> tiny<00:05:38.020> little<00:05:38.259> bit<00:05:38.439> of

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:38.469 
sudden just got a tiny little bit of

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:41.100 
sudden just got a tiny little bit of
hydrogen<00:05:38.949> peroxide<00:05:39.159> in<00:05:39.610> it<00:05:39.749> and<00:05:40.749> put<00:05:40.899> it<00:05:41.020> in

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
hydrogen peroxide in it and put it in
