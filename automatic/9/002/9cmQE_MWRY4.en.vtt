has have engaged two guys now let's look
at<00:00:55.199> their<00:00:55.350> spacing<00:00:55.890> let's<00:00:56.100> look<00:00:56.219> at<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.460> two

00:00:56.599 --> 00:00:56.609 
at their spacing let's look at the two

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:58.639 
at their spacing let's look at the two
triangle<00:00:57.149> people<00:00:57.449> usually<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.170> people<00:00:58.530> that

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
triangle people usually to people that

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.680 
triangle people usually to people that
are<00:00:58.800> next<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.219> basketball<00:00:59.699> let's<00:01:00.449> look<00:01:00.539> at

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
are next to the basketball let's look at

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.380 
are next to the basketball let's look at
this<00:01:00.780> guy's<00:01:01.019> triangle<00:01:01.680> he<00:01:02.550> got<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> little<00:01:03.090> more

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
this guy's triangle he got a little more

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.999 
this guy's triangle he got a little more
of<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.539> perfect<00:01:03.989> triangle<00:01:04.229> if<00:01:04.589> he<00:01:04.679> was<00:01:04.830> about

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
of a perfect triangle if he was about

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:06.710 
of a perfect triangle if he was about
right<00:01:05.369> here<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:05.970> spacing<00:01:06.270> could<00:01:06.600> be<00:01:06.690> a

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
right here this spacing could be a

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.690 
right here this spacing could be a
little<00:01:06.960> bit<00:01:07.229> better<00:01:07.470> same<00:01:08.220> thing<00:01:08.429> with<00:01:08.550> this

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
little bit better same thing with this

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.669 
little bit better same thing with this
guy<00:01:08.789> spacings<00:01:09.450> pretty<00:01:09.780> good<00:01:10.080> but<00:01:10.320> he<00:01:10.380> could<00:01:10.560> be

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:10.679 
guy spacings pretty good but he could be

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:12.560 
guy spacings pretty good but he could be
a<00:01:10.710> little<00:01:11.039> bit<00:01:11.340> more<00:01:11.490> dangerous<00:01:12.090> if<00:01:12.300> you<00:01:12.420> have

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
a little bit more dangerous if you have

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.969 
a little bit more dangerous if you have
a<00:01:12.600> little<00:01:12.899> bit<00:01:13.050> more<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.289> a<00:01:13.350> perfect<00:01:13.770> triangle

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
a little bit more of a perfect triangle

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.630 
a little bit more of a perfect triangle
right<00:01:14.880> here<00:01:15.110> so<00:01:16.110> these<00:01:16.289> are<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.530> two<00:01:16.640> dancers

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
right here so these are the two dancers

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.999 
right here so these are the two dancers
right<00:01:17.880> here<00:01:18.170> you<00:01:19.170> see<00:01:19.349> this<00:01:19.500> dance<00:01:19.800> our<00:01:19.979> doing

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
right here you see this dance our doing

right here you see this dance our doing
a<00:01:20.220> pretty<00:01:20.429> good<00:01:20.520> job<00:01:20.670> he<00:01:21.060> can<00:01:21.209> be<00:01:21.300> more<00:01:21.479> triple

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
a pretty good job he can be more triple

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.600 
a pretty good job he can be more triple
wide<00:01:22.020> but<00:01:22.289> one<00:01:22.410> thing<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.619> doing<00:01:23.069> very<00:01:23.099> well<00:01:23.459> is

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
wide but one thing is doing very well is

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.730 
wide but one thing is doing very well is
getting<00:01:23.670> into<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.270> opening<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.530> they're

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
getting into that opening so they're

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.380 
getting into that opening so they're
going<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.920> hit<00:01:26.069> this<00:01:26.220> dancer<00:01:26.729> anytime<00:01:27.270> you

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
puncture the middle of his own about

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.150 
puncture the middle of his own about
hitting<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.160> dancer<00:01:30.679> everybody<00:01:31.679> else<00:01:31.920> needs

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
hitting the dancer everybody else needs

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.889 
hitting the dancer everybody else needs
to<00:01:32.310> move<00:01:32.489> and<00:01:32.819> get<00:01:32.940> dangerous<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.690> they<00:01:33.750> get

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
to move and get dangerous and they get

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.850 
to move and get dangerous and they get
something<00:01:34.229> easier<00:01:35.899> so<00:01:36.899> it's<00:01:37.440> not<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.590> perfect

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
something easier so it's not a perfect

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.979 
something easier so it's not a perfect
zone<00:01:38.220> attack<00:01:38.610> but<00:01:38.819> they<00:01:38.940> do<00:01:39.000> do<00:01:39.330> enough<00:01:39.690> things

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:39.989

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
well to get themselves an easy shot so

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.990 
well to get themselves an easy shot so
here's<00:01:46.709> an<00:01:46.830> example<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.369> dancer<00:01:47.849> the<00:01:47.970> dancer

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
here's an example that dancer the dancer

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.080 
here's an example that dancer the dancer
pass

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.910 

and<00:01:54.719> here's<00:01:54.960> an<00:01:55.049> example<00:01:55.289> of<00:01:55.500> punch<00:01:55.770> her<00:01:55.890> in

and she punctures the middle all five

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.580 
and she punctures the middle all five
defenders<00:02:06.270> are<00:02:06.420> going<00:02:06.569> to<00:02:06.630> turn<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.229> collapse

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
defenders are going to turn and collapse

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.499 
defenders are going to turn and collapse
he's<00:02:07.890> created<00:02:08.280> an<00:02:08.369> opening<00:02:08.489> right<00:02:08.910> here<00:02:08.970> and
