my<00:00:15.929> goal<00:00:16.170> for<00:00:16.500> probably<00:00:17.220> about<00:00:17.400> past<00:00:17.910> 4<00:00:18.240> months

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
my goal for probably about past 4 months

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.230 
my goal for probably about past 4 months
and<00:00:18.660> I<00:00:18.779> spent<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.500> vast<00:00:19.910> majority<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:20.939> my

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240

spendable<00:00:21.869> money<00:00:22.109> on<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.439> so<00:00:22.560> I'm<00:00:22.650> kind<00:00:22.890> of

broke<00:00:23.250> now<00:00:23.580> but<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:23.820> think<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.150> was<00:00:24.240> worth<00:00:24.420> it

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
broke now but I think it was worth it

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.420 
broke now but I think it was worth it
because<00:00:25.019> I'm<00:00:25.590> not<00:00:25.740> really<00:00:25.980> someone<00:00:26.279> that's

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430

but<00:01:21.750> it's<00:01:21.930> finally<00:01:22.229> done<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.619> this<00:01:22.950> means<00:01:23.159> I

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
but it's finally done and this means I

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.590 
but it's finally done and this means I
can<00:01:23.490> move<00:01:23.610> on<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.939> bigger<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.270> better<00:01:24.450> things

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
can move on to bigger and better things

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.630 
can move on to bigger and better things
so<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.380> main<00:01:25.530> thing<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.740> think<00:01:26.009> about<00:01:26.220> now<00:01:26.400> is

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
so the main thing to think about now is

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.940 
so the main thing to think about now is
what<00:01:27.090> 1:20<00:01:27.630> do<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.780> want<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.140> go<00:01:28.259> for<00:01:28.500> next<00:01:28.680> and

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
what 1:20 do I want to go for next and

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.770 
what 1:20 do I want to go for next and
I've<00:01:29.040> been<00:01:29.220> puzzling<00:01:30.030> over<00:01:30.150> this<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.450> little

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
I've been puzzling over this a little

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.260 
I've been puzzling over this a little
bit<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.200> do<00:01:31.439> have<00:01:31.740> quite<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.040> few<00:01:32.130> combat<00:01:32.729> 120s

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
bit I do have quite a few combat 120s

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.359 
bit I do have quite a few combat 120s
that<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.479> I'm<00:01:33.720> getting<00:01:34.110> fairly<00:01:34.590> close<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:35.220> the

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
that I I'm getting fairly close to the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.999 
that I I'm getting fairly close to the
main<00:01:35.880> ones<00:01:36.150> are<00:01:36.420> attack<00:01:36.990> magic<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.799> ranged

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
main ones are attack magic and ranged

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.670 
main ones are attack magic and ranged
ranges<00:01:38.670> about<00:01:38.820> 20<00:01:39.240> mil<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.420> speak<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.229> go<00:01:40.409> into

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
ranges about 20 mil I speak to go into

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.380 
ranges about 20 mil I speak to go into
120<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.549> these<00:01:41.700> are<00:01:41.850> ones<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.210> definitely

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
120 so these are ones that I definitely

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.510 
120 so these are ones that I definitely
might<00:01:42.750> work<00:01:42.960> on<00:01:43.170> I've<00:01:43.530> had<00:01:43.649> some<00:01:43.950> ideas<00:01:44.310> of

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
might work on I've had some ideas of

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.370 
might work on I've had some ideas of
possibly<00:01:45.299> going<00:01:45.479> for<00:01:45.689> boss<00:01:45.840> pets<00:01:46.110> in<00:01:46.290> a

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
possibly going for boss pets in a

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.590 
possibly going for boss pets in a
certain<00:01:46.950> way<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.579> possibly<00:01:47.880> making<00:01:48.450> some

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
certain way and possibly making some

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.359 
certain way and possibly making some
videos<00:01:48.689> about<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.200> as<00:01:49.350> well<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:50.100> should<00:01:50.340> be

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
videos about it as well that should be

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.130 
videos about it as well that should be
fairly<00:01:50.670> enjoyable<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.360> watch<00:01:51.450> for<00:01:51.780> any<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:52.049> you

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
fairly enjoyable to watch for any of you

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.380 
fairly enjoyable to watch for any of you

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.080 
patient person in the world so I decided
to<00:02:47.680> go<00:02:47.830> for<00:02:47.860> 120<00:02:48.310> prayers<00:02:48.520> because<00:02:48.850> it's<00:02:49.030> a

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
to go for 120 prayers because it's a

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.870 
to go for 120 prayers because it's a
fairly<00:02:49.300> quick<00:02:49.690> one<00:02:49.900> and<00:02:50.160> thieving<00:02:51.160> is<00:02:51.310> around

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
fairly quick one and thieving is around

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.610 
fairly quick one and thieving is around
the<00:02:52.030> same<00:02:52.209> speed<00:02:52.480> as<00:02:52.630> prayer<00:02:53.020> maybe<00:02:53.440> a<00:02:53.530> little

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
the same speed as prayer maybe a little

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.810 
the same speed as prayer maybe a little
bit<00:02:53.770> slower<00:02:53.890> but<00:02:54.070> they're<00:02:54.280> both<00:02:54.400> around<00:02:54.610> the

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
bit slower but they're both around the

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.210 
bit slower but they're both around the
300k<00:02:55.450> XP<00:02:55.870> per<00:02:56.020> hour<00:02:56.170> range<00:02:56.410> because<00:02:56.890> I<00:02:56.920> did<00:02:57.130> the

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
300k XP per hour range because I did the

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.680 
300k XP per hour range because I did the
prayer<00:02:57.459> at<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:57.820> half<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:58.150> monastery<00:02:58.570> in<00:02:58.630> the

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
prayer at the half and monastery in the

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.540 
prayer at the half and monastery in the
elf<00:02:58.840> City<00:02:58.900> so<00:02:59.500> it's<00:02:59.620> not<00:02:59.740> as<00:02:59.890> fast<00:03:00.070> as<00:03:00.310> using

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
elf City so it's not as fast as using

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.770 
elf City so it's not as fast as using
frost<00:03:00.790> dragon<00:03:00.940> bones<00:03:01.300> or<00:03:01.420> anything<00:03:01.570> like<00:03:01.720> that

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
frost dragon bones or anything like that

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.130 
frost dragon bones or anything like that
but<00:03:02.080> it's<00:03:02.200> very<00:03:02.290> afk<00:03:03.010> and<00:03:03.220> thieving<00:03:04.209> also<00:03:04.990> has

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
but it's very afk and thieving also has

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.140 
but it's very afk and thieving also has
that<00:03:05.350> benefit<00:03:05.680> of<00:03:05.860> not<00:03:06.310> requiring<00:03:06.520> much<00:03:07.000> of

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
that benefit of not requiring much of

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.790 
that benefit of not requiring much of
your<00:03:07.300> attention<00:03:07.600> in<00:03:07.840> order<00:03:07.990> to<00:03:08.260> do<00:03:08.380> it<00:03:08.530> which<00:03:08.650> I

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
your attention in order to do it which I

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.920 
your attention in order to do it which I
absolutely<00:03:08.980> love<00:03:09.490> it's<00:03:10.000> great<00:03:10.480> for<00:03:10.780> working

absolutely love it's great for working

on Ironman at the same time and it's a
fairly<00:03:14.020> fast<00:03:14.290> skill<00:03:14.530> and<00:03:14.650> you<00:03:14.709> earn<00:03:14.920> a<00:03:15.040> little

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
fairly fast skill and you earn a little

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.830 
fairly fast skill and you earn a little
bit<00:03:15.310> of<00:03:15.430> money<00:03:15.580> back<00:03:15.880> from<00:03:16.150> it<00:03:16.300> too<00:03:16.450> which<00:03:16.660> I'm

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
bit of money back from it too which I'm

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.770 
bit of money back from it too which I'm
definitely<00:03:17.410> all<00:03:17.739> about<00:03:18.310> that<00:03:18.580> so<00:03:19.209> this<00:03:19.510> is<00:03:19.570> one

definitely all about that so this is one

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:20.880 
definitely all about that so this is one
thing<00:03:19.930> that<00:03:20.050> I<00:03:20.110> might<00:03:20.260> do<00:03:20.380> even<00:03:20.800> though

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
thing that I might do even though

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.130 
thing that I might do even though
