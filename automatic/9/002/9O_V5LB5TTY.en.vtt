00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.300 

the<00:00:09.300> other<00:00:09.630> techniques<00:00:10.200> that<00:00:10.440> I<00:00:10.500> wanted<00:00:10.770> to<00:00:10.950> go

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:11.310 
the other techniques that I wanted to go

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.810 
the other techniques that I wanted to go
over<00:00:11.340> today<00:00:12.060> are<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:13.080> pushing<00:00:13.740> and

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820 
over today are the pushing and

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.490 
over today are the pushing and
depressing<00:00:14.820> pushing<00:00:15.810> and<00:00:15.930> pressing<00:00:16.350> are

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
depressing pushing and pressing are

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.650 
depressing pushing and pressing are
really<00:00:16.770> fundamental<00:00:17.610> techniques<00:00:18.210> in<00:00:18.420> all

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
really fundamental techniques in all

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.400 
really fundamental techniques in all
forms<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.110> bodywork<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:20.960> these<00:00:21.960> techniques

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
forms of bodywork and these techniques

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.580 
forms of bodywork and these techniques
in<00:00:22.650> particular<00:00:23.250> if<00:00:24.119> you<00:00:24.570> use<00:00:24.750> different<00:00:25.290> tools

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
in particular if you use different tools

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.019 
in particular if you use different tools
they<00:00:26.400> have<00:00:26.580> very<00:00:27.470> very<00:00:28.470> different<00:00:29.029> effects

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
they have very very different effects

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.980 
they have very very different effects
okay<00:00:30.540> so<00:00:31.410> with<00:00:31.680> pushing<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.790> know<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.600> line

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:33.990 
okay so with pushing you know the line

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.690 
okay so with pushing you know the line
between<00:00:34.200> rubbing<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:34.950> pushing<00:00:35.280> might<00:00:35.430> seem

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
between rubbing and pushing might seem

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.580 
between rubbing and pushing might seem
to<00:00:35.940> be<00:00:36.090> kind<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.630> fine<00:00:36.960> but<00:00:37.380> pushing<00:00:39.590> yeah

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
to be kind of fine but pushing yeah

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.740 
to be kind of fine but pushing yeah
pushing<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.550> different<00:00:41.969> from<00:00:42.090> rubbing<00:00:42.539> in<00:00:42.660> the

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
pushing is different from rubbing in the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.200 
pushing is different from rubbing in the
sense<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.109> you<00:00:43.260> you're<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.879> are

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
sense that you you're you are

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.959 
sense that you you're you are
introducing<00:00:45.629> some<00:00:46.260> degree<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.739> pressure<00:00:47.129> like

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
introducing some degree of pressure like

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.509 
introducing some degree of pressure like
I'm<00:00:48.120> pressing<00:00:48.570> into<00:00:48.899> her<00:00:49.109> body<00:00:49.320> now<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.890> then

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519 
I'm pressing into her body now and then

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:53.660 
I'm pressing into her body now and then
I'm<00:00:50.850> adding<00:00:51.149> on<00:00:51.780> vector<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:52.890> typically

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
I'm adding on vector to it so typically

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.520 
I'm adding on vector to it so typically
pushing<00:00:54.179> has<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.629> be<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> little<00:00:55.019> bit<00:00:55.140> slower

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
pushing has to be a little bit slower

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.060 
pushing has to be a little bit slower
because<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.820> need<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.149> have<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:58.070> contact

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
because you need to have that contact

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.029 
because you need to have that contact
and<00:00:59.570> you<00:01:00.570> know<00:01:00.660> put<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.170> pressure<00:01:01.410> down<00:01:01.739> into

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
and you know put that pressure down into

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.310 
and you know put that pressure down into
the<00:01:02.190> patient's<00:01:02.579> body<00:01:02.760> so<00:01:03.690> right<00:01:03.870> now<00:01:03.899> I'm<00:01:04.110> just

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
the patient's body so right now I'm just

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.170 
the patient's body so right now I'm just
doing<00:01:04.589> this<00:01:04.710> with<00:01:04.920> my<00:01:05.070> columns<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:06.060> know

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
doing this with my columns you know

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.220 
doing this with my columns you know
putting<00:01:06.450> pressure<00:01:06.720> down<00:01:07.050> and<00:01:07.650> then<00:01:09.140> adding<00:01:10.140> a

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.230 
putting pressure down and then adding a

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.350 
putting pressure down and then adding a
vector<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.770> it

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:21.289 

now<00:01:15.360> if<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.409> were<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:19.460> okay<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.820> thing<00:01:21.000> about

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
now if you were to okay the thing about

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.050 
now if you were to okay the thing about
pushing<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:23.540> you<00:01:24.540> can<00:01:24.720> only<00:01:24.840> um<00:01:25.909> do<00:01:26.909> it

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
pushing is that you can only um do it

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.530 
pushing is that you can only um do it
effectively<00:01:28.549> with<00:01:29.549> your<00:01:29.729> palms<00:01:30.000> when<00:01:30.420> they

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
effectively with your palms when they

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.560 
effectively with your palms when they
have<00:01:30.869> when<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.409> patient<00:01:31.740> has<00:01:31.860> clothes<00:01:32.159> on<00:01:32.570> if

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
have when the patient has clothes on if

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.530 
have when the patient has clothes on if
you<00:01:33.750> start<00:01:33.990> adding<00:01:35.060> too<00:01:36.060> much<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.420> a

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
you start adding too much of a

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.280 
you start adding too much of a
penetrative<00:01:37.080> force<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.619> you're<00:01:38.100> pushing

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
penetrative force and you're pushing

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.020 
penetrative force and you're pushing
you're<00:01:40.290> going<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.530> kind<00:01:40.830> of<00:01:40.920> damage<00:01:41.759> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
you're going to kind of damage the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.530 
you're going to kind of damage the
clothes<00:01:42.360> or<00:01:42.979> something<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.450> usually<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
clothes or something so usually the

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.840 
clothes or something so usually the
other<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:46.530> more<00:01:46.679> penetrative<00:01:47.340> types<00:01:47.670> of

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
other the more penetrative types of

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.419 
other the more penetrative types of
pushing<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.420> have<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.780> have<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.429> patient's

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
pushing you have to have the patient's

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:52.580 
pushing you have to have the patient's
back<00:01:50.670> exposed<00:01:51.330> and<00:01:51.660> use<00:01:51.869> some<00:01:52.110> kind<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.409> a

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
back exposed and use some kind of a

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.880 
back exposed and use some kind of a
liniment<00:01:53.039> or<00:01:53.190> something<00:01:53.610> like<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.759> okay<00:01:54.890> but

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
liniment or something like that okay but

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.800 
liniment or something like that okay but
is<00:01:56.070> everybody<00:01:56.490> sort<00:01:56.940> of<00:01:57.000> clear<00:01:57.270> about<00:01:57.479> what<00:01:57.780> i

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
is everybody sort of clear about what i

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.899 
is everybody sort of clear about what i
mean<00:01:58.020> by<00:01:58.200> pushing<00:01:58.470> this<00:01:58.860> is<00:01:59.039> the<00:01:59.220> pushing<00:01:59.640> that

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
mean by pushing this is the pushing that

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.430 
mean by pushing this is the pushing that
is<00:02:00.149> my<00:02:01.110> tweet<00:02:01.800> from<00:02:02.190> tween<00:02:02.520> ok<00:02:03.289> again<00:02:04.289> to

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
is my tweet from tween ok again to

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.830 
is my tweet from tween ok again to
distinguish<00:02:05.039> it<00:02:05.220> it's<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:06.060> addition<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.569> some

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
distinguish it it's the addition of some

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.999 
distinguish it it's the addition of some
degree<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.259> pressure<00:02:07.619> plus<00:02:08.300> vector<00:02:09.300> like<00:02:09.720> a

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
degree of pressure plus vector like a

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:16.730 
degree of pressure plus vector like a
pushing<00:02:11.009> in<00:02:11.100> a<00:02:11.190> direction

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.050 

um<00:02:16.920> yeah<00:02:17.780> yeah<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:18.930> this<00:02:19.110> it's<00:02:19.980> it's<00:02:20.280> probably

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
um yeah yeah and this it's it's probably

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.270 
um yeah yeah and this it's it's probably
more<00:02:21.330> in<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.510> heel<00:02:21.770> although<00:02:22.770> you<00:02:22.830> know<00:02:23.220> you

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
more in the heel although you know you

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.400 
more in the heel although you know you
can<00:02:23.610> that's<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.510> other<00:02:24.600> thing<00:02:24.750> even<00:02:25.290> though<00:02:25.380> I

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
can that's the other thing even though I

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.810 
can that's the other thing even though I
talked<00:02:25.680> about<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.070> palm<00:02:26.280> as<00:02:26.520> though<00:02:26.670> it's

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
talked about the palm as though it's

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.070 
talked about the palm as though it's
just<00:02:27.150> one<00:02:27.390> thing<00:02:28.130> there<00:02:29.130> you<00:02:29.850> can<00:02:30.150> use<00:02:30.720> various

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
just one thing there you can use various

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.400 
just one thing there you can use various
parts<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.710> the<00:02:31.830> palm<00:02:32.070> okay<00:02:32.850> you<00:02:33.390> can<00:02:33.600> eat<00:02:33.750> most

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
parts of the palm okay you can eat most

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.670 
parts of the palm okay you can eat most
people<00:02:34.770> use<00:02:34.950> this<00:02:35.820> in<00:02:36.300> our<00:02:36.420> eminence<00:02:36.870> but<00:02:37.140> you

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
people use this in our eminence but you

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.820 
people use this in our eminence but you
can<00:02:37.830> also<00:02:38.010> use<00:02:38.190> more<00:02:38.700> like<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.090> edge<00:02:39.300> of<00:02:39.480> the

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
can also use more like the edge of the

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.470 
can also use more like the edge of the
the<00:02:40.830> hypothenar<00:02:41.430> eminence<00:02:41.910> on<00:02:42.270> this<00:02:42.420> time<00:02:42.660> no

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
the hypothenar eminence on this time no

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.050 
the hypothenar eminence on this time no
that's<00:02:45.480> one<00:02:45.720> thing<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.110> know<00:02:46.370> I<00:02:47.370> guess<00:02:47.850> that's

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
that's one thing you know I guess that's

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.970 
that's one thing you know I guess that's
one<00:02:48.240> thing<00:02:48.390> that<00:02:48.450> makes<00:02:48.690> this<00:02:48.840> kind<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:49.560> an<00:02:49.740> art

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
one thing that makes this kind of an art

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.540 
one thing that makes this kind of an art
as<00:02:50.280> well<00:02:50.490> is<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:50.810> you<00:02:51.810> can<00:02:52.370> you<00:02:53.370> can

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
as well is that you can you can

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.130 
as well is that you can you can
experiment<00:02:54.090> with<00:02:54.270> different<00:02:54.540> tools<00:02:54.960> in

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
experiment with different tools in

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.260 
experiment with different tools in
different<00:02:55.470> ways<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:55.950> get<00:02:56.100> the<00:02:56.760> effect<00:02:57.180> that

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
different ways to get the effect that

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.460 
different ways to get the effect that
you<00:02:57.390> want<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.900> okay<00:02:58.710> so<00:02:58.940> just<00:02:59.940> you<00:03:00.420> know<00:03:00.540> don't

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
you want to okay so just you know don't

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.260 
you want to okay so just you know don't
restrict<00:03:01.860> yourself<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.340> thinking<00:03:02.970> like<00:03:03.120> oh

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
restrict yourself to thinking like oh

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.640 
restrict yourself to thinking like oh
I'm<00:03:03.390> going<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.630> use<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.870> palms<00:03:04.110> I<00:03:04.320> have<00:03:04.470> to

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
I'm going to use the palms I have to

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.300 
I'm going to use the palms I have to
flatter<00:03:05.580> you<00:03:06.120> can<00:03:06.300> just<00:03:06.480> stop<00:03:06.690> somebody

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.030 

we<00:03:10.310> be

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
we be

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.220 
we be
exaggerated<00:03:13.030> like<00:03:13.360> some<00:03:13.569> people<00:03:13.810> Kevin

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.290 

if<00:03:18.680> I<00:03:18.800> CC<00:03:19.340> @<00:03:19.430> x<00:03:19.610> rays<00:03:19.819> with<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.120> other

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
if I CC @ x rays with the other

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.500 
if I CC @ x rays with the other
okay<00:03:22.220> yeah<00:03:23.220> like<00:03:23.460> that<00:03:23.730> gets<00:03:24.000> into<00:03:24.210> an

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
okay yeah like that gets into an

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.330 
okay yeah like that gets into an
interesting<00:03:26.060> topic<00:03:27.060> home<00:03:28.100> how<00:03:29.100> do<00:03:29.160> you<00:03:29.250> think

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
interesting topic home how do you think

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.400 
interesting topic home how do you think
you<00:03:29.670> would<00:03:29.790> address<00:03:30.060> something<00:03:33.110> if<00:03:34.110> you<00:03:34.230> get

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
you would address something if you get

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.700 
you would address something if you get
too<00:03:34.620> close<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.570> vertebra

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:38.710 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.520 

yeah<00:03:39.850> okay<00:03:40.850> when<00:03:41.090> I'm<00:03:41.210> doing<00:03:41.360> this<00:03:41.690> yeah<00:03:42.320> if

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
yeah okay when I'm doing this yeah if

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.950 
yeah okay when I'm doing this yeah if
they<00:03:42.680> have<00:03:42.860> a<00:03:42.890> scoliosis<00:03:43.400> then<00:03:44.030> yeah<00:03:44.210> I<00:03:44.480> guess

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 
they have a scoliosis then yeah I guess

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.070 
they have a scoliosis then yeah I guess
it<00:03:44.990> would<00:03:45.230> be<00:03:45.380> better<00:03:45.560> to<00:03:46.360> follow<00:03:47.360> the<00:03:47.660> muscles

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
it would be better to follow the muscles

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.650 
it would be better to follow the muscles
not<00:03:48.530> the<00:03:48.800> not<00:03:49.430> just<00:03:49.640> go<00:03:49.850> straight<00:03:50.180> at<00:03:50.300> window

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
not the not just go straight at window

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.000 
not the not just go straight at window
and<00:03:52.540> that's<00:03:53.540> a<00:03:53.630> good<00:03:53.780> point<00:03:54.080> on<00:03:54.410> when<00:03:54.860> we're

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
and that's a good point on when we're

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.440 
and that's a good point on when we're
doing<00:03:55.160> any<00:03:55.460> of<00:03:55.610> our<00:03:55.760> techniques<00:03:56.180> especially

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
doing any of our techniques especially

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.300 
doing any of our techniques especially
these<00:03:57.340> more<00:03:58.340> longitudinal<00:03:59.180> techniques<00:03:59.660> um<00:04:00.310> as

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
these more longitudinal techniques um as

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.550 
these more longitudinal techniques um as
much<00:04:01.550> as<00:04:01.700> possible<00:04:01.880> don't<00:04:02.240> just<00:04:02.510> go<00:04:03.140> up<00:04:03.380> and

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
much as possible don't just go up and

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.430 
much as possible don't just go up and
down<00:04:03.740> but<00:04:04.130> you<00:04:04.280> know<00:04:04.400> try<00:04:04.700> to<00:04:04.760> feel<00:04:05.060> I<00:04:05.510> guess

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
down but you know try to feel I guess

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.260 
down but you know try to feel I guess
the<00:04:06.620> contours<00:04:07.070> of<00:04:07.070> the<00:04:07.220> body<00:04:07.490> and<00:04:07.670> follow<00:04:07.970> them

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
the contours of the body and follow them

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.470 
the contours of the body and follow them
and<00:04:08.950> yeah<00:04:09.950> in<00:04:10.100> some<00:04:10.370> cases<00:04:10.640> with<00:04:10.940> like<00:04:11.120> if<00:04:11.270> a

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
and yeah in some cases with like if a

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.360 
and yeah in some cases with like if a
person<00:04:11.510> has<00:04:11.870> scoliosis<00:04:12.230> that<00:04:12.890> might<00:04:13.160> mean

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
person has scoliosis that might mean

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:21.010 
person has scoliosis that might mean
that<00:04:13.430> you<00:04:13.850> have<00:04:13.880> to<00:04:15.489> curve<00:04:16.489> the<00:04:16.520> line<00:04:18.010> um
