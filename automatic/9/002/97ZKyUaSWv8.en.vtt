00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello everyone my name is label when up 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.270
 the new year is already quite 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.250
 few days it's time to let some down 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.370
 the results here I think now that you 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.440
 tell me what it was in 2013 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.500
 to be really worthy 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.900
 attention of some kind but honestly at all 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.490
 nothing comes to mind but still on 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.060
 mind comes one interesting point 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.180
 which I had in December and I wanted 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.460
 show you but sometime first 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.180
 there was not enough material and 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.670
 finally by the end of 2013 I decided 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.059
 there may have been more important 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.129
 events but this is which I probably 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.989
 I will remember for a long time but agree 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.239
 stupid now would be to create some 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.579
 intrigue because you all have long 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.140
 read in the title of the video and probably 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.590
 now you understand what is at stake 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.020
 December 3, 2013 I visited 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.149
 the concert of the band is cut the season and the band 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.789
 traces for a start tell you what me 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.570
 generally encouraged to go to this concert and 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.489
 probably this desire that I had 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.979
 have long been to attend such an event 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.350
 the first thing that entered the program 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.810
 autograph session with a group of sesame tacan 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.790
 as a concert, all the same, it was originally exactly 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.159
 here is this group but just to warm up 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.439
 there was a group merged about which i think you 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.689
 don't know but I'll tell you a bit later 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.579
 and by the way, yes for those who have not yet 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.770
 understands what is being said and what I do 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:28.350
 I say now I told the group 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.840
 crouched season this group is notorious 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.970
 video blogger max plus up to 500 and his 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.860
 Friends at the autograph session did not occur 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.110
 nothing unusual i don't have any 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.909
 video clips to show tell you 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.750
 just that I was photographed with 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.850
 I took autographs by fax and the whole group 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.100
 but at once I will voice to you the one and only 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.319
 minus although it may be the only but 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.179
 Here is a significant minus to tell you 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:53.280
 this is something that failed to converge with 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.530
 other members of the group but only with 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.959
 max the whole event lasted 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.390
 two hours to open the Sagan season played 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:03.090
 his after that traces this is our Tomsk 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:07.009
 the group and I was fond of you roughly somewhere in 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.500
 2011 and 2012 but then I somehow 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.299
 still stopped this hobby 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.400
 stopped listening to them but this one 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.620
 here is a concert that made me 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.900
 again I began to listen to their songs tell 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.579
 honestly group cool guys cool 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.709
 cool played 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:25.260
 and to meet you get to 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.380
 creativity you can follow the link in 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.109
 description I'll leave you a reference on 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.329
 their creep which by the way recently came out to me 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:34.730
 and the video and the song really like it very much 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.920
 so kind 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.140
 uplifting but maybe 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.120
 but not everyone understands me so that 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.040
 look i 'm sure he'll like it 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.269
 Well, of course, some videos from 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.269
 footprints 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.560
 you 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.239
 you 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.400
 and 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.410
 and 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.990
 but now let's probably move on 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.780
 band second season never seen 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.010
 before I love live but listened to their music 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.930
 I really liked her 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.040
 in principle, what am I telling you? 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.040
 now see for yourself 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.660
 your e-mail 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.660
 Washington 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:16.650
 one 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.510
 and then 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.850
 scattered function either just follows 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.020
 now entertainment 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.070
 they 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:31.480
 the car does not know how to give currency update 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.480
 general match feature 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.360
 i hate 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.940
 and after the juice show season I was 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.710
 a little more upset by the fact that not 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.180
 still managed to take pictures with 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.759
 all group members on 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.190
 autograph session because in fact 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:05.069
 very cool made very cool 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:07.289
 I won back but I did 

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:09.870
 I decided to rectify the situation I was able to 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:12.659
 take a picture with a guitar player 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:15.030
 Alex and Max 's girlfriend Nastya Polekova 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:17.580
 In general, I really liked the concert 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:19.800
 I was pleasantly surprised to be eager 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.840
 Of course, wait for the return to Tomsk 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.069
 second season and be sure to once again 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.050
 go to the concert 

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:28.620
 Well, the group tracks me somehow closer 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:30.569
 still because you are swords and if they 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.270
 there will be a concert you will definitely go too 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:35.669
 because the band is very cool music 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:38.219
 not cool so fun well on it 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:40.110
 perhaps all if you liked it 

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:42.120
