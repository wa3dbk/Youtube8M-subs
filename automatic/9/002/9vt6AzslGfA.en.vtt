the total control midi controller for
our<00:00:15.990> software<00:00:16.320> q<00:00:17.330> this<00:00:18.330> allows<00:00:18.600> me<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:18.840> mix

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
our software q this allows me to mix

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.599 
our software q this allows me to mix
fade<00:00:20.150> scratch<00:00:21.150> loop<00:00:21.960> everything<00:00:22.920> that<00:00:23.160> you

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
fade scratch loop everything that you

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.700 
fade scratch loop everything that you
would<00:00:23.730> use<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:24.090> queue<00:00:24.330> with<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.320> mouse<00:00:25.470> but

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
would use in queue with the mouse but

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.310 
would use in queue with the mouse but
freeing<00:00:25.920> your<00:00:26.039> hands<00:00:26.279> up<00:00:26.400> allowing<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:27.000> to

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
freeing your hands up allowing you to

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.540 
freeing your hands up allowing you to
work<00:00:28.320> multiple<00:00:28.529> parameters<00:00:28.890> at<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.400> same

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
work multiple parameters at the same

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.429 
work multiple parameters at the same
time<00:00:29.730> so<00:00:30.660> here<00:00:30.900> i'm<00:00:30.960> going<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.140> change<00:00:31.320> a

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
time so here i'm going to change a

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.830 
time so here i'm going to change a
couple<00:00:31.590> tracks<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.759> throw<00:00:33.450> them<00:00:33.510> into<00:00:33.660> each

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
couple tracks and throw them into each

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.319 
couple tracks and throw them into each
side<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:34.860> i'm<00:00:34.920> scrolling<00:00:35.219> from<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.059> total

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329

basically do a basic blend with the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.960 
basically do a basic blend with the
cross<00:01:05.939> fader<00:01:06.180> just<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.170> see<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.729> so<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.790> can

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
cross fader just to see you so you can

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.700 
cross fader just to see you so you can
see<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.210> fade<00:01:09.420> from<00:01:10.049> right<00:01:10.260> side<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.650> left

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
see the fade from right side to the left

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.370 
see the fade from right side to the left
side<00:01:12.049> and<00:01:13.049> up<00:01:13.860> top<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.310> our<00:01:14.580> wave<00:01:14.729> display

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.030 
actually loop from here loop in loop out
and<00:01:29.100> then<00:01:29.820> trim<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.270> loop<00:01:30.530> with<00:01:31.530> our<00:01:31.680> left<00:01:31.860> and

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
and then trim the loop with our left and

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.810 
and then trim the loop with our left and
right<00:01:32.189> cursor<00:01:32.729> arrows<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:34.070> on<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.670> wave

right cursor arrows and on the wave

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.780 
right cursor arrows and on the wave
display<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.210> can<00:01:36.450> see<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:37.140> loop<00:01:37.790> lengthening

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
display you can see the loop lengthening

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.260 
display you can see the loop lengthening
and<00:01:39.000> shortening<00:01:40.280> according<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.430> which

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
and shortening according to which

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.359 
comes with as well here's our audio
effects<00:01:50.520> these<00:01:51.509> come<00:01:52.140> with<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.380> software<00:01:52.710> we

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
effects these come with the software we

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.880 
effects these come with the software we
have<00:01:53.490> video<00:01:53.759> effects<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.619> separate<00:01:55.619> video

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
have video effects and separate video

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.770 
have video effects and separate video
transitions<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:57.180> right<00:01:57.329> now<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.479> have<00:01:57.689> the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
transitions so right now I have the

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.310 
transitions so right now I have the
video<00:01:58.049> transitions<00:01:58.469> set<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.100> fade<00:02:00.200> with<00:02:01.200> the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
video transitions set to fade with the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.660 
video transitions set to fade with the
cross<00:02:01.500> fader<00:02:02.030> i'll<00:02:03.030> change<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.710> cube<00:02:04.710> so

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
cross fader i'll change it to cube so

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.800 
cross fader i'll change it to cube so
now<00:02:05.820> if<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:06.000> look<00:02:06.149> at<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.329> master<00:02:06.479> output

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
now if you look at the master output

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.589 
now if you look at the master output
which<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.439> top<00:02:07.619> video<00:02:08.160> screen<00:02:08.520> it's<00:02:09.450> going

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
which is the top video screen it's going

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.660 
which is the top video screen it's going
to<00:02:09.629> rotate<00:02:09.810> like<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.140> cube

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
to rotate like a cube

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.760 
to rotate like a cube
there's<00:02:12.300> another<00:02:13.110> one<00:02:13.230> I'll<00:02:13.440> show<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:13.650> this

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
there's another one I'll show you this
