 answers short and less 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.050
 Fifty rubles seconds to fifty

 and we are on all three land that 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.550
 are m 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.830
 and a follower of such really human 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.440
 p values ​​and recognized as 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.720
 democracy is freedom not to let yes decide 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.620
 percentage of the nature of the controversy to nail 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.440
 discussions 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.160
 because what we are discussing today 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.280
 this question is acceptable for 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.420
 and acceptable for today 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.350
 Russia in r its society and state in sphere 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.189
 holding a Eurovision contest in our 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:34.950
 territories 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.250
 as for the nature of the controversy 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.250
 and i'm afraid u didn't consider myself 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.050
 eligible 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.900
 go over 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.189
 you began to come to Rome 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.869
 sitting errors began after one 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.369
 from the requests of one of the deputies 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.150
 there are no legislative assemblies 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.249
 contestants and winners 

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:54.639
 Eurovision last contest 

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:57.699
 the matter is whether our colleague is colleague 

00:01:57.699 --> 00:02:01.329
 famous figure skater Eugene Plushenko neither 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.489
 his fellow faction fair 

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:05.309
 Russia which krasavia such request 

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:07.430
 sent them need marchenko 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.270
 I think that here and in general, nothing to create 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.059
 become all the more so because our parliament 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:14.419
 and all this 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:16.509
 but sorry blue for started parliament 

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:18.609
 the parliament is formally composed of 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:20.559
 low party we have pluralism of opinions 

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:23.729
 which what gives birth to the world district 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:26.509
 Petersburg typical for example here too 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:28.219
 deputy banned for flying on 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:29.969
 I want a specific question that you 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:31.639
 say whether I had a headache 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:32.869
 if anything else 

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:35.579
 the percentage will be now from in controversy I 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.599
 I will say say that, too, judging by your 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.419
 voting and therefore voted which 

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:41.369
 was the bronze medalist channel 

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:42.399
 percent 

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:44.779
 in general, many people remember Petersburgers 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:47.059
 express their opinion resonant year 

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:48.839
 mashenka but if they were given the opportunity 

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:50.949
 become Islam was not another lexically 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:52.269
 form then expressed 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:53.609
 so I would suggest dates 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.790
 go to the discussion there is a question 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.799
 which sets a different perspective and on 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:02:58.549
 thing 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.439
 acceptable underdeveloped two parts 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:01.669
 chase part 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:04.459
 rather pragmatic and morally 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.419
 it is difficult once they all collect 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:08.399
 it should be held by our 

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:09.280
 there is no city 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.090
 Viktor Leonidov said two important 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.319
 things like political events with this 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.760
 point of view it is beneficial to us 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.709
 in terms of the fact that it is also profitable 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.549
 short ohhh but like city dwellers 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.360
 told me nice to come here 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.270
 foreigners new people and young people again 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.520
 and while you talk to him but I do not 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.939
 like said another 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:28.379
 angry pigsty who can 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:29.979
 stay after this event us 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:30.649
 the city 

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:32.449
 so this question is not to hold not 

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:34.329
 hold and how to spend it 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:35.630
 so that it is clean 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:36.830
 we got political 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.880
 economic benefits people talked to 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.610
 interesting people get nice 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.720
 emotions but the city remained a city 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.930
 cultural too polar capital and 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.170
 so on we have Alexander Alexander Shvets 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.439
 radio baltic 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:50.929
 however five years 

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:52.200
 Hello Svetlana 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.849
 on the turn of the radio Baltic became 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.200
 a kind of front in the conflict of generations 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.879
 the opinion of our listeners that 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:59.920
 no matter how old they are we like 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.730
 just trying to figure out what they think abols 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.019
 sails and must confess annotations 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.150
 were much more active than the children of the young 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.970
 generations will probably have their say 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.669
 very soon on the streets 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:13.739
 at the prosecutor's office 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:14.829
 Vladivostok 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.499
 just wonder why you need 

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:19.119
 city ​​from such a pupil who 

00:04:19.119 --> 00:04:20.579
 in addition to cents 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.669
 true economies that spend 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.879
 guide and rule of law 

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:27.059
 and if you have any thoughts on this these 

00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:28.309
 opinions about the holiday are very 

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:29.989
 strongly divided team track 

00:04:29.989 --> 00:04:32.349
 said mother sorry Rostovy youth 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:34.409
 it's true it's their holiday question 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:36.550
 must be because that 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.189
 the day the release notes are 10 

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.650
 years old 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.400
 I myself celebrated 99 holiday I remember 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.300
 of course were open to put on the street 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.499
 Marata Mousavi 

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:47.319
 these emotions need to give young people 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:49.139
 because they deserve it for 10 years 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.209
 when they worked and now they have 

00:04:51.209 --> 00:04:52.080
 opportunity 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.330
 and express it all talk to each other 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.860
