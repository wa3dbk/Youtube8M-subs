think<00:00:38.730> we<00:00:38.879> should<00:00:38.910> make<00:00:39.570> silver<00:00:39.989> Twilight

enterprises<00:00:41.280> fight<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:41.910> for<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.270> points

enterprises fight this for the points
and<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:42.840> think<00:00:43.110> we<00:00:43.230> should<00:00:43.260> see<00:00:43.559> if<00:00:43.590> they<00:00:43.800> can

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
and I think we should see if they can

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.760 
and I think we should see if they can
win<00:00:43.980> we<00:00:44.670> may<00:00:44.910> need<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.180> extend<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.260> timer<00:00:46.500> ever

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
win we may need to extend the timer ever
