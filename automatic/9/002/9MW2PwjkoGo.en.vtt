00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.420
 good anyway he did not live the 145 

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:07.220
 from jesulÃ­n favorites to take a 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.049
 lot and news that you download and but 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.719
 pretty good you're going to realize that 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:14.059
 technology advances far more than 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.700
 what we think and there are applications that do not 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.900
 They are for all but logically 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.920
 that really has a pint 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.780
 extraordinary 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.840
 basically because microsoft has invented 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.240
 a kind of apparatus we could say 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.730
 what good comedians then what 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.950
 we could say then kinect and in 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.689
 projectors and others well have 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.460
 created the room 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.010
 basically last year we had the 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.520
 mirror thread that you already know that what 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.170
 toward 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.640
 basically it was to expand the 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.470
 vision of the good television 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.950
 basically we have the TV and good the 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.380
 wall because it was good for projects 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.630
 not projecting what would be more 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.370
 background of what we have on the screen 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.590
 not primarily because granda by 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.920
 say it in a way with rumba live 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.270
 this seems to be an illuminated and lumi 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.920
 room 2.0 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.890
 basically converts all our 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.750
 fourth in a video game basically because 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.260
 you have it in the videos of the 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.910
 description 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.880
 logically while I'm just going to 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.110
 explain it because if it does not make sense 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.520
 explaining if you do not see it with your 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.710
 own eyes because I explain myself as 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.390
 sluts cocks many times and good 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.680
 basically that makes all of them 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.040
 the walls of our room in 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.810
 augmented reality we could not say 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.790
 with different devices and others like 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.830
 example a gun then we can go 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.150
 playing and this has enough of 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.980
 applications even if it looks like a whore 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.360
 bullshit that has enough 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.070
 applications to play for example to 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.200
 any normal video game with the rr 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.960
 tele and so on and that the whole fund of 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.640
 our room is adapted for 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.910
 that game is imagine we're 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.100
 playing the folk titan for example me that 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.229
 I know we are looking forward not 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.610
 in our titan and others and that I know 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.979
 on the left on the right 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.450
 we can see different parts from behind 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.000
 so we can see the back of the 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.520
 map I do not know would be something pretty cool not 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.920
 course the titan fold by with any 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.510
 another eye but really as I say then 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.290
 It has many applications though 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.290
 let's be in a 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.470
 environment that does not get us inside more than 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.770
 game of what we are imagined 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.260
 will also play the pp with those with that not 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.910
 currently it would be amazing and I hope 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.730
 that some day something comes but that 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.620
 let's actually radic you're going down 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.450
 of movement and shit so do 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.920
 big things like these that 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.680
 try to cheapen prices and that 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.060
 really because this is affordable in a 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.060
 near future because it's pretty 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.680
 pimp is not cool enough I do not know if to 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.959
 people will like it or not for me 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.310
 at least I'm very excited about this 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.410
 kind of things because they would be the future 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.790
 let's have wonders so 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.160
 really position for something in the 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.140
 get directly into a game 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.140
 so we see in the next video
