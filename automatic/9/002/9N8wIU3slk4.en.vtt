00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.349
 every day they always do everything the same at some time in the morning of 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.949
 yesterday began the dispute for a space within the public transport 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.719
 offered crowds of outside people a bit uncomfortable 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.100
 until when we will continue filling teapots and avenues of automobiles the 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.660
 traffic congestion by increasing pollution and decreasing 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.900
 considerably our quality of life 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.030
 did you know that 56 million Brazilians do not use transportation 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.030
 because you do not have the money to pay the 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.210
 and that the passenger of the automobile consumes about ten times more energy than 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.760
 a passenger of buses and 25 times more than a passenger of subway 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.440
 Did you know that 40,000 people die every year in Brazil from accidents 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.220
 of traffic and that 120 thousand become disabled 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.290
 committed to helping the public power change this scenario was born mpt 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.060
 movement for the right to quality public transport 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.210
 all 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.890
 the inter-party had sought to insert in the socialist political agendas with the name each 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.510
 nation the public transport 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.200
 the strong treaty as an essential service 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.399
 equated with education and health, both with regard to 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.189
 investments as well as for the provision of 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.740
 services is to take the ordinary citizen out of the 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.740
 transportation to work was 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.810
 give people mobility thereby achieving greater social inclusion 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.320
 generating employment and income 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.479
 achieving development 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.349
 and quality of life 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.179
 I was awakened in five basic axes 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:21.149
 mobility for all permanent investment in collective transport 

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:26.589
 social inclusion tariffs priority to public transport 

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:31.719
 in transit public transport with the technological development that 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:34.059
 respects the environment 

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:36.279
 guided by these five axes 

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:41.609
 the movement comes to present to society and governments various proposals such as 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:46.219
 for example to allocate part of the proceeds from taxes and 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:47.489
 contributions 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.099
 for public transport 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:54.499
 create a technological environment focused on this segment you will enter the 

00:02:54.499 --> 00:03:01.109
 main inputs of the sector at last the mpt does not propose any magic I want 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:06.280
 public transport as a priority mobility as a priority. 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.489
 Everyone's right to make life better. 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.810
 this is one of the indicators of our development
