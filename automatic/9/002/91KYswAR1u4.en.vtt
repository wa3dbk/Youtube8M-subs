you'll be making your way up the wall
nicely<00:01:09.430> completing<00:01:09.970> route<00:01:10.119> I've<00:01:10.270> done<00:01:10.540> more

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
nicely completing route I've done more

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.780 
nicely completing route I've done more
the<00:01:10.930> easier<00:01:11.290> routes<00:01:11.799> there's<00:01:12.369> still<00:01:12.580> some

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
the easier routes there's still some

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.670 
the easier routes there's still some
routes<00:01:13.000> I'd<00:01:13.180> like<00:01:13.930> I<00:01:14.020> wouldn't<00:01:14.260> be<00:01:14.320> able<00:01:14.410> to<00:01:14.530> do

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
routes I'd like I wouldn't be able to do

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.650 
routes I'd like I wouldn't be able to do
right<00:01:14.830> now<00:01:14.890> but<00:01:15.430> maybe<00:01:16.030> in<00:01:16.210> a<00:01:16.270> little<00:01:16.510> bit

after<00:01:16.900> a<00:01:17.140> couple<00:01:17.320> more<00:01:17.530> classes<00:01:17.980> I'll<00:01:18.160> be<00:01:18.250> able

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
after a couple more classes I'll be able

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.820

to like the six-foot tall guy like
climbs<00:01:34.030> here<00:01:34.270> but<00:01:34.680> it's<00:01:35.680> not<00:01:35.890> all<00:01:36.310> about<00:01:36.520> just

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
climbs here but it's not all about just

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.520 
climbs here but it's not all about just
muscle<00:01:37.270> it's<00:01:37.390> very<00:01:37.600> strategic<00:01:38.140> it's<00:01:38.320> a<00:01:38.380> lot<00:01:38.500> of

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
muscle it's very strategic it's a lot of

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.530 
muscle it's very strategic it's a lot of
like<00:01:38.770> planning<00:01:39.340> and<00:01:39.550> thinking<00:01:40.120> about<00:01:40.210> how<00:01:40.479> are

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
like planning and thinking about how are

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.630 
like planning and thinking about how are
you<00:01:40.659> gonna<00:01:40.750> do<00:01:40.900> things<00:01:41.170> and<00:01:41.590> you<00:01:42.400> use<00:01:42.610> your

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
you gonna do things and you use your

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.190 
you gonna do things and you use your
whole<00:01:42.820> body<00:01:43.000> you<00:01:43.150> use<00:01:43.180> all<00:01:43.450> your<00:01:43.659> muscles<00:01:43.990> your

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
whole body you use all your muscles your

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.680 
whole body you use all your muscles your
legs<00:01:44.409> your<00:01:44.620> arms<00:01:44.950> and<00:01:45.220> it<00:01:45.430> just<00:01:45.670> you<00:01:46.150> come<00:01:46.540> up

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
legs your arms and it just you come up

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.510 
legs your arms and it just you come up
with<00:01:46.840> different<00:01:46.960> ways<00:01:47.260> you<00:01:47.590> I<00:01:47.860> think<00:01:48.310> if

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
with different ways you I think if

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.950 
with different ways you I think if
you're<00:01:48.760> shorter<00:01:49.240> you<00:01:49.479> don't<00:01:49.630> have<00:01:49.780> as<00:01:49.870> much

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
you're shorter you don't have as much

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.510 
you're shorter you don't have as much
muscle<00:01:50.170> you<00:01:50.440> get<00:01:50.560> more<00:01:50.710> creative<00:01:51.220> with<00:01:51.370> the

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
muscle you get more creative with the

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.630 
muscle you get more creative with the
way<00:01:51.549> you<00:01:51.700> could<00:01:52.000> because<00:01:52.900> you<00:01:53.260> you<00:01:53.890> tried<00:01:54.310> new

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
way you could because you you tried new

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.020 
way you could because you you tried new
things<00:01:54.909> to<00:01:55.060> reach<00:01:55.210> different<00:01:55.659> fold<00:01:56.049> so<00:01:56.530> it

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
things to reach different fold so it

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.780 
things to reach different fold so it
it's<00:01:58.030> more<00:01:58.240> I<00:01:58.510> think<00:01:58.750> it's<00:01:58.870> more<00:01:58.930> like<00:01:59.140> a<00:01:59.790> virus
