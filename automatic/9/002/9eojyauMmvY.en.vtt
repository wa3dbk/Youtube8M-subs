00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
milk on hang out because I'm going to be

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.200

adding<00:00:46.150> splashes<00:00:46.780> of<00:00:46.810> milk<00:00:47.170> if<00:00:47.410> it's<00:00:47.620> too<00:00:48.210> if

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
adding splashes of milk if it's too if

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.950 
adding splashes of milk if it's too if

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:18.670 

so<00:01:13.730> I<00:01:16.150> think<00:01:17.150> that's<00:01:17.300> that<00:01:17.600> I<00:01:17.810> did<00:01:18.530> two

splashes<00:01:19.190> milk<00:01:20.830> so<00:01:21.830> if<00:01:21.890> you<00:01:21.980> find<00:01:22.130> it's<00:01:22.370> too

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
splashes milk so if you find it's too

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.880 
splashes milk so if you find it's too
thick<00:01:22.850> you<00:01:23.240> add<00:01:23.390> more<00:01:23.630> milk<00:01:23.840> if<00:01:24.350> you<00:01:24.470> find<00:01:24.770> this

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
thick you add more milk if you find this

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.400 
thick you add more milk if you find this
too<00:01:25.160> runny<00:01:25.479> you<00:01:26.479> know<00:01:26.600> add<00:01:26.720> a<00:01:26.990> little<00:01:27.110> bit<00:01:27.260> more
