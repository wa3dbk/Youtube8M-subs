00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.210
 two 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.870
 good morning friends rubÃ©n and 17 and we are 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.010
 in a new career of gt5 online with 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.920
 subscribers 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.570
 we are in a career of ps 4a letters 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.509
 the last ones that were from ps3 we go back to 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.640
 cs4 here you have the participants and 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.230
 well let's start the race and what 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.119
 first of all of styles that you already know 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.859
 than to participate in these careers in 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.170
 my credible you have below the description 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.170
 I think that what he says is that it is for 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.390
 ps 4 is worth only use of that from pc 4 good 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.309
 that you already know and well this race 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.159
 I put gta to put us here 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.739
 to do a little the crazy is worth as you see 

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:46.320
 I eat it instead where I eat 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.540
 missing here so I do not know I wanted to 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.070
 put the gta to get to burst 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.670
 we all use to change a little 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.739
 you know I love c4 so 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.879
 let's get a little burst here 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.589
 until it means in the middle though 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.799
 I owe this the only one that is not for the 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:03.900
 I'm half because I'm going last and I change 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:06.030
 leave lying around the plan to the 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.740
 stay last you are leaving mine 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.990
 of proximity on your side and as you see 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.790
 last front eating everything there has 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.380
 seen that is that I've seen it 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.640
 seen on the ground 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.140
 I could not dodge the more let's see 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.700
 now 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.280
 Well that career was called something like that 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.659
 how nascar is worth and from there you are seeing 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.100
 the little corners are worth that they are like 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.729
 circular for the car to put on 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.439
 something like that aside so the 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.569
 circuit is different than like going to 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.759
 to be circular not for that also as I 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:38.970
 I suspected this of this circuit because I've 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.799
 decided to put it in gta mode it's worth it 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.990
 we were going to burst all of us 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.810
 problem of this the every 22 with account 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.700
 that I've put myself last very soon and 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.979
 I'm falling all damn 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.959
 sights of proximity here in the 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.450
 heading that is the problem 

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:55.790
 ok so let's go putting minitas 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.570
 here 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:03.400
 and another one around here so let's see if 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.400
 then they eat us 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.810
 voucher voucher voucher perfect must have had 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.540
 someone else for something is perfect not 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.800
 we are put these we are going to see throw 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.800
 this around here I do not know if I 'll give it 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:25.450
 some Syrian neighborhood gave him the serious uncle 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:31.019
 with a truth mine no no no 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.019
 because I have him back to the previous one 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.410
 plectrum 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:44.630
 like that then it was another so 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.800
 taken has had to catch a mine like that 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.450
 that I think we're going to put more mini 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.780
 plugs is not until the last lap 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.120
 damn it here I have to pick a 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.380
 whoever I am, I do not have one and what I 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.240
 it happens that as I am seeing these 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.220
 circuits are pretty simple voucher 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.930
 they are circuits that are really for 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.410
 speed and that's why I had decided 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.580
 put it well then I have not put fifth 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.030
 it must have had some theft 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.850
 exploited something I think has floated yes 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.950
 and I liked it so I'm going to stay 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.050
 last so perfect and what is 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.640
 saying these circuits are like more 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:22.210
 for speed cars and both 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:23.680
 speed implants before 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.650
 and what they said for what they gave in the 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.580
 people to do it a little we are going to 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:33.340
 see we have still here 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:37.690
 I do not shit in the milk next to the 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.940
 goal seriously since I'm already next to 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.180
 the beta this is francisca I'm going to come 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.970
 On the other hand, the game could not be 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.270
 the half unit has exploded we have 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.270
 exploited 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.740
 so perfect is worth having 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.120
 put three turns the truth that the 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.740
 career did not last long because it's what 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.420
 I mean they are circuits that are made for 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.990
 speed is worth to test the speed 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.850
 of the cars but good at the end to saw 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.850
 explosions everywhere so you do not 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.230
 would have used will be more maybe what 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.090
 you're going to put me last very soon 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.100
 but well then I could also kill 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.680
 there with so proximity mines 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.049
 perfect 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.630
 well I feel next time I do 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.550
 better and good guys well nothing you already know 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.530

 description that says that it is from ps 4 vale 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:37.889
 important important that of tc 4 is 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:39.810
 for pc 4 and the other one is for ps3 it's worth 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.110
 so much that 7 ps4 input at a time of 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.110
 four 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.860
