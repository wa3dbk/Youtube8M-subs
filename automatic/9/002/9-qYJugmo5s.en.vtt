middle-click the chain armor will be put

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.160 
middle-click the chain armor will be put
on<00:02:29.230> you<00:02:29.530> I<00:02:30.450> demonstrate<00:02:31.450> that<00:02:31.569> by<00:02:31.750> putting<00:02:32.019> on

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
on you I demonstrate that by putting on

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.460 
on you I demonstrate that by putting on
the<00:02:32.290> pants<00:02:32.590> right<00:02:33.099> there<00:02:33.810> number<00:02:34.810> one<00:02:34.989> is

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470

Anne's<00:02:35.739> mini-map<00:02:36.310> a<00:02:36.459> lot<00:02:36.760> of<00:02:36.909> people<00:02:37.209> use<00:02:37.420> many

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:37.689 
Anne's mini-map a lot of people use many

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:41.940 
Anne's mini-map a lot of people use many
methods<00:02:38.230> but<00:02:39.000> everyone<00:02:40.000> I<00:02:40.120> see<00:02:40.389> use<00:02:40.680> uses<00:02:41.680> Rees

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
methods but everyone I see use uses Rees

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.490 
methods but everyone I see use uses Rees
mini-map<00:02:42.629> which<00:02:43.629> is<00:02:43.900> really<00:02:44.290> surprising

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
mini-map which is really surprising

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.740 
mini-map which is really surprising
actually<00:02:45.189> because<00:02:45.579> this<00:02:45.760> mini-map<00:02:46.269> is<00:02:46.480> just

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
actually because this mini-map is just

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.979 
actually because this mini-map is just
like<00:02:46.900> Rees<00:02:47.139> mini-map<00:02:47.620> so<00:02:48.489> you<00:02:48.579> can<00:02:48.819> see<00:02:49.780> things

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
like Rees mini-map so you can see things

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:55.170 
like Rees mini-map so you can see things
on<00:02:50.379> your<00:02:51.180> on<00:02:52.180> your<00:02:52.480> map<00:02:52.870> but<00:02:53.560> also<00:02:53.849> it<00:02:54.849> adds

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
on your on your map but also it adds

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.970 
on your on your map but also it adds
other<00:02:55.599> great<00:02:56.200> features<00:02:58.049> like<00:02:59.049> way<00:02:59.409> pointing

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
other great features like way pointing

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.089 
other great features like way pointing
you<00:03:00.459> can<00:03:00.819> see<00:03:01.150> waypoints<00:03:01.840> much<00:03:02.349> more<00:03:02.620> clearly

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
you can see waypoints much more clearly

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:08.399 
you can see waypoints much more clearly
and<00:03:04.049> my<00:03:05.049> favorite<00:03:05.680> is<00:03:06.659> the<00:03:07.659> fact<00:03:07.900> that<00:03:08.109> you<00:03:08.230> can

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
and my favorite is the fact that you can

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:11.610 
and my favorite is the fact that you can
see<00:03:08.650> people's<00:03:09.099> heads<00:03:09.579> on<00:03:10.060> your<00:03:10.720> mini-map<00:03:11.169> when

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
see people's heads on your mini-map when

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.849 
see people's heads on your mini-map when
they<00:03:11.769> come<00:03:11.980> close<00:03:12.010> if<00:03:13.440> you<00:03:14.440> look<00:03:14.620> in<00:03:14.739> the<00:03:14.829> top

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 
they come close if you look in the top

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:16.890 
they come close if you look in the top
right<00:03:15.310> compass<00:03:15.790> you'll<00:03:16.180> be<00:03:16.389> able<00:03:16.479> to<00:03:16.690> see

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
right compass you'll be able to see

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.180 
right compass you'll be able to see
their<00:03:17.109> heads<00:03:17.409> right<00:03:18.120> now<00:03:19.650> once<00:03:20.650> I<00:03:20.739> get<00:03:20.889> out<00:03:21.010> of

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
their heads right now once I get out of

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.509 
their heads right now once I get out of
here<00:03:21.959> which<00:03:22.959> is<00:03:23.109> really<00:03:23.440> useful<00:03:23.650> so<00:03:24.159> say

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
here which is really useful so say

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.089 
here which is really useful so say
you're<00:03:24.699> running<00:03:24.909> away<00:03:25.299> from<00:03:25.359> someone<00:03:25.810> you<00:03:26.139> can

see exactly if they're continuously
chasing<00:03:30.909> you<00:03:31.060> or<00:03:31.359> if<00:03:31.479> they've<00:03:31.659> given<00:03:32.199> up<00:03:32.319> and

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
chasing you or if they've given up and

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.050 
chasing you or if they've given up and
