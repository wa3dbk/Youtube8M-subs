00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.470
 and we come to vinces and we're going to 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.389
 discover how the life of this place 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.740
 changed for cocoa and why do I 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.990
 known as paris chiquito 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.060

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.710

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.550

 Ecuador the cocoa boom 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.560
 it was 1880 and the name of the equator 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.410
 began to be heard loudly in 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.489
 Europe the reason the quality of its cocoa 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.620
 it was the beginning of a golden age lynxes 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.350
 fill your buildings with memories 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.129
 from a period of bonanza elegance and 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.129
 increase 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.990
 this was the municipal palace of vinces 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.390
 It was inaugurated in 1909 and its architecture 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.390
 reflects the luxury of the time 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.210
 and is that this building only tells us 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.640
 something wealth 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.200
 the productivity of these lands and the 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.450
 ease offered by the river vinces 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.670
 to transport the cocoa made the 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.170
 exports will grow in such a way that 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.210
 the life of the landowners changed 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.700
 radically they became 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.900
 true magnates and they were called 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:27.759
 the great cocoa at that time the 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:31.119
 landowners were going to live in France and 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:33.550
 they left their administrators and they 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.009
 they spent six months here six months in 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.880
 france in england somewhere in 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.579
 Europe they were 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.409
 and how doÃ±a mine tells us when 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:46.220
 Ecuadorian landowners returned from 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:50.329
 Europe did not come alone they brought the last 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:53.570
 fashion that's why vinces was up to date 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:57.259
 in the fashion of france the women 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.960
 they all dressed long with hats 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:02.270
 taco shoes sold coming from 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.750
 several parts of the equator to copy the 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:10.280
 fashions to vince vince was like saying the 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:13.130
 leader in the clothing model block for 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.959
 all of Ecuador at that time and that is 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.239
 paris was not only present in the 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.620
 clothes the great cocoa built their 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.769
 hacienda houses without skimping 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.080
 resources were awesome buildings 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.780
 always at the edge of the river and very 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.830
 capricious as they were seen in 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.780
 Europe 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.940
 this is an original house of the time 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.160
 cocoa gilt and shows the structure 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.170
 typical of a hacienda house in the 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.880
 downstairs were the warehouses and 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.090
 climbing this ladder you came to the 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:45.379
 main lounge and the bedrooms 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:49.940
 the shares were precious very elegant 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:53.120
 the immense room all all his paintings 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.459
 they were brought from there by great painters 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.950
 the dishes came from there there are people 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.769
 that the furniture still conserves them 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:04.730
 they brought from there all and all those things 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:07.580
 they were rock crystal this population 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.250
 they had the most beautiful houses on the coast 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.709
 Ecuadorian houses existed here 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.739
 hacienda houses also to 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:19.579
 very nice house in style with 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.560
 European influence particularly don 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:25.370
 Manuel explains how princess grew up 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.769
 thanks to the so-called gold pepa 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:32.150
 vince was boardwalk and docks when 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:34.849
 other cantons of the Republic of the 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.890
 Ecuador - they had not been made not by 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:40.310
 contribution of the state but by contribution 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.709
 private, that is, there were contributions from 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.269
 owners of haciendas that contributed 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.060
 so that for example the 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.970
 municipal palace 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.650
 that's how paris chiquito and 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.480
 in whose honor for a few years now 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.090
 lift this replica of the famous tower 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.250
 eiffel and is that the inhabitants of vinces 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.069
 in the golden age of cocoa they saw 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.090
 Paris as their second homeland and not 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:06.340
 only that but terminology 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:09.130
 French terminology also in the era 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.890
 it was common to hear in the corners that 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:15.340
 they spoke in French here but this life 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:18.130
 of comfort and pleasures ended in 1920 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.930
 two plagues finished everything 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:24.650
 cocoa plantations 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:27.949
 they were infected with two diseases that 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:30.199
 it was the handle and the witch's broom 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:31.850
 the economy totally fell we learned 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:33.410
 only of them in the country itself 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.020
 because they depended directly on the 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.419
 cacao export and although the boom 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.830
 of cocoa concluded tragically there are 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:42.500
 who continue to cultivate and 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.479
 exporting it until today these cocoa 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.850
 from now on they are the guardians of our 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:49.820
 heritage and perhaps apply the most 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:53.120
 simple recipes all work 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:57.470
 What is done is made by hand with a machete 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:00.259
 no chemicals are used at all but the 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:03.110
 cocoa devils is the best cocoa in the world 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:05.750
 I do not say it, I was told by the 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:09.020
 chocolatiers in six you are the 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.060
 rich cocoa chocolate chocolate 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.050
 all muel tea is very much colate 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.720
 delicious 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.909
 and so we said goodbye to you from your 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.129
 people from his magical past and his 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:22.500
 future we bid farewell to a 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:24.650
 part of the history of fine cocoa 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.650
 to Rome
