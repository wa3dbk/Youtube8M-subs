we're going to his physical attributes

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.069 
we're going to his physical attributes
where<00:01:43.229> he<00:01:43.290> does<00:01:43.439> have<00:01:43.590> 88<00:01:44.360> jumping<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.899> has

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
where he does have 88 jumping it has

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.130 
where he does have 88 jumping it has
reactions<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.619> 8980<00:01:47.369> sprint<00:01:47.939> speed<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.360> 87

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
reactions of 8980 sprint speed and 87

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.870 
reactions of 8980 sprint speed and 87
stamina<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:49.950> that's<00:01:50.130> not<00:01:50.280> too<00:01:50.430> bad<00:01:50.460> i<00:01:50.700> think

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
stamina so that's not too bad i think

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.609 
stamina so that's not too bad i think
stamina<00:01:51.360> might<00:01:51.509> go<00:01:51.659> under<00:01:51.869> its<00:01:52.409> current

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
stamina might go under its current

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.980 
stamina might go under its current

little stats now and the first one thing
I'm<00:02:23.950> gonna<00:02:24.100> mention<00:02:24.340> is<00:02:24.670> general<00:02:25.450> shooting

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
I'm gonna mention is general shooting

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.380 
I'm gonna mention is general shooting
now<00:02:26.739> it<00:02:26.920> shots<00:02:27.190> are<00:02:27.400> perfect<00:02:27.910> one<00:02:28.150> so<00:02:28.180> you<00:02:28.360> can

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
now it shots are perfect one so you can

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.420 
now it shots are perfect one so you can
do<00:02:28.569> low-driven<00:02:29.230> powerful<00:02:29.800> shots<00:02:30.040> which<00:02:30.220> go

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
do low-driven powerful shots which go

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.460 
do low-driven powerful shots which go
flying<00:02:30.730> him<00:02:31.030> because<00:02:31.660> you<00:02:31.750> guys<00:02:31.870> have<00:02:32.050> a<00:02:32.110> good

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
flying him because you guys have a good

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.070 
flying him because you guys have a good
long<00:02:32.800> shots<00:02:33.069> and<00:02:33.790> also<00:02:34.180> power<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.810> shot

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
long shots and also power and the shot

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.740 
long shots and also power and the shot
so<00:02:35.319> that's<00:02:35.500> fine<00:02:35.709> is<00:02:36.130> finishes<00:02:36.790> are<00:02:37.000> fine<00:02:37.540> as

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
so that's fine is finishes are fine as

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.600 
so that's fine is finishes are fine as
well<00:02:37.900> they<00:02:38.080> go<00:02:38.200> in<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.800> majority<00:02:39.069> of<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.459> time

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
well they go in the majority of the time

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.580 
well they go in the majority of the time
finesses<00:02:40.120> will<00:02:40.239> go<00:02:40.360> in<00:02:40.510> with<00:02:40.690> him<00:02:40.870> I<00:02:41.050> think

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
finesses will go in with him I think

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.070 
finesses will go in with him I think
it's<00:02:41.709> cause<00:02:41.860> finesse<00:02:42.250> there<00:02:42.489> pal<00:02:42.819> and<00:02:43.090> so

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
it's cause finesse there pal and so

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.750 
it's cause finesse there pal and so
they're<00:02:44.260> simple<00:02:44.709> you'd<00:02:44.890> expect<00:02:45.310> them<00:02:45.459> to<00:02:45.640> go

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
they're simple you'd expect them to go

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.729 
they're simple you'd expect them to go
in<00:02:45.940> with<00:02:46.090> his<00:02:46.239> thinking<00:02:46.660> as<00:02:46.780> 84<00:02:47.260> shot<00:02:47.500> is<00:02:47.590> it

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
in with his thinking as 84 shot is it

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.130 
in with his thinking as 84 shot is it
and<00:02:47.920> but<00:02:48.760> we<00:02:49.090> saw<00:02:49.239> his<00:02:49.360> in<00:02:49.450> gamestats<00:02:49.780> was<00:02:50.019> like

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
and but we saw his in gamestats was like

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.110 
and but we saw his in gamestats was like
90<00:02:50.590> is<00:02:50.769> longshot<00:02:51.010> just<00:02:51.459> hit<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.730> bar<00:02:51.910> they're

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
90 is longshot just hit the bar they're

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.240 
90 is longshot just hit the bar they're
very<00:02:52.360> unfortunate<00:02:52.930> long<00:02:53.560> shots<00:02:53.799> they<00:02:54.069> come

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
very unfortunate long shots they come

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.070 
very unfortunate long shots they come
under<00:02:54.489> as<00:02:54.700> well<00:02:54.940> a<00:02:54.970> bit<00:02:55.180> of<00:02:55.269> the<00:02:55.360> power<00:02:55.540> section

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
under as well a bit of the power section

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.990 
under as well a bit of the power section
like<00:02:56.260> we<00:02:56.380> mentioned<00:02:56.530> they<00:02:57.010> were<00:02:57.069> foot<00:02:57.430> perfect

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
like we mentioned they were foot perfect

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.070 
like we mentioned they were foot perfect
to<00:02:58.090> be<00:02:58.180> able<00:02:58.239> to<00:02:58.360> it<00:02:58.510> i<00:02:58.540> would<00:02:58.780> definitely

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
to be able to it i would definitely

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.320 
to be able to it i would definitely
recommend<00:02:59.260> taking<00:03:00.160> some<00:03:00.489> long<00:03:00.700> shots<00:03:00.970> taking

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
recommend taking some long shots taking

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.699 
recommend taking some long shots taking
some<00:03:01.450> outside<00:03:01.780> of<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:01.959> box<00:03:02.080> driving<00:03:02.590> them

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
some outside of the box driving them

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.070 
some outside of the box driving them
home<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:03.519> one<00:03:03.970> problem<00:03:04.239> was<00:03:04.480> having<00:03:04.810> a<00:03:04.900> lot

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
home and one problem was having a lot

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.430 
home and one problem was having a lot
with<00:03:05.260> him<00:03:05.380> is<00:03:05.790> basically<00:03:06.790> is<00:03:06.940> like<00:03:06.970> is<00:03:07.480> just

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
with him is basically is like is just

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.690

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
probably comes under ball control and

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.729 
probably comes under ball control and
dribbling<00:03:10.180> that<00:03:10.750> was<00:03:10.930> absolutely<00:03:11.109> horrendous

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
dribbling that was absolutely horrendous

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.420
