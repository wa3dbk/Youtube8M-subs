00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
 go is everyone knows art 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:07.259
 sensors today actually attacked a 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.690
 video a grinder to xp finally origins to 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.120
 xp grinder a zombie or skeleton 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.950
 I do not know if we're going 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.279
 if the skeletons no we will test so 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:21.390
 it's a pretty compact grinder that 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:24.210
 to be finally who so what of 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.350
 renders already it's a factory at xp is in 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.810
 do you tap once on it and 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.580
 saudi excuse me zombies so that's 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.500
 the most compact version that I could 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.600
 make 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:37.649
 or otherwise I have not looked otherwise to 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.309
 do it here and so we will tackle 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.739
 directly how does it work 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:49.140
 I have a plum photos without doing it on purpose 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:50.879
 so you have your hobby project that 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.390
 is called and here you kill at once 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.230
 also get the sp and it worked 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.230
 more plumper 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:05.620
 yeah and several roger 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.409
 after 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:17.020
 if all the projects then why roger 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:21.280
 because recognizing ourselves about us 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:26.060
 here on video I make you a little sign 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:29.210
 this is bombay ch and syna xp which is 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.340
 director because I street the only 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.470
 that I find more compact cd zephyr 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.990
 but in fact we have to wait until in fact 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.500
 he's more fleet on him and that's 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.420
 a little embarrassing 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.860
 so that's the most 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.450
 compact that I found the time we 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.580
 will go directly to the tutorial 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.259
 so here we go directly tutorial 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.330
 so you put your under all the 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.610
 diagonal 10-inch diagonal angles 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.530
 Spencer's hours with the little mouth 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.750
 round this is with your god button you 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.590
 listen to this blog where we give on 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.560
 wanted a slab tool or block for 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.290
 easter the friends go out so we go 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.740
 to move from the body xvi if we are going to pass 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.810
 will remain eight hours later in place 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.510
 piston 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.819
 sticky quarks up 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.090
 ar no it must do that after you 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:21.000
 hurt person 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:26.760
 reston ray scorer this side you place 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.819
 the peter kay the eac katic block up having 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.920
 a little kid like that preston how 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.280
 does one have to do exactly as there 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.610
 down it's like that it's really simple 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.430
 in fact 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.390
 then we 'll put you a block of this 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.260
 side hop here it is actually it takes really 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.409
 do it directly there as there 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.420
 men 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:50.639
 we must make great detours and 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.299
 cyprus in master preston has done a wrong 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:54.209
 storch 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.920
 here and there against here we will put 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.599
 a block we will remove that because in 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.870
 do we manage to push it will remove 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:03.870
 the stuff the push pushed block is broken 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.879
 the preston object on the pace of their 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.489
 to stay here 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:11.819
 chambers next here you put thin 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.799
 and if you put reston and the fault 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.260
 shift and you put your rest here 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.910
 so in fact it's going to count as 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.760
 having done that does exactly the same thing 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:25.099
 then like there then it depends 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:29.549
 either you put three ticks 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:32.760
 but in fact you do this pony there at 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.739
 see them when I'm running hop 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.650
 he kills so he actually took one of 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.129
 guy if I take it off and that I place at 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.129
 same place 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.200
 here they are dying directly in fact there 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.400
 must not they take the block 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.900
 will he hang himself the blog if you want 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.550
 avoid that you take the block you 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:57.090
 put a tic me I put three here 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.920
 so in fact we are going to attack here but 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.900
 three tic to put roast 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.560
 frankly for me your cheek tips 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:09.360
 practices 1 then everything was westen 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:15.570
 on this side you will m reston then 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:16.650
 have a blog here and here and there 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:21.270
 normally see you soon finished you 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:23.970
 put cathy who did reston and reston 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.500
 and here is the razer and finish 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.930
 normally 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:32.700
 so here I did a stupidity 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:36.270
 oh yes so the part of the most 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:39.900
 important so sedan here the most 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:43.290
 high on but I was to know the top 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:46.200
 which are useless I put myself assault 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.730
 of lava in the high extra cost in this 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:52.580
 dispensary six months and the other side 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:56.180
 moreover you do not put us waterjet 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.180
 bomb and then he left 

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:06.189
 that's how we do it i roger on 

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:06.189
 a train of eating 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:15.449
 hop and that's it finished I quoted 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:19.080
 watch this video fallen to the 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:24.150

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:26.090
 soon for on my channel I post to 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:30.680
 my opinion videos every day 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:33.680
