00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.200
 me since the age of 14 in fact never visited agricultural high schools 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.509
 because I always wanted to be a farmer here 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:16.509
 I was drawn to animals by the hour 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.189
 by being always outside by the work of the earth 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.960
 all that 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.900
 and percent in my concern it's my parents did not agree and 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.580
 do not want to move to agriculture because 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.789
 two not being farmer 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.020
 he told me it could be a difficult job for a Roma girl 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.160
 we can not access we will not be able to buy land end of everything 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.380
 pass on land all that is missing financially it's going to be impossible 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.840
 so euros me I have a little I dropped the piece 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.750
 which 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.290
 saw that my parents did not want chosen tunnel schools age I followed 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.520
 the accident yesterday the classic so that I started my active life in the 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.880
 secretariat 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.660
 I was in Auvergne and the children were going to spend 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.850
 birthdays with punches in an educational farm 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.040
 but I found it nice to allow children 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.530
 to approach animals 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.899
 but I felt good in the train it was deep inside me I wanted to 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.790
 certainly I have children that allow them to flourish like that 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.410
 among animals and from there I told myself% 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.500
 that's my little side would come had warned is sued because that would be 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.230
 well to set up an educational farm 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.730
 but to rip to us in scales had already had a slight but 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.250
 parents being the winner 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.040
 I said to love and on valves is not pedagogical farm in e1 family 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.500
 after the agriculture chamber that put 10% adjustment 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.920
 the goods because 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.979
 but a project at the moment with the mayor of Paris and the Conservatoire du 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.259
 littoral so it will be necessary that the conservatory of the littoral and% e 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.790
 there I started I postulated then 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.630
 and then I was chosen 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.549
 been invited to sign the end of everything 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.060
 montpellier a to z 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.130
 yeah the coastal conservatory who owns the building that is 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.429
 of the 25 hectares that I exploit 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.469
 percent and they bought that in 2001 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:16.409
 % and so it was no longer exploited a seemingly here it does well 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.879
 35 40 then exploited 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.339
 it was open to any production 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:25.889
 so I arrived with my sheep folder 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:28.259
 he made the city of pollet valves which is a boom 

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:31.969
 dexia stole educational heir to direct sales 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:37.469
 and then it's true I was a lot of turns so it makes sense 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:38.639
 it's an important fact 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:41.159
 do not find yourself alone or almost 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.620
 especially when we do not know a creation and we are not from the farming community 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.039
 think that 

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:48.539
 it's still not an easy job farming the banks when you go 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:50.329
 throws like that into the void 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:51.620
 we need to have tutors
