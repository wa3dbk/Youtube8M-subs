00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hey people come to my new video 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.250
 here in the video again a little 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.200
 unboxing I have one again 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.910
 new graphics card and here added 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.130
 in this case the geforce gtx 780 from 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.619
 kfa I got this card from me 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.380
 I am very much there 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.510
 videos and now mostly in 4k 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.939
 and to speed things up a bit 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.029
 because as I said the gpu or the 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.050
 gpu this graphics card to use 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.810
 I have a something again 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.090
 more powerful card added to this 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.110
 Fortunately, I have such a map around 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.370
 the 280 euros arose new and that was 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.079
 a pretty good price I could 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.360
 just can not resist now though 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.809
 Let's take a look at the package first 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.539
 so here's the good part sometimes 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.870
 key data for this card 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.360
 as I said it is the gtx 780 this gives 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.070
 it synonymous again in the tv version has 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.399
 give it a little more steam under the 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.449
 Hood 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.649
 this graphics card comes with 3 gb 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:06.360
 RAM therefore and with a 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.860
 Kernel clock of 863 megahertz just this 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.689
 also supports a turbo boost 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.880
 mode then has 900 megahertz too 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.680
 very important this map needs here 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.439
 a lot of electricity that is who this 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.380
 just wants to use of you plans 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.360
 here at least 1 600 watts strong 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.520
 power supply and that a good power supply 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.890
 not any cheap power supply if 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.320
 this card draws well over 200 watts 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.560
 So I would here 200 to 250 watts 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.759
 Power consumption for this card 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.130
 so we'll look first 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.590
 just in the package into it 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.869
 I open it just to talk so deceptive 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.939
 In this box is lisa grubb 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.710
 carton we just fold it up 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:51.689
 and, most of all, it comes to us 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.570
 not irritate the graphics card 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.880
 let gtx 700 series is on it here 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:01.610
 but it is the 780 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:05.460
 furthermore, it is in the box 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.500
 a quick installation guide that 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.179
 means for the installation will be there 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.100
 be self-explanatory that's pretty 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.910
 easy to install such a squad 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.680
 I recommend the drivers cd dvd here 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.090
 but always get the current ones 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.070
 drivers from the internet furthermore 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.170
 various power supply cables are 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.020
 important this graphics card still needs 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:32.310
 times additional power supply because how 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.960
 said is very very hungry or if 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.050
 his power hungry that is called here 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.210
 additional power connections attached 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:43.830
 and we still have 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:45.270
 an adapter from dvi to vga so and 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.800
 The carton is empty 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.330
 Let's just have a look again 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:53.430
 graphics card in detail to that is me 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:55.260
 Just get it out of here so here 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.880
 is the beautiful piece on the front 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.860
 As I said, we only see the lettering 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.510
 700 gt serie 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.280
 we only see a lot 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.660
 powerful fan we know that 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.160
 from other graphics cards that have then 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.200
 partly two fans but the fan 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.630
 here is sufficient at least if I 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.100
 then go to internet tests 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.960
 Let's turn the map forward 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.270
 Here we see the following we have here 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.250
 a displayport that is very much for me 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.440
 important because I have my graphics cards too 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.500
 like to have three monitors 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.850
 connect at the same time and that of 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.590
 you've already tasted know 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.060
 that you quickly reach the limit 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.110
 the graphics card comes across the 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.720
 Graphics card can usually only 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.430
 at the same time spend two monitors over 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.470
 the displayport and an active one 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.960
 But you can still get an adapter here anyway 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.790
 connect three monitors 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.510
 Furthermore , we have a hdmi here 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:46.290
 exit and a dvi exit and a 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.610
 dvi d output thus we are then quasi 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.650
 prepared for everything 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.840
 furthermore, we can use the graphics card 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.300
 turn this page again here 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.580
 We see, as I said just the motherboard on 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.850
 the rear again a fan 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:04.410
 exit like the heat sink and on the 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:06.570
 bottom of the pci 3.0 express connection 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.420
 that means here is or graphics card 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.730
 finally connected to the computer 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.430
 and on the top we see here 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.620
 the front power connections are very 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:20.160
 important that means we have here once 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.810
 6 pin and once 8 pin extra power 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.470
 connections where the graphics card again 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.410
 would additionally be supplied with power 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.570
 you can and we have over here then 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.310
 again the bridge connections around now 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.950
 possibly the graphics card with others 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.850
 to connect graphics cards so far 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.880
 compatible 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.230
 So that's it for this beautiful piece of me 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.820
 that'll just be in my mind 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.270
 install calculator and will have a look 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.990
 How far can I use it again my edges 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.490
 services can increase, so to speak 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.410
 additional effect you have here, of course 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.760
 a much better game performance 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.530
 but let's just see how much 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.180
 there is the graphics card suggests the 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.980
 get off the graphics card a little earlier or 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.300
 I have problems with this video card 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.330
 I do have just as I said again 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.710
 an additional video to this card 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.330
 so and here again a whole 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.070
 important point the boy on everyone 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.590
 Case should be noted with this card 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:11.560
 this card is also damn big that 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:14.440
 means I'll give you some dimensions 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:18.220
 complete length of this map amounts to 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.169
 on 27 centimeters about 27 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.260
 centimeter that's a hell of a lot 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:25.450
 the height of this card is included 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:29.200
 socket is here in the case 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:30.970
 eleven centimeters that is 110 millimeters 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.300
 that also means a lot 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:37.260
 the height of this card is about 40 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.500
 to 41 mm that is something over four 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.000
 centimeter 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.010
 Also we should in any case 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.690
 Always keep an eye on it before taking this 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.820
 just buy because the part must first 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.160
 in the calculator purely so and come with it 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.690
 I also end this unboxing of 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.669
 this graphics card as I said the 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.169
 product link I have again below in 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.180
 the video description also again the 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:57.250
 technical data to the chain of 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.990
 Manufacturer below in the video 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.060
 description if you know that 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.560
 Just click on it and read 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.300
 just everything after 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.250
 I hope I could you with the am 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.320
 Boxing again fairly help 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.700
 wanted similar more videos from me 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.460
 As I said hours ago I have you 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.140
 again some want to link it more 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.720
 subscribe to my video shows please 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.040
 simply my channel and hereby say 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.880
