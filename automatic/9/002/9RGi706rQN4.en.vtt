00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510 

okay<00:00:00.359> so<00:00:00.420> I<00:00:00.960> want<00:00:01.140> to<00:00:01.230> show<00:00:01.410> you<00:00:01.469> this<00:00:01.770> little

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
okay so I want to show you this little

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.410 
okay so I want to show you this little
bit<00:00:02.730> of<00:00:02.850> rigging<00:00:03.480> topology<00:00:04.319> and<00:00:04.589> quite<00:00:05.009> simply

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:05.420 
bit of rigging topology and quite simply

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.700 
bit of rigging topology and quite simply
now<00:00:06.420> I'm<00:00:06.660> sure<00:00:06.930> most<00:00:07.140> of<00:00:07.319> you<00:00:07.470> will<00:00:07.680> think

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
now I'm sure most of you will think

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.320 
now I'm sure most of you will think
straightaway<00:00:08.460> that<00:00:08.670> this<00:00:08.790> looks<00:00:08.970> pretty<00:00:09.210> much

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
straightaway that this looks pretty much

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.299 
straightaway that this looks pretty much
like<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.599> body<00:00:09.929> and<00:00:10.139> shoulder<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:10.620> arm<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:11.130> it

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
like a body and shoulder and arm and it

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.850 
like a body and shoulder and arm and it
is<00:00:11.400> indeed<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:12.000> that's<00:00:12.450> one<00:00:13.139> of<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.380> things

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
is indeed and that's one of the things

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.560 
is indeed and that's one of the things
that<00:00:14.099> we're<00:00:14.219> covering<00:00:14.549> basically<00:00:15.179> one<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.389> the

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
that we're covering basically one of the

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.900 
that we're covering basically one of the
aspects<00:00:16.170> that<00:00:16.230> matters<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:16.890> lot<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.250> rigging<00:00:17.760> is

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
aspects that matters a lot to rigging is

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.120 
aspects that matters a lot to rigging is
of<00:00:18.090> course<00:00:18.270> how<00:00:18.449> you<00:00:18.510> skin<00:00:19.080> your<00:00:19.500> characters

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
of course how you skin your characters

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.410 
of course how you skin your characters
and<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.369> lot<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.609> that<00:00:20.760> has<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.029> do<00:00:21.180> with<00:00:21.270> the

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
and a lot of that has to do with the

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.210 
and a lot of that has to do with the
topology<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.199> polygon<00:00:22.619> flow<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:23.100> you've

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
topology and polygon flow that you've

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.279 
topology and polygon flow that you've
got<00:00:23.430> going<00:00:23.609> on<00:00:23.789> in<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.029> base<00:00:24.210> mesh<00:00:24.539> as<00:00:24.990> such

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
got going on in the base mesh as such

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.839 
got going on in the base mesh as such
it's<00:00:25.500> really<00:00:25.769> important<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.340> try<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.580> get

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
it's really important to try and get

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.490 
it's really important to try and get
good<00:00:27.060> poly<00:00:27.359> flow<00:00:27.660> but<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:27.960> course<00:00:28.170> there's<00:00:28.410> a

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
good poly flow but of course there's a

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.679 
good poly flow but of course there's a
lot<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.769> different<00:00:29.609> ideas<00:00:29.820> about<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.570> know

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
lot of different ideas about you know

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.110 
lot of different ideas about you know
what<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.170> best<00:00:31.619> flows<00:00:32.040> are<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.669> so<00:00:32.910> on<00:00:32.940> and

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
what the best flows are and so on and

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.459 
what the best flows are and so on and
there's<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.300> lot<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.510> confusion<00:00:33.840> amongst<00:00:34.290> users

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
there's a lot of confusion amongst users

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.110 
there's a lot of confusion amongst users
as<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.950> what<00:00:35.070> they<00:00:35.190> should<00:00:35.340> try<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.579> do<00:00:35.910> if

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
as to what they should try and do if

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.209 
as to what they should try and do if
they're<00:00:36.300> not<00:00:36.510> familiar<00:00:36.899> with<00:00:37.230> doing<00:00:38.010> such

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
they're not familiar with doing such

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.010 
they're not familiar with doing such
things<00:00:38.489> themselves<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:39.030> great<00:00:39.120> deal<00:00:39.450> now<00:00:39.809> no

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
things themselves a great deal now no

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
matter what different opinions there may

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.060 
matter what different opinions there may
be<00:00:41.850> on<00:00:42.300> actual<00:00:42.719> topology<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.559> flow<00:00:43.829> and

that I can guarantee you is absolutely
true<00:00:48.480> for<00:00:48.750> every<00:00:49.110> single<00:00:49.350> rig<00:00:49.680> in<00:00:49.890> every

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
single package is that the basic

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.770 
single package is that the basic
structure<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:53.070> your<00:00:53.309> mesh<00:00:53.550> topology<00:00:54.239> should

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
structure of your mesh topology should

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.439 
structure of your mesh topology should
be<00:00:54.960> very<00:00:55.370> simple<00:00:56.370> just<00:00:56.820> like<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.239> rigs

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
be very simple just like the rigs

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.450 
be very simple just like the rigs
themselves<00:00:58.260> rigs<00:00:58.440> can<00:00:58.649> be<00:00:58.739> very<00:00:58.949> complicated

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
themselves rigs can be very complicated

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.630 
themselves rigs can be very complicated
and<00:00:59.969> fancy<00:01:00.510> but<00:01:00.780> underneath<00:01:01.379> they<00:01:01.980> rely<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.460> a

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
and fancy but underneath they rely on a

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.870 
and fancy but underneath they rely on a
few<00:01:03.000> very<00:01:03.030> basic<00:01:04.159> relationships<00:01:05.159> parent

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
few very basic relationships parent

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.130 
few very basic relationships parent
constraints<00:01:06.659> targeting<00:01:07.560> ika<00:01:08.340> and

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
constraints targeting ika and

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.230 
constraints targeting ika and
hierarchies<00:01:10.140> some<00:01:10.680> expressions<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.729> whatnot

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
hierarchies some expressions and whatnot

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.510 
hierarchies some expressions and whatnot
to<00:01:12.540> create<00:01:13.080> slightly<00:01:13.830> more<00:01:14.040> complex

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
to create slightly more complex

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.910 
to create slightly more complex
relationship<00:01:15.330> behaviors<00:01:15.900> but<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.530> all<00:01:16.650> comes

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
relationship behaviors but it all comes

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.450 
relationship behaviors but it all comes
from<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.220> very<00:01:17.400> very<00:01:17.759> simple<00:01:18.390> base<00:01:19.310> set<00:01:20.310> of

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
from a very very simple base set of

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.399 
from a very very simple base set of
foundations<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.750> same<00:01:21.990> should<00:01:22.229> be<00:01:22.290> true

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
foundations and the same should be true

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.789 
foundations and the same should be true
in<00:01:22.920> your<00:01:22.950> mesh<00:01:23.570> if<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.689> pick<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.960> rig<00:01:25.229> apart<00:01:25.590> all

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
in your mesh if you pick a rig apart all

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.560 
in your mesh if you pick a rig apart all
of<00:01:25.920> its<00:01:26.040> controllers<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.820> come<00:01:27.000> down<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.360> very

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
of its controllers you come down to very

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.319 
of its controllers you come down to very
simple<00:01:28.490> handful<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.610> different<00:01:29.790> control

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
simple handful of different control

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.210 
simple handful of different control
types<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.840> can<00:01:30.990> be<00:01:31.140> used<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.710> if<00:01:31.890> you

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.800 

undividable<00:01:35.220> ansi<00:01:35.820> mesh<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.270> should<00:01:36.479> find

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
undividable ansi mesh you should find

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.590 
undividable ansi mesh you should find
something<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.470> gives<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.860> very<00:01:37.890> basic<00:01:38.600> easy

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
something that gives a very basic easy

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.340 
something that gives a very basic easy
flow<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.290> deform<00:01:40.920> well<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.400> this<00:01:42.180> for<00:01:42.450> me<00:01:42.570> is

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
flow to deform well and this for me is

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.620 
flow to deform well and this for me is
my<00:01:43.880> favorite<00:01:44.880> basic<00:01:45.950> shape<00:01:46.950> here<00:01:47.369> it's<00:01:48.270> useful

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
my favorite basic shape here it's useful

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.120 
my favorite basic shape here it's useful
in<00:01:48.750> lots<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.079> situations<00:01:49.320> we're<00:01:49.920> going<00:01:50.070> to

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
in lots of situations we're going to

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.780 
in lots of situations we're going to
look<00:01:50.250> initially<00:01:50.520> at<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.030> arm<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.810> shoulder

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
look initially at the arm and shoulder

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.370 
look initially at the arm and shoulder
deformation<00:01:53.790> here<00:01:54.060> but<00:01:54.689> we'll<00:01:54.840> also<00:01:54.960> see<00:01:55.259> how

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
deformation here but we'll also see how

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.289 
deformation here but we'll also see how
this<00:01:55.530> comes<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:55.950> useful<00:01:56.130> elsewhere<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:57.210> other

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
this comes in useful elsewhere the other

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.179 
this comes in useful elsewhere the other
thing<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.659> love<00:01:57.869> about<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:58.290> particular<00:01:58.680> flow

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
thing I love about this particular flow

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.490 
thing I love about this particular flow
is<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.790> it's<00:01:59.939> good<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:00.810> many<00:02:01.140> situations

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
is that it's good in so many situations

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.639 
is that it's good in so many situations
if<00:02:02.340> you're<00:02:02.850> using<00:02:03.119> subdivision<00:02:03.930> surfaces<00:02:04.469> to

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
if you're using subdivision surfaces to

in a you know animation package for
rendering<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.239> works<00:02:09.450> great

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
rendering it works great

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.819 
rendering it works great
if<00:02:10.299> you're<00:02:10.689> trying<00:02:10.929> to<00:02:11.019> create<00:02:11.200> low<00:02:11.560> poly

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:11.829

places<00:02:20.890> it's<00:02:21.310> great<00:02:21.819> if<00:02:22.209> you're<00:02:22.390> using<00:02:22.629> some

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
places it's great if you're using some

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.839 
places it's great if you're using some
kind<00:02:23.170> of<00:02:23.349> muscle<00:02:23.860> system<00:02:24.099> and<00:02:24.459> you<00:02:24.519> want<00:02:24.640> to

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
kind of muscle system and you want to

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.390 
kind of muscle system and you want to
skin<00:02:25.239> that<00:02:25.480> wraps<00:02:25.780> around<00:02:26.049> it<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:26.829> gives<00:02:27.250> you

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
skin that wraps around it and gives you

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.479

good<00:02:27.640> lines<00:02:28.439> for<00:02:29.439> your<00:02:29.500> crease<00:02:29.859> maps<00:02:30.189> and

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
good lines for your crease maps and

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.729 
good lines for your crease maps and
wrinkle<00:02:30.879> maps<00:02:31.090> and<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:31.569> on<00:02:31.689> and<00:02:31.840> so<00:02:31.989> forth<00:02:32.319> it's

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
wrinkle maps and so on and so forth it's

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.399 
wrinkle maps and so on and so forth it's
great<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:33.790> also<00:02:34.359> in<00:02:34.540> situations<00:02:35.200> where

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:35.409 
great and also in situations where

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:36.830 
great and also in situations where
you're<00:02:35.560> using<00:02:35.799> a<00:02:36.040> pretty<00:02:36.340> detailed

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
you're using a pretty detailed

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.149 
you're using a pretty detailed
subdivided<00:02:37.840> mesh<00:02:38.170> in<00:02:38.620> your<00:02:38.829> animation

package<00:02:39.790> with<00:02:40.000> standard<00:02:40.569> weighting<00:02:41.049> it's

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:41.409 
package with standard weighting it's

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:43.020 
package with standard weighting it's
also<00:02:41.620> really<00:02:41.980> good<00:02:42.190> for<00:02:42.430> that<00:02:42.519> the<00:02:42.730> point<00:02:42.940> of

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
also really good for that the point of

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.479 
also really good for that the point of
course<00:02:43.299> being<00:02:43.569> that<00:02:44.139> the<00:02:44.290> base<00:02:44.530> structure<00:02:45.340> is

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
course being that the base structure is

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.610 
course being that the base structure is
very<00:02:45.760> simple<00:02:46.299> and<00:02:46.450> supports<00:02:46.959> everything<00:02:47.290> that

very simple and supports everything that

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.410 
very simple and supports everything that
we<00:02:47.739> need<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:48.129> to<00:02:48.159> do<00:02:48.489> and<00:02:48.760> then<00:02:49.030> beyond<00:02:49.329> that

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
we need it to do and then beyond that

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.330 
we need it to do and then beyond that
you<00:02:49.540> just<00:02:49.810> subdivide<00:02:50.379> to<00:02:50.590> hell<00:02:50.769> and<00:02:51.010> that's

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
you just subdivide to hell and that's

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.759 
you just subdivide to hell and that's
your<00:02:51.549> detail<00:02:51.940> those<00:02:52.239> into<00:02:52.690> topology<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.530> such

your detail those into topology and such

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.259 
your detail those into topology and such
stuff<00:02:54.099> there<00:02:54.280> were<00:02:54.340> two<00:02:54.549> key<00:02:54.819> points<00:02:55.239> that

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
stuff there were two key points that

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
bits as you can see and just a straight

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.819 
bits as you can see and just a straight
flat<00:03:12.849> grid<00:03:13.269> pretty<00:03:13.870> much<00:03:14.109> there's<00:03:14.680> some

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
flat grid pretty much there's some

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.800 
flat grid pretty much there's some
angular<00:03:15.250> edges<00:03:15.400> there<00:03:15.819> but<00:03:16.030> it's<00:03:16.180> basically<00:03:16.690> a

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
angular edges there but it's basically a

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.979 
angular edges there but it's basically a
grid<00:03:17.160> so<00:03:18.160> I'm<00:03:18.400> just<00:03:18.549> gonna<00:03:18.730> dump<00:03:19.540> a<00:03:19.599> copy<00:03:19.810> of

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
grid so I'm just gonna dump a copy of

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.539 
grid so I'm just gonna dump a copy of
that<00:03:20.139> and<00:03:20.349> to<00:03:20.440> come<00:03:20.560> back<00:03:20.799> to<00:03:20.919> it<00:03:21.010> your<00:03:21.160> later

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
that and to come back to it your later

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.360 
that and to come back to it your later
but<00:03:21.790> let's<00:03:22.090> pop<00:03:22.599> our<00:03:22.780> little<00:03:23.049> fella<00:03:23.680> out<00:03:23.919> as<00:03:24.190> we

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
but let's pop our little fella out as we

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.490 
but let's pop our little fella out as we
can<00:03:24.519> actually<00:03:24.819> see<00:03:25.090> how<00:03:25.449> and<00:03:25.659> why<00:03:25.870> this<00:03:26.319> is

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
can actually see how and why this is

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.420 
can actually see how and why this is
such<00:03:26.680> a<00:03:26.709> great<00:03:27.069> piece<00:03:27.940> of<00:03:28.290> topology<00:03:29.290> okay<00:03:30.099> so

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
such a great piece of topology okay so

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.330 
such a great piece of topology okay so
here<00:03:30.819> it<00:03:30.940> is<00:03:31.139> basically<00:03:32.139> when<00:03:32.409> we<00:03:32.560> skinned<00:03:33.099> a

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
here it is basically when we skinned a

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.449 
here it is basically when we skinned a
mesh<00:03:33.819> two<00:03:34.180> joints<00:03:34.720> or<00:03:34.870> bones<00:03:35.079> whatever<00:03:35.470> you

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
mesh two joints or bones whatever you

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.710 
mesh two joints or bones whatever you
know<00:03:36.579> it's<00:03:36.790> just<00:03:37.139> points<00:03:38.139> being<00:03:38.379> related<00:03:38.919> to<00:03:38.949> a

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
know it's just points being related to a

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.319 
know it's just points being related to a
deform<00:03:40.720> controller<00:03:41.260> object<00:03:41.970> now<00:03:42.970> obviously

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
deform controller object now obviously

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.089 
deform controller object now obviously
you<00:03:43.479> can<00:03:43.540> smooth<00:03:44.019> weights<00:03:44.440> you<00:03:44.799> know<00:03:44.919> in

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
you can smooth weights you know in

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.069 
you can smooth weights you know in
between<00:03:45.250> things<00:03:45.970> and<00:03:46.239> of<00:03:46.599> course<00:03:46.810> if<00:03:46.959> you're

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
between things and of course if you're

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.050 
between things and of course if you're
using<00:03:47.290> some<00:03:47.650> kind<00:03:47.799> of<00:03:48.010> shrink<00:03:48.400> wrap<00:03:48.669> then<00:03:48.970> of

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
using some kind of shrink wrap then of

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.140 
using some kind of shrink wrap then of
course<00:03:49.269> you're<00:03:49.389> able<00:03:49.629> to<00:03:49.659> smooth<00:03:50.319> things<00:03:50.650> off

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
course you're able to smooth things off

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.780 
course you're able to smooth things off
as<00:03:52.150> they're<00:03:52.359> as<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:53.379> mesh<00:03:53.739> collapses<00:03:54.430> it<00:03:54.579> can

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
as they're as the mesh collapses it can

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.939 
as they're as the mesh collapses it can
wrap<00:03:55.239> itself<00:03:55.659> by<00:03:55.959> iterating<00:03:56.530> a<00:03:56.620> smooth

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:56.949 
wrap itself by iterating a smooth

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:58.830 
wrap itself by iterating a smooth
modifier<00:03:57.250> on<00:03:57.790> it<00:03:57.940> and<00:03:58.180> of<00:03:58.449> course<00:03:58.659> with

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
modifier on it and of course with

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.420 
modifier on it and of course with
subdivision<00:03:59.470> surfaces<00:03:59.979> you've<00:04:00.220> basically

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
subdivision surfaces you've basically

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.149 
subdivision surfaces you've basically
got<00:04:00.639> a<00:04:00.699> low<00:04:00.940> poly<00:04:01.239> cage<00:04:01.599> which<00:04:01.959> can<00:04:02.620> collapse

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:03.159 
got a low poly cage which can collapse

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:05.789 
got a low poly cage which can collapse
to<00:04:03.669> a<00:04:03.699> certain<00:04:04.299> extent<00:04:04.780> and<00:04:05.049> then<00:04:05.229> of<00:04:05.709> course

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
to a certain extent and then of course

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:07.649 
to a certain extent and then of course
the<00:04:06.159> real-time<00:04:06.459> subdivision<00:04:07.150> comes<00:04:07.359> in<00:04:07.540> on

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:07.659 
the real-time subdivision comes in on

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:09.420 
the real-time subdivision comes in on
top<00:04:07.900> about<00:04:08.079> but<00:04:08.470> the<00:04:08.560> more<00:04:08.709> your<00:04:08.859> basic<00:04:09.250> mesh

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
top about but the more your basic mesh

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.159 
top about but the more your basic mesh
can<00:04:09.729> support<00:04:10.090> defamation<00:04:10.840> without

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.169 
can support defamation without

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:13.470 
can support defamation without
collapsing<00:04:11.949> and<00:04:12.159> twisting<00:04:12.760> and<00:04:12.879> going<00:04:13.150> whole

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
collapsing and twisting and going whole

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.880 
collapsing and twisting and going whole
or<00:04:13.599> the<00:04:13.720> better<00:04:13.989> position<00:04:14.530> you're<00:04:14.650> going<00:04:14.830> to

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
or the better position you're going to

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.250 
or the better position you're going to
be<00:04:14.980> in<00:04:15.129> for<00:04:15.370> anything<00:04:15.640> so<00:04:16.570> I<00:04:16.600> selected<00:04:17.079> here

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
be in for anything so I selected here

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.379 
be in for anything so I selected here
the<00:04:17.440> points<00:04:17.739> that<00:04:17.799> are<00:04:17.919> just<00:04:18.239> explicitly<00:04:19.239> the

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
the points that are just explicitly the

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.629 
the points that are just explicitly the
arm<00:04:19.600> and<00:04:19.870> so<00:04:20.079> when<00:04:20.229> I<00:04:20.260> rotate<00:04:20.709> it<00:04:20.739> in<00:04:21.010> four

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
arm and so when I rotate it in four

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.840 
arm and so when I rotate it in four
words<00:04:21.910> like<00:04:22.780> this<00:04:23.050> which<00:04:23.350> is<00:04:23.380> often<00:04:23.830> a<00:04:23.919> trick<00:04:24.610> C

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
words like this which is often a trick C

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.640 
words like this which is often a trick C
position<00:04:25.300> we<00:04:25.840> can<00:04:25.990> see<00:04:26.169> what<00:04:26.320> I've<00:04:26.410> got

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
position we can see what I've got

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.320 
position we can see what I've got
straight<00:04:27.010> away<00:04:27.250> of<00:04:27.430> course<00:04:27.639> because<00:04:28.030> of<00:04:28.150> this

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
straight away of course because of this

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.350 
straight away of course because of this
quad<00:04:29.110> we<00:04:29.500> have<00:04:29.710> here<00:04:30.010> makes<00:04:30.580> a<00:04:30.699> funky<00:04:31.090> shape

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
quad we have here makes a funky shape

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.730 
quad we have here makes a funky shape
but<00:04:31.570> of<00:04:31.660> course<00:04:31.840> because<00:04:32.139> of<00:04:32.260> the<00:04:32.350> way<00:04:32.470> it<00:04:32.620> will

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
but of course because of the way it will

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.100 
but of course because of the way it will
draw<00:04:33.070> or<00:04:33.550> if<00:04:33.820> this<00:04:33.970> would<00:04:34.180> triangulate<00:04:34.810> it<00:04:34.990> in

draw or if this would triangulate it in

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.430 
draw or if this would triangulate it in
a<00:04:35.199> games<00:04:35.410> engine<00:04:35.979> it<00:04:36.669> holds<00:04:37.120> up<00:04:37.300> the<00:04:38.050> shape<00:04:38.320> of

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
a games engine it holds up the shape of

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.290 
a games engine it holds up the shape of
our<00:04:38.560> shoulder<00:04:39.070> reasonably<00:04:39.850> well<00:04:40.030> of<00:04:40.240> course

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
our shoulder reasonably well of course

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.060 
our shoulder reasonably well of course
if<00:04:40.600> we're<00:04:40.720> going<00:04:40.840> to<00:04:40.990> subdivision<00:04:41.620> see<00:04:41.889> that

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
if we're going to subdivision see that

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.950 
if we're going to subdivision see that
we<00:04:42.160> haven't<00:04:42.370> got<00:04:42.520> a<00:04:42.550> proper<00:04:43.060> bulge<00:04:43.419> of<00:04:43.720> course

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
we haven't got a proper bulge of course

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.570 
we haven't got a proper bulge of course
because<00:04:44.169> we<00:04:44.290> are<00:04:44.410> so<00:04:44.650> very<00:04:44.680> low<00:04:45.100> poly<00:04:45.400> we've

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
because we are so very low poly we've

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.760 
because we are so very low poly we've
got<00:04:45.729> no<00:04:45.880> ability<00:04:46.090> but<00:04:46.600> we<00:04:46.660> have<00:04:46.900> got<00:04:47.110> a<00:04:47.260> smooth

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
got no ability but we have got a smooth

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.240 
got no ability but we have got a smooth
clean<00:04:48.550> defamation<00:04:49.479> and<00:04:50.169> we<00:04:50.320> can<00:04:50.500> see<00:04:50.770> of

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
clean defamation and we can see of

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.010 
clean defamation and we can see of
course<00:04:51.430> if<00:04:51.639> we<00:04:51.760> look<00:04:51.910> for<00:04:52.180> for<00:04:52.539> instance<00:04:52.840> the

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
course if we look for for instance the

course if we look for for instance the
top<00:04:53.229> view<00:04:53.530> here<00:04:53.770> we've<00:04:54.280> got<00:04:54.430> this<00:04:54.610> loop<00:04:55.360> going

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
top view here we've got this loop going

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.980 
top view here we've got this loop going
round<00:04:56.590> and<00:04:57.070> it's<00:04:57.550> not<00:04:57.760> collapsed<00:04:58.630> in<00:04:58.780> on

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
round and it's not collapsed in on

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.779 
round and it's not collapsed in on
itself<00:04:59.199> which<00:04:59.800> is<00:04:59.919> what<00:05:00.070> we<00:05:00.160> want<00:05:00.370> we've<00:05:00.639> got

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
itself which is what we want we've got

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:02.430 
itself which is what we want we've got
something<00:05:01.060> that<00:05:01.210> we<00:05:01.389> can<00:05:01.419> work<00:05:01.870> with<00:05:01.900> so

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
something that we can work with so

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.460 
something that we can work with so
that's<00:05:02.590> great<00:05:02.770> and<00:05:03.210> of<00:05:04.210> course<00:05:04.419> the<00:05:04.570> other<00:05:04.720> one

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
that's great and of course the other one

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.890 
that's great and of course the other one
is<00:05:05.710> coming<00:05:06.310> down<00:05:06.789> here<00:05:07.150> so<00:05:07.389> we've<00:05:07.539> turned<00:05:07.750> the

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
is coming down here so we've turned the

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.080 
is coming down here so we've turned the
arm<00:05:08.050> down<00:05:08.650> at<00:05:08.860> the<00:05:08.949> side<00:05:09.190> and<00:05:09.460> see<00:05:09.639> that<00:05:09.850> dennah

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
arm down at the side and see that dennah

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.810 
arm down at the side and see that dennah
topology<00:05:11.020> is<00:05:11.169> you<00:05:11.680> know<00:05:11.800> giving<00:05:12.340> us<00:05:12.430> good

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820

stuff obviously even in a games engine
we're<00:05:14.919> gonna<00:05:15.010> have<00:05:15.190> a<00:05:15.220> bit<00:05:15.400> of<00:05:15.460> cross<00:05:15.729> waiting

we're gonna have a bit of cross waiting
so<00:05:16.389> you<00:05:16.479> would<00:05:16.600> have<00:05:16.750> you<00:05:16.900> adjustment<00:05:17.860> going

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
so you would have you adjustment going

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.210 
so you would have you adjustment going
on<00:05:18.280> here<00:05:19.060> as<00:05:19.750> you<00:05:19.930> can<00:05:20.080> see<00:05:20.289> it's<00:05:20.410> very<00:05:20.500> easy<00:05:20.710> to

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
on here as you can see it's very easy to

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.730 
on here as you can see it's very easy to
manipulate<00:05:22.000> your<00:05:22.180> mesh<00:05:22.450> with<00:05:22.870> simple<00:05:23.349> deform

us to get a good and consistent shape
and<00:05:28.210> your<00:05:28.450> flow<00:05:29.160> continues<00:05:30.160> round<00:05:30.580> following

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
and your flow continues round following

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.029 
and your flow continues round following
the<00:05:31.360> lines<00:05:31.570> of<00:05:31.840> your<00:05:31.960> character<00:05:32.380> pose<00:05:32.620> again

if we go for say the arm up over the

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.900 
if we go for say the arm up over the
head<00:05:35.560> move<00:05:35.800> there<00:05:36.130> where<00:05:36.400> we<00:05:36.490> actually<00:05:36.729> bring

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
head move there where we actually bring

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.270

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
once again were able to maintain a nice

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.469 
once again were able to maintain a nice
flow<00:05:41.860> that's<00:05:42.099> very<00:05:42.340> easily<00:05:42.550> corrected<00:05:43.270> with

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 
flow that's very easily corrected with

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:46.020 
flow that's very easily corrected with

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
mean you know use subdivision surfaces

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.700 
mean you know use subdivision surfaces
and<00:05:51.820> this<00:05:52.000> is<00:05:52.150> honestly<00:05:52.720> about<00:05:52.870> as<00:05:53.169> far<00:05:53.380> as<00:05:53.440> you

and this is honestly about as far as you
need<00:05:53.830> to<00:05:54.010> go<00:05:54.160> with<00:05:54.370> the<00:05:54.460> modeling<00:05:54.820> and<00:05:55.240> it's

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
need to go with the modeling and it's

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.600 
need to go with the modeling and it's
really<00:05:55.720> good<00:05:55.960> to<00:05:56.080> practice<00:05:56.289> on<00:05:56.680> a<00:05:56.710> really

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.510 
find it very easy and responsive course
as<00:06:08.139> we<00:06:08.289> get<00:06:08.440> beyond<00:06:08.710> that<00:06:08.800> we<00:06:09.010> want<00:06:09.160> to<00:06:09.250> start

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
as we get beyond that we want to start

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.120 
as we get beyond that we want to start
getting<00:06:09.789> in<00:06:10.150> some<00:06:10.389> detail<00:06:10.840> so<00:06:11.110> you<00:06:11.410> know<00:06:11.530> bit

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
getting in some detail so you know bit

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.400 
getting in some detail so you know bit
of<00:06:12.220> the<00:06:12.310> old<00:06:12.539> subdivision<00:06:13.539> and<00:06:13.870> we<00:06:13.990> can<00:06:14.169> see

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.410 
of the old subdivision and we can see

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.320 
of the old subdivision and we can see
that<00:06:14.650> the<00:06:14.949> flow<00:06:15.190> that<00:06:15.430> we<00:06:15.490> get<00:06:15.729> then<00:06:16.030> is

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
that the flow that we get then is

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.930 
that the flow that we get then is
starting<00:06:16.780> to<00:06:16.900> get<00:06:17.050> a<00:06:17.229> lot<00:06:17.560> more<00:06:17.889> shapely<00:06:18.400> for

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:18.940 
starting to get a lot more shapely for

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.089 
starting to get a lot more shapely for
what<00:06:19.060> we're<00:06:19.210> after<00:06:19.380> and<00:06:20.380> we<00:06:20.500> can<00:06:20.650> see<00:06:20.860> that

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:21.099 
what we're after and we can see that

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:22.700 
what we're after and we can see that
once<00:06:21.340> again<00:06:21.610> as<00:06:21.789> we<00:06:21.940> go<00:06:22.090> around<00:06:22.210> the

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:22.710 
once again as we go around the

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.880 
once again as we go around the
poses<00:06:23.490> start<00:06:24.240> see<00:06:24.570> straightaway<00:06:24.990> how<00:06:25.440> easy<00:06:25.650> it

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:25.890 
poses start see straightaway how easy it

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.310 
poses start see straightaway how easy it
is<00:06:25.980> to<00:06:26.220> just<00:06:26.490> not<00:06:27.360> a<00:06:27.390> couple<00:06:28.080> of<00:06:28.140> rows<00:06:28.290> of

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:28.320 
is to just not a couple of rows of

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.400 
is to just not a couple of rows of
vertices<00:06:29.280> here<00:06:29.880> and<00:06:30.120> there<00:06:30.300> and<00:06:30.480> still<00:06:30.840> get

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:31.410 
vertices here and there and still get

defamation<00:06:41.100> in<00:06:41.220> the<00:06:41.310> majority<00:06:41.730> of<00:06:41.760> situations

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.030 
defamation in the majority of situations

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.270 
defamation in the majority of situations
or<00:06:42.810> since<00:06:42.990> you<00:06:43.080> start<00:06:43.350> to<00:06:43.440> come<00:06:43.590> and<00:06:43.770> do<00:06:44.040> your

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:48.230 
forward poses and the like you've got

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.170 
forward poses and the like you've got
intermediary<00:06:49.230> points<00:06:49.680> here<00:06:49.890> is<00:06:50.280> to<00:06:50.580> UM<00:06:50.910> but

intermediary points here is to UM but
you<00:06:51.240> get<00:06:51.390> the<00:06:51.510> idea

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:51.870 
you get the idea

you get the idea
you<00:06:51.960> can<00:06:52.110> start<00:06:52.350> to<00:06:52.500> use<00:06:52.590> to<00:06:53.550> shape<00:06:54.330> out

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:54.600 
you can start to use to shape out

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.810 
you can start to use to shape out
defamation<00:06:55.380> with<00:06:55.530> some<00:06:55.740> morphs<00:06:56.160> once<00:06:56.610> of

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:56.820 
defamation with some morphs once of

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.730 
defamation with some morphs once of
course<00:06:57.060> if<00:06:57.210> this<00:06:57.390> was<00:06:57.600> wrapped<00:06:57.870> over<00:06:58.320> a<00:06:58.350> muscle

00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:58.740 
course if this was wrapped over a muscle

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:04.070 
course if this was wrapped over a muscle
system<00:06:59.270> the<00:07:00.270> lines<00:07:00.870> that<00:07:01.380> are<00:07:02.510> flowing<00:07:03.510> will

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 
system the lines that are flowing will

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.100 
system the lines that are flowing will
give<00:07:04.260> some<00:07:04.560> nice<00:07:04.800> and<00:07:05.070> smooth<00:07:05.370> results<00:07:06.000> so<00:07:06.960> all

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:07.110 
give some nice and smooth results so all

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.320 
give some nice and smooth results so all
in<00:07:07.260> all<00:07:07.350> you<00:07:07.740> know<00:07:07.830> I<00:07:07.860> get<00:07:08.160> my<00:07:08.190> own<00:07:08.400> to<00:07:08.640> shoulder

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:09.330 
in all you know I get my own to shoulder

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.300 
in all you know I get my own to shoulder
topology<00:07:09.840> I<00:07:09.870> find<00:07:10.290> for<00:07:10.500> the<00:07:10.560> vast<00:07:10.710> majority<00:07:10.860> of

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:11.310 
topology I find for the vast majority of

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.070 
topology I find for the vast majority of
situations<00:07:11.550> and<00:07:12.240> if<00:07:12.300> you<00:07:12.390> are<00:07:12.510> starting<00:07:12.930> out

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080 
situations and if you are starting out

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.990 
situations and if you are starting out
modeling<00:07:13.320> a<00:07:13.560> character<00:07:14.070> it's<00:07:14.430> a<00:07:14.550> great<00:07:14.730> place

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000 
modeling a character it's a great place

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.650 
modeling a character it's a great place
to<00:07:15.030> start<00:07:15.390> if<00:07:15.540> we<00:07:15.600> come<00:07:15.810> back<00:07:15.960> to<00:07:16.140> the<00:07:16.260> old<00:07:16.580> base

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:17.660 
to start if we come back to the old base

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.200 
to start if we come back to the old base
thing<00:07:18.660> again<00:07:19.410> we<00:07:20.040> see<00:07:20.250> that<00:07:20.400> I<00:07:20.430> actually<00:07:20.610> kept

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:21.210 
thing again we see that I actually kept

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:24.080 
thing again we see that I actually kept
this<00:07:21.420> for<00:07:21.870> a<00:07:22.110> reason<00:07:22.620> and<00:07:22.860> the<00:07:23.610> reason<00:07:23.670> is<00:07:24.060> that

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:24.090 
this for a reason and the reason is that

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.180 
this for a reason and the reason is that
this<00:07:24.420> shape<00:07:24.690> comes<00:07:25.020> in<00:07:25.230> useful<00:07:25.440> in<00:07:25.890> other

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:26.190 
this shape comes in useful in other

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:28.460 
this shape comes in useful in other
places<00:07:26.610> other<00:07:27.000> than<00:07:27.120> the<00:07:27.360> shoulder<00:07:27.780> as<00:07:27.960> well

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:28.470 
places other than the shoulder as well

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.980 
places other than the shoulder as well
in<00:07:28.800> case<00:07:29.040> you<00:07:29.190> haven't<00:07:29.370> guessed<00:07:29.460> already<00:07:29.990> it's

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:30.990 
in case you haven't guessed already it's

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.610 
in case you haven't guessed already it's
going<00:07:31.410> to<00:07:31.530> be<00:07:31.740> a<00:07:31.980> hand<00:07:32.610> and<00:07:32.970> thumb<00:07:33.480> again<00:07:34.320> this

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:34.620 
going to be a hand and thumb again this

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.100 
going to be a hand and thumb again this
gives<00:07:34.920> just<00:07:35.430> the<00:07:35.490> right<00:07:35.730> points<00:07:36.270> and<00:07:36.540> just<00:07:36.570> the

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:37.110 
gives just the right points and just the

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.740 
gives just the right points and just the
right<00:07:37.140> sort<00:07:37.620> of<00:07:37.710> basic<00:07:38.370> arrangement<00:07:39.030> to<00:07:39.300> get<00:07:39.510> a

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:39.750 
right sort of basic arrangement to get a

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:42.200 
right sort of basic arrangement to get a
thumb<00:07:40.380> and<00:07:40.650> hand<00:07:40.920> topology<00:07:41.340> that<00:07:41.790> works

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:42.210 
thumb and hand topology that works

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:44.600 
thumb and hand topology that works
really<00:07:42.720> well<00:07:42.870> for<00:07:43.320> the<00:07:43.410> kind<00:07:43.650> of<00:07:43.770> defamations

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:44.610 
really well for the kind of defamations

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.880 
really well for the kind of defamations
that<00:07:45.090> we<00:07:45.240> want<00:07:45.390> to<00:07:45.540> use<00:07:45.750> in<00:07:45.960> this<00:07:46.080> area<00:07:46.290> and<00:07:46.710> so

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:46.890 
that we want to use in this area and so

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:48.650 
that we want to use in this area and so
there<00:07:47.070> you<00:07:47.100> go<00:07:47.370> so<00:07:47.940> I<00:07:47.970> hope<00:07:48.180> you<00:07:48.270> found<00:07:48.450> this
