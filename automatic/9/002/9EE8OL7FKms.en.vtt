00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 our next candidate is 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.730
 probably the most famous people 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.649
 even into the team thus also 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.719
 economically, that's it 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.550
 most successful team ever in the 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.440
 In any case, there are some 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.480
 made the right decision but the 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.400
 entire story of team thus now 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.109
 to tell the format would be 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.369
 that's why they're a bit limited 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.289
 I'm on the last split in the 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.660
 last split they are in the normal 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.269
 season have become third and then have 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.769
 defeated in the playoffs 3 2 and 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.599
 even the first place in the 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.189
 summer split then have secured 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.440
 qualified for the world are there 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.969
 also emerged from the group phase 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.710
 and then are in the quarterfinals against 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.300
 samsung failed three to one 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.640
 have they lost there so have 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.059
 still in the top 8 of the entire 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.430
 Bates smuggled so top 8 on each 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.450
 case absolutely solid place nevertheless think 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.460
 I have you in this season 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.629
 want to get started harder like 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.030
 I want to tell you what you want to do 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.010
 now on the top with doris the longer 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.510
 it already since the beta and also 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.640
 for a very long time in the pop scene 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.100
 which he must now almost three 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.339
 years and earlier were its signature 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.420
 James especially wishes and jacks the 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.130
 both are currently not 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.900
 quite so in the meta tags you can see 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.220
 here from time to time but he plays 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.479
 the bavaria is not that right now 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.040
 is limited mainly to meters 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.530
 champs mobile traffic light him very much 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.090
 loves and he is one of the only ones 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.740
 player along with Jesus saw it 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.119
 so far have done for all 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.460
 four world championships too 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.560
 qualify so that's right 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.630
 really big chapman what like i said 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.610
 already reached only two people 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.610
 He is mainly through his 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.240
 experience in the very strong for a team 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.130
 is very experienced and solar problems 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.869
 Does not he have that at all? 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.200
 most experienced players do not 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.150
 to have 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.149
 many say that the usa is a bit like that 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.770
 To the end he goes because not more this 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.479
 has motivation and still be happy 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.280
 nonetheless, the mental does solo 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.869
 not a good job sits just under 800 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.100
 score challenger and do it mechanically 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.229
 but still a very good one 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.630
 problems in jungle santorin the now 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.340
 only recently sms the colleague has 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.340
 never 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.109
 dlcs was played before at team 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.789
 challenge series is doing pretty well there 

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:07.009
 Performs and is also with 1000 points 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.030
 Challenger individually on each 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.679
 case a top player 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.950
 nonetheless, such a caliber 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.450
 like tsm still very inexperienced and that 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.650
 biggest question mark of the entire team 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.750
 it has to be in the next game 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.000
 definitely prove the potential he has 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.120
 but whether he can develop this by 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.040
 lc's environment remains to be seen 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.299
 especially the scenes are very much to him and 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.220
 as already mentioned mechanically 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.870
 he is absolute top player in the middle 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.060
 We sometimes box them 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.310
 best known aim members ever 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.079
 that was preferred esm came on 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.299
 beginning at copenhagen wulffs 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.620
 then qualify for the lcs 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.970
 was allowed the first two weeks even 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.860
 Do not even play because he is still there 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.110
 17 years old was 17 is that 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.569
 Minimum age to participate in the lcs 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.430
 may then have a pretty 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.170
 good job in lc's made after that 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.430
 he takes a team to his then 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.950
 gone where they are relatively good 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.680
 and then he was by tsm 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.290
 is recruited as the second player of 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.120
 europe to america after edward of gay 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.430
 has gone with gaming and has now 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.500
 Definitely made his mark here 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.630
 has definitely grown a lot 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.579
 very many like the central one big 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.410
 but above all, be his 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.540
 skills a lot again he rose 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.609
 is sometimes considered the best with countries 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.010
 in the whole of america where you have to say 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:20.930
 that only at santos de so in the 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.880
 intel extreme masters not so good 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.319
 could be several times by the 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.239
 submit them to unicorns for example 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.430
 from plate in the left, especially so 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.989
 individually very annoying champions 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.609
 league special and with a very 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.829
 can hurt a lot and in the one against one 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:36.769
 an absolutely lethal weapon is the 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:39.560
 position represents turtle since 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.880
 2013 mathias m and was formerly mainly 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.099
 as a solo kita lent he had one 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.079
 for a long time four accounts in the top 10 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.730
 countries in the challenger and currently is 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.690
 also in first place with almost 1400 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.510
 points 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.239
 bwl as I said so absolute top level 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.829
 sometimes in the lcc he is considered one 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.239
 bit too greedy and maybe 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.799
 sometimes something very aggressive around in kiel 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.180
 to get what he usually gets 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.109
 death does not necessarily mean the best 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.209
 decision for his team is 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:03.889
 Nonetheless, the salsa the kerry 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.450
 one of the best in america and 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:07.909
 if he is this small and constant 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.319
 then he can eliminate 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:10.640
 probably the best 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.590
 from america to the end now 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.569
 support idea.de complicated is last at 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.120
 la suisse koreaner and has before him 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.039
 last year to tsm came for sea and 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.460
 displays also played before that 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:23.630
 he was involved in the ign for a long time 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.100
 all through his individual style 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.380
 and the fact that he stops 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.470
 successful player in Korea is very 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.750
 then DMS is attractive to America 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.310
 changed and has a good one there too 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.139
 job done where you have to say you have to 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.259
 looks partly at the koreaner 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:41.000
 been a while since are that this 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:43.009
 western environment not the skill 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.570
 therefore, the fewest help 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:46.250
 players who can come from korea 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.630
 this level what they had in korea 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.490
 also in America 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.570
 Similarly, I still look at Lars Bergmann 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.490
 for American standards 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.139
 probably the best or one of the 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.849
 best supporter ever 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.250
 Nonetheless, I think he is in 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:59.780
 korea there was a little higher from the skill level 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.820
 he still harmonizes pretty well and 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.560
 wild oertel and the hotline is absolutely 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.270
 strong above all just what mechanical 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.130
 play and just know about the game 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.490
 The two are absolutely on top 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.680
 level 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.030
 So we have four well-known ones here 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.740
 player who also very stage 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.050
 had past and then have 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.849
 we are a relatively inexperienced and 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.500
 also unknown player in the jungle 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:19.880
 with santorin of course in any case 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.220
 I still have to prove if 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.960
 Santorin performs well and the team as well 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.250
 then harmonizes in the last season 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.080
 we have a top line up here again 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.659
 and iris m has good chances again 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.409
 very good position in lcs with 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:32.330
 complete 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:34.130
 I think place 1 to 3 is really 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.020
 again realistic and depending on how it is 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.030
 you can really enjoy yourself at performance 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:41.080
 designate as the best team America 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.080
 at least on the paper
