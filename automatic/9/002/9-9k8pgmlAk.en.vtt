i'm going to start moving the cursor so
it's<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.270> lot<00:01:03.449> easier<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:04.280> it's<00:01:05.280> pretty<00:01:05.549> fast

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
it's a lot easier and it's pretty fast

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.300 
it's a lot easier and it's pretty fast
now<00:01:06.299> say<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.080> took<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.560> long<00:01:07.710> time<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:08.070> get

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
now say that took a long time to get

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.850 
now say that took a long time to get
over<00:01:08.369> there<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:08.700> say<00:01:09.180> i<00:01:09.210> need<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.710> do<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.830> a

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
over there so say i need to do it a

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.050 
over there so say i need to do it a
little<00:01:10.979> bit<00:01:11.100> faster<00:01:11.280> all<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.700> need<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.909> do<00:01:12.030> is

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
little bit faster all you need to do is

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.000 
little bit faster all you need to do is
take<00:01:12.270> two<00:01:12.450> fingers<00:01:12.630> do<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.470> same<00:01:13.710> thing<00:01:13.890> and

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
take two fingers do the same thing and

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.499 
take two fingers do the same thing and
it's<00:01:14.130> going<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.280> go<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.460> lot<00:01:14.700> faster<00:01:14.939> as<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.360> can

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
it's going to go a lot faster as you can

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.719 
it's going to go a lot faster as you can
see<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:16.350> it's<00:01:16.500> going<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.799> lot<00:01:16.920> faster<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.490> now

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
see so it's going a lot faster and now

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.999 
see so it's going a lot faster and now
i'm<00:01:17.909> there<00:01:18.119> in<00:01:18.330> less<00:01:18.960> time<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:19.740> really

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
i'm there in less time so it's really

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.190 
i'm there in less time so it's really
effective<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.790> it's<00:01:20.909> really<00:01:21.090> easy<00:01:21.330> also<00:01:22.080> if

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
effective and it's really easy also if

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.899 
effective and it's really easy also if
you<00:01:22.320> want<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.590> select<00:01:22.830> text<00:01:23.130> all<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.700> need<00:01:23.850> to

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
you want to select text all you need to

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.390 
you want to select text all you need to
do<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.150> hold<00:01:24.330> shift<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.920> then<00:01:25.920> go<00:01:26.189> ahead<00:01:26.220> and

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
do is hold shift and then go ahead and

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.340 
do is hold shift and then go ahead and
select<00:01:26.640> text<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.509> as<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.689> can<00:01:27.780> see<00:01:27.960> there<00:01:28.200> it's

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
select text so as you can see there it's

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.620 
select text so as you can see there it's
a<00:01:28.439> lot<00:01:28.650> faster<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:29.100> copy<00:01:29.310> just<00:01:29.970> hold<00:01:30.119> down<00:01:30.210> and

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
a lot faster to copy just hold down and

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.330 
a lot faster to copy just hold down and
that<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.350> actually<00:01:31.500> something<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.040> I've

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
that is actually something that I've

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.569 
that is actually something that I've
found<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.820> problem<00:01:33.119> here<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:33.810> when<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.590> copy

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
found a problem here so when you copy

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.490 
found a problem here so when you copy
text<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.180> works<00:01:36.329> very<00:01:36.600> well<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:37.140> highlight

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
text it works very well to highlight

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.960 
text it works very well to highlight
everything<00:01:37.710> but<00:01:38.009> once<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.220> want<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.460> go<00:01:38.520> copy<00:01:38.759> it

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
everything but once I want to go copy it

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.969 
everything but once I want to go copy it
I<00:01:39.150> have<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.930> be<00:01:40.140> careful<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.710> what<00:01:40.740> I'm<00:01:40.950> doing

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
I have to be careful in what I'm doing

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.069 
I have to be careful in what I'm doing
otherwise<00:01:41.970> it's<00:01:42.299> going<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.509> deselect

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
otherwise it's going to deselect

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.270 
otherwise it's going to deselect
everything<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.770> it's<00:01:43.860> just<00:01:43.979> not<00:01:44.130> going<00:01:44.220> to

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
everything and it's just not going to

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.429 
everything and it's just not going to
work<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.549> way<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.700> want<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.439> that's

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
work the way I want it so that's

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.870 
work the way I want it so that's
something<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:47.189> think<00:01:47.399> could<00:01:47.490> be<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.670> little

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
something that I think could be a little

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.670 
something that I think could be a little
bit<00:01:48.030> fixed<00:01:48.329> but<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:49.020> know<00:01:49.110> not<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.380> big<00:01:49.439> deal

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
bit fixed but you know not a big deal

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.289 
bit fixed but you know not a big deal
you<00:01:49.829> just<00:01:49.890> have<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.130> be<00:01:50.250> careful<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:51.060> it's

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
you just have to be careful so it's

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.240 
you just have to be careful so it's
really<00:01:51.659> easy<00:01:51.960> in<00:01:52.170> really<00:01:52.470> effective<00:01:52.979> way<00:01:53.009> to

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
really easy in really effective way to

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.429 
really easy in really effective way to
edit<00:01:53.850> text<00:01:54.240> on<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.479> iphone<00:01:54.509> it's<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.170> lot

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
edit text on the iphone it's a lot

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.740 
edit text on the iphone it's a lot
better<00:01:55.649> than<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.149> magnifying<00:01:57.149> view<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.630> you

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
better than the magnifying view that you

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.069 
better than the magnifying view that you
get<00:01:57.960> stock<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:58.920> I'm<00:01:59.340> really<00:01:59.939> excited<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.930> see

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
get stock so I'm really excited to see

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.770 
get stock so I'm really excited to see
this<00:02:01.229> implemented<00:02:01.920> in<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.310> real<00:02:02.610> iOS<00:02:03.149> version<00:02:03.630> I

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
this implemented in a real iOS version I

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.929 
this implemented in a real iOS version I
don't<00:02:04.409> think<00:02:04.590> we'll<00:02:05.040> exactly<00:02:05.700> but<00:02:05.909> I

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
don't think we'll exactly but I

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.850 
don't think we'll exactly but I
definitely<00:02:06.299> think<00:02:06.659> Apple<00:02:07.020> has<00:02:07.110> seen<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.560> and

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
definitely think Apple has seen this and

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.740 
definitely think Apple has seen this and
is<00:02:08.369> looking<00:02:08.610> into<00:02:08.940> something<00:02:09.420> like<00:02:09.539> this

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
is looking into something like this

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.170 
is looking into something like this
because<00:02:10.379> I<00:02:10.770> mean<00:02:11.039> this<00:02:11.190> is<00:02:11.250> very<00:02:11.580> popular<00:02:11.819> when

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
because I mean this is very popular when

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.230 
because I mean this is very popular when
the<00:02:12.239> video<00:02:12.390> came<00:02:12.510> out<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:12.840> remember

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
the video came out I remember

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.420 
the video came out I remember
how<00:02:13.300> popular<00:02:13.750> was<00:02:14.020> so<00:02:14.290> apples<00:02:15.040> definitely

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
how popular was so apples definitely

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.740 
how popular was so apples definitely
seen<00:02:15.610> this<00:02:15.760> but<00:02:16.060> hopefully<00:02:16.540> they<00:02:16.690> can

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
seen this but hopefully they can

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.140 
seen this but hopefully they can
implement<00:02:17.110> it<00:02:17.350> in<00:02:17.440> some<00:02:17.620> way<00:02:17.800> and<00:02:17.950> so<00:02:18.670> this<00:02:18.940> is
