00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
five and a half it all depends on what

the tax happens to be but you definitely
need<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:28.410> number<00:00:28.710> because<00:00:29.099> you'll<00:00:30.090> need<00:00:30.449> it

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
need that number because you'll need it

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.089 
need that number because you'll need it
to<00:00:30.810> figure<00:00:31.109> out<00:00:31.289> how<00:00:31.380> much<00:00:31.500> tax<00:00:31.769> you'll<00:00:32.009> be

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
to figure out how much tax you'll be

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.610 
to figure out how much tax you'll be
paying<00:00:32.309> on<00:00:32.520> certain<00:00:32.850> items<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.469> it'll<00:00:34.469> help

paying on certain items and it'll help

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.260 
paying on certain items and it'll help
you<00:00:34.710> find<00:00:34.950> out<00:00:35.040> what<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.250> total<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.969> it'll

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
you find out what the total is and it'll

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.240 
you find out what the total is and it'll
give<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.420> more<00:00:36.510> insight<00:00:37.020> as<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.260> why<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
give you more insight as to why the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.270 
give you more insight as to why the
final<00:00:39.149> totals<00:00:39.540> are<00:00:39.750> what<00:00:40.079> they<00:00:40.230> are<00:00:40.410> now

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
final totals are what they are now

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.700 
final totals are what they are now
here's<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.879> brief<00:00:42.390> example<00:00:42.719> now<00:00:42.930> suppose<00:00:43.680> you

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
here's a brief example now suppose you

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.279 
here's a brief example now suppose you
have<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:44.040> sales<00:00:44.309> tax<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.760> seven<00:00:45.329> percent<00:00:45.480> first

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
have a sales tax of seven percent first

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.720 
have a sales tax of seven percent first
thing<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.710> definitely<00:00:46.920> need<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.309> do<00:00:47.520> is

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
thing that you definitely need to do is

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.310 
thing that you definitely need to do is
take<00:00:47.969> whatever<00:00:48.329> percentage<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.050> are

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
take whatever percentage that you are

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.619 
take whatever percentage that you are
provided<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:49.980> turn<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.700> into<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:51.120> decimal

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
provided and turn it into a decimal

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.150 
provided and turn it into a decimal
that<00:00:52.020> way<00:00:52.170> it'll<00:00:52.379> help<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.739> figure<00:00:52.920> out<00:00:53.039> how

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
that way it'll help you figure out how

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.830 
that way it'll help you figure out how
much<00:00:53.430> tax<00:00:53.670> you're<00:00:53.940> actually<00:00:54.300> paying<00:00:54.510> on<00:00:54.780> a

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
much tax you're actually paying on a

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.799 
much tax you're actually paying on a
particular<00:00:55.469> item<00:00:55.800> now<00:00:56.579> because<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.600> seven

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
particular item now because it is seven

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.130 
particular item now because it is seven
percent<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.559> take<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.750> decimal<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.930> shift

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
percent you take that decimal and shift

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.080 
percent you take that decimal and shift
it<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.379> left<00:01:01.469> two<00:01:01.949> places<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.760> seven

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
it to the left two places so seven

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.579 
it to the left two places so seven
percent<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.570> actually<00:01:04.140> another<00:01:04.320> way<00:01:04.470> of

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
percent is actually another way of

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.899 
percent is actually another way of
saying<00:01:04.739> zero<00:01:05.489> point<00:01:06.240> zero<00:01:06.420> seven<00:01:07.290> now<00:01:08.130> here's

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
saying zero point zero seven now here's

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.670 
saying zero point zero seven now here's
an<00:01:09.060> example<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.600> calculate<00:01:10.290> how<00:01:10.500> much

is<00:01:30.240> very<00:01:30.659> very<00:01:30.930> handy<00:01:31.350> here<00:01:31.680> but<00:01:32.490> because<00:01:32.759> we

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
is very very handy here but because we

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.940 
is very very handy here but because we
are<00:01:33.150> talking<00:01:33.450> about<00:01:33.600> dollars<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.049> cents<00:01:34.470> you

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
are talking about dollars and cents you

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.030 
are talking about dollars and cents you
want<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.250> round<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.850> two<00:01:36.450> decimal<00:01:36.479> places<00:01:37.229> so

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
want to round to two decimal places so

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.920 
want to round to two decimal places so

when you multiply those two numbers you

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.590 
when you multiply those two numbers you
will<00:01:40.020> get<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> grand<00:01:40.500> total<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:41.270> attacks<00:01:42.270> a
