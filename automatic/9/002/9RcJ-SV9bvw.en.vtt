00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
really really like it so I'll actually

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.850

really<00:00:48.180> take<00:00:48.360> care<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.230> this<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.649> one<00:00:49.800> of

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
really take care of it so this is one of

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.700 
really take care of it so this is one of
the<00:00:49.950> ways<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.100> I've<00:00:50.399> had<00:00:50.640> probably<00:00:51.120> like

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
the ways that I've had probably like

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.060 
the ways that I've had probably like
almost<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.890> year<00:00:53.129> now<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:54.350> I<00:00:55.350> think<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.559> got<00:00:55.710> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
almost a year now and I think I got the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.560 
almost a year now and I think I got the
first<00:00:56.219> one<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.550> August<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.180> think<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:57.480> is

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
first one in August and I think this is

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.660 
first one in August and I think this is
the<00:00:57.629> one<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.780> got<00:00:57.960> first<00:00:58.530> one<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.739> August<00:00:58.859> so

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
the one I got first one in August so

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.880 
the one I got first one in August so
this<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.570> what<00:01:00.750> she<00:01:01.350> looks<00:01:01.500> like<00:01:01.620> after<00:01:01.859> I

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.289 
me approximately five to six minutes to
get<00:02:04.409> this<00:02:04.530> done

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
get this done

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.630 
get this done
come<00:02:06.299> on<00:02:06.479> now<00:02:06.659> come<00:02:07.110> on<00:02:07.259> now<00:02:07.320> come<00:02:07.920> on<00:02:08.009> now<00:02:08.069> the

come on now come on now come on now the

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.130 
come on now come on now come on now the
whole<00:02:08.819> process<00:02:09.060> would<00:02:09.390> probably<00:02:09.750> take<00:02:10.020> about

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
whole process would probably take about

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.130 
whole process would probably take about
30<00:02:10.590> minutes<00:02:10.739> because<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.430> has<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.730> dry

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
30 minutes because it has to dry

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.460 
30 minutes because it has to dry
depending<00:02:13.650> on<00:02:13.740> how<00:02:14.010> much<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:15.000> actually

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
depending on how much you actually

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.890 
depending on how much you actually
drench<00:02:16.470> your<00:02:17.220> wake<00:02:17.400> so<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.420> things<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:18.750> you

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
drench your wake so the things that you

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.160 
drench your wake so the things that you
will<00:02:19.080> need<00:02:19.230> is<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:20.310> spray<00:02:20.640> bottle<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.270> I<00:02:22.020> got

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
will need is a spray bottle and I got

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.720 
will need is a spray bottle and I got
this<00:02:22.260> at<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.410> dollar<00:02:22.470> store<00:02:22.740> for<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.640> dollar

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
this at the dollar store for a dollar

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.650 
this at the dollar store for a dollar
and<00:02:24.770> then<00:02:25.770> you<00:02:26.130> will<00:02:26.340> need<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:27.360> secret

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
and then you will need the secret

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.690 
and then you will need the secret
ingredient<00:02:28.250> that<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.280> have<00:02:29.930> fabric<00:02:30.930> softener

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
ingredient that I have fabric softener

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.430 
ingredient that I have fabric softener
imagine<00:02:32.700> that<00:02:32.850> so<00:02:33.570> you<00:02:33.630> know<00:02:33.840> synthetic<00:02:34.260> wigs

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
imagine that so you know synthetic wigs

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.070 
imagine that so you know synthetic wigs
are<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.980> synthetic<00:02:35.460> fiber<00:02:35.700> so<00:02:36.150> it's<00:02:36.420> a<00:02:36.600> fake

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
are a synthetic fiber so it's a fake

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.850 
are a synthetic fiber so it's a fake
fiber<00:02:37.560> um<00:02:38.400> so<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.330> is<00:02:39.600> where<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.320> softening

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
fiber um so that is where the softening

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.480 
fiber um so that is where the softening
of<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.520> fibers<00:02:42.000> comes<00:02:42.540> into<00:02:42.810> play<00:02:43.170> so<00:02:43.590> fabric

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
of the fibers comes into play so fabric

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.060 
of the fibers comes into play so fabric
softener<00:02:44.850> one<00:02:45.270> dollar<00:02:45.540> make<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.350> ha<00:02:46.530> ha<00:02:46.670> and

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
softener one dollar make you ha ha and

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.070 
softener one dollar make you ha ha and
the<00:02:50.070> dollar<00:02:50.280> store<00:02:50.610> so<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:51.480> don't<00:02:51.720> need<00:02:51.870> like

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
the dollar store so you don't need like

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.950 
the dollar store so you don't need like
you<00:02:52.290> know<00:02:52.410> gain<00:02:52.740> or<00:02:53.430> downy<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.360> mean<00:02:54.750> if<00:02:54.840> you
