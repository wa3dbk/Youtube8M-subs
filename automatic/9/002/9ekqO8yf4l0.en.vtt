00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
males asking crash terminology here so I

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.959 
males asking crash terminology here so I
don't<00:00:56.640> know<00:00:56.940> how<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.210> got<00:00:57.360> linked<00:00:57.930> or<00:00:58.730> how<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.760> got

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
so i'll talk about that terminology and

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.740 
so i'll talk about that terminology and
all<00:01:19.450> right<00:01:19.720> and<00:01:19.900> i'm<00:01:19.990> going<00:01:20.110> to<00:01:20.200> talk<00:01:20.260> about

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
all right and i'm going to talk about

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.240 
all right and i'm going to talk about
dynamics<00:01:22.750> of<00:01:22.900> a<00:01:22.990> crash<00:01:24.210> well<00:01:25.920> when<00:01:26.920> there<00:01:27.100> is<00:01:27.220> a

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
dynamics of a crash well when there is a

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.480 
dynamics of a crash well when there is a
crash<00:01:27.610> it's<00:01:28.060> not<00:01:28.330> just<00:01:28.950> because<00:01:29.950> of<00:01:30.160> one<00:01:30.460> thing

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
crash it's not just because of one thing

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.530 
crash it's not just because of one thing
usually<00:01:33.490> it's<00:01:33.610> a<00:01:33.640> whole<00:01:33.820> bunch<00:01:34.090> of<00:01:34.270> it's<00:01:34.450> a

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
usually it's a whole bunch of it's a

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.720 
usually it's a whole bunch of it's a
combination<00:01:34.840> of<00:01:35.230> things<00:01:36.690> so<00:01:37.690> think<00:01:38.230> of<00:01:38.290> it<00:01:38.440> as

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 
combination of things so think of it as

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:45.320 
combination of things so think of it as
like<00:01:40.680> two<00:01:41.680> sprockets<00:01:42.040> connected<00:01:42.910> by<00:01:43.090> a<00:01:43.390> chain

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
like two sprockets connected by a chain

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.210 
like two sprockets connected by a chain
kind<00:01:46.330> of<00:01:46.420> way<00:01:46.570> with<00:01:47.260> a<00:01:47.290> way<00:01:47.500> kind<00:01:47.860> of<00:01:47.920> like<00:01:48.070> the

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
kind of way with a way kind of like the

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.930 
kind of way with a way kind of like the
way<00:01:48.340> your<00:01:49.080> rear<00:01:50.080> wheel<00:01:50.620> is<00:01:50.830> driven<00:01:51.100> if<00:01:51.610> any

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
way your rear wheel is driven if any

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.090 
way your rear wheel is driven if any
link<00:01:52.330> in<00:01:52.480> your<00:01:52.600> chain<00:01:52.660> is<00:01:53.020> gone<00:01:53.260> you<00:01:53.830> can't

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
link in your chain is gone you can't

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.610 
link in your chain is gone you can't
drive<00:01:54.370> that<00:01:54.550> rear<00:01:54.880> wheel<00:01:55.230> so<00:01:56.230> as<00:01:57.330> accident<00:01:58.330> was

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
drive that rear wheel so as accident was

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.190 
drive that rear wheel so as accident was
to<00:01:59.620> minimize<00:02:00.070> or<00:02:00.460> reduce<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.750> chances<00:02:02.110> of

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
to minimize or reduce the chances of

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.160 
to minimize or reduce the chances of
accident<00:02:02.800> you<00:02:03.400> minimize<00:02:03.820> as<00:02:04.150> many<00:02:04.660> links<00:02:04.930> of

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
accident you minimize as many links of

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.740 
accident you minimize as many links of
those<00:02:05.350> as<00:02:06.040> you<00:02:06.250> can<00:02:06.460> as<00:02:07.240> possible<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:09.750> prevent

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
those as you can as possible to prevent

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.140 
those as you can as possible to prevent
you<00:02:10.990> from<00:02:11.020> being<00:02:11.380> linked<00:02:11.710> to<00:02:11.770> that<00:02:11.860> to<00:02:12.820> a<00:02:12.850> crash

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
you from being linked to that to a crash

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.980 
you from being linked to that to a crash
or<00:02:13.590> okay<00:02:14.590> right<00:02:15.100> yeah<00:02:15.940> does<00:02:16.660> that<00:02:16.780> make<00:02:16.960> sense

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
or okay right yeah does that make sense

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.850 
or okay right yeah does that make sense
did<00:02:17.950> I<00:02:18.010> say<00:02:18.160> that<00:02:18.190> right<00:02:19.500> that<00:02:20.500> is<00:02:20.680> actually

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
did I say that right that is actually

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:37.110 
did I say that right that is actually
Disneyland<00:02:21.790> that's<00:02:22.209> not<00:02:22.540> knots

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.600 

so<00:02:37.720> you<00:02:37.780> minimize<00:02:38.260> there's<00:02:39.159> certain<00:02:39.580> things

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
so you minimize there's certain things

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.220 
so you minimize there's certain things
in<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.090> lit<00:02:40.269> there<00:02:40.480> are<00:02:40.569> certain<00:02:40.870> links<00:02:41.080> you

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
in the lit there are certain links you

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.789 
in the lit there are certain links you
can't<00:02:41.549> control<00:02:42.549> like<00:02:43.060> you<00:02:43.530> know<00:02:44.530> road

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
can't control like you know road

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.979 
can't control like you know road
conditions<00:02:45.400> whether<00:02:46.440> stuff<00:02:47.440> like<00:02:47.620> that<00:02:47.970> so

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
conditions whether stuff like that so

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.720 
conditions whether stuff like that so
the<00:02:49.989> things<00:02:50.260> you<00:02:50.470> do<00:02:50.680> you<00:02:50.980> can<00:02:51.220> control<00:02:51.580> is

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
the things you do you can control is

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.490 
the things you do you can control is
like<00:02:51.940> you<00:02:52.150> know<00:02:52.180> you're<00:02:52.480> right<00:02:52.659> or<00:02:52.810> skill<00:02:53.049> you

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
like you know you're right or skill you

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.600 
like you know you're right or skill you
could<00:02:53.680> practice<00:02:54.129> certain<00:02:54.430> things<00:02:56.459> stuff<00:02:57.459> like

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
could practice certain things stuff like

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.369 
could practice certain things stuff like
that<00:02:58.650> so<00:02:59.650> one<00:03:00.220> of<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.810> two<00:03:01.810> males<00:03:02.110> worse

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:02.379 
that so one of the two males worse

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:07.619 
that so one of the two males worse
asking<00:03:05.459> what's<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.519> low<00:03:06.730> side<00:03:07.000> and<00:03:07.390> what's

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
asking what's the low side and what's

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.530 
asking what's the low side and what's
the<00:03:07.750> high<00:03:07.870> side

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:21.580 

so<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:13.459> low<00:03:13.640> side<00:03:13.939> a<00:03:19.540> low<00:03:20.540> side<00:03:20.810> is<00:03:20.959> when<00:03:21.140> you

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
so the low side a low side is when you

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.539 
so the low side a low side is when you
lose<00:03:21.799> traction<00:03:22.099> and<00:03:23.319> your<00:03:24.319> motorcycle<00:03:25.040> slides

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
lose traction and your motorcycle slides

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:31.270 
lose traction and your motorcycle slides
out<00:03:25.760> from<00:03:25.819> underneath<00:03:26.299> you<00:03:29.980> ironically<00:03:30.980> of

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
out from underneath you ironically of

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.089 
out from underneath you ironically of
the<00:03:32.030> two<00:03:32.180> crashes<00:03:32.450> that<00:03:32.780> I<00:03:32.840> had<00:03:33.049> that<00:03:33.379> I<00:03:33.650> was

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
the two crashes that I had that I was
