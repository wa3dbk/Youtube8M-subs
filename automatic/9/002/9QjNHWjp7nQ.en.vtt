Oh

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.160 

got<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.060> ferry<00:02:11.300> water<00:02:11.540> all<00:02:11.750> because<00:02:11.930> of<00:02:11.959> the

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
got the ferry water all because of the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.410 
got the ferry water all because of the
controller<00:02:12.590> but

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.430 

as<00:02:16.420> you<00:02:16.510> can<00:02:16.629> see<00:02:16.750> in<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.930> top<00:02:17.080> left<00:02:17.110> and

as you can see in the top left and
courses<00:02:18.569> FPS<00:02:19.569> 30<00:02:19.900> frames<00:02:20.349> per<00:02:20.440> second<00:02:21.010> so<00:02:21.160> I

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
courses FPS 30 frames per second so I

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.979 
courses FPS 30 frames per second so I
mean<00:02:21.910> it's<00:02:22.030> running<00:02:22.269> at<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:22.390> hundred<00:02:22.599> percent

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
mean it's running at a hundred percent

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.970 
mean it's running at a hundred percent
all<00:02:23.200> my<00:02:23.440> system<00:02:23.890> my<00:02:24.160> system<00:02:25.090> is<00:02:25.540> I<00:02:26.230> made<00:02:26.860> it

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
all my system my system is I made it

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.259 
all my system my system is I made it
pretty<00:02:27.099> well<00:02:28.200> I'm<00:02:29.200> gonna<00:02:29.349> turn<00:02:29.800> this<00:02:29.890> down<00:02:30.269> but

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
pretty well I'm gonna turn this down but

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.870 
pretty well I'm gonna turn this down but
uh<00:02:31.330> I<00:02:32.970> took<00:02:33.970> a<00:02:34.000> little<00:02:34.180> screenshot<00:02:34.840> just<00:02:35.080> of<00:02:35.560> uh

uh I took a little screenshot just of uh

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.940 
uh I took a little screenshot just of uh
my<00:02:36.880> systems<00:02:37.330> performance<00:02:38.019> specs<00:02:38.319> as<00:02:38.650> far<00:02:38.830> as

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
my systems performance specs as far as

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.979 
my systems performance specs as far as
windows<00:02:39.280> rates<00:02:39.519> it<00:02:39.730> that's<00:02:40.420> out<00:02:40.599> of<00:02:40.630> seven

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
windows rates it that's out of seven

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.930 
windows rates it that's out of seven
point<00:02:41.230> nine<00:02:41.260> so<00:02:41.650> I<00:02:41.680> mean<00:02:41.890> my<00:02:42.010> frosted<00:02:42.580> Ram<00:02:42.760> are

my PC u SH is only like 50% Rams at 25 I
got<00:02:57.849> eight<00:02:58.060> gigs<00:02:58.360> of<00:02:58.540> RAM<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.920> only<00:03:00.069> bad<00:03:00.459> side

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
got eight gigs of RAM the only bad side

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.270 
got eight gigs of RAM the only bad side
to<00:03:00.910> this<00:03:01.030> thing<00:03:01.299> that<00:03:01.420> I<00:03:01.510> have<00:03:01.660> right<00:03:01.840> now<00:03:01.870> is<00:03:02.110> a

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
to this thing that I have right now is a

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.940 
to this thing that I have right now is a
pretty<00:03:03.280> crappy<00:03:03.549> video<00:03:04.000> card<00:03:04.470> it's<00:03:05.470> a<00:03:05.620> fifty

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
pretty crappy video card it's a fifty

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.440 
pretty crappy video card it's a fifty
nine<00:03:05.980> hundred<00:03:06.400> GT<00:03:06.730> out<00:03:06.760> of<00:03:06.970> my<00:03:07.120> brother's

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
nine hundred GT out of my brother's

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.569 
nine hundred GT out of my brother's
computer<00:03:07.630> it's<00:03:07.930> that<00:03:08.079> wise<00:03:08.230> out<00:03:08.530> to<00:03:08.650> see<00:03:08.890> as

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
computer it's that wise out to see as

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:10.740 
computer it's that wise out to see as
soon<00:03:09.760> as<00:03:09.880> he<00:03:10.030> gets<00:03:10.150> back<00:03:10.269> though<00:03:10.630> I'll

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
soon as he gets back though I'll

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.979 
soon as he gets back though I'll
probably<00:03:10.989> end<00:03:11.200> up<00:03:11.319> investing<00:03:11.829> into<00:03:12.370> like<00:03:12.579> a

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
probably end up investing into like a

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.690 
probably end up investing into like a
g-force<00:03:14.010> 550<00:03:16.110> so<00:03:17.110> those<00:03:17.349> are<00:03:17.470> like<00:03:17.680> not<00:03:18.459> too

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
g-force 550 so those are like not too

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.180 
g-force 550 so those are like not too
reason<00:03:19.000> to<00:03:19.090> be<00:03:19.209> priced<00:03:19.510> like<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.410> 140<00:03:21.069> or

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
reason to be priced like the 140 or

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.530 
reason to be priced like the 140 or
something<00:03:21.400> like<00:03:21.459> that<00:03:21.549> but<00:03:21.970> it's<00:03:22.090> like<00:03:22.150> a<00:03:22.239> gig

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
something like that but it's like a gig

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.349 
something like that but it's like a gig
of<00:03:22.720> memory<00:03:22.930> and<00:03:23.430> it's<00:03:24.430> just<00:03:24.549> a<00:03:24.730> lot<00:03:24.850> better<00:03:25.060> are

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
of memory and it's just a lot better are

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:29.490 
of memory and it's just a lot better are
well<00:03:26.170> off<00:03:26.319> as<00:03:27.190> you<00:03:27.310> see<00:03:27.569> I'm<00:03:28.569> playing<00:03:28.810> a<00:03:28.989> game<00:03:29.200> I

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
well off as you see I'm playing a game I

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.379 
well off as you see I'm playing a game I
mean<00:03:30.400> I<00:03:30.489> don't<00:03:30.549> know<00:03:30.700> how<00:03:30.819> much<00:03:31.000> more<00:03:31.239> I<00:03:31.299> can

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389 
mean I don't know how much more I can

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.020 
mean I don't know how much more I can
really<00:03:31.780> try<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:32.709> make<00:03:32.889> this<00:03:33.190> thing<00:03:33.430> not<00:03:33.790> work

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
really try and make this thing not work

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.530 
really try and make this thing not work
as<00:03:34.239> well<00:03:34.530> but<00:03:35.530> uh<00:03:35.700> I'll<00:03:36.700> show<00:03:36.910> you<00:03:37.000> fullscreen

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
as well but uh I'll show you fullscreen

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.699 
as well but uh I'll show you fullscreen
that's<00:03:37.810> no<00:03:37.900> time<00:03:38.139> it<00:03:38.230> really<00:03:38.319> slows<00:03:38.620> and

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
that's no time it really slows and

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.110 
that's no time it really slows and
that's<00:03:38.859> only<00:03:39.100> because<00:03:39.310> of<00:03:39.489> the<00:03:39.639> video<00:03:39.880> card

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
that's only because of the video card

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.120 
that's only because of the video card
it's<00:03:41.079> uh<00:03:42.750> see<00:03:43.750> right<00:03:44.079> now<00:03:44.200> I'm<00:03:44.290> at<00:03:44.410> 16<00:03:44.889> frames

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
it's uh see right now I'm at 16 frames

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.330 
it's uh see right now I'm at 16 frames
per<00:03:45.400> second<00:03:45.850> so<00:03:46.139> it's<00:03:47.139> like<00:03:47.380> half<00:03:47.769> of<00:03:48.010> what<00:03:48.190> it

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
per second so it's like half of what it

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.940 
per second so it's like half of what it
was<00:03:48.370> but<00:03:48.970> it<00:03:49.239> looks<00:03:49.870> awesome<00:03:50.079> all<00:03:50.500> my<00:03:50.620> 50-inch

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
was but it looks awesome all my 50-inch

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.710 
was but it looks awesome all my 50-inch
Samsung<00:03:53.730> too<00:03:54.730> bad<00:03:54.880> it's<00:03:55.000> so<00:03:55.030> slow

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
Samsung too bad it's so slow
