00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:06.580
 very good to everyone in this video os 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:09.510
 I bring how to customize our acer 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:13.030
 iconia 3 as you will know there is not much 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.320
 support for this tablet but with some 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.590
 few can customize the apps 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:21.329
 pretty good the first of all 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.329
 we will show foot control 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.100
 as you see is to put the buttons here 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.760
 to the sides 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:37.230
 it serves for example if we want to use 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.649
 there is a bar that is to put in mode 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.649
 fullscreen 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.329
 let's hope it loads that it takes a 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.329
 little while 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.220
 as you can see and that's how we have the buttons here 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.220
 as well 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:06.870
 good another one of them is x owns 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.870
 we download it from the lawsuit we install it 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.840
 and we go to framework 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.350
 here we give you install and update myself 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.100
 I already have it 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:26.500
 then we restart the tablet 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.500
 let's module have download 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.640
 and we look for this one that you see here the gravity 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.400
 box 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.400
 you have to put jb deliver 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.870
 although there is also one kit kat but 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.390
 that is not valid for our 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.750
 once downloaded 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.000
 we go to modules and you see that it is marked 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.620
 with a tick because you leave it the same 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.710
 we restart the tablet 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.360
 and we are going to 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.360
 in gravity box we open it 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:09.009
 you see there are countless things there are some 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:12.640
 that do not go for example 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.340
 this extended desktop you see him 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.370
 we give a trap 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.739
 but hey you can be removed just see 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.030
 lock screen for example apps from 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.030
 the blocking cni 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.270
 and then if you look, I have 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.980
 transparency as it indicates because that is 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.590
 do here 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:37.900
 in transparency settings and we leave it 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:40.440
 well 66% or so we all reset and 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.440
 Will apply 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.760
 good and this is all 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.739
 I do not have to say it takes 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:56.610
 be rod for all these things is worth 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:03:02.030
 I did it with super one click 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.030
 okay, come on, thank you, see you later
