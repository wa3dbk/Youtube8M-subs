00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
yeah we've got there a good side very

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.690 
yeah we've got there a good side very
solid<00:01:55.610> and<00:01:56.420> organized<00:01:56.840> but<00:01:57.020> now<00:01:57.170> yeah<00:01:57.380> and<00:01:57.700> the

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
solid and organized but now yeah and the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.330 
solid and organized but now yeah and the
guff<00:01:58.850> is<00:01:59.000> coming<00:01:59.360> then<00:01:59.450> he's<00:01:59.710> slow<00:02:00.710> it's

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
guff is coming then he's slow it's

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.380 
guff is coming then he's slow it's
caused<00:02:01.520> me<00:02:01.670> other<00:02:01.789> than<00:02:01.880> what<00:02:02.030> we<00:02:02.090> want<00:02:02.240> to<00:02:02.299> do

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
caused me other than what we want to do

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.539 
caused me other than what we want to do
so<00:02:02.929> i<00:02:03.110> guess<00:02:03.350> first<00:02:03.500> job<00:02:03.740> is<00:02:03.860> trying<00:02:04.250> to<00:02:04.340> break

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
so i guess first job is trying to break

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:05.800 
so i guess first job is trying to break
that<00:02:04.729> to<00:02:04.939> that<00:02:05.060> team<00:02:05.270> for<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:05.450> opening<00:02:05.750> game

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
that to that team for the opening game

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.620 
that to that team for the opening game
on<00:02:06.170> saturday<00:02:06.799> yeah<00:02:07.250> we're<00:02:07.490> obviously<00:02:07.820> it'd<00:02:08.509> be

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
on saturday yeah we're obviously it'd be

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.620 
on saturday yeah we're obviously it'd be
nice<00:02:08.780> to<00:02:08.810> get<00:02:08.989> a<00:02:09.050> win<00:02:09.229> but<00:02:09.410> i<00:02:09.500> think<00:02:10.599> the<00:02:11.599> most

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
nice to get a win but i think the most

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.030 
nice to get a win but i think the most
important<00:02:12.110> thing<00:02:12.140> is<00:02:12.319> going<00:02:12.470> to<00:02:12.560> my<00:02:12.650> direction

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
important thing is going to my direction

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.729 
important thing is going to my direction
didn't<00:02:13.370> I<00:02:13.400> mean<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:14.050> when<00:02:15.050> I<00:02:15.140> leaves<00:02:15.410> as<00:02:15.620> long

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
didn't I mean and when I leaves as long

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:16.990 
didn't I mean and when I leaves as long
as<00:02:15.830> we<00:02:15.920> got<00:02:16.010> in<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.220> right<00:02:16.370> direction<00:02:16.519> was

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
as we got in the right direction was

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.150 
as we got in the right direction was
it's<00:02:17.120> not<00:02:17.299> just<00:02:17.480> based<00:02:17.750> on<00:02:17.870> one<00:02:18.049> game<00:02:18.260> it's<00:02:19.100> a

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
it's not just based on one game it's a

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.800 
it's not just based on one game it's a
