00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.380
 pro evolution on the famous simulator 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.150
 of football of the company konami returns to 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.190
 one more season with a new delivery 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.170
 loaded with great news and with the 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.430
 firm intention to recover his throne 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.430
 as the best game of the genre 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.180
 centered we tell you that the juice is 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.310
 being developed on this occasion by 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.080
 the 'boxing day' nothing less than the same 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.150
 graphic engine created by kojima 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.540
 productions paramedia the sun 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.040
 5 this will be noticed especially in the 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.600
 animations and control of 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.340
 players as well as in any 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.260
 kinematics that we see during the 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.510
 matches having each of the 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.890
 players modeling and especially about 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.890
 Faces more real than ever 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.440
 in this sense pro evolution on the 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.449
 2014 plays its gameplay in several 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.579
 key characteristics that define the 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.379
 gaming experience starting with the 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.180
 incorporation of truecolor technology 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.490
 with which the ball is completely 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.920
 independent of the player with covers 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.229
 the spherical much more similar 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.210
 to that of a real ball this adds 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.920
 also more freedom to movements 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.259
 of the players allowing the user 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.600
 handle the ball just everything 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.500
 related to the touches the passes or 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.500
 the shots on goal 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.979
 this technology is also accompanied 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.110
 for a new animation system 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.119
 called murcia a division stability 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.070
 which focuses mostly on realism 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.810
 of physics simulating contact 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.549
 body and the collisions between 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.830
 players taking into account elements 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.720
 as the direction the speed and the 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.700
 amount of force that is used 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.590
 during an entry while trying to steal the 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.479
 ball having to stand out in this 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.310
 aspect of the game also makes use of the 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.310
 famous physics engine please 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.490
 similarly we will also have a new 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.560
 system called card or what is it 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.210
 same heart in our language with the 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.220
 that the greatest realism is sought in the 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.110
 emotions of the players and in showing 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.970
 the passion for football of each trade 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.950
 something that will affect especially the 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.020
 teams that play away from home against 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.230
 the local public booing them at the same time 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.030
 try to encourage your own team like 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.010
 This system aims to recreate 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.900
 the influence of the hobby of both 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.970
 individual form for each player in 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.590
 concrete as for the entire team already 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.750
 that each player possess their own 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.880
 mental attributes that can be seen 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.830
 negatively affected if they feel 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.810
 intimidated while the inverse 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.730
 will have a positive effect on a 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.270
 team that is being encouraged by its 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.270
 local hobby 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.159
 For its part, the game recovers 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.739
 called psy we saw in pro 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:49.569
 evolution soccer '2013 which reproduces 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.700
 in a personalized way the style of 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.170
 I play the way to run and even the 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.969
 dribbling and celebrations 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.920
 characteristics of certain 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:03:00.040
 footballers we will recognize 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.750
 immediately weakened in 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.459
 this new edition the number of large 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.230
 stars that will have their own 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.859
 artificial intelligence animations 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.859
 only 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.720
 also pro evolution soccer '2014 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.030
 also has improvements in the system 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.709
 of tactics thanks to the so-called team 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.780
 play is to say team play 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.239
 allowing the user to configure 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.400
 various tactics in full match zones 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.560
 keys of the village land using by 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.180
 example three or more players to try 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.159
 to take advantage of gaps in defense 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.879
 rival not to surround our 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:32.879
 opponents 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.860
 In the same way there will also be changes in 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.540
 the sevens shots and the penalties for 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.670
 increase our options on 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.950
 set pieces specifically 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.020
 the control over the shots and the is has 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.120
 expanded with careers of distraction and 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.890
 new short passes while the 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.930
 criminals to socialize I must act 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.040
 to tell that also depending on 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.040
 the ability of a challenger 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.560
 and finally with respect to 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.910
 clubs and competitions with the 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.980
 official science the game would have 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.170
 increased its number by adding if by 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.480
 first time the champions league in addition 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.490
 if the exclusive use of the 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.010
 uefa champions league among many others 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.080
 tournaments more like the liberators cup the 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.060
 South American Cup as well as several leagues 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.190
 European in which of course no 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.930
 will miss Spanish with all their equipment 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.670
 of the entire first division 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.810
 making also that adding other 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.810
 leagues of the American continent 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.720
 pro evolution soccer '2014 will be launched 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.930
 end of next September 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.669
 estimated platforms Xbox 360 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.740
 playstation3 and psp 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:41.139
 It is not foreseen that this edition of the 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.000
 game arrives at the new xbox consoles 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.979
 one to playstation 4 so very 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.630
 possibly we should wait for the 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:48.130
 next year's edition so that the 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.250
 saga give the jump to the next 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.250
 generation
