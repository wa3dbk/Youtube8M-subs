DNA when it comes to racing they started
making<00:00:49.129> cars<00:00:49.429> back<00:00:49.730> in<00:00:49.879> 1910<00:00:50.480> and<00:00:50.780> that<00:00:51.289> very

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:51.499 
making cars back in 1910 and that very

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:53.680 
making cars back in 1910 and that very
next<00:00:51.710> year<00:00:51.829> they<00:00:52.609> won<00:00:52.819> their<00:00:52.969> first<00:00:53.030> race<00:00:53.480> and

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
next year they won their first race and

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.360 
next year they won their first race and
since<00:00:53.929> then<00:00:54.109> they've<00:00:54.289> won<00:00:54.319> over<00:00:55.069> a<00:00:55.100> dozen

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370

since then they've won over a dozen
world<00:00:55.699> championships<00:00:56.300> so<00:00:56.480> it's<00:00:56.960> safe<00:00:57.199> to<00:00:57.319> say

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
world championships so it's safe to say

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.430 
world championships so it's safe to say
that<00:00:57.829> racing<00:00:58.699> is<00:00:58.789> an<00:00:59.030> alpha<00:00:59.329> males<00:00:59.600> DNA<00:00:59.870> and

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
that racing is an alpha males DNA and

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.649 
that racing is an alpha males DNA and

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.300 
to a little more of the regular America
and<00:04:56.169> I<00:04:56.440> think<00:04:56.650> they're<00:04:56.740> gonna<00:04:56.860> do<00:04:57.070> it

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
and I think they're gonna do it

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
so at sixty $3,900 that sounds like a

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:01.409 
so at sixty $3,900 that sounds like a
lot<00:05:00.160> of<00:05:00.190> monies<00:05:00.550> but<00:05:00.729> you<00:05:00.849> can<00:05:00.970> compare<00:05:01.270> it<00:05:01.389> to

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
lot of monies but you can compare it to

lot of monies but you can compare it to
a<00:05:01.539> Boxster<00:05:02.380> for<00:05:02.770> example<00:05:03.190> but<00:05:03.729> consider<00:05:04.240> it's

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
a Boxster for example but consider it's
