 more time instead ink companies 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.970
 ability with evil that can not 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.890
 to avoid some companies are very

 the ueg to the episode also member of rspo 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.700
 doubt that the system does any 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.479

 left and the worst is in progress 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.060
 continuous and companies with for not 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.280
 adjusted 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.290
 I am today bad behaviors of the past is 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.290
