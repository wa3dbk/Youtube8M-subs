use transitions in css3 to smooth out

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.530 
use transitions in css3 to smooth out
your<00:00:06.629> animation<00:00:07.470> effects<00:00:07.770> so<00:00:08.519> normally<00:00:09.030> when

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
your animation effects so normally when

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.660 
your animation effects so normally when
you<00:00:09.780> animate<00:00:10.200> something<00:00:10.740> like<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:11.099> hover<00:00:11.370> the

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
you animate something like a hover the

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.060 
you animate something like a hover the
animation<00:00:12.330> happens<00:00:12.780> immediately<00:00:13.080> if<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:13.830> roll

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
animation happens immediately if I roll

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.379 
animation happens immediately if I roll
over<00:00:14.280> this<00:00:14.400> link<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:14.670> can<00:00:14.759> see<00:00:15.030> that<00:00:15.059> the

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
over this link you can see that the

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.840 
over this link you can see that the
animation<00:00:15.870> happens<00:00:16.529> right<00:00:16.770> away<00:00:16.980> now<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.460> can

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
animation happens right away now I can

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.150 
animation happens right away now I can
improve<00:00:18.180> on<00:00:18.359> that<00:00:18.390> by<00:00:18.869> using<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.470> simple<00:00:19.800> CSS

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
improve on that by using a simple CSS

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.519 
improve on that by using a simple CSS
transition<00:00:21.029> it's<00:00:21.420> really<00:00:21.900> one<00:00:22.140> line<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.350> code

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
transition it's really one line of code

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.890 
transition it's really one line of code
so<00:00:23.279> for<00:00:23.460> example<00:00:23.550> when<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:24.300> roll<00:00:24.510> over<00:00:24.750> these

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
so for example when I roll over these

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.269 
so for example when I roll over these
menus<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.410> can<00:00:25.529> see<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.740> there's<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.039> little

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
menus you can see that there's a little

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.220 
menus you can see that there's a little
bit<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.670> delay<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.269> there's<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.840> little<00:00:28.080> bit

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
bit of a delay and there's a little bit

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.200 
bit of a delay and there's a little bit
of<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.439> smoother<00:00:28.830> animation<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.760> can<00:00:29.820> use<00:00:30.060> that

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
of a smoother animation you can use that

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.240 
of a smoother animation you can use that
same<00:00:30.570> single<00:00:31.109> line<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.380> code<00:00:31.529> it's<00:00:32.070> going<00:00:32.189> to

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
same single line of code it's going to

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.770 
same single line of code it's going to
help<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.460> improve<00:00:32.730> things<00:00:33.000> like<00:00:33.210> responsive

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
which means the photo at the very top is

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.069 
which means the photo at the very top is
changing<00:00:40.920> size<00:00:41.190> but<00:00:41.670> as<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.420> changes<00:00:42.840> sighs

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
changing size but as it changes sighs

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.900 
changing size but as it changes sighs
it's<00:00:43.440> just<00:00:43.620> kind<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.860> smoothly<00:00:44.190> animating

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
it's just kind of smoothly animating

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.330 
it's just kind of smoothly animating
into<00:00:45.210> position<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:46.230> can<00:00:46.350> also<00:00:46.500> use<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:47.039> do

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
into position you can also use it to do

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.459 
into position you can also use it to do
a<00:00:47.370> peak<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.090> effect<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:49.260> particular

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
a peak in effect so in this particular

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.069 
a peak in effect so in this particular
channel<00:00:50.219> or<00:00:50.370> category<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.059> my<00:00:51.149> website<00:00:51.600> when<00:00:52.050> I

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
channel or category of my website when I

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.840 
channel or category of my website when I
roll<00:00:52.410> over<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:52.800> image<00:00:53.190> it's<00:00:53.399> going<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.640> make

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
roll over this image it's going to make

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.790 
roll over this image it's going to make
the<00:00:53.969> image<00:00:54.300> bigger<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:55.199> when<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.350> leave<00:00:55.590> that

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
the image bigger so when I leave that

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.470 
the image bigger so when I leave that
it'll<00:00:56.160> make<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.399> smaller<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.940> that's<00:00:57.329> a

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
it'll make it smaller and that's a

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.450 
it'll make it smaller and that's a
pretty<00:00:57.629> cool<00:00:57.840> effect<00:00:58.230> it's<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.710> same<00:00:59.010> line<00:00:59.280> of

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
pretty cool effect it's the same line of

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.150 
pretty cool effect it's the same line of
code<00:00:59.670> applied<00:01:00.210> in<00:01:00.510> different<00:01:01.079> places<00:01:01.500> so

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
code applied in different places so

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.770 
code applied in different places so
let's<00:01:02.280> take<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.460> look<00:01:02.609> at<00:01:02.699> how<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.879> do<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.270> so

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
let's take a look at how you do that so

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.289 
let's take a look at how you do that so
I've<00:01:04.110> got<00:01:04.290> my<00:01:04.320> div<00:01:05.220> right<00:01:05.460> here<00:01:05.820> right<00:01:06.090> now<00:01:06.119> the

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
I've got my div right here right now the

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.420 
I've got my div right here right now the
style<00:01:06.840> doesn't<00:01:07.080> have<00:01:07.320> anything<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.340> I'm

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
style doesn't have anything in it so I'm

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.580 
style doesn't have anything in it so I'm
going<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.580> start<00:01:08.670> off<00:01:08.970> by<00:01:09.000> creating<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:10.020> style

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
going to start off by creating a style

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.370 
going to start off by creating a style
that<00:01:10.799> just<00:01:11.369> calls<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:12.000> ID<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.750> then<00:01:13.320> I'm

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
that just calls that ID and then I'm

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.080 
that just calls that ID and then I'm
going<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.530> just<00:01:13.680> call<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.040> background<00:01:14.520> URL

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
going to just call the background URL

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.899 
going to just call the background URL
here<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.810> type<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.130> location<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.729> my

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
here and type in the location of my

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.190 
here and type in the location of my
image<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.509> was<00:01:18.570> not<00:01:18.689> going<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.869> show<00:01:19.049> up

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
image that was not going to show up

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.560 
image that was not going to show up
until<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.530> give<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:20.070> height<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:21.060> my<00:01:21.390> height

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
until I give this a height so my height

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.480 
until I give this a height so my height
is<00:01:21.720> going<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:21.960> be<00:01:22.049> 200<00:01:22.560> pixels<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.040> start<00:01:23.310> with

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
is going to be 200 pixels to start with

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.450 
is going to be 200 pixels to start with
and<00:01:23.700> i'll<00:01:24.479> give<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.780> width<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.320> one<00:01:26.280> hundred

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
and i'll give it a width of one hundred

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.640 
and i'll give it a width of one hundred
percent<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:27.600> way<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.869> will<00:01:27.930> be<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.259> width<00:01:28.470> of

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
percent that way it will be the width of

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.039 
percent that way it will be the width of
my<00:01:28.740> window<00:01:29.340> i<00:01:29.670> want<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.390> image<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.780> be

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
my window i want this image to be

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.350 
my window i want this image to be
centered<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:32.280> div<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:32.729> i<00:01:32.759> can<00:01:32.939> do<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.090> by

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
centered in that div so i can do that by

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.870 
centered in that div so i can do that by
using<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:34.290> background<00:01:34.860> position<00:01:35.369> attribute

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
using the background position attribute

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.240 
using the background position attribute
just<00:01:36.090> set<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.570> fifty<00:01:36.930> percent<00:01:37.320> by<00:01:37.680> fifty

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
just set that to fifty percent by fifty

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.770 
just set that to fifty percent by fifty
percent<00:01:38.430> that'll<00:01:39.180> center<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.600> both

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
percent that'll center it both

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.380 
percent that'll center it both
vertically<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.350> horizontally<00:01:40.579> and<00:01:41.579> then<00:01:42.270> i'm

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
vertically and horizontally and then i'm

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.450 
vertically and horizontally and then i'm
going<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.570> do<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.960> hover<00:01:43.320> effect<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:44.070> all

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
going to do a hover effect on this all

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.639 
going to do a hover effect on this all
i'm<00:01:44.520> going<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.700> just<00:01:44.850> change<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.329> high<00:01:45.479> 2<00:01:45.649> 340

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
i'm going to just change the high 2 340

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.800 
i'm going to just change the high 2 340
pixels<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.189> lot<00:01:47.670> bigger<00:01:47.909> when<00:01:48.030> somebody<00:01:48.540> rolls

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
pixels a lot bigger when somebody rolls

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.420 
pixels a lot bigger when somebody rolls
over<00:01:49.079> this<00:01:49.320> image<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:50.040> when<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.250> roll<00:01:50.399> over

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
over this image so when you roll over

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.760 
over this image so when you roll over
the<00:01:50.759> image<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.360> image<00:01:51.390> gets<00:01:51.960> bigger<00:01:52.170> that's<00:01:52.649> a

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
the image the image gets bigger that's a

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.109 
the image the image gets bigger that's a
really<00:01:53.009> cool<00:01:53.159> effect<00:01:53.250> but<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.670> really<00:01:53.850> could

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
really cool effect but it really could

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.999 
really cool effect but it really could
be<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.420> lot<00:01:54.630> better<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.140> we<00:01:55.229> can<00:01:55.409> do<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.710> with

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
be a lot better and we can do that with

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.069 
be a lot better and we can do that with
a<00:01:56.040> single<00:01:56.610> line<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.790> code<00:01:56.939> i'm<00:01:57.509> using<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.869> web

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
a single line of code i'm using a web

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.910 
a single line of code i'm using a web
browser<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.920> what<00:01:59.130> I'll<00:01:59.219> do<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.399> use<00:02:00.210> WebKit

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
browser so what I'll do is use WebKit

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.880 
browser so what I'll do is use WebKit
transition<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.329> here<00:02:03.329> i<00:02:03.420> can<00:02:03.689> type<00:02:03.869> in<00:02:04.140> four

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
transition and here i can type in four

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.590 
transition and here i can type in four
different<00:02:05.040> values<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:06.060> first<00:02:06.329> one<00:02:06.479> I'm<00:02:06.570> going

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
different values the first one I'm going

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.130 
different values the first one I'm going
to<00:02:06.719> type<00:02:06.899> is<00:02:07.140> all<00:02:07.320> then<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.099> will<00:02:08.489> do<00:02:09.140> 0.3

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
to type is all then I will do 0.3

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.559 
to type is all then I will do 0.3
seconds<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:11.039> ease<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.090> will<00:02:12.239> be<00:02:12.360> my

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
seconds and ease that will be my

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.820 
seconds and ease that will be my
transformation<00:02:13.349> timing

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
transformation timing

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.860 
transformation timing
function<00:02:14.100> so<00:02:14.520> when<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.700> do<00:02:14.790> that<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.480> come<00:02:15.690> over

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
function so when I do that and come over

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.200 
function so when I do that and come over
here<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.260> now<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:16.770> animation<00:02:17.550> happens<00:02:17.940> but

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
here and now the animation happens but

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.930 
here and now the animation happens but
it<00:02:18.420> happens<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.990> lot<00:02:19.260> smoother<00:02:19.770> so<00:02:20.190> I<00:02:20.220> can<00:02:20.640> make

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
it happens a lot smoother so I can make

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.550 
it happens a lot smoother so I can make
sure<00:02:20.970> that<00:02:21.120> this<00:02:21.570> works<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.110> as<00:02:22.410> many

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
sure that this works and as many

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.320 
sure that this works and as many
browsers<00:02:22.830> as<00:02:23.160> possible<00:02:23.640> just<00:02:23.670> by<00:02:23.880> copying

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
browsers as possible just by copying

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.020 
browsers as possible just by copying
this<00:02:24.540> so<00:02:25.290> I'll<00:02:25.380> paste<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:25.800> a<00:02:25.860> few<00:02:26.040> times<00:02:26.100> the

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
this so I'll paste it a few times the

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.850 
this so I'll paste it a few times the
actual<00:02:27.180> properties<00:02:27.750> is<00:02:27.930> transition<00:02:28.560> but

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
actual properties is transition but

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
actual properties is transition but
we'll<00:02:28.980> make<00:02:29.100> sure<00:02:29.160> it<00:02:29.400> works<00:02:29.610> with<00:02:29.850> opera<00:02:30.780> as

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
we'll make sure it works with opera as

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.730 
we'll make sure it works with opera as
well<00:02:32.880> as<00:02:33.060> Mozilla<00:02:33.600> there's<00:02:34.320> a<00:02:34.410> few<00:02:34.590> options

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
well as Mozilla there's a few options

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.700 
well as Mozilla there's a few options
you<00:02:35.040> can<00:02:35.160> do<00:02:35.400> here<00:02:35.970> as<00:02:36.090> well<00:02:36.270> so<00:02:36.930> for<00:02:37.170> example<00:02:37.230> i

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
you can do here as well so for example i

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.400 
you can do here as well so for example i
can<00:02:37.950> add<00:02:38.130> another<00:02:38.790> value<00:02:39.690> right<00:02:39.900> here<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.290> i'll

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
can add another value right here so i'll

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.400 
can add another value right here so i'll
add<00:02:40.590> one<00:02:40.980> s<00:02:41.220> for<00:02:41.580> one<00:02:41.880> second<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:42.390> that<00:02:43.200> will

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
add one s for one second and that will

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.410 
add one s for one second and that will
add<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.620> delay<00:02:43.950> so<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.490> transition<00:02:44.970> doesn't

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
add a delay so the transition doesn't

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.570 
add a delay so the transition doesn't
happen<00:02:45.540> right<00:02:45.690> away<00:02:45.840> but<00:02:46.110> after<00:02:46.890> a<00:02:46.920> one-second

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
happen right away but after a one-second

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.490 
happen right away but after a one-second
delay<00:02:47.640> by<00:02:48.150> adding<00:02:48.480> this<00:02:48.600> transition<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.350> the

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
delay by adding this transition to the

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.260 
delay by adding this transition to the
original<00:02:49.950> diff<00:02:50.220> it's<00:02:50.820> going<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.030> make<00:02:51.180> the

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
original diff it's going to make the

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.120 
original diff it's going to make the
transition<00:02:51.420> happen<00:02:52.110> when<00:02:52.380> somebody<00:02:52.620> hovers

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
transition happen when somebody hovers

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.000 
transition happen when somebody hovers
over<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.970> image<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.720> when<00:02:55.440> somebody<00:02:55.740> hovers

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
over the image and when somebody hovers

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.620 
over the image and when somebody hovers
out<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.520> image<00:02:56.820> so<00:02:57.000> it's<00:02:57.120> happening<00:02:57.420> twice

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
out of the image so it's happening twice

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.110 
out of the image so it's happening twice
that<00:02:58.170> is<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:59.040> little<00:02:59.310> bit<00:02:59.459> of<00:02:59.670> knowing<00:02:59.910> so<00:03:00.030> I'm

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
that is a little bit of knowing so I'm

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.360 
that is a little bit of knowing so I'm
going<00:03:00.240> to<00:03:00.300> take<00:03:00.390> that<00:03:00.540> out<00:03:00.830> so<00:03:01.830> your<00:03:01.950> options

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
going to take that out so your options

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.030 
going to take that out so your options
here<00:03:02.730> are<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.300> transition<00:03:04.020> property<00:03:04.530> which

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
here are the transition property which

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.890 
here are the transition property which
if<00:03:05.280> you<00:03:05.610> want<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:05.850> animate<00:03:06.150> everything<00:03:06.780> you

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
if you want to animate everything you

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.270 
if you want to animate everything you
can<00:03:07.050> put<00:03:07.260> all<00:03:07.380> but<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:07.650> can<00:03:07.770> put<00:03:07.920> in<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.100> valley

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
can put all but you can put in a valley

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.520 
can put all but you can put in a valley
here<00:03:08.580> like<00:03:08.820> height<00:03:09.090> or<00:03:09.330> width<00:03:09.780> if<00:03:10.230> you<00:03:10.320> want<00:03:10.470> to

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
here like height or width if you want to

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.170 
here like height or width if you want to
animate<00:03:10.770> a<00:03:10.950> specific<00:03:11.640> property<00:03:11.850> and

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
animate a specific property and

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.820 
animate a specific property and
sometimes<00:03:12.510> that's<00:03:12.660> useful<00:03:12.930> because<00:03:13.200> you

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
sometimes that's useful because you

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.100 
sometimes that's useful because you
don't<00:03:14.010> want<00:03:14.130> to<00:03:14.190> animate<00:03:14.520> everything<00:03:15.240> here<00:03:15.930> is

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
don't want to animate everything here is

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.130 
don't want to animate everything here is
a<00:03:16.500> timing<00:03:16.920> property<00:03:17.760> which<00:03:17.940> is<00:03:18.150> just<00:03:18.600> how<00:03:19.080> many

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
a timing property which is just how many

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.110 
a timing property which is just how many
seconds<00:03:19.739> you<00:03:20.010> can<00:03:20.130> use<00:03:20.250> milliseconds<00:03:20.730> if<00:03:21.030> you

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
seconds you can use milliseconds if you

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.690 
seconds you can use milliseconds if you
use<00:03:21.269> ms<00:03:21.750> here<00:03:22.019> or<00:03:22.170> you<00:03:22.769> could<00:03:22.950> just<00:03:22.980> put<00:03:23.310> point

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
use ms here or you could just put point

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.000 
use ms here or you could just put point
three<00:03:23.940> seconds<00:03:24.480> one<00:03:24.870> second<00:03:25.380> for<00:03:25.530> a<00:03:25.590> second

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
three seconds one second for a second

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.880 
three seconds one second for a second
point<00:03:26.519> three<00:03:26.850> works<00:03:27.239> really<00:03:27.720> well<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:28.320> here

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
point three works really well and here

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.490 
point three works really well and here
is<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.370> ease<00:03:29.640> in<00:03:29.850> and<00:03:30.300> ease<00:03:30.510> out<00:03:30.810> properties

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
is the ease in and ease out properties

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.670 
is the ease in and ease out properties
so<00:03:31.920> you<00:03:31.980> could<00:03:32.100> say<00:03:32.280> ease<00:03:32.550> out<00:03:32.820> or<00:03:33.269> ease<00:03:33.600> in<00:03:33.810> or

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
so you could say ease out or ease in or

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.410 
so you could say ease out or ease in or
just<00:03:35.010> ease<00:03:35.280> or<00:03:35.760> ease<00:03:36.209> in<00:03:36.420> and<00:03:36.900> out<00:03:37.320> and<00:03:38.420> those

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
just ease or ease in and out and those

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.600 
just ease or ease in and out and those
will<00:03:39.660> all<00:03:39.690> work<00:03:40.110> so<00:03:40.380> one<00:03:40.980> more<00:03:41.130> thing<00:03:41.340> that<00:03:41.489> you

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
will all work so one more thing that you

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.000 
will all work so one more thing that you
could<00:03:41.730> do<00:03:41.910> is<00:03:42.150> use<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:42.690> background<00:03:43.140> position

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
could do is use the background position

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.130 
could do is use the background position
property<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:44.610> that<00:03:45.239> lets<00:03:45.510> you<00:03:45.600> control<00:03:45.900> how

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
property and that lets you control how

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.990 
property and that lets you control how
the<00:03:46.200> animation<00:03:46.980> happens<00:03:47.430> so<00:03:47.730> it's<00:03:47.850> going<00:03:47.940> to

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
the animation happens so it's going to

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.720 
the animation happens so it's going to
transition<00:03:48.450> from<00:03:48.810> being<00:03:49.590> at<00:03:49.769> the<00:03:49.890> center<00:03:50.250> to

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
transition from being at the center to

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.190 
transition from being at the center to
whatever<00:03:51.000> you<00:03:51.120> put<00:03:51.330> right<00:03:51.510> here<00:03:51.750> so<00:03:51.900> if<00:03:51.959> we<00:03:52.050> put

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
whatever you put right here so if we put

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.590 
whatever you put right here so if we put
0<00:03:52.470> 0<00:03:52.739> it's<00:03:53.010> just<00:03:53.220> going<00:03:53.340> to<00:03:53.400> animate<00:03:53.730> to<00:03:54.420> the

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
0 0 it's just going to animate to the

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.979 
0 0 it's just going to animate to the
top<00:03:54.930> left<00:03:55.350> of<00:03:55.560> that<00:03:55.650> original<00:03:56.070> image<00:03:56.630> so<00:03:57.630> if

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
top left of that original image so if

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.660 
top left of that original image so if
you<00:03:58.110> don't<00:03:58.260> count<00:03:58.380> all<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.650> browser<00:03:58.890> prefixes

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
you don't count all the browser prefixes

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.000 
you don't count all the browser prefixes
that's<00:03:59.910> one<00:04:00.360> single<00:04:00.780> line<00:04:00.959> of<00:04:00.989> code<00:04:01.170> that<00:04:01.920> you

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
that's one single line of code that you

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.590 
that's one single line of code that you
can<00:04:02.160> add<00:04:02.370> all<00:04:02.580> over<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.060> place<00:04:03.300> and<00:04:03.480> your

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
can add all over the place and your

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.699 
can add all over the place and your
website<00:04:03.989> and<00:04:04.200> it's<00:04:04.350> just<00:04:04.470> going<00:04:04.620> to<00:04:04.650> make

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
website and it's just going to make

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.140 
website and it's just going to make
everything<00:04:05.070> look<00:04:05.670> a<00:04:05.850> lot<00:04:06.180> more<00:04:06.239> polished
