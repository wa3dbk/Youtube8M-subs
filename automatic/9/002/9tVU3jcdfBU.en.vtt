 There is little space, right? 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.560
 I was there with belletti with a truck 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:09.480

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:35.860
 representative in a very nice car 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:38.390

 six original cylinders and we are 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.810
 adapted the v8 engine but kept the exchange 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.420
 the original car is an exchange of 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.730
