be the culprit and tightening that one
it's<00:01:08.159> probably<00:01:08.340> going<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.850> be<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:08.970> good<00:01:09.150> start

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.300 

welljust<00:01:39.120> tithing<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.170> single<00:01:40.650> loose<00:01:40.950> spoke

welljust tithing that single loose spoke

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.039 
welljust tithing that single loose spoke
has<00:01:41.460> made<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.640> huge<00:01:41.970> difference<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.720> buckle

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
has made a huge difference to the buckle

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.870 
has made a huge difference to the buckle
in<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.290> wheel<00:01:43.560> not<00:01:44.100> only<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.400> it<00:01:44.520> no<00:01:44.700> longer

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
in this wheel not only is it no longer

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.490 
in this wheel not only is it no longer
rubbing<00:01:45.299> against<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.600> inside<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.080> the<00:01:46.229> frame

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
rubbing against the inside of the frame

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.380 
rubbing against the inside of the frame
it's<00:01:46.920> also<00:01:47.130> not<00:01:47.520> even<00:01:47.820> rubbing<00:01:48.060> against<00:01:48.300> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
it's also not even rubbing against the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.690 
it's also not even rubbing against the
break<00:01:48.780> with<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:49.440> cantilever<00:01:50.010> loosened<00:01:50.550> off

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
break with this cantilever loosened off

so<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.030> should<00:01:51.210> enable<00:01:51.420> us<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.690> ride<00:01:51.990> back

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
so that should enable us to ride back

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.289 
so that should enable us to ride back
home<00:01:52.500> but<00:01:52.890> we<00:01:53.040> can<00:01:53.190> make<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.340> decent<00:01:53.610> fix<00:01:54.090> or

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
home but we can make a decent fix or

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.270 
home but we can make a decent fix or

you possibly can so let's go through the
steps<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.320> do<00:02:07.440> that<00:02:07.590> now<00:02:07.770> when<00:02:08.250> you're<00:02:08.399> out<00:02:08.550> on

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
steps to do that now when you're out on

steps to do that now when you're out on
the<00:02:08.729> road<00:02:08.880> or<00:02:09.270> on<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.390> trails<00:02:09.840> well<00:02:10.110> then<00:02:10.200> your

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
the road or on the trails well then your

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.930 
the road or on the trails well then your

when<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:12.959> pick<00:02:13.170> it<00:02:13.290> up<00:02:13.410> you'll<00:02:13.769> notice<00:02:13.980> that

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
when you pick it up you'll notice that

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.860 
when you pick it up you'll notice that

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
when you spin the rim you can probably

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.080 
when you spin the rim you can probably
either<00:02:15.989> hear<00:02:16.440> or<00:02:16.650> see<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.190> rim<00:02:17.430> touching<00:02:18.030> on

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
touches the brake pad then you'll want

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.680 
touches the brake pad then you'll want

tighten or loosen very much depends on

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.490 
tighten or loosen very much depends on
the<00:02:30.209> tension<00:02:30.450> already<00:02:30.720> in<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.050> spokes

the tension already in the spokes
if<00:02:31.830> you<00:02:31.950> feel<00:02:32.190> them<00:02:32.340> they're<00:02:32.489> already<00:02:32.670> very

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
if you feel them they're already very

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.520 
if you feel them they're already very
tight<00:02:33.420> well<00:02:33.840> then<00:02:33.930> you're<00:02:34.050> probably<00:02:34.080> going<00:02:34.350> to

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
tight well then you're probably going to

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.130 
tight well then you're probably going to
want<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:34.739> loosen<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.340> vice-versa<00:02:36.180> one<00:02:36.900> thing

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
want to loosen and vice-versa one thing

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.809 
want to loosen and vice-versa one thing
we<00:02:37.230> would<00:02:37.410> say<00:02:37.680> though<00:02:37.860> is<00:02:38.069> make<00:02:38.489> sure<00:02:38.700> you

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
we would say though is make sure you

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.490 
we would say though is make sure you
don't<00:02:38.970> more<00:02:39.300> than<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.540> quarter<00:02:39.959> of<00:02:39.989> a<00:02:40.080> turn<00:02:40.260> at<00:02:40.440> a

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
don't more than a quarter of a turn at a

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.530 
don't more than a quarter of a turn at a
time<00:02:40.530> because<00:02:41.160> you<00:02:41.340> can<00:02:41.580> place<00:02:41.850> unwanted

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
time because you can place unwanted

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.720 
time because you can place unwanted
tension<00:02:42.900> if<00:02:42.989> you<00:02:43.079> do<00:02:43.260> that<00:02:43.470> well<00:02:44.400> we've<00:02:44.579> got

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
tension if you do that well we've got

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.100 
tension if you do that well we've got
that<00:02:44.850> wheel<00:02:45.150> about<00:02:45.420> as<00:02:45.600> good<00:02:45.840> as<00:02:45.959> I<00:02:46.049> think

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
that wheel about as good as I think

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.590 
that wheel about as good as I think
we're<00:02:46.500> going<00:02:46.769> to<00:02:46.950> get<00:02:47.160> it<00:02:47.370> it<00:02:47.610> is<00:02:47.850> worth<00:02:48.180> taking

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
we're going to get it it is worth taking

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.270 
we're going to get it it is worth taking
a<00:02:48.660> look<00:02:48.690> at<00:02:48.989> our<00:02:49.110> other<00:02:49.320> video<00:02:49.739> because<00:02:50.160> it

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
a look at our other video because it

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.530 
a look at our other video because it
gives<00:02:50.459> a<00:02:50.519> more<00:02:50.700> detailed<00:02:50.760> description
