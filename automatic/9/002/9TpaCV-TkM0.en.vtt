00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050 
another video training lesson for you

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.689 
another video training lesson for you
and<00:00:17.230> this<00:00:17.800> one<00:00:18.070> I'm<00:00:18.279> going<00:00:18.400> to<00:00:18.460> show<00:00:18.550> you

and this one I'm going to show you

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:21.359 
and this one I'm going to show you
another<00:00:19.390> great<00:00:19.750> tricep<00:00:20.439> exercise<00:00:20.919> and<00:00:21.310> this

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
another great tricep exercise and this

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.670 
another great tricep exercise and this
is<00:00:21.579> a<00:00:21.789> move<00:00:22.119> that<00:00:22.329> I<00:00:22.390> got<00:00:22.539> from<00:00:22.720> the<00:00:23.050> iron<00:00:23.230> guru

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 
is a move that I got from the iron guru

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.130 
is a move that I got from the iron guru
Vince<00:00:23.980> Gironda<00:00:24.340> and<00:00:25.150> what<00:00:25.300> it<00:00:25.419> is<00:00:25.539> is<00:00:25.869> it's<00:00:26.050> a

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
Vince Gironda and what it is is it's a

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.010 
Vince Gironda and what it is is it's a
tricep<00:00:26.710> extension<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:28.000> it's<00:00:28.360> kind<00:00:28.599> of<00:00:28.630> like<00:00:28.779> I

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
tricep extension and it's kind of like I

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.810 
tricep extension and it's kind of like I
guess<00:00:29.169> a<00:00:29.349> tricep<00:00:29.860> preacher<00:00:30.130> curl<00:00:30.399> variation

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
guess a tricep preacher curl variation

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.000 
guess a tricep preacher curl variation
because<00:00:31.750> we're<00:00:31.930> going<00:00:32.050> to<00:00:32.169> do<00:00:32.290> a<00:00:32.320> very<00:00:32.649> strict

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
because we're going to do a very strict

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.000 
because we're going to do a very strict
move<00:00:33.280> and<00:00:33.790> I<00:00:34.360> just<00:00:34.390> want<00:00:34.660> to<00:00:34.719> explain<00:00:35.649> to<00:00:35.800> setup

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
move and I just want to explain to setup

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.630 
move and I just want to explain to setup
so<00:00:36.850> on<00:00:37.629> the<00:00:37.809> flat<00:00:38.050> bench<00:00:38.350> here<00:00:38.920> and<00:00:39.160> this<00:00:39.489> is

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
so on the flat bench here and this is

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.010 
so on the flat bench here and this is
what<00:00:39.820> our<00:00:39.850> elbows<00:00:40.300> are<00:00:40.450> going<00:00:40.570> to<00:00:40.629> be<00:00:40.690> resting

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
what our elbows are going to be resting

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.460 
what our elbows are going to be resting
on<00:00:41.140> to<00:00:41.920> give<00:00:42.070> us<00:00:42.190> the<00:00:42.370> strict<00:00:42.789> move<00:00:43.470> using

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
on to give us the strict move using

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.210 
on to give us the strict move using
cable<00:00:44.890> setup<00:00:45.690> about

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
cable setup about

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.250 
cable setup about
come<00:00:47.790> to<00:00:48.060> waste<00:00:48.480> like<00:00:48.720> chess<00:00:49.050> played

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
come to waste like chess played

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.590 
come to waste like chess played
somewhere<00:00:49.590> around<00:00:49.650> there<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.940> use<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.420> rope

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
somewhere around there and use the rope

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.800 
somewhere around there and use the rope
attachment<00:00:52.460> so<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.580> is<00:00:53.790> a<00:00:53.970> tricep<00:00:54.450> rope

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:54.810 
attachment so this is a tricep rope

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.170 
attachment so this is a tricep rope
extension<00:00:55.500> whether<00:00:56.400> it<00:00:56.550> almost<00:00:56.820> braced

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
extension whether it almost braced

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.710 
extension whether it almost braced
against<00:00:57.810> the<00:00:57.870> flat<00:00:58.110> bench<00:00:59.450> killer<00:01:00.450> move

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
against the flat bench killer move

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.510 
against the flat bench killer move
because<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.200> allows<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.830> get<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.160> full

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
because it allows you to get a full

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.660 
because it allows you to get a full
stretch<00:01:03.020> and<00:01:04.020> then<00:01:04.500> hold<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.010> contraction<00:01:05.370> at

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
stretch and then hold the contraction at

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.350 
stretch and then hold the contraction at
the<00:01:05.760> top<00:01:10.580> so<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.670> way<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.120> going<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.330> work

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
the top so the way this is going to work

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.870 
the top so the way this is going to work
rest<00:01:13.080> my<00:01:13.260> elbows<00:01:13.650> on<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.890> bench<00:01:14.130> investment

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
rest my elbows on the bench investment

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:52.469 
rest my elbows on the bench investment
forehead<00:01:15.330> on<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.170> bench<00:01:16.500> as<00:01:16.680> well

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.580 

hi<00:01:53.479> everybody<00:01:53.720> Brent<00:01:54.170> now<00:01:54.320> is<00:01:54.380> gonna

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
hi everybody Brent now is gonna

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.820 
hi everybody Brent now is gonna
demonstrate<00:01:54.799> and<00:01:55.790> set<00:01:56.500> again<00:01:57.500> I'll<00:01:57.649> just

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
demonstrate and set again I'll just

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.690 
demonstrate and set again I'll just
explain<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:58.700> form<00:01:58.939> again<00:01:59.350> he<00:02:00.350> sees<00:02:00.700> elbows

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
explain the form again he sees elbows

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.320 
explain the form again he sees elbows
and<00:02:01.939> he's<00:02:02.030> forehead<00:02:02.450> resting<00:02:02.869> on<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.080> bench

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
and he's forehead resting on the bench

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.570 
and he's forehead resting on the bench
and<00:02:05.330> he's<00:02:05.420> coming<00:02:05.690> all<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:05.960> way<00:02:05.990> down<00:02:06.399> all<00:02:07.399> the

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
and he's coming all the way down all the

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.570 
and he's coming all the way down all the
way<00:02:07.700> out<00:02:07.850> so<00:02:08.360> this<00:02:09.140> exercise<00:02:09.440> classifies<00:02:10.280> as

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
way out so this exercise classifies as

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.670 
way out so this exercise classifies as
both<00:02:10.759> a<00:02:10.910> stretch<00:02:11.300> and<00:02:11.840> a<00:02:12.110> peak<00:02:12.350> contraction

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
both a stretch and a peak contraction

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.710 
both a stretch and a peak contraction
move<00:02:13.100> so<00:02:13.910> those<00:02:14.090> of<00:02:14.120> you<00:02:14.360> who<00:02:14.390> are<00:02:14.600> familiar

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
move so those of you who are familiar

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.750 
move so those of you who are familiar
with<00:02:15.019> the<00:02:15.260> positions<00:02:15.800> of<00:02:15.920> flexion<00:02:16.310> style<00:02:16.640> of

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
with the positions of flexion style of

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.180 
with the positions of flexion style of
training<00:02:17.120> you<00:02:18.050> could<00:02:18.200> use<00:02:18.349> this<00:02:18.560> as<00:02:18.769> either<00:02:18.890> or

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
training you could use this as either or

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.759 
training you could use this as either or
fully<00:02:20.000> stretched<00:02:20.360> or<00:02:20.750> peak<00:02:20.989> contraction<00:02:21.350> and

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
fully stretched or peak contraction and

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.680 
fully stretched or peak contraction and
I<00:02:22.459> think<00:02:22.670> that's<00:02:22.819> part<00:02:23.090> of<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.239> reason<00:02:23.510> why<00:02:23.630> it

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
I think that's part of the reason why it

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.530 
I think that's part of the reason why it
works<00:02:23.930> so<00:02:24.080> very<00:02:24.290> well

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.020 

and<00:02:29.019> you<00:02:29.319> notice<00:02:29.590> we<00:02:29.709> have<00:02:29.739> a<00:02:29.890> pad<00:02:30.580> there<00:02:30.819> for

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
and you notice we have a pad there for

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.190 
and you notice we have a pad there for
the<00:02:31.090> knees<00:02:31.239> just<00:02:31.540> make<00:02:31.689> it<00:02:31.810> a<00:02:31.840> little<00:02:31.930> bit<00:02:32.080> more

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
the knees just make it a little bit more

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.500 
the knees just make it a little bit more
comfortable<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:33.030> we<00:02:34.030> actually<00:02:34.180> have<00:02:34.420> our

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
comfortable and we actually have our

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.850 
comfortable and we actually have our
feet<00:02:34.720> braced<00:02:35.049> against<00:02:35.379> the<00:02:35.500> back<00:02:35.650> of<00:02:35.799> the

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
feet braced against the back of the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.880 
feet braced against the back of the
bench<00:02:36.040> or<00:02:36.459> back<00:02:36.670> of<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.879> cable<00:02:37.480> station<00:02:37.890> just

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
bench or back of the cable station just

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.640 
bench or back of the cable station just
for<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.099> bit<00:02:39.220> more<00:02:39.310> support<00:02:39.840> so<00:02:40.840> give<00:02:41.319> that<00:02:41.349> move

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
for a bit more support so give that move

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.319 
for a bit more support so give that move
