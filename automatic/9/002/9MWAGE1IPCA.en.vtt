 military police to follow

 travel because some for passengers 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:46.289

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.219

 the population is expected to be 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.520
 this is the population that suffers if

 florianópolis can water part coast one 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.560

 to work as city council bus 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.980
 year I even make a challenge for people 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.170
 starting up at least once 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.080

 marcelo this councilman comes to work 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.930
 also of animals is that no one who is 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:46.230
 doing promotion for who she is or was 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.390
 obligation is binding and all councilmen 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.760
 to be here in this house floor 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.030
 public transport once a week 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.330
 to see the terrible quality that is the 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.209
 Poor quality is the same when 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.030
 is talking about health hospital and post 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:06.540
 health when you say look looks 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.549
 arguing here it's okay to have 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.820
 a lot that has to bring here this 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:14.670
 house the city's public transportation is 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:18.959
 poor quality has a very high value 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:21.959
 high is one of the highest rates in Brazil 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.870
 if you throw money in the drain if you did 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:29.850
 terminal it was thought that no one 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:32.549
 know where the money went or is not 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:37.560
 So, gentlemen, let's go, I do not know. 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:41.850
 account of what the population expects 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.579
 of us to open a class once and for all 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.890
 this black box that has been said 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:50.700
 many campaigns that would open up did not 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:54.299
 opened nothing remains the poor quality 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.609
 of the service but also did not fail to 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:59.459
 say you can never stop saying 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:02.670
 here in this house that continues to grow 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:05.130
 brasil rate is from florianópolis 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.400
 the badeko alderman allowance 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:12.570
 remembered as well as having a high tariff have 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:16.709
 monthly allowance that we have to 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:18.060
 to discuss how this 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.670
 pass through 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.790
 we have to discuss why not 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:26.100
 go back to that time and it took only 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:29.250
 a single bus to reach the destination 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.770
 these endless buckets 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:35.340
 this is what the population expects of us 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.770
 councilors is not personal promotion of 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.680
 tell another one who walks by bus all 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.540
 they had to ride a bus to know 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:47.670
 this lousy quality 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:51.210
 I invite everyone to join 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:56.010
 inside the bus and then have 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:57.360
 shame shame this terrible 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.140
 quality 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:05.190
 I will be ashamed of the fee that is paid 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:08.250
 to this town that is a council tax 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.920
 that can be justified 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.320
 for the quality of service 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.930
 is this the alderman lino peres that we 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:19.200
 We have to discuss this house we have. 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:24.240
 to discuss with the workers earn 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:27.180
 good wages and drivers collectors 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:30.200
 this is what we have to discuss the 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:33.420
 how much is the subsidy paid 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:37.170
 why the subsidy in my view had not 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:41.400
 to have subsidy because at all the tariff is 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:45.360
 face is already too expensive to receive 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.670
 subsidy or else cast the councilman linen 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.640
 peres 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:55.050
 the bidding is a bid 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:58.350
 transparent bidding and it is a 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.450
 that will lose all those who have 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.670
 public transport and which are 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:06.380
 who may participate in a tender 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:09.870
 that everyone already knows who will win 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.610
 this bidding and who wants 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.870
 we want is clean bidding 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:17.440
 transparent that come from outside companies 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:20.500
 participate in this process 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:23.710
 this is what we want is this is the 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:27.760
 discussion and invite all 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:30.580
 the councilors of this house walks not only a 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.710
 but two times a week by bus 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.060
 and then they will know what we are 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:37.750
 bringing here to this house this 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:40.600
 subject is a matter in my view a serious 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:42.820
 matter that deserves attention as well as 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.010
 discusses and asks the approval of the plan 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.500
 director also has to bring this 

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.760
 subject of public transport in 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.850
 this house 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:54.100
 A lot of things are said here and you forget. 

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:56.530
 public transport that affects thousands of 

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:58.090
 thousands of families in the daily life of 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.790
 city ​​florianópolis brigados o 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:03.610
 teacher calls 30 seconds plus 30 

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:07.570
 according to the councilmen my game 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:09.550
 Your cry is I think it expresses the 

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:12.520
 scream that is in the throat of so much 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:14.860

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.670
 live we have to be Sao Paulo 15

 millions 

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.250
 a population of nearly 150 thousand 

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.290
 to provide a crime that is 

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:22.150
 happening when I invite you to 

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:24.130
 I also take part in the front 

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.810

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:28.630
 This house here to do this job. 

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:30.610
 this holiday here will be the author of 

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:32.970
 cpi of public transport is what we 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.970
 we have to investigate
