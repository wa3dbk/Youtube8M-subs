healthy<00:00:41.480> recipe<00:00:42.710> because<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.980> has<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.430> green

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610

me I was intrigued because I've never
tried<00:00:57.870> Swiss<00:00:58.680> chard<00:00:58.980> before<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.640> the<00:01:00.570> last

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
tried Swiss chard before and the last

green leafy vegetable I made didn't

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.410 
green leafy vegetable I made didn't
really<00:01:03.329> turn<00:01:03.539> out<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:04.110> great<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.820> was

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
really turn out that great so I was

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.990 
really turn out that great so I was
excited<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.869> try<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:08.010> heard<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.580> was<00:01:08.640> really

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
excited to try it I heard it was really

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.969 
excited to try it I heard it was really
good<00:01:09.150> for<00:01:09.390> my<00:01:09.540> mother<00:01:09.900> who<00:01:10.290> made<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.799> once

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
good for my mother who made it once

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.399 
good for my mother who made it once
before<00:01:13.250> the<00:01:14.250> only<00:01:14.820> problem<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.479> found<00:01:16.200> the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
before the only problem I found the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.789 
before the only problem I found the
recipe<00:01:16.560> was<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.580> lack<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:17.909> measurements<00:01:18.799> for

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
recipe was the lack of measurements for

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.249 
recipe was the lack of measurements for
the<00:01:19.860> ingredients<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:21.299> think<00:01:21.869> there<00:01:22.140> actually

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
the ingredients I think there actually

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.830 
the ingredients I think there actually
were<00:01:22.590> two<00:01:22.799> measurements<00:01:23.310> for<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.360> potatoes

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
were two measurements for the potatoes

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.740 
were two measurements for the potatoes
jason<00:01:25.500> said<00:01:25.890> one<00:01:26.250> kilogram<00:01:26.700> but<00:01:27.390> being<00:01:27.659> that

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
jason said one kilogram but being that

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.020 
jason said one kilogram but being that
I'm<00:01:27.990> from<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.320> United<00:01:28.470> States<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:29.189> think

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
I'm from the United States I think

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.429 
I'm from the United States I think
that's<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.299> metric<00:01:30.630> system<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:31.170> don't<00:01:31.380> know

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
that's the metric system I don't know

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.109 
that's the metric system I don't know
what<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.740> but<00:01:32.009> whatever<00:01:32.250> system<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:32.880> we

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
what it is but whatever system it is we

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.700 
what it is but whatever system it is we
don't<00:01:33.210> use<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.509> here<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.380> don't<00:01:34.530> know<00:01:34.619> what

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
don't use that here so I don't know what

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.510 
don't use that here so I don't know what
a<00:01:34.740> kilogram<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:36.090> after<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.420> am<00:01:37.280> chopped<00:01:38.280> up

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
a kilogram is so after I am chopped up

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.170 
a kilogram is so after I am chopped up
the<00:01:38.850> charred<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.979> kind<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.159> eyeballed<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:42.000> and

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
the charred I kind of eyeballed it and

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.170 
the charred I kind of eyeballed it and
said<00:01:42.390> hmm<00:01:42.810> two<00:01:43.740> potatoes<00:01:44.130> sound<00:01:44.369> good<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.790> so

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
said hmm two potatoes sound good and so

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.170 
said hmm two potatoes sound good and so
I<00:01:45.240> used<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.720> baking<00:01:46.110> potatoes<00:01:46.790> and<00:01:47.790> also<00:01:48.060> just

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
I used to baking potatoes and also just

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.179 
I used to baking potatoes and also just
to<00:01:48.270> backtrack<00:01:48.720> with<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.079> chart<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.649> could<00:01:49.950> not

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
to backtrack with the chart I could not

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.719 
to backtrack with the chart I could not
find<00:01:50.579> Swiss<00:01:51.479> chard<00:01:51.840> by<00:01:52.619> itself<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.369> had<00:01:53.520> to

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
find Swiss chard by itself like I had to

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.959 
find Swiss chard by itself like I had to
get<00:01:54.390> like<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.659> combination<00:01:54.869> pack<00:01:55.649> with<00:01:56.460> this

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
get like the combination pack with this

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.810 
get like the combination pack with this
was<00:01:57.180> charred<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.079> red<00:01:58.259> chard<00:01:58.590> but<00:01:59.250> still

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
was charred and the red chard but still

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.639 
was charred and the red chard but still
it<00:02:00.119> turned<00:02:00.420> out<00:02:00.570> really<00:02:00.630> well<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:01.020> thought<00:02:01.350> that

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
it turned out really well I thought that

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.480 
it turned out really well I thought that
the<00:02:02.460> Swiss<00:02:02.820> chard<00:02:03.180> would<00:02:03.869> cook<00:02:04.490> differently

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
the Swiss chard would cook differently

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.880 
the Swiss chard would cook differently
than<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.090> red<00:02:06.390> chard<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.320> really<00:02:07.619> didn't

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
than the red chard and I really didn't

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.930 
than the red chard and I really didn't
notice<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.220> different<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.670> was<00:02:08.759> all

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
notice the different it was all

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.070 
notice the different it was all
difference<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:09.810> was<00:02:09.899> all<00:02:10.050> really<00:02:10.229> good

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
difference it was all really good

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.590 
difference it was all really good
but<00:02:12.800> anyway<00:02:13.100> so<00:02:13.160> I<00:02:13.400> used<00:02:13.700> to<00:02:13.910> baking<00:02:14.240> potatoes

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
but anyway so I used to baking potatoes

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.580 
but anyway so I used to baking potatoes
and<00:02:15.070> i<00:02:16.070> discovered<00:02:16.580> that<00:02:16.780> baking<00:02:17.780> potatoes

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
and i discovered that baking potatoes

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.970 
and i discovered that baking potatoes
boil<00:02:19.010> faster<00:02:19.340> than<00:02:20.240> red<00:02:20.990> potatoes<00:02:21.470> so<00:02:21.800> the

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
boil faster than red potatoes so the

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.640 
boil faster than red potatoes so the
whole<00:02:22.310> recipe<00:02:22.700> cook<00:02:23.090> really<00:02:23.480> quickly<00:02:24.110> after<00:02:24.620> I

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
whole recipe cook really quickly after I

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.410 
whole recipe cook really quickly after I
chopped<00:02:25.400> up<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:26.090> chard<00:02:26.360> and<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.840> potatoes<00:02:27.080> I

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
chopped up the chard and the potatoes I

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.730 
chopped up the chard and the potatoes I
after<00:02:29.420> that<00:02:29.570> like<00:02:29.690> the<00:02:29.840> recipe<00:02:30.110> just<00:02:30.350> went

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
after that like the recipe just went

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.430 
after that like the recipe just went
really<00:02:30.920> really<00:02:31.130> fast<00:02:31.760> because<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.930> potatoes

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
really really fast because the potatoes

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.230 
really really fast because the potatoes
cooked<00:02:33.710> so<00:02:33.890> quickly<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:34.460> then<00:02:34.820> the<00:02:34.970> charred

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
cooked so quickly and then the charred

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.680 
cooked so quickly and then the charred
cooked<00:02:35.630> really<00:02:36.320> fast<00:02:36.680> too<00:02:37.030> but<00:02:38.030> I<00:02:38.090> think<00:02:38.510> the

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
cooked really fast too but I think the

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.210 
cooked really fast too but I think the
key<00:02:38.990> to<00:02:39.380> that<00:02:39.770> recipe<00:02:40.280> is<00:02:41.620> adding<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:42.800> garlic

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
key to that recipe is adding the garlic

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.470 
key to that recipe is adding the garlic
and<00:02:43.490> the<00:02:43.930> oil<00:02:44.930> after<00:02:45.890> you've<00:02:46.610> drained<00:02:47.060> the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
and the oil after you've drained the

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.380 
and the oil after you've drained the
water<00:02:47.660> off<00:02:47.990> the<00:02:48.290> chart<00:02:48.470> and<00:02:48.680> potatoes<00:02:49.070> oh<00:02:49.390> it

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
water off the chart and potatoes oh it

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.120 
water off the chart and potatoes oh it
was<00:02:50.810> it<00:02:51.080> was<00:02:51.170> so<00:02:51.290> good<00:02:51.440> i<00:02:51.560> just<00:02:51.770> love<00:02:51.890> you<00:02:51.920> so

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.670 
was it was so good i just love you so
much<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:53.540> then<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:54.020> other<00:02:54.170> thing<00:02:54.260> i<00:02:54.500> wanted

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
much and then the other thing i wanted

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.390 
much and then the other thing i wanted
to<00:02:54.770> add<00:02:54.920> i<00:02:55.250> was<00:02:55.400> going<00:02:55.760> to<00:02:56.500> exclude<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:58.070> gravy

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
to add i was going to exclude the gravy

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.300 
to add i was going to exclude the gravy
mixture<00:02:59.090> because<00:02:59.390> Jason's<00:02:59.870> recipe<00:03:00.410> does<00:03:01.040> call

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
mixture because Jason's recipe does call

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.610 
mixture because Jason's recipe does call
for<00:03:01.340> I<00:03:01.760> think<00:03:02.090> it's<00:03:02.240> like<00:03:02.330> one<00:03:02.540> cup<00:03:02.840> of<00:03:03.050> the

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
for I think it's like one cup of the

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.320 
for I think it's like one cup of the
remaining<00:03:03.980> vegetable<00:03:04.580> stock<00:03:04.790> and<00:03:04.820> then<00:03:05.120> you

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
remaining vegetable stock and then you

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.900 
remaining vegetable stock and then you
mix<00:03:05.540> in<00:03:05.870> some<00:03:06.320> of<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:06.980> potatoes<00:03:07.400> and<00:03:07.670> you<00:03:07.730> make

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
mix in some of the potatoes and you make

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.690 
mix in some of the potatoes and you make
kind<00:03:08.150> of<00:03:08.209> like<00:03:08.330> a<00:03:08.360> potato<00:03:08.690> gravy<00:03:09.080> I<00:03:09.700> didn't

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
kind of like a potato gravy I didn't

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.010 
kind of like a potato gravy I didn't
need<00:03:10.880> a<00:03:11.180> full<00:03:12.050> cup<00:03:12.320> of<00:03:12.500> vegetable<00:03:12.890> stock<00:03:13.240> and<00:03:14.240> I

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
need a full cup of vegetable stock and I

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.479 
need a full cup of vegetable stock and I
was<00:03:15.200> also<00:03:15.380> going<00:03:15.530> to<00:03:15.830> exclude<00:03:16.280> it<00:03:16.400> all

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
was also going to exclude it all

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:17.740 
was also going to exclude it all
together<00:03:16.610> because<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.090> recipe<00:03:17.450> I<00:03:17.480> mean<00:03:17.690> it

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
together because the recipe I mean it

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.199 
together because the recipe I mean it
was<00:03:17.840> just<00:03:17.870> good<00:03:18.230> without<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:19.040> potato<00:03:19.940> gravy

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
was just good without the potato gravy

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.270 
was just good without the potato gravy
but<00:03:20.450> I<00:03:20.510> felt<00:03:20.720> like<00:03:20.780> it<00:03:20.930> would<00:03:21.019> be<00:03:21.080> too<00:03:21.320> dry<00:03:21.620> so<00:03:21.890> i

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
but I felt like it would be too dry so i

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.800 
but I felt like it would be too dry so i
only<00:03:22.670> used<00:03:23.120> about<00:03:23.300> half<00:03:24.400> a<00:03:25.400> cup<00:03:25.580> of<00:03:25.810> the

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
only used about half a cup of the

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.580 
only used about half a cup of the
vegetable<00:03:27.260> stock<00:03:27.500> off<00:03:27.769> the<00:03:29.380> chart<00:03:30.380> and

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
vegetable stock off the chart and

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.280 
vegetable stock off the chart and
potatoes<00:03:30.980> and<00:03:31.280> and<00:03:31.970> then<00:03:32.239> I<00:03:32.330> crushed<00:03:32.720> in<00:03:32.989> some

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
potatoes and and then I crushed in some

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.520 
potatoes and and then I crushed in some
of<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:34.209> boil<00:03:35.209> potatoes<00:03:35.420> and<00:03:36.050> I<00:03:36.080> put<00:03:36.260> it<00:03:36.350> in<00:03:36.440> a

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
of the boil potatoes and I put it in a

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.550 
of the boil potatoes and I put it in a
blender<00:03:36.650> and<00:03:37.070> you<00:03:37.940> know<00:03:38.090> ported<00:03:38.450> over<00:03:38.560> the

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
blender and you know ported over the

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.390 
blender and you know ported over the
chard<00:03:40.160> and<00:03:40.519> potatoes<00:03:41.180> also<00:03:41.810> good<00:03:42.140> but<00:03:42.680> I<00:03:43.010> just

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
chard and potatoes also good but I just

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.729 
chard and potatoes also good but I just
