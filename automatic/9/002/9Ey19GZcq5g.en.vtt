 works of stephen king dark tower 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.119
 confrontation n is a meaningful book 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.580
 author and perhaps someone from the audience 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.769
 even read the original novels but about 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.810
 story with the name road rage i 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:36.449

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.680
 everyone loves steven spielberg but not many 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.930
 watched his old picture under 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.399
 title duel tough intriguing 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.110
 Thriller about a man who 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:51.969
 for unknown reasons there was such a thing 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.300
 huge truck on the road in the middle 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:57.460
 deaf wilderness oh yes this is a wonderful movie about 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.530
 which i learned thanks to james ralf 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.420
 but even if you watched this movie you 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.820
 you may not know that it was shot by 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.100
 the motives of the famous novel to what it all 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.050
 besides that two comics are 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.540
 under this cover are tributes 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.090
 the very same writer who invented 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.130
 romance duel a two last issues so 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.049
 and at all its graphic adaptation and 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.770
 you know what the main problem is 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.110
 comics 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.780
 in the fact that this is not a product of steven 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.299
 Kinga possible in creating the first story 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.850
 he really participated but damn 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.830
 it's like a twins movie where the game is declared 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.500
 Jackie Chan but the screen in time with him 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.869
 no more than three minutes and generally god 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.060
 I hope you never watched this 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.340
 film one way or another go to the first 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.560
 stories we have mean biker gang 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.119

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.880
 past wary able to pair with her 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.920
 buddy Carl friends went wrong 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.079
 chum threw it on a good 60 pieces 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.720
 Ultimately biker left without money 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:54.399
 over time the music decides 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.470
 go for disassembly from the scam and 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.479
 and according to the most moron of the crowd 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.820
 using matched and hacks debtor 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.130
 his girlfriend gang faces a choice 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.649
 abandon the pursuit of attendants either 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.719
 fight to the last but not enough for 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.940
 for unknown reasons 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:12.160
 truck killer with crazed drivers 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.349
 behind the wheel of the chip story is that it 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.239
 focuses on family relationships as 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.970
 in the blood and friendly understanding 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.250
 of the word on the rails other and biker 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.780
 to 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.030
 you can not leave without support 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.890
 his father has a follower 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.930
 rich life experience and wants 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.330
 affect his son by protecting him from dangerous 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.310
 actions but the child will never understand 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.250
 their parents exactly like them not 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.750
 will take the child's point of view to the eternal 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.700
 fathers and children theme 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.260
 only instead of old Russian motives 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.060
 here is american rockenrol 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.550
 it is clear that the authors tried to uncover and 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.860
 biker fraternity theme but they donâ€™t have 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.170
 It happened and you know, maybe the spirit 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.209
 Issues for this little and maybe the problem 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.760
 the fact is that almost the whole gang dies in three 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.190
 pages and the bitterness of the rest on this 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.830
 it comes down only to a couple of words of fig 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.140
 know somehow it all wrong 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.120
 more about the first story to say nothing 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.040
 the story of the fight bikers and truck 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.160
 killer mixed with family drama 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.020
 no epica no unexpected of 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.630
 and not to say that everything is bad 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.610
 fear and creeps from the story certainly not 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.150
 get don't believe opening speech 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.130
 the author 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.690
 but can not i call this story ken 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.270
 mountain simply because it is not 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.790
 zest of the author, he took the finished idea 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.380
 created a kind of fan comic with 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.660
 except that the creator of this 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.820
 works of genius writing case 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.950
 not some random dude from the internet 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.019
 second story as i said earlier 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.450
 adaptation of the novel duel nothing 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.610
 remarkable again as adaptations 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.590
 she is not bad and not good since 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.750
 spoil such a cool product like 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.150
 it seems to me simply unreal but if 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.160
 do you want to get real emotions then 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.560
 I advise you to rather see the film version 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.350
 spielberg film as it should be 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.610
 more details to the heat of passion 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.160
 illustrations in both stories are very 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.410
 are good the first is slightly cartoon 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.480
 dynamic drawing from on yeltsin daniel 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.530
 in the second incredibly wild unusually 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.690
 harris's traffic 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.570
 the edition in Russian turned out soundly 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.760
 120 glossy hard cover pages 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.549
 matt dust jacket that watches 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.100
 zadolbala registration storks this time 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:16.100
 good fonts are not like comic sans 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.260
 sounds are also redone in Russian 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.019
 yes on visa illustrations additional 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.130
 covers in general today without cons what 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.350
 incredibly happy 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.930
 I can advise this book only in three 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.700
 cases if you stop you are a fan of steven 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.529
 Kinga and ready to buy any product 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.019

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:34.569
 no if you like movie duels just 

00:04:32.019 --> 00:04:37.059
 wanted to adapt it on paper but either 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:39.339
 you are a biker with a fire 

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:41.559
 beak columns not sure that there are such 

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:43.449
 on my channel but did not infringe upon this 

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:45.639
 class of people in other cases can 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:47.709

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.529

 department fiction genes go to him 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:53.529
