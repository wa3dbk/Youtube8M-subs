probably might be able to come out since
it<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.540> not<00:01:30.780> kind<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.829> like<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:31.979> regular<00:01:32.250> update

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
it is not kind of like a regular update

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.990 
it is not kind of like a regular update
it's<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.180> dlc<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:34.020> know<00:01:34.619> how<00:01:34.860> DLCs<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.670> updates

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.560 
you why I think it will come out I'm the
20th<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.860> can<00:01:53.399> I'm<00:01:53.670> gonna<00:01:53.790> tell<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.090> guys<00:01:54.119> why<00:01:54.540> I

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
20th I can I'm gonna tell you guys why I

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.320 
20th I can I'm gonna tell you guys why I
don't<00:01:54.930> think<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.350> will<00:01:55.560> come<00:01:55.799> out

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
don't think it will come out

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.570 
don't think it will come out
so<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.230> first<00:01:57.380> reason<00:01:57.590> for<00:01:57.920> that<00:01:58.040> is<00:01:58.280> like<00:01:58.460> I

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
so the first reason for that is like I

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.870 
so the first reason for that is like I
said<00:01:58.790> earlier<00:01:58.820> it<00:01:59.330> is<00:01:59.390> Easter<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:00.640> maybe<00:02:01.640> they

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
said earlier it is Easter and maybe they

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
said earlier it is Easter and maybe they
would<00:02:02.060> think<00:02:02.240> it<00:02:02.360> might<00:02:02.540> be<00:02:02.570> a<00:02:02.750> little

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
would think it might be a little

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.620 
would think it might be a little
disrespectful<00:02:03.740> or<00:02:04.100> something<00:02:04.790> because<00:02:04.970> I<00:02:05.180> you

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
disrespectful or something because I you

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.870 
disrespectful or something because I you
know<00:02:05.750> it<00:02:05.900> is<00:02:06.020> like<00:02:06.260> the<00:02:06.740> whole<00:02:06.950> idea<00:02:07.250> gian

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
know it is like the whole idea gian

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.780 
know it is like the whole idea gian
speculation<00:02:08.450> of<00:02:08.570> like<00:02:08.810> God<00:02:09.440> and<00:02:09.770> Jesus<00:02:09.979> etc

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
speculation of like God and Jesus etc

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.330 
speculation of like God and Jesus etc
I'm<00:02:11.180> not<00:02:11.330> gonna<00:02:11.450> tell<00:02:11.660> you<00:02:11.720> any<00:02:11.900> of<00:02:12.020> my<00:02:12.340> beliefs
