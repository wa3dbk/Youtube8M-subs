the<00:02:10.240> direction<00:02:10.360> later<00:02:10.810> but<00:02:11.110> if<00:02:11.170> you

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
the direction later but if you

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.780 
the direction later but if you
comfortable<00:02:12.160> if<00:02:12.400> you're<00:02:12.520> more<00:02:12.640> comfortable

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
comfortable if you're more comfortable

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.840 
comfortable if you're more comfortable
your<00:02:13.120> left<00:02:13.300> you're<00:02:14.140> gonna<00:02:14.200> go

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
your left you're gonna go

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.490 
your left you're gonna go
counterclockwise<00:02:15.850> and<00:02:16.540> that's<00:02:17.440> because

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
counterclockwise and that's because

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.800 
counterclockwise and that's because
you're<00:02:20.500> gonna<00:02:20.620> notice<00:02:20.820> when<00:02:21.820> you<00:02:21.940> do<00:02:22.090> footwork

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
you're gonna notice when you do footwork

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.160 
you're gonna notice when you do footwork
and<00:02:23.020> you<00:02:23.110> actually<00:02:23.340> finally<00:02:24.340> get<00:02:24.490> to<00:02:24.670> power

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
and you actually finally get to power

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.770 
and you actually finally get to power
you're<00:02:26.170> gonna<00:02:26.320> say<00:02:27.120> or<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:28.300> I<00:02:28.360> know<00:02:28.540> I<00:02:28.570> have<00:02:28.720> a

freeze by doing foot work you want to go

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.910 
freeze by doing foot work you want to go

you're<00:02:36.910> gonna<00:02:37.000> clockwise<00:02:37.420> and<00:02:37.750> that's

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
you're gonna clockwise and that's

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.260 
you're gonna clockwise and that's
because<00:02:38.440> when<00:02:39.340> you<00:02:39.459> when<00:02:39.820> you<00:02:39.910> go<00:02:40.000> clockwise

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
be a specific time where it's perfect

for you to just freeze others rather

for you to just freeze others rather
than<00:02:47.970> if<00:02:49.110> you<00:02:50.110> went<00:02:50.260> clock<00:02:50.950> walk<00:02:51.160> if<00:02:51.340> you<00:02:51.459> went

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
than if you went clock walk if you went

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.880 
than if you went clock walk if you went
counterclockwise<00:02:51.940> but<00:02:52.750> you're<00:02:52.890> right-handed

freeze in oh well almost if you get

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.570 
freeze in oh well almost if you get
creative<00:03:01.720> and<00:03:01.930> get<00:03:02.050> better<00:03:02.290> and<00:03:02.620> you<00:03:02.739> just<00:03:02.890> do

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
creative and get better and you just do

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.430 
creative and get better and you just do
it<00:03:03.760> on<00:03:03.880> purpose<00:03:04.090> but<00:03:04.600> for<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:05.080> sake<00:03:05.260> of<00:03:05.290> a

it on purpose but for the sake of a

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.199 
it on purpose but for the sake of a
beginner<00:03:05.739> you<00:03:06.310> want<00:03:06.459> to<00:03:06.610> make<00:03:06.730> sure<00:03:06.760> if<00:03:07.060> you're

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
beginner you want to make sure if you're

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.520 
beginner you want to make sure if you're
right-handed<00:03:07.390> when<00:03:07.870> you<00:03:07.959> freeze<00:03:08.230> you<00:03:08.410> go

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
right-handed when you freeze you go

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.080 
right-handed when you freeze you go
clockwise<00:03:08.799> and<00:03:09.280> if<00:03:09.459> you're<00:03:09.580> left-handed<00:03:09.880> when

clockwise and if you're left-handed when

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.509 
clockwise and if you're left-handed when
you<00:03:10.209> freeze<00:03:10.420> you<00:03:10.570> go<00:03:10.660> counterclockwise

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
you freeze you go counterclockwise

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.210 
you freeze you go counterclockwise
that's<00:03:12.519> because<00:03:12.940> when<00:03:13.510> you<00:03:13.950> when<00:03:14.950> you<00:03:15.040> do

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
that's because when you when you do

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.130 
that's because when you when you do
footwork<00:03:15.670> because<00:03:16.299> I'm<00:03:16.450> right-handed<00:03:16.660> I<00:03:16.930> move

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
footwork because I'm right-handed I move

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.830 
footwork because I'm right-handed I move
clockwise<00:03:17.549> there's<00:03:18.549> a<00:03:18.610> time<00:03:20.040> where<00:03:21.040> power

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
clockwise there's a time where power

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.660 
clockwise there's a time where power
will<00:03:22.840> just<00:03:23.110> slip<00:03:23.410> in<00:03:23.590> there<00:03:23.799> you<00:03:24.400> guys<00:03:24.549> do

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
will just slip in there you guys do

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.710 
will just slip in there you guys do
fight<00:03:26.310> again<00:03:27.310> like<00:03:27.549> if<00:03:27.700> I<00:03:27.820> didn't<00:03:28.180> if<00:03:28.360> I<00:03:28.480> was<00:03:28.690> a

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
fight again like if I didn't if I was a

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.690 
fight again like if I didn't if I was a
counting<00:03:29.650> clip<00:03:29.799> I<00:03:29.890> want<00:03:30.010> common<00:03:30.400> counter

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
counting clip I want common counter

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.009 
counting clip I want common counter
clockwise<00:03:30.940> actually<00:03:31.570> do<00:03:31.690> power

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
clockwise actually do power

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.890 
clockwise actually do power
it<00:03:32.470> wouldn't<00:03:32.830> work<00:03:32.920> because<00:03:33.459> I'm<00:03:34.120> going<00:03:34.750> this

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
it wouldn't work because I'm going this

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.030 
it wouldn't work because I'm going this
way

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
way

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.860 
way
but<00:03:36.250> then<00:03:36.400> I'm<00:03:36.760> trying<00:03:36.939> to<00:03:37.150> cover<00:03:37.420> this<00:03:37.689> way<00:03:38.280> so

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
but then I'm trying to cover this way so

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.330 
but then I'm trying to cover this way so
that's<00:03:40.870> one<00:03:41.349> important<00:03:41.890> thing<00:03:41.920> to<00:03:42.129> keep<00:03:42.220> in

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
that's one important thing to keep in

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.110 
that's one important thing to keep in
mind<00:03:42.549> and<00:03:42.790> I<00:03:43.510> hope<00:03:44.200> you<00:03:44.920> guys<00:03:45.189> and<00:03:45.519> girls<00:03:45.849> watch

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
mind and I hope you guys and girls watch

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.819 
mind and I hope you guys and girls watch
this<00:03:46.390> video<00:03:46.720> before<00:03:46.870> you<00:03:47.049> actually<00:03:47.200> start<00:03:47.379> so

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
this video before you actually start so

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.490 
this video before you actually start so
you<00:03:47.950> don't<00:03:48.099> screw<00:03:49.060> yourself<00:03:49.450> over<00:03:49.780> like<00:03:50.049> I<00:03:50.260> did

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
you don't screw yourself over like I did

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.710 
you don't screw yourself over like I did
and<00:03:50.860> I<00:03:50.890> remember<00:03:51.220> I<00:03:51.280> did<00:03:51.489> but<00:03:52.299> we're<00:03:52.450> kind<00:03:52.659> of

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
and I remember I did but we're kind of

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.300 
and I remember I did but we're kind of
clockwise<00:03:53.049> when<00:03:53.290> I<00:03:53.409> did<00:03:53.560> my<00:03:53.680> power<00:03:54.069> of

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
clockwise when I did my power of

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.210 
clockwise when I did my power of
clockwise<00:03:54.700> so<00:03:55.629> I<00:03:56.079> found<00:03:56.379> the<00:03:56.560> six<00:03:56.799> step<00:03:57.010> to

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
clockwise so I found the six step to

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.460 
clockwise so I found the six step to
windmill<00:03:57.569> very<00:03:58.569> very<00:03:58.930> very<00:03:59.560> challenging<00:03:59.920> so

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
windmill very very very challenging so

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.259 
windmill very very very challenging so
yeah<00:04:02.470> make<00:04:03.250> sure<00:04:03.280> if<00:04:03.519> you're<00:04:03.640> right-handed<00:04:03.819> go

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
yeah make sure if you're right-handed go

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.809 
yeah make sure if you're right-handed go
clockwise<00:04:04.569> you<00:04:05.560> just<00:04:05.799> figure<00:04:06.069> out<00:04:06.099> later<00:04:06.459> if

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
clockwise you just figure out later if

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:08.819 
clockwise you just figure out later if
it<00:04:07.239> doesn't<00:04:07.510> make<00:04:07.599> sense<00:04:07.810> right<00:04:07.930> now<00:04:07.989> if<00:04:08.590> we

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
it doesn't make sense right now if we

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:11.460 
it doesn't make sense right now if we
were<00:04:08.890> out<00:04:09.010> later<00:04:09.220> that<00:04:09.989> juni<00:04:10.989> you<00:04:11.349> were

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470

actually right thank you for saving me
from<00:04:13.680> having<00:04:14.680> to<00:04:14.829> learn<00:04:15.069> the<00:04:15.670> foot<00:04:15.909> foot<00:04:16.299> work

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
from having to learn the foot foot work

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:21.000 
from having to learn the foot foot work
the<00:04:16.870> other<00:04:17.019> way<00:04:18.510> and<00:04:19.510> again<00:04:19.870> by<00:04:20.380> me<00:04:20.620> saying

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
the other way and again by me saying

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.240 
the other way and again by me saying
that<00:04:21.280> I<00:04:21.519> don't<00:04:21.579> mean<00:04:22.440> you<00:04:23.440> should<00:04:23.470> only<00:04:24.039> stick

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
that I don't mean you should only stick

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.800 
that I don't mean you should only stick
to<00:04:24.280> one<00:04:24.610> way<00:04:24.760> of<00:04:24.910> foot<00:04:25.090> work<00:04:25.120> you<00:04:25.419> always<00:04:25.630> want

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
to one way of foot work you always want

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.090 
to one way of foot work you always want
to<00:04:25.840> be<00:04:25.930> dynamic<00:04:26.470> you<00:04:26.590> always<00:04:26.800> want<00:04:26.979> to<00:04:27.010> learn

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
to be dynamic you always want to learn

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.150 
to be dynamic you always want to learn
both<00:04:27.370> ways<00:04:27.639> and<00:04:28.440> I<00:04:29.440> think<00:04:29.740> that's<00:04:29.889> about<00:04:30.010> it

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
both ways and I think that's about it

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.750 
both ways and I think that's about it
for<00:04:30.310> the<00:04:30.550> video<00:04:30.820> so<00:04:31.479> if<00:04:31.630> you're<00:04:31.780> right-handed

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
for the video so if you're right-handed

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.180 
for the video so if you're right-handed
clockwise<00:04:33.760> if<00:04:34.210> you're<00:04:34.389> left-handed<00:04:35.190> counter

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
clockwise if you're left-handed counter

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.830 
clockwise if you're left-handed counter
clockwise<00:04:36.400> and<00:04:36.940> when<00:04:37.030> I<00:04:37.060> say<00:04:37.210> right-handed<00:04:37.750> or

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
clockwise and when I say right-handed or

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.810 
clockwise and when I say right-handed or
left-handed<00:04:37.870> I<00:04:38.410> mean<00:04:38.590> which<00:04:39.160> hand<00:04:39.490> do<00:04:39.669> you

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820
