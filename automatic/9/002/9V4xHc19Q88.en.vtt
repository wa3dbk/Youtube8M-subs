00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.790
 video on revolverlab.com we 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:13.879
 we are at samsung booth 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.490
 part of the exhibition messi 2015 and in my 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:18.410
 hands new galaxy gear we are which 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.010
 supports new samsung smartphones 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.500
 galaxy s6 and samsung galaxy s 6 edge 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.170
 what is the difference from earlier versions 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.310
 gear gar they became much easier once a year 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.320
 it became easier but appeared 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.300
 air vents so as not to sweat 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.160
 head and at the same time naturally 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.240
 graphics and device performance 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.710
 decreased by as much as 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.510
 improved performance of new 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.910
 smartphone galaxy s6 galaxy s6 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.100
 galaxy s6 edge first impressions 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.140
 The device is very doubtful I 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.910
 I tried it on video games and I can 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.410
 say what if you buy yourself such 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.210
 the device you will need to be sure 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.430
 buy yourself a chair that 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.080
 rotates 360 degrees otherwise not 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.250
 imagine how you can play if you 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.020
 you will play standing for sure 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.630
 dizzy so you have to 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.580
 constantly sit and look at 360 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.710
 degrees in games everything happens very 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.900
 cool graphics don't say what's great 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.820
 she is as good as she can 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.890
 show this galaxy s6 display 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.080
 grainy little visible but the fact 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.670
 your head control 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.100
 the sensitivity is excellent i.e. 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.050
 elementary head lighting per degree 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.700
 and you have a feeling that you mouse 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.260
 move very cool aim very 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.060
 cool fly if you play for example 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.770
 shooters to this device are not 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.600
 special such 200 samsung companies 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.760
 with the help of it you control already and 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.380
 shoot reload and do 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.170
 additional device actions 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.170
 certainly interesting if you are 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.480
 the owner of the smartphone galaxy laptop 4 or 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.070
 same galaxy ace with it costs about 200 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.240
 dollars it will be a great buy on 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.190
 I don't need a gift for myself 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.010
 there are some controls here 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.990
 here here only here comes the tournament 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.970
 which adjusts the brightness and clarity 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.040
 images if the picture is not for you 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.930

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.880
 Here is such a sensor trackpad and using 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.320
 which you navigate by yourself 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.539
 request when you choose your game 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.789
 either put a new video or photo 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:10.900

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.910
 whole device really 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.099
 interesting and tasteful and we understand that 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.660
 virtual reality is a thing that 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.150
