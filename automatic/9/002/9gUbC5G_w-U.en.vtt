00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.320

 in the room an exhibition of the place 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.840
 like last year it was to go back so in a 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.410
 system itself 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.410
 it's a resignation or taking a second and a half after 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.259
 a career an editorial line of the point we can fail 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.259
 and then do not forget the tnt 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 no complaints 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.120
 to improve revenue and marie-france that these churches and a 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.170
 waterproof makeup

 the palace of las vegas 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.170
 never ate very well that I also saw crying 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.469
 because we will wait in the pan 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:13.909
 we go with 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:16.979
 butter and oil obviously to talk about them 

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:21.389
 a lot of blood said here for a little bit we would have almost 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.569
 the Italian happened at the time I'm talking to you 

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:32.429
 you feel concerned 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:35.629
 which should do a lot better 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:40.589
 and we never imposed ourselves on nancy at the end so still go there 

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:43.589
 what did they do to learn something 

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:46.049

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.089

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:02.949
 continue our series 

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:05.879
 we could have taken place in several countries 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.879
 I did say it makes me dream 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:18.369
 now that's the last now now against the euro 

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:21.369

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:30.449
 I prefer it's true 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:33.529
 barracks so here we talk about the wolf 

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:34.760
 neighbour 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.749
 at the same time with great sincerity 

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:38.780
 it's monstrous 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.969
 June 5th 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:43.289

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:48.289
 jousting some good basics 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:52.429
 eric woerth and camp ouattara 

00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:53.819
 a news all over the east 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.049
 days 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.979
 we are really everywhere not just like it's a bad time 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.039
 Lindsay Lohan 

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:05.039
 a little coat and vaud the ain 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.319
 zero rate instruments 

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:11.260
 a great team 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.869
 in a statement 

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:15.089
 but that's the technique 

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:16.639
 francis the basser 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:17.919
 she is incompetent 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.919
 but what are his missions 

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:49.379
 here 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:51.499
 or even mister 

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:52.639
 number 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:53.860
 the team sky 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.610
 a feather for us 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.800
 and as usual the snsm 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.099
 a little closed just a little bit the problem was that the end of his life 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:06.270
 sandrine 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.880
 so there we removed the bronze to the euro quoted 1 5124 

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:14.089
 the discomfort is now deep that this 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.020
 they are men is this season in asia 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.379
 nice way to explain customers 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:25.379
 what I do 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:29.270
 hush 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.069
 thank you to know how you want we'll see more 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:35.760
 complete faure c 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.639
 it's crazy 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.449
 did not remain passive 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:42.689
 he is saving his life 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:45.830
 the higher it is 113 5 6% 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.629
 even if this season tonight 

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:51.629
 it's the success of claviÃ¨res 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:54.819
 the serious things 

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:56.909
 hush 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:58.529
 Freche 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:01.529
 so for four people 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:04.639
 that said you have to see everything 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:07.259
 it's difficult 

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:09.369
 m 

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:10.869
 field 

00:06:10.869 --> 00:06:15.849
 without blinking it is a rally had fallen to 1 6% for citizens 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:19.399
 as particularly fond of putting off the cover the news is that all 

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:20.409
 teachers 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:24.249
 it takes at least a small advance faster detailed prosecutor 

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:25.990
 It's very difficult 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.819
 his pieces to prepare the interventions 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:33.610
 gold in the delay subway of the a380 a season of loves and saint-denis 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:38.099
 but why the ps might not be the same good lesson for the next 

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:41.249
 year so we will have the same job 

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:43.719
 this is due to human error 

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:46.169
 the most polluting to displease him 

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:48.460
 but in the end it's to eat this summer 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:49.159
 these days 

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:52.159
 we but not to have indicted on Saturday to bourges per month 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.219
 res 

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:09.479
 it took three quarters of an hour because one has to be a wise woman was reduced it 

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:12.679
 there is now more to end a soap opera last summer quarter 

00:07:12.679 --> 00:07:14.879
 time 

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:17.879
 - 27th of February 

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:26.849

00:07:26.849 --> 00:07:27.990
 my eldest son 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.569
 That's a good point 

00:07:29.569 --> 00:07:32.569
 the jonas brothers 1 4% 

00:07:33.949 --> 00:07:36.509
 the action lost 3 37% of revenue 

00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:39.819
 to be more importantly this other thing today I think we 

00:07:39.819 --> 00:07:43.349
 will start the year the value she was the first to give your opinion 

00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:45.319
 as for the head 

00:07:45.319 --> 00:07:48.319
