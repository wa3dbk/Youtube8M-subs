00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.070
 despite the fact that Javier Hernández has only 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.590
 played 17 minutes with the manchester 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.270
 united in the last 2 months of that 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.340
 André saved just played a 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.560
 full match last Sunday with 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.840
 the valence against Barcelona and that 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.150
 Diego Reyes does not make his debut with the port 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.859
 in the first division lusa el chepo 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.349
 he assured that each of these players 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.839
 They are in good level and available for 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.730
 this Friday will face honduras 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:34.320
 he also remembered that the match against 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.290
 ivory coast makes it a couple of 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.720
 Weeks when they scored 4-1 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.790
 as a good reference thinking about what 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.760
 what could be your alignment for this 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.150
 match against the Central American team 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.070
 saved he played the game against 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.590
 Barcelona 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.350
 if the pea within diego change has 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.559
 played with the second in 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.690
 in portugal but has had activity and 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.120
 has followed the rhythm and all the 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.739
 we have followed we have their videos and we have 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.990
 been very aware of each of 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.790
 them of what is happening not the most 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.920
 in sports but also in its 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.490
 environment that gives us information for 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.780
 to be able to make decisions then that 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.330
 complicated because they are in good time and 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.940
 because they are good for and available 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.110
 for the national team when it 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.930
 did the meeting 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.929
 justino compeán invited to be able 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.630
 talk as responsible for the 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:32.819
 selection with the owners with whom 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.340
 they were there and able to have a 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:37.159
 talk as I usually do when 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.780
 I go to any club to have my theories 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.929
 Of course there are questions 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.270
 that there are suggestions that there are many things 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:47.729
 but the decisions are some 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.770
 imposition has never been us 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.830
 we've had in some matches 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.600
 previous different ways of playing what 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.369
 We did with Brazil we did it with 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.770
 Japan we did it in other matches 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.150
 previously and the fact that they have 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.310
 appeared 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.810
 players like the chaco like damiana 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.540
 I'm going to talk about it too 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.119
 previously I think that his level improved 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.190
 much the chepo also denied that there 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.010
 there was some imposition on the part of 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.890
 the leaders to change the style 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.930
 the alignments in the Mexican team and 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.970
 he even mentioned that for example the 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.940
 appearance of players like christian 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.130
 giménez or damián álvarez have been due to 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.410
 that have greatly improved their level in 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.650
 last weeks also stressed that 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.470
 spoke with lucas lobos although that call 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.000
 no longer thrived for this call in 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.950
 the city of mexico with images 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.240
