00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
you're wide like this is easier to squat

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.729 
you're wide like this is easier to squat
down<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.690> get<00:00:45.930> your<00:00:46.020> arm<00:00:46.260> down<00:00:46.440> where<00:00:46.680> it

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
down and get your arm down where it

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.880 
down and get your arm down where it
needs<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.950> be<00:00:47.040> um<00:00:47.969> but<00:00:48.480> if<00:00:48.629> it's<00:00:48.780> like<00:00:48.930> close

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
needs to be um but if it's like close

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.040 
needs to be um but if it's like close
together<00:00:50.100> it's<00:00:50.460> just<00:00:50.489> yeah<00:00:51.360> just<00:00:51.690> don't<00:00:51.870> have

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
together it's just yeah just don't have

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.040 
together it's just yeah just don't have
as<00:00:52.170> much<00:00:52.289> balance<00:00:52.530> down<00:00:52.980> low<00:00:53.190> like<00:00:53.370> that

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
as much balance down low like that

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.240 
as much balance down low like that
basically<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.170> idea<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:55.739> trick<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.219> that

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
basically the idea of this trick is that

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.549 
basically the idea of this trick is that
you<00:00:56.640> are<00:00:56.850> doing<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.360> heel<00:00:57.690> side<00:00:57.930> check<00:00:58.230> wall

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
you are doing a heel side check wall

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.680 
you are doing a heel side check wall
grabbing<00:00:59.129> your<00:00:59.430> heel<00:00:59.670> side<00:00:59.910> rail<00:01:00.210> with<00:01:00.539> your

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
grabbing your heel side rail with your

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.439 
grabbing your heel side rail with your
back<00:01:00.870> hand<00:01:01.370> between<00:01:02.370> your<00:01:02.520> legs<00:01:02.760> but<00:01:03.270> not

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
back hand between your legs but not

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.990 
back hand between your legs but not

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
through the crotch like from behind

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.039 
through the crotch like from behind
between<00:01:06.000> your<00:01:06.119> legs<00:01:06.270> but<00:01:06.479> close<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.660> your<00:01:06.869> back

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
between your legs but close to your back

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.560 
between your legs but close to your back
foot<00:01:07.320> like<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.729> way<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:08.909> learned<00:01:09.299> this

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
foot like so the way I learned this

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.620 
foot like so the way I learned this
trick<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.770> decided<00:01:11.460> one<00:01:11.729> day<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.880> try<00:01:12.150> squat

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
trick is I decided one day to try squat

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.719 
trick is I decided one day to try squat
stand<00:01:12.960> up<00:01:13.080> checks<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.860> way<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.040> do<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.670> is

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
stand up checks the way you do this is

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.060 
stand up checks the way you do this is
try<00:01:15.330> squat<00:01:15.659> 180<00:01:16.049> just<00:01:16.290> get<00:01:16.409> down<00:01:16.530> low<00:01:16.799> and

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
try squat 180 just get down low and

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.100 
try squat 180 just get down low and
throw<00:01:17.790> your<00:01:17.939> weight<00:01:18.090> room<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.659> then<00:01:18.840> once<00:01:19.020> you

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
throw your weight room and then once you

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.510 
throw your weight room and then once you
progress<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.530> checks<00:01:19.830> don't<00:01:19.979> make<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.369> too

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
progress the checks don't make it too

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.980 
progress the checks don't make it too
elaborate<00:01:20.820> just<00:01:21.150> sort<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.540> like<00:01:21.720> when<00:01:21.900> you're

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
elaborate just sort of like when you're

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.380 
elaborate just sort of like when you're
beginning<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.439> learn<00:01:22.530> heelside<00:01:22.770> checks<00:01:23.390> sort

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
beginning to learn heelside checks sort

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.850 
beginning to learn heelside checks sort
of<00:01:24.479> like<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.720> same<00:01:24.960> motion<00:01:25.290> just<00:01:25.470> kick<00:01:25.680> out

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
of like that same motion just kick out

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.950 
of like that same motion just kick out
back<00:01:26.310> in<00:01:26.490> with<00:01:26.610> your<00:01:26.729> front<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.600> once<00:01:27.840> you

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
back in with your front and once you

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.719 
back in with your front and once you
have<00:01:28.140> those<00:01:28.290> down<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:29.100> pretty<00:01:29.340> confident

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
have those down and you pretty confident

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.700 
have those down and you pretty confident
with<00:01:29.820> your<00:01:29.939> balance<00:01:30.299> then<00:01:30.840> just<00:01:31.170> try<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.439> with

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
with your balance then just try it with

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.530 
with your balance then just try it with
your<00:01:31.860> hands<00:01:32.070> sticking<00:01:32.369> down<00:01:32.610> there<00:01:32.850> that's

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
your hands sticking down there that's

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.819 
your hands sticking down there that's
that's<00:01:33.810> how<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:33.990> learned<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.680> was

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
that's how I learned it it was

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.710 
that's how I learned it it was
relatively<00:01:35.220> easy<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.670> learn<00:01:35.790> but<00:01:36.030> you've<00:01:36.600> got

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
relatively easy to learn but you've got

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.600 
relatively easy to learn but you've got
to<00:01:36.750> remember<00:01:36.960> you're<00:01:37.200> gonna<00:01:37.619> fall<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.280> lot

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
to remember you're gonna fall a lot

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.100 
to remember you're gonna fall a lot
while<00:01:39.060> learning<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:39.420> trick<00:01:39.600> mostly

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
while learning this trick mostly

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.960 
while learning this trick mostly
backwards<00:01:40.560> because<00:01:40.920> your<00:01:41.310> tendency<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.820> going

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
backwards because your tendency is going

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.569 
backwards because your tendency is going
to<00:01:42.030> be<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.210> lean<00:01:42.360> really<00:01:42.509> far<00:01:42.630> back<00:01:43.579> these

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
to be the lean really far back these

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.130 
to be the lean really far back these
pictures<00:01:45.000> are<00:01:45.119> very<00:01:45.299> much<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.600> fall<00:01:45.750> backward

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
pictures are very much to fall backward

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.300 
pictures are very much to fall backward
on<00:01:46.259> because<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.560> already<00:01:46.680> loaded<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.070> ground

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
on because you already loaded the ground

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.039 
on because you already loaded the ground
you're<00:01:48.000> not<00:01:48.119> don't<00:01:48.299> have<00:01:48.450> very<00:01:48.570> much<00:01:48.750> velocity

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
you're not don't have very much velocity

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.270 
you're not don't have very much velocity
when<00:01:49.380> you're<00:01:49.470> hitting<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.680> ground<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.189> you

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
when you're hitting the ground and you

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.370 
when you're hitting the ground and you
can<00:01:50.369> stick<00:01:50.579> your<00:01:50.610> gloves<00:01:50.909> behind<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.380> alright

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
into it you're going to be writing and

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.459 
into it you're going to be writing and
probably<00:02:06.540> want<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.780> look<00:02:06.960> forward<00:02:07.350> when

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
probably want to look forward when

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.169 
probably want to look forward when
you're<00:02:07.590> doing<00:02:07.770> this

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
you're doing this

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.669 
you're doing this
when<00:02:08.719> you're<00:02:08.840> beginning<00:02:09.170> this<00:02:09.259> trick<00:02:09.530> you

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
when you're beginning this trick you

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.619 
when you're beginning this trick you
want<00:02:09.890> to<00:02:09.979> grab<00:02:10.280> a<00:02:10.519> little<00:02:10.759> bit<00:02:11.000> before<00:02:11.269> you

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 
want to grab a little bit before you

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:13.599 
want to grab a little bit before you
even<00:02:11.780> carve<00:02:12.140> into<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.500> slide<00:02:12.709> just<00:02:12.920> to<00:02:13.010> get<00:02:13.459> in

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:13.609 
even carve into the slide just to get in

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:15.729 
even carve into the slide just to get in
that<00:02:13.790> position<00:02:13.969> solid<00:02:14.810> so<00:02:15.439> you're<00:02:15.590> going<00:02:15.680> to

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
that position solid so you're going to

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.890 
that position solid so you're going to
grab<00:02:16.099> and<00:02:16.430> then<00:02:17.120> we're<00:02:17.390> going<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:17.599> want<00:02:17.810> to

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
grab and then we're going to want to

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.990 
grab and then we're going to want to
carve<00:02:18.799> into<00:02:19.010> it<00:02:19.189> pretty<00:02:19.310> hard<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:19.730> shift<00:02:19.909> your

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
carve into it pretty hard and shift your

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.580 
carve into it pretty hard and shift your
weight<00:02:20.120> onto<00:02:20.299> your<00:02:20.359> front<00:02:20.599> foot<00:02:20.750> so<00:02:21.319> you<00:02:21.379> can

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
weight onto your front foot so you can

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.380 
weight onto your front foot so you can
kick<00:02:21.829> out<00:02:22.040> your<00:02:22.280> back<00:02:22.700> foot<00:02:22.939> pretty<00:02:23.209> easily

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
kick out your back foot pretty easily

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.709 
kick out your back foot pretty easily
you're<00:02:24.019> going<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.230> want<00:02:24.379> to<00:02:24.500> kick<00:02:24.950> it<00:02:25.099> out<00:02:25.250> and

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:25.719 
you're going to want to kick it out and

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:28.209 
you're going to want to kick it out and
keep<00:02:26.719> your<00:02:26.900> front<00:02:27.170> foot<00:02:27.230> back<00:02:27.560> in<00:02:27.769> real<00:02:28.040> quick

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:28.219 
keep your front foot back in real quick

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:29.920 
keep your front foot back in real quick
that's<00:02:28.609> basically<00:02:28.909> what's<00:02:29.450> going<00:02:29.599> to<00:02:29.659> happen

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
that's basically what's going to happen

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.209 
that's basically what's going to happen
when<00:02:30.079> you're<00:02:30.139> first<00:02:30.319> learning<00:02:30.469> it<00:02:30.829> and<00:02:30.859> once

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:31.219 
when you're first learning it and once

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:33.280 
when you're first learning it and once
you<00:02:31.280> start<00:02:31.489> holding<00:02:31.639> it<00:02:31.849> out<00:02:31.939> more<00:02:32.290> you're

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
you start holding it out more you're

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.809 
you start holding it out more you're
going<00:02:33.409> to<00:02:33.469> work<00:02:33.560> on<00:02:33.739> weight<00:02:33.980> distribution<00:02:34.609> who

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
going to work on weight distribution who

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.390 
going to work on weight distribution who
what<00:02:34.939> needs<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.269> happen<00:02:35.299> is<00:02:35.920> for<00:02:36.920> the

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
what needs to happen is for the

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.009 
what needs to happen is for the
beginning<00:02:37.700> part<00:02:37.819> you're<00:02:38.420> going<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:38.659> put<00:02:38.810> most

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
beginning part you're going to put most

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.659 
beginning part you're going to put most
your<00:02:39.230> weight<00:02:39.349> on<00:02:39.469> your<00:02:39.500> front<00:02:39.620> foot<00:02:39.859> I'm<00:02:40.459> kick

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:40.669 
your weight on your front foot I'm kick

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:41.860 
your weight on your front foot I'm kick
it<00:02:40.790> out<00:02:40.879> and<00:02:41.060> when<00:02:41.150> you<00:02:41.180> start<00:02:41.419> holding<00:02:41.599> out<00:02:41.840> a

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
it out and when you start holding out a

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.830 
it out and when you start holding out a
little<00:02:42.019> more<00:02:42.879> logically<00:02:43.879> you're<00:02:44.329> going<00:02:44.599> to<00:02:44.659> be

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
little more logically you're going to be

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.059 
little more logically you're going to be
sort<00:02:45.109> of<00:02:45.169> balancing<00:02:45.680> your<00:02:45.739> weight<00:02:45.919> between

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
sort of balancing your weight between

sort of balancing your weight between
the<00:02:46.340> feet<00:02:46.459> and<00:02:46.669> when<00:02:46.819> you<00:02:46.879> bring<00:02:47.030> it<00:02:47.150> back<00:02:47.269> put

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
the feet and when you bring it back put

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.119 
the feet and when you bring it back put
most<00:02:47.780> your<00:02:47.959> weight<00:02:48.079> on<00:02:48.200> your<00:02:48.230> back<00:02:48.530> foot<00:02:49.010> so

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
most your weight on your back foot so

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:50.890 
most your weight on your back foot so
you<00:02:49.220> can<00:02:49.400> kick<00:02:49.879> this<00:02:50.030> forward<00:02:50.450> easily<00:02:50.810> with

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
you can kick this forward easily with

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.459 
you can kick this forward easily with
little<00:02:51.280> resistance<00:02:52.280> as<00:02:52.959> for<00:02:53.959> leaning<00:02:54.290> back

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:54.469 
little resistance as for leaning back

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:56.589 
little resistance as for leaning back
and<00:02:54.650> forth<00:02:54.889> your<00:02:55.459> tendency<00:02:56.060> is<00:02:56.239> going<00:02:56.450> to<00:02:56.510> be

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
and forth your tendency is going to be

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.539 
and forth your tendency is going to be
to<00:02:56.719> lean<00:02:56.900> too<00:02:57.109> far<00:02:57.319> back<00:02:57.560> you're<00:02:58.310> just<00:02:58.430> going

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
to lean too far back you're just going

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.159 
to lean too far back you're just going
to<00:02:58.609> need<00:02:58.730> to<00:02:58.760> balance<00:02:58.939> yourself<00:02:59.269> literally

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:00.169 
to need to balance yourself literally

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:02.640 
to need to balance yourself literally
the<00:03:00.409> way<00:03:00.530> I<00:03:00.560> learned<00:03:01.069> this<00:03:01.310> was<00:03:01.969> by<00:03:02.180> going

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
the way I learned this was by going

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.559 
the way I learned this was by going
falling<00:03:03.650> and<00:03:03.889> then<00:03:04.549> figuring<00:03:05.090> out<00:03:05.269> which<00:03:05.389> way

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
falling and then figuring out which way

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.599 
falling and then figuring out which way
I<00:03:05.599> fell<00:03:05.959> and<00:03:06.250> adjusting<00:03:07.250> my<00:03:07.370> weight

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
I fell and adjusting my weight

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.339 
I fell and adjusting my weight
accordingly<00:03:08.180> what<00:03:08.629> usually<00:03:08.780> would<00:03:09.019> happen<00:03:09.260> is

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
accordingly what usually would happen is

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:10.659 
accordingly what usually would happen is
I<00:03:09.409> would<00:03:09.530> fall<00:03:09.709> backwards<00:03:10.129> and<00:03:10.250> put<00:03:10.370> my<00:03:10.459> glove

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:10.669 
I would fall backwards and put my glove

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:12.759 
I would fall backwards and put my glove
down<00:03:10.819> just<00:03:11.090> a<00:03:11.150> CV<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:11.719> then<00:03:12.470> I<00:03:12.530> would<00:03:12.650> do<00:03:12.739> that

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
down just a CV and then I would do that

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:13.750 
down just a CV and then I would do that
a<00:03:12.889> couple<00:03:12.979> times<00:03:13.220> and<00:03:13.489> then<00:03:13.609> lean<00:03:13.729> forward

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
a couple times and then lean forward

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.330 
a couple times and then lean forward
more<00:03:14.269> and<00:03:14.449> more<00:03:14.599> each<00:03:14.780> time<00:03:14.840> and<00:03:15.349> if<00:03:16.129> I<00:03:16.190> lean

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
more and more each time and if I lean

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.710 
more and more each time and if I lean
forward<00:03:16.609> too<00:03:16.669> much<00:03:16.790> at<00:03:16.909> fault<00:03:17.090> more<00:03:17.389> than<00:03:17.569> just

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
forward too much at fault more than just

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.270 
forward too much at fault more than just
lean<00:03:17.870> back<00:03:17.900> more<00:03:18.379> you're<00:03:18.889> going<00:03:19.040> to<00:03:19.099> want<00:03:19.220> to

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
lean back more you're going to want to

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.430 
lean back more you're going to want to
lean<00:03:19.459> back<00:03:19.669> more<00:03:20.030> than<00:03:20.060> a<00:03:20.510> heel<00:03:20.989> side<00:03:21.199> check

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
lean back more than a heel side check

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.559 
lean back more than a heel side check
just<00:03:22.010> because<00:03:22.280> a<00:03:22.549> lot<00:03:23.150> more<00:03:23.269> weights

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
just because a lot more weights

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.080 
just because a lot more weights
concentrated<00:03:24.319> down<00:03:24.470> there<00:03:24.739> and<00:03:24.919> you<00:03:25.819> want<00:03:26.000> to

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
concentrated down there and you want to

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.879 
concentrated down there and you want to
have<00:03:26.269> a<00:03:26.299> little<00:03:26.510> more<00:03:26.629> pressure<00:03:26.840> lean<00:03:27.680> back

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:27.889 
have a little more pressure lean back

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:29.619 
have a little more pressure lean back
too<00:03:28.129> far<00:03:28.159> at<00:03:28.459> first<00:03:28.699> to<00:03:28.849> catch<00:03:29.030> yourself<00:03:29.239> I've

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:29.629 
too far at first to catch yourself I've

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:32.080 
too far at first to catch yourself I've

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
you can figure out how to make its
