of these and two small smaller size
clips<00:01:21.480> for<00:01:22.480> this<00:01:23.340> because<00:01:24.340> if<00:01:24.610> stock<00:01:24.880> ones<00:01:25.150> are

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
clips for this because if stock ones are

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.780

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
the actual piece and they're each three

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.210 
the actual piece and they're each three
dollars<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:36.130> you<00:01:36.190> get<00:01:37.200> all<00:01:38.200> four<00:01:38.590> for<00:01:38.830> six

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
dollars so you get all four for six

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.080 
dollars so you get all four for six
dollars<00:01:39.460> you<00:01:39.790> could<00:01:39.940> do<00:01:40.090> that<00:01:40.300> now<00:01:41.910> it<00:01:42.910> only

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
dollars you could do that now it only

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.360 
dollars you could do that now it only
comes<00:01:43.510> with<00:01:43.630> that<00:01:43.930> that<00:01:44.560> you<00:01:44.710> will<00:01:44.860> use<00:01:45.100> and

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
comes with that that you will use and

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.130 
comes with that that you will use and
maybe<00:01:45.610> these<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:48.430> what<00:01:48.730> I<00:01:48.760> would<00:01:49.450> my<00:01:49.600> dad<00:01:49.840> got

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
maybe these so what I would my dad got

00:01:50.140 --> 00:02:08.600 
maybe these so what I would my dad got
for<00:01:50.290> me<00:01:58.530> he<00:01:59.530> got<00:01:59.740> those<00:01:59.980> from<00:02:00.310> his<00:02:00.490> work

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:36.300 

and<00:02:32.819> it<00:02:33.819> was<00:02:34.120> clean<00:02:34.420> but<00:02:35.350> I<00:02:35.560> just<00:02:35.830> got<00:02:36.069> those

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
and it was clean but I just got those

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.050 
and it was clean but I just got those
and<00:02:36.700> then<00:02:37.410> all<00:02:38.410> you'll<00:02:38.680> basically<00:02:38.950> need<00:02:39.370> is

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
and then all you'll basically need is

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.000 
and then all you'll basically need is
some<00:02:40.360> of<00:02:40.480> these<00:02:41.400> smaller<00:02:42.400> size<00:02:43.000> pliers<00:02:44.010> and

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
some of these smaller size pliers and

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:58.860 
some of these smaller size pliers and
then<00:02:45.489> your<00:02:55.830> really<00:02:56.830> cool<00:02:57.130> without<00:02:58.090> these<00:02:58.569> on

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
then your really cool without these on

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.190 
then your really cool without these on
that<00:03:00.090> so<00:03:01.090> you<00:03:01.300> could<00:03:01.480> see<00:03:01.660> the<00:03:01.780> difference

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
that so you could see the difference

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:18.000 
that so you could see the difference
like<00:03:02.410> an<00:03:03.370> inch<00:03:03.910> difference<00:03:14.340> these<00:03:15.340> two<00:03:16.590> or<00:03:17.590> one

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
like an inch difference these two or one

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:24.390 
like an inch difference these two or one
each<00:03:18.280> path<00:03:18.700> I<00:03:18.880> got<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.329> tax<00:03:22.739> all<00:03:23.739> you<00:03:24.010> need<00:03:24.220> is

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
each path I got the tax all you need is

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:32.069 
each path I got the tax all you need is
these<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:26.650> get<00:03:26.860> it<00:03:26.980> down<00:03:27.160> from<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.549> bottom<00:03:31.079> and

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
these to get it down from the bottom and

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.449 
these to get it down from the bottom and
that<00:03:32.320> that's<00:03:32.739> that's<00:03:33.280> it<00:03:34.829> so<00:03:35.829> I<00:03:35.859> got<00:03:36.100> it<00:03:36.130> for

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
that that's that's it so I got it for

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.680 
that that's that's it so I got it for
the<00:03:36.730> basic<00:03:37.299> idea<00:03:37.660> from<00:03:38.019> July<00:03:38.620> 20<00:03:39.010> to<00:03:39.510> 22<00:03:40.510> but

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
the basic idea from July 20 to 22 but

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.199 
the basic idea from July 20 to 22 but
you<00:03:40.780> could<00:03:40.930> do<00:03:41.049> that

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
you could do that

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:48.990 
you could do that
instead<00:03:43.209> just<00:03:45.750> get<00:03:46.750> the<00:03:46.959> Russell's<00:03:47.650> part<00:03:48.190> 37

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
instead just get the Russell's part 37

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.170 
instead just get the Russell's part 37
what<00:03:49.690> oven<00:03:49.959> and<00:03:50.829> it's<00:03:51.700> cheaper<00:03:53.400> so<00:03:54.400> it<00:03:54.609> looks<00:03:54.820> a

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
what oven and it's cheaper so it looks a

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.720 
what oven and it's cheaper so it looks a
lot<00:03:55.510> a<00:03:55.810> lot<00:03:56.109> better<00:03:57.510> then<00:03:58.950> this<00:03:59.950> is<00:04:00.100> how<00:04:00.489> was

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
lot a lot better then this is how was

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.349 
lot a lot better then this is how was
before<00:04:01.620> before<00:04:02.620> I<00:04:03.090> was<00:04:04.090> like<00:04:04.269> right<00:04:04.900> there

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
before before I was like right there

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:12.229 
before before I was like right there
didn't<00:04:07.359> even<00:04:07.480> touch<00:04:07.720> the<00:04:07.900> chassis<00:04:09.780> and<00:04:10.780> now

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
didn't even touch the chassis and now

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.580 
didn't even touch the chassis and now
slick<00:04:13.019> an<00:04:13.170> inch<00:04:13.379> or<00:04:13.620> closed<00:04:14.340> down<00:04:15.229> at<00:04:16.229> least

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
slick an inch or closed down at least

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:27.590 
slick an inch or closed down at least
halfway<00:04:16.979> there<00:04:17.549> halfway<00:04:18.169> done<00:04:26.030> it<00:04:27.030> looks<00:04:27.210> cool

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
halfway there halfway done it looks cool

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.640 
halfway there halfway done it looks cool
but<00:04:27.630> it<00:04:27.870> was<00:04:28.650> talking<00:04:28.889> to<00:04:29.190> my<00:04:29.340> daddy's<00:04:30.650> looks

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.909 
kind of wide you could get a / 2 wheel
drive<00:04:36.090> a<00:04:36.600> arms<00:04:36.960> and<00:04:37.280> those<00:04:38.280> are<00:04:38.520> like<00:04:38.699> narrower

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.870 
there forever
and<00:05:14.340> the<00:05:14.849> little<00:05:15.180> hole<00:05:15.419> there<00:05:16.490> put<00:05:17.490> some<00:05:17.669> tape

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
and the little hole there put some tape

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.610 
and the little hole there put some tape
around<00:05:17.940> where<00:05:18.539> I<00:05:18.570> cut<00:05:18.900> it<00:05:19.020> because<00:05:19.110> I<00:05:19.349> couldn't

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
around where I cut it because I couldn't

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.120 
around where I cut it because I couldn't
with<00:05:19.770> the<00:05:19.889> pocket<00:05:20.280> I<00:05:20.400> had<00:05:20.669> I<00:05:21.530> was<00:05:22.530> really<00:05:22.919> not<00:05:23.070> a

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
with the pocket I had I was really not a

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.719 
with the pocket I had I was really not a
good<00:05:23.340> idea

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
good idea

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:26.210 
good idea
so<00:05:24.599> it<00:05:24.720> was<00:05:24.870> all<00:05:25.050> sharp<00:05:25.349> and<00:05:25.590> I<00:05:25.680> just<00:05:25.860> put<00:05:26.010> tape

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
so it was all sharp and I just put tape

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.740 
so it was all sharp and I just put tape
so<00:05:26.820> now<00:05:27.000> it's<00:05:27.120> pretty<00:05:27.330> good

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
so now it's pretty good

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.710 
so now it's pretty good
it's<00:05:28.620> better<00:05:28.919> like<00:05:29.010> that<00:05:29.190> lots<00:05:30.120> of<00:05:30.300> more<00:05:30.449> and

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
it's better like that lots of more and

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.550 
it's better like that lots of more and
they<00:05:30.990> stay<00:05:31.979> school<00:05:32.400> I<00:05:33.229> recommend<00:05:34.229> if<00:05:34.380> you're

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
they stay school I recommend if you're
