00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.180
 hello everyone today we will try to solve 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.860
 error that occurs at startup 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:13.530
 minecraft as well as the game itself error 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:16.289
 common java team platform error 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.350
 all ill possible solution 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.740
 problems first it is not installed by 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.279
 in 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.260
 Well, maybe the error of this oil is not 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.990
 will be because of this because well rather 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.720
 total when installing any system i 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.279
 but everything will be established well if you do not have it 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.110
 you can download it by the link in 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.969
 description 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.250
 the second option is not match 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.600
 bit system and crushed 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.219
 java bit depth 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.300
 Well, too, as if this is not something 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.829
 problem but if you have a valid system 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.579
 32-bit then you need to install and 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:57.530
 32-bit system in 32-bit java 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.899
 if the system is 64 bit then 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.070
 accordingly you need to install 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.979
 64-bit java and 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:10.549
 32 because some applications 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:12.240
 run on a 32-bit system well 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.119
 government can be as follows 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.750
 my computer properties are system type 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.229
 Well, then this is relative because 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.200
 what to download with the best 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.979
 and tuber yourself another well with this 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.189
 sorted out 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.720
 Again, a reference is the same as in the description 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:35.400
 the third option that helped me 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.259
 This is the removal of the d3d gear program well 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.430
 which displays fps in games and 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.829
 allows you to record and 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.350
 I personally because of this 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.750
 the program had an error I deleted it and 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.610
 everything works so check if u 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.740
 you have the program and if it 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.680
 accordingly available 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.299
 another solution to this problem 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.520
 Of course, reinstalling 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.009
 minecraft but refers he crossed 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.640
 reviews but maybe fit 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.240
 pirates 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:07.080
 just go to daddy appdata roaming 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.509
 and delete the folder there. minecraft further 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.690
 We go accordingly to the launcher, he 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.610
 pumping all over again and maybe it's 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.340
 help you so take advantage 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.750
 these tips and hope you 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.750
