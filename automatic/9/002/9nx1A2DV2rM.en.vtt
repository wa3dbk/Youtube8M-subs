then<00:03:10.070> you<00:03:10.220> go<00:03:10.400> down<00:03:10.610> and<00:03:10.820> get<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:10.970> center

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
then you go down and get the center

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.990 
then you go down and get the center
point<00:03:11.780> of<00:03:11.930> your<00:03:12.079> loop<00:03:12.380> and<00:03:12.799> you<00:03:13.459> bring<00:03:13.730> it<00:03:13.880> up

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
point of your loop and you bring it up

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.800 
point of your loop and you bring it up
and<00:03:14.299> you<00:03:14.360> put<00:03:14.450> it<00:03:14.750> between<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.530> dolls<00:03:16.220> legs

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
and you put it between the dolls legs

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.550 
and you put it between the dolls legs
the<00:03:17.810> armature<00:03:18.290> legs<00:03:18.530> and<00:03:19.489> you<00:03:19.610> stretch<00:03:20.030> out

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
the armature legs and you stretch out

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.160 
the armature legs and you stretch out
your<00:03:21.560> two<00:03:21.769> loops<00:03:22.120> you<00:03:23.120> grab<00:03:23.450> it<00:03:23.660> down<00:03:23.870> by<00:03:24.110> the

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
your two loops you grab it down by the

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.340 
your two loops you grab it down by the
toothpick<00:03:24.829> section<00:03:25.989> holding<00:03:26.989> it<00:03:27.079> pretty

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
toothpick section holding it pretty

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:33.400 
toothpick section holding it pretty
tight<00:03:28.690> and<00:03:29.690> you<00:03:29.780> separate<00:03:30.380> your<00:03:30.530> loops<00:03:32.410> and

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
tight and you separate your loops and

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.599 
tight and you separate your loops and
get<00:03:33.620> a<00:03:33.650> good<00:03:33.950> grip<00:03:34.220> on<00:03:34.430> them<00:03:36.250> and<00:03:37.250> you're<00:03:37.489> going

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
get a good grip on them and you're going

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:38.890 
get a good grip on them and you're going
to<00:03:37.700> wind<00:03:38.000> them<00:03:38.329> so<00:03:38.510> you're<00:03:38.600> going<00:03:38.720> to<00:03:38.750> be

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
to wind them so you're going to be

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.009 
to wind them so you're going to be
winding<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.560> two<00:03:39.799> loops<00:03:40.100> creating<00:03:41.060> four

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
winding the two loops creating four

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.530 
winding the two loops creating four
pieces<00:03:42.500> of<00:03:42.680> wire<00:03:43.100> for<00:03:43.519> a<00:03:43.579> nice<00:03:43.940> strong<00:03:44.660> spine

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
pieces of wire for a nice strong spine

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.960 
pieces of wire for a nice strong spine
and<00:03:47.540> you<00:03:47.690> wind<00:03:47.959> it<00:03:48.140> tightly<00:03:48.680> up<00:03:48.890> you<00:03:49.430> eyeball

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
and you wind it tightly up you eyeball

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.879 
and you wind it tightly up you eyeball
it<00:03:50.209> to<00:03:50.690> the<00:03:50.810> point<00:03:51.109> where<00:03:51.320> you<00:03:51.440> think<00:03:51.470> you're

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:51.889 
it to the point where you think you're

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:55.840 
it to the point where you think you're
up<00:03:52.070> in<00:03:52.250> the<00:03:52.430> in<00:03:52.639> the<00:03:53.449> arm<00:03:53.690> section<00:03:54.169> I<00:03:54.699> like<00:03:55.699> to

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
up in the in the arm section I like to

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:56.960 
up in the in the arm section I like to
use<00:03:56.000> the<00:03:56.180> back<00:03:56.419> of<00:03:56.660> them

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
use the back of them

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.800

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
old let me get this guy out of the way

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.360 
old let me get this guy out of the way
okay<00:04:00.810> so<00:04:00.870> you<00:04:01.050> measure<00:04:01.410> from<00:04:01.680> your<00:04:01.920> hip<00:04:02.130> area

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
okay so you measure from your hip area

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.660 
okay so you measure from your hip area
and<00:04:03.360> you<00:04:03.600> keep<00:04:03.840> winding<00:04:04.230> until<00:04:04.830> you<00:04:04.950> get<00:04:05.220> up<00:04:05.430> to

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
and you keep winding until you get up to

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.440 
and you keep winding until you get up to
the<00:04:05.820> T<00:04:06.090> section<00:04:06.480> up<00:04:07.230> there<00:04:07.770> between<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.610> torso

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
the T section up there between the torso

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.690 
the T section up there between the torso
and<00:04:09.960> the<00:04:10.020> arms<00:04:12.590> now<00:04:13.590> once<00:04:13.890> you<00:04:14.040> get<00:04:14.220> up<00:04:14.400> there

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
and the arms now once you get up there

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.050 
and the arms now once you get up there
you're<00:04:15.210> going<00:04:15.360> to<00:04:15.420> separate<00:04:16.049> your<00:04:16.200> two<00:04:17.060> bunny

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
you're going to separate your two bunny

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.850 
you're going to separate your two bunny
ears<00:04:19.370> and<00:04:20.630> you're<00:04:21.630> going<00:04:21.750> to<00:04:21.780> open<00:04:22.200> up<00:04:22.350> your

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
ears and you're going to open up your

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.610 
ears and you're going to open up your
big<00:04:23.040> loops<00:04:23.720> and<00:04:24.720> you're<00:04:24.870> going<00:04:25.020> to<00:04:25.050> divide<00:04:25.230> it

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
big loops and you're going to divide it

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.060 
big loops and you're going to divide it
in<00:04:25.740> half<00:04:25.970> and<00:04:26.970> put<00:04:27.450> one<00:04:27.990> loop<00:04:28.260> up<00:04:28.530> towards<00:04:28.920> the

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
in half and put one loop up towards the

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.950 
in half and put one loop up towards the
top<00:04:29.100> you're<00:04:30.090> going<00:04:30.210> to<00:04:30.330> come<00:04:30.510> to<00:04:30.720> the<00:04:30.840> other

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
top you're going to come to the other

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.440 
top you're going to come to the other
side<00:04:31.640> divide<00:04:32.640> it<00:04:32.880> in<00:04:33.030> half<00:04:33.060> and<00:04:33.780> put<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:35.450> one

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
side divide it in half and put the one

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.210 
side divide it in half and put the one
loop<00:04:36.720> up<00:04:36.960> to<00:04:37.320> the<00:04:37.440> top<00:04:37.680> and<00:04:37.980> you're<00:04:38.040> going<00:04:38.190> to

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
loop up to the top and you're going to

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.860 
loop up to the top and you're going to
take<00:04:38.400> the<00:04:38.580> two<00:04:38.790> top<00:04:38.820> loops<00:04:40.070> and<00:04:41.600> twist<00:04:42.600> those

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
take the two top loops and twist those

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.680 
take the two top loops and twist those
together<00:04:43.670> and<00:04:44.670> then<00:04:44.820> this<00:04:45.120> is<00:04:45.300> going<00:04:45.450> to<00:04:45.510> give

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
together and then this is going to give

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:51.140 
together and then this is going to give
you<00:04:45.810> a<00:04:45.840> nice<00:04:46.170> strong<00:04:47.570> neck<00:04:48.570> area<00:04:49.790> now<00:04:50.790> for<00:04:51.030> the

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
you a nice strong neck area now for the

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.930 
you a nice strong neck area now for the
tiniest<00:04:51.720> dolls<00:04:52.380> you<00:04:52.950> might<00:04:53.190> want<00:04:53.460> to<00:04:53.610> cut

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
tiniest dolls you might want to cut

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.620 
tiniest dolls you might want to cut
these<00:04:54.180> so<00:04:55.050> that<00:04:55.080> you<00:04:55.260> only<00:04:55.500> have<00:04:55.740> two<00:04:55.980> wires

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
these so that you only have two wires

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.600 
these so that you only have two wires
but<00:04:57.630> four<00:04:57.960> or<00:04:58.110> five<00:04:58.350> inch<00:04:58.590> dolls<00:04:58.919> the<00:04:59.340> four

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
but four or five inch dolls the four

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.210 
but four or five inch dolls the four
wires<00:04:59.850> is<00:05:00.210> fine<00:05:00.480> now<00:05:01.200> at<00:05:01.350> this<00:05:01.470> point<00:05:01.800> I<00:05:01.950> find

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
wires is fine now at this point I find

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.580 
wires is fine now at this point I find
that<00:05:02.400> the<00:05:02.580> wire<00:05:03.060> starts<00:05:03.450> to<00:05:03.750> rebel<00:05:04.140> a<00:05:04.169> little

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
that the wire starts to rebel a little

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.159 
that the wire starts to rebel a little
bit<00:05:04.770> so<00:05:05.040> I<00:05:05.070> cut<00:05:05.490> these<00:05:05.730> to<00:05:06.480> release<00:05:06.870> some<00:05:07.140> of

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
bit so I cut these to release some of

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.130 
bit so I cut these to release some of
the<00:05:07.440> tension<00:05:07.680> and<00:05:08.460> it<00:05:09.150> makes<00:05:09.360> it<00:05:09.510> easier<00:05:09.900> to

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
the tension and it makes it easier to

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.650 
the tension and it makes it easier to
twist<00:05:10.500> so<00:05:11.340> you're<00:05:11.460> going<00:05:11.610> to<00:05:11.640> twist<00:05:11.940> your<00:05:12.120> arms

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
twist so you're going to twist your arms

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.540 
twist so you're going to twist your arms
down<00:05:12.930> you're<00:05:13.440> only<00:05:13.620> going<00:05:13.830> to<00:05:13.890> need<00:05:13.950> the<00:05:14.280> two

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
down you're only going to need the two

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.270 
down you're only going to need the two
pieces<00:05:14.970> of<00:05:15.120> wire<00:05:15.510> here<00:05:16.020> you<00:05:16.680> want<00:05:16.890> it<00:05:17.010> to<00:05:17.130> be

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
pieces of wire here you want it to be

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.650 
pieces of wire here you want it to be
thin<00:05:17.700> in<00:05:18.060> the<00:05:18.120> arm<00:05:18.960> section<00:05:20.270> now<00:05:21.270> while<00:05:21.479> I'm

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
thin in the arm section now while I'm

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.260 
thin in the arm section now while I'm
twisting<00:05:22.140> this<00:05:22.290> I'll<00:05:22.530> just<00:05:22.860> say<00:05:23.700> that<00:05:24.000> this

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
twisting this I'll just say that this

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.480 
twisting this I'll just say that this
armature<00:05:25.200> I'm<00:05:25.710> going<00:05:26.100> to<00:05:26.190> be<00:05:26.310> demonstrating
