music calm so I noticed on one of the

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.300 
music calm so I noticed on one of the
comments<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:15.330> I<00:00:15.690> received<00:00:16.049> actually<00:00:16.440> from<00:00:17.070> a

little while ago was in regards to

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.990 
little while ago was in regards to
learning<00:00:21.510> how<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.900> develop<00:00:22.699> agility<00:00:23.699> learning

how<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.090> play<00:00:24.359> fast<00:00:24.830> now<00:00:25.830> I'm<00:00:25.890> sorry<00:00:26.189> if<00:00:26.340> I

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
how to play fast now I'm sorry if I

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.400 
how to play fast now I'm sorry if I
address<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:27.060> partly<00:00:27.720> in<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.930> different<00:00:28.260> video

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
address this partly in a different video

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.990 
address this partly in a different video
already<00:00:28.920> but<00:00:29.160> I'm<00:00:29.250> going<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.490> go<00:00:29.640> over<00:00:29.670> this

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
already but I'm going to go over this

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.680 
already but I'm going to go over this
again<00:00:30.949> because<00:00:31.949> it's<00:00:32.130> it's<00:00:32.550> helpful<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.300> kind

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
again because it's it's helpful to kind

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.069 
again because it's it's helpful to kind
of<00:00:33.840> understanding<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:35.100> problems<00:00:35.579> with<00:00:36.079> with

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
of understanding the problems with with

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.600 
of understanding the problems with with
playing<00:00:37.440> fast<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.010> with<00:00:38.100> coordination

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
playing fast and with coordination

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.360 
playing fast and with coordination
between<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.030> hands<00:00:40.010> first<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.129> all<00:00:41.219> it's

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
between the hands first of all it's

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.580 
between the hands first of all it's
important<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.820> understand<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.660> playing

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
important to understand that playing

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.100 
important to understand that playing
slow<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.340> playing<00:00:44.579> faster<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.270> very<00:00:45.780> very

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
slow and playing faster to very very

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.279 
slow and playing faster to very very
very<00:00:46.379> different<00:00:46.739> activities<00:00:47.989> it's<00:00:48.989> it's

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
very different activities it's it's

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.139 
very different activities it's it's
analogous<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.640> difference<00:00:50.969> between

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
analogous to the difference between

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.360 
analogous to the difference between
running<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.840> walking<00:00:52.250> certainly<00:00:53.250> you're

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
running and walking certainly you're

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.920 
running and walking certainly you're
both<00:00:53.520> moving<00:00:53.820> your<00:00:54.059> legs<00:00:54.300> but<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.660> actual

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
both moving your legs but the actual

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.979 
both moving your legs but the actual
feeling<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.500> quite<00:00:55.649> different<00:00:56.660> for<00:00:57.660> example

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
feeling is quite different for example

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.569 
feeling is quite different for example
walking<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.530> very<00:00:58.590> much<00:00:58.890> similar<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.250> slow

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
walking is very much similar to slow

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.819 
walking is very much similar to slow
playing<00:00:59.879> for<00:01:00.510> example<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:00.960> go<00:01:01.109> slowly<00:01:01.440> from

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
playing for example you go slowly from

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.600 
playing for example you go slowly from
from<00:01:02.190> one<00:01:02.399> finger<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:03.510> another<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:05.189> feel

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
from one finger to another and you feel

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.539 
from one finger to another and you feel
the<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.240> change<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.229> balance<00:01:07.710> especially

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
the the change of balance especially

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.940 
the the change of balance especially
when<00:01:09.030> you're<00:01:09.150> vibrating<00:01:09.810> from<00:01:10.170> finger<00:01:10.560> to

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
when you're vibrating from finger to

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.250 
when you're vibrating from finger to
finger<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.729> feel<00:01:12.030> as<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.540> go<00:01:12.720> back<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.170> forth

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
finger you feel as you go back and forth

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.649 
finger you feel as you go back and forth
that<00:01:13.770> you're<00:01:13.920> really<00:01:14.159> kind<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.490> settle<00:01:15.420> into

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
that you're really kind of settle into

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.359 
that you're really kind of settle into
that<00:01:15.810> particular<00:01:16.170> finger<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.070> then<00:01:17.220> you

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
that particular finger and then you

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.149 
that particular finger and then you
settle<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.390> next<00:01:18.600> one<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.320> and

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
settle in to the next one and and and

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.800 
settle in to the next one and and and
vice<00:01:20.400> versa<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:20.850> that's<00:01:21.240> something<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.750> I

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
vice versa that that's something that I

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.149 
vice versa that that's something that I
think<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.110> talked<00:01:22.350> about<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> little<00:01:22.860> bit<00:01:23.009> in

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
think I talked about a little bit in

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.999 
think I talked about a little bit in
this<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.549> Aswan<00:01:23.970> video<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:25.200> video<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.619> did<00:01:25.799> for

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
this in Aswan video the video I did for

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.980 
this in Aswan video the video I did for
for<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.659> that<00:01:27.659> piece<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:28.049> Swan<00:01:28.340> ice<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:29.729> on

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
for the that piece of Swan ice and so on

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.719 
for the that piece of Swan ice and so on
now<00:01:30.990> fast<00:01:31.259> playing<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:32.040> very<00:01:32.310> different

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
now fast playing is is very different

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.370 
now fast playing is is very different
fast<00:01:32.909> playing<00:01:33.180> actually<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.720> don't<00:01:33.960> want<00:01:34.229> to

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
fast playing actually you don't want to

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.370 
fast playing actually you don't want to
settle<00:01:34.650> in<00:01:34.890> as<00:01:35.070> much<00:01:35.400> on<00:01:35.700> each<00:01:35.939> finger<00:01:36.380> now

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
settle in as much on each finger now

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.350 
settle in as much on each finger now
this<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> point<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.340> contention<00:01:38.490> between<00:01:39.030> me

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
this is a point of contention between me

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.410 
this is a point of contention between me
and<00:01:39.780> some<00:01:40.439> other<00:01:40.619> string<00:01:41.070> teachers<00:01:41.460> but<00:01:42.240> it's

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
and some other string teachers but it's

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.090 
and some other string teachers but it's
it's<00:01:42.780> my<00:01:43.470> understanding<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.729> play<00:01:45.210> fast

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
it's my understanding that to play fast

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.780 
it's my understanding that to play fast
since<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.369> such<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.640> radically<00:01:48.270> different

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
since it is such a radically different

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.550 
since it is such a radically different
technique<00:01:50.790> it's<00:01:51.750> actually<00:01:52.200> something<00:01:52.439> that

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
technique it's actually something that

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.710 
technique it's actually something that
needs<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.920> be<00:01:52.979> practiced<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:54.270> actually<00:01:54.570> need

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
needs to be practiced you actually need

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.480 
needs to be practiced you actually need
to<00:01:54.750> practice<00:01:55.200> playing<00:01:55.409> fast<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:56.159> see<00:01:56.369> the

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
to practice playing fast you see the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.209 
to practice playing fast you see the
common<00:01:57.090> way<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.450> developing<00:01:58.259> agility<00:01:58.920> which

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
common way of developing agility which

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.690 
common way of developing agility which
personally<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.850> never<00:02:00.000> found<00:02:00.329> useful<00:02:01.280> was<00:02:02.280> kind

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
personally I never found useful was kind

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.280 
personally I never found useful was kind
of<00:02:02.729> notching<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.299> metronome<00:02:03.689> up<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.200> know

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
of notching the metronome up you know

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.050 
of notching the metronome up you know
you<00:02:04.350> start<00:02:04.890> with<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.009> low<00:02:05.219> metronome<00:02:05.700> number

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
you start with a low metronome number

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
you start with a low metronome number

one which i think is on this website

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:18.500 
one which i think is on this website
there's<00:02:17.249> multiple<00:02:17.639> passages<00:02:17.969> in<00:02:18.209> there<00:02:18.359> that

require this kind of agility it's very

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.830 
require this kind of agility it's very
difficult<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.519> start<00:02:23.849> for<00:02:24.329> example<00:02:24.420> this

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
difficult to start for example this

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.830 
difficult to start for example this
passage<00:02:25.349> that's<00:02:25.650> on<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.189> first<00:02:26.340> page<00:02:26.780> kind<00:02:27.780> of

passage that's on the first page kind of

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.410 
passage that's on the first page kind of
at<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:27.989> bottom<00:02:28.349> this<00:02:31.670> that<00:02:32.670> that<00:02:32.939> passage

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
at the bottom this that that passage

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.910 
at the bottom this that that passage
where<00:02:33.599> you<00:02:33.719> kind<00:02:33.959> of<00:02:34.049> go<00:02:34.379> up<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.530> fingerboard

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
where you kind of go up the fingerboard

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.119 
where you kind of go up the fingerboard
like<00:02:35.310> that<00:02:36.019> it's<00:02:37.019> very<00:02:37.349> difficult<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:37.859> start

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
like that it's very difficult to start

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:45.490 
like that it's very difficult to start
that<00:02:38.370> passage

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.410 

as<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:47.310> can<00:02:47.459> hear<00:02:47.670> you<00:02:47.700> can<00:02:47.879> almost<00:02:48.030> hear<00:02:48.180> the

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
as you can hear you can almost hear the

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.150 
as you can hear you can almost hear the
pounding<00:02:48.810> of<00:02:49.019> my<00:02:49.050> finger<00:02:49.440> you<00:02:49.860> know<00:02:49.950> because

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
pounding of my finger you know because

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.500 
pounding of my finger you know because
I'm<00:02:50.250> making<00:02:50.550> sure<00:02:50.700> that<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:51.000> strings<00:02:51.269> getting

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
I'm making sure that the strings getting

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.589 
I'm making sure that the strings getting
down<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:51.840> everything<00:02:52.410> on<00:02:52.530> on<00:02:53.040> each<00:02:53.220> note<00:02:53.599> it's

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
down and everything on on each note it's

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.089 
down and everything on on each note it's
very<00:02:54.870> difficult<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.349> go<00:02:55.470> from<00:02:55.739> that<00:02:55.860> which<00:02:56.069> is

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
very difficult to go from that which is

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.280 
very difficult to go from that which is
quite<00:02:56.459> obviously<00:02:57.030> slow<00:02:57.480> playing<00:02:57.780> technique

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
quite obviously slow playing technique

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.740 
quite obviously slow playing technique
I'm<00:02:58.650> able<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.340> kind<00:02:59.670> of<00:02:59.790> take<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.209> time<00:03:00.480> to

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
I'm able to kind of take the time to

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.220 
I'm able to kind of take the time to
even<00:03:00.930> vibrate<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.590> little<00:03:01.709> bit<00:03:02.300> as<00:03:03.300> you<00:03:04.200> can

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
even vibrate a little bit as you can

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.309 
even vibrate a little bit as you can
hear<00:03:05.989> or<00:03:06.989> you<00:03:07.080> can<00:03:07.230> see<00:03:07.410> sorry<00:03:07.620> I<00:03:09.050> can<00:03:10.050> kind<00:03:10.230> of

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
hear or you can see sorry I can kind of

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.410 
hear or you can see sorry I can kind of
take<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.650> time<00:03:10.860> when<00:03:11.310> I'm<00:03:11.430> playing<00:03:11.670> fast<00:03:12.060> I

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
take the time when I'm playing fast I

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.089 
take the time when I'm playing fast I
can't<00:03:12.870> take<00:03:13.049> any<00:03:13.230> time<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.560> do<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:13.830> kind<00:03:14.069> of

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
can't take any time to do that kind of

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.039 
can't take any time to do that kind of
thing<00:03:14.310> at<00:03:14.430> all<00:03:14.580> in<00:03:14.879> fact<00:03:15.209> I<00:03:15.390> kind<00:03:15.660> of<00:03:15.720> need<00:03:15.900> to

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
thing at all in fact I kind of need to

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:21.530 
thing at all in fact I kind of need to
stay<00:03:16.620> hovering<00:03:17.220> and<00:03:17.430> with<00:03:17.940> my<00:03:18.150> arm<00:03:20.030> and<00:03:21.030> in

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
stay hovering and with my arm and in

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.990 
stay hovering and with my arm and in
fact<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:21.989> third<00:03:22.230> finger<00:03:22.709> if<00:03:23.579> you<00:03:23.730> could<00:03:23.880> only

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
fact the third finger if you could only

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.020 
fact the third finger if you could only
see<00:03:24.120> it<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:24.630> it's<00:03:24.780> really<00:03:24.989> hard<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.380> see<00:03:26.030> the

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
see it and it's really hard to see the

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.400 
see it and it's really hard to see the
string<00:03:27.390> actually<00:03:27.540> isn't<00:03:27.870> getting<00:03:28.170> all<00:03:28.260> the

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
string actually isn't getting all the

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.140 
string actually isn't getting all the
way<00:03:28.530> down<00:03:28.709> it's<00:03:29.130> only<00:03:29.220> getting<00:03:29.400> partially<00:03:30.000> the

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
way down it's only getting partially the

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.650 
way down it's only getting partially the
way<00:03:30.269> down<00:03:30.510> this<00:03:31.230> is<00:03:31.410> how<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:31.650> actually<00:03:32.220> play

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
way down this is how you actually play

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.410 
way down this is how you actually play
you<00:03:33.660> know<00:03:33.780> fast<00:03:34.079> up<00:03:34.440> to<00:03:34.500> a<00:03:34.799> certain<00:03:35.160> tempo<00:03:35.519> you

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
you know fast up to a certain tempo you

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.030 
you know fast up to a certain tempo you
know<00:03:36.510> if<00:03:36.810> it's<00:03:37.230> a<00:03:37.319> little<00:03:37.440> bit<00:03:37.620> slower<00:03:37.860> than

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
know if it's a little bit slower than

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.500 
know if it's a little bit slower than
this<00:03:38.160> then<00:03:38.400> it<00:03:38.519> doesn't<00:03:39.030> doesn't<00:03:39.329> doesn't

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
this then it doesn't doesn't doesn't

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.160 
this then it doesn't doesn't doesn't
really<00:03:40.349> affect<00:03:40.680> this<00:03:40.829> too<00:03:41.010> much<00:03:41.160> but<00:03:42.090> for<00:03:42.959> this

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
really affect this too much but for this

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.229 
really affect this too much but for this
passage<00:03:43.500> then<00:03:44.069> you'll<00:03:44.549> say<00:03:44.760> well<00:03:44.910> then<00:03:45.060> how<00:03:45.180> do

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
passage then you'll say well then how do

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:46.759 
passage then you'll say well then how do
I<00:03:45.360> practice<00:03:45.599> it<00:03:45.810> how<00:03:45.930> do<00:03:45.989> I<00:03:46.079> practice<00:03:46.500> it<00:03:46.560> at

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
I practice it how do I practice it at

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.020 
I practice it how do I practice it at
the<00:03:46.950> fast<00:03:47.160> tempo<00:03:47.489> well<00:03:47.610> this<00:03:47.760> is<00:03:47.849> what<00:03:48.000> I

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
the fast tempo well this is what I

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.170 
the fast tempo well this is what I
always<00:03:48.209> recommend<00:03:48.480> to<00:03:48.780> my<00:03:48.930> students<00:03:49.940> in<00:03:50.940> order

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
always recommend to my students in order

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.400 
always recommend to my students in order
to<00:03:51.269> practice<00:03:51.450> things<00:03:51.840> fast<00:03:52.049> you<00:03:52.230> have<00:03:52.319> to

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
to practice things fast you have to

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.259 
to practice things fast you have to
practice<00:03:52.709> them<00:03:52.799> fast<00:03:53.040> but<00:03:53.250> in<00:03:53.340> small<00:03:53.670> chunks

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
practice them fast but in small chunks

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.210 
practice them fast but in small chunks
so<00:03:55.230> of<00:03:55.319> course<00:03:55.530> once<00:03:55.739> you've<00:03:55.889> learned<00:03:56.130> the

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
so of course once you've learned the

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.559 
so of course once you've learned the
notes<00:03:56.340> now<00:03:56.549> you<00:03:56.700> can<00:03:56.850> learn<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.180> notes<00:03:57.359> in<00:03:57.510> a

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
notes now you can learn the notes in a

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:58.879 
notes now you can learn the notes in a
much<00:03:57.690> slower<00:03:57.959> tempo<00:03:58.380> of<00:03:58.470> course<00:03:58.650> I<00:03:58.709> don't

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
much slower tempo of course I don't

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:00.319 
much slower tempo of course I don't
expect<00:03:59.130> you<00:03:59.310> to<00:03:59.370> be<00:03:59.489> able<00:03:59.670> to<00:03:59.850> blaze<00:04:00.060> through

it you know right right off the bat but

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.140 
it you know right right off the bat but
once<00:04:04.769> once<00:04:05.130> you've<00:04:05.280> decided<00:04:05.549> okay<00:04:05.910> I<00:04:05.940> want<00:04:06.120> to

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
once once you've decided okay I want to

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.610 
once once you've decided okay I want to
learn<00:04:06.299> how<00:04:06.420> to<00:04:06.450> play<00:04:06.720> this<00:04:06.870> thing<00:04:07.019> now<00:04:07.200> fast

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
learn how to play this thing now fast

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.470 
learn how to play this thing now fast
you<00:04:08.160> have<00:04:08.280> to<00:04:08.400> actually<00:04:08.579> pick<00:04:09.030> your<00:04:09.150> tempo

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
you have to actually pick your tempo

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.970 
you have to actually pick your tempo
that<00:04:09.510> you<00:04:09.750> want<00:04:09.959> to<00:04:10.019> play<00:04:10.170> at<00:04:10.319> play<00:04:10.650> at<00:04:10.799> that

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
that you want to play at play at that

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.580 
that you want to play at play at that
tempo<00:04:11.430> but<00:04:11.819> play<00:04:12.060> in<00:04:12.239> chunks<00:04:12.810> playing<00:04:13.290> fast

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
tempo but play in chunks playing fast

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:20.149 
tempo but play in chunks playing fast
chunks<00:04:15.950> so<00:04:16.950> for<00:04:17.220> example

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:20.159 

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:22.619 

that<00:04:21.159> kind<00:04:21.459> of<00:04:21.489> thing<00:04:21.699> I<00:04:21.789> would<00:04:21.970> break<00:04:22.150> up<00:04:22.330> into

00:04:22.619 --> 00:04:22.629 
that kind of thing I would break up into

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:31.140 
that kind of thing I would break up into
this<00:04:27.090> and<00:04:28.090> then<00:04:28.960> maybe<00:04:29.430> dividing<00:04:30.430> it<00:04:30.520> for<00:04:30.759> not

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
this and then maybe dividing it for not

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.790 
this and then maybe dividing it for not
further<00:04:31.419> but<00:04:31.719> but<00:04:31.990> clumping<00:04:32.409> some<00:04:32.620> of<00:04:32.710> those

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
further but but clumping some of those

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:42.769 
further but but clumping some of those
together<00:04:36.810> and<00:04:38.219> then<00:04:39.219> trying<00:04:39.729> to<00:04:39.789> go

00:04:42.769 --> 00:04:42.779 

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:45.629 

kind<00:04:43.779> of<00:04:43.839> like<00:04:44.050> that<00:04:44.289> you<00:04:44.739> know<00:04:44.860> and<00:04:45.219> and<00:04:45.459> so

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
kind of like that you know and and so

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.049 
kind of like that you know and and so
you<00:04:45.669> you<00:04:46.479> divide<00:04:47.110> it<00:04:47.319> up<00:04:47.439> and<00:04:48.129> I<00:04:48.279> did<00:04:48.489> this<00:04:48.639> you

00:04:49.049 --> 00:04:49.059 
you you divide it up and I did this you

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:51.899 
you you divide it up and I did this you
know<00:04:49.179> kind<00:04:49.419> of<00:04:49.479> quickly<00:04:49.719> um<00:04:50.679> and<00:04:51.519> you'll<00:04:51.669> see

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:51.909 
know kind of quickly um and you'll see

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:53.249 
know kind of quickly um and you'll see
that<00:04:52.089> you'll<00:04:52.300> have<00:04:52.449> to<00:04:52.509> actually<00:04:53.050> practice

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259 
that you'll have to actually practice

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:56.489 
that you'll have to actually practice
that<00:04:54.149> to<00:04:55.149> get<00:04:55.330> good<00:04:55.569> at<00:04:55.749> it<00:04:55.779> but<00:04:56.199> this<00:04:56.289> is<00:04:56.469> how

00:04:56.489 --> 00:04:56.499 
that to get good at it but this is how

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:58.350 
that to get good at it but this is how
you<00:04:56.589> teach<00:04:56.979> your<00:04:57.219> fingers<00:04:57.580> how<00:04:57.729> to<00:04:57.789> move<00:04:58.059> fast

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
you teach your fingers how to move fast

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.820 
you teach your fingers how to move fast
so<00:04:58.509> you<00:04:58.629> have<00:04:58.749> to<00:04:58.869> teach<00:04:59.080> your<00:04:59.289> fingers<00:04:59.619> how<00:04:59.769> to

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
so you have to teach your fingers how to

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:00.359 
so you have to teach your fingers how to
do<00:05:00.039> this

00:05:00.359 --> 00:05:00.369 
do this

00:05:00.369 --> 00:05:03.359 
do this
you<00:05:00.610> cannot<00:05:01.059> derive<00:05:01.599> fast<00:05:02.289> playing<00:05:02.679> from<00:05:03.219> so

00:05:03.359 --> 00:05:03.369 
you cannot derive fast playing from so

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:05.879 
you cannot derive fast playing from so
playing<00:05:03.699> slow<00:05:04.419> playing<00:05:04.629> they<00:05:04.929> are<00:05:04.959> just<00:05:05.559> too

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
playing slow playing they are just too

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.100 
playing slow playing they are just too
different<00:05:06.189> I<00:05:06.580> can't<00:05:07.029> emphasize<00:05:07.149> that<00:05:07.449> enough

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
different I can't emphasize that enough

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.949 
different I can't emphasize that enough
you<00:05:08.469> will<00:05:08.649> be<00:05:08.830> toiling<00:05:09.729> away<00:05:09.849> for<00:05:10.389> hours<00:05:10.809> and

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:10.959 
you will be toiling away for hours and

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:12.839 
you will be toiling away for hours and
hours<00:05:11.199> and<00:05:11.289> hours<00:05:11.409> trying<00:05:12.249> to<00:05:12.459> get<00:05:12.580> something

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:12.849 
hours and hours trying to get something

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:15.540 
hours and hours trying to get something
faster<00:05:13.479> if<00:05:13.749> you<00:05:13.959> practice<00:05:14.349> it<00:05:14.499> a<00:05:14.529> lot<00:05:14.889> slower

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
faster if you practice it a lot slower

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.459 
faster if you practice it a lot slower
now<00:05:16.059> I<00:05:16.119> know<00:05:16.269> that<00:05:16.749> goes<00:05:16.989> against<00:05:17.289> the<00:05:17.439> grain

00:05:17.459 --> 00:05:17.469 
now I know that goes against the grain

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:19.199 
now I know that goes against the grain
that<00:05:17.889> goes<00:05:18.039> against<00:05:18.309> what<00:05:18.489> most<00:05:18.669> people<00:05:18.999> say

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:19.209 
that goes against what most people say

00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:21.749 
that goes against what most people say
but<00:05:19.629> this<00:05:19.779> is<00:05:19.899> just<00:05:20.110> what<00:05:20.259> I<00:05:20.289> found<00:05:20.619> to<00:05:20.800> be<00:05:20.919> true

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 
but this is just what I found to be true

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.399 
but this is just what I found to be true
in<00:05:22.059> my<00:05:22.300> own<00:05:22.419> playing<00:05:22.659> in<00:05:22.899> my<00:05:23.050> own<00:05:23.139> teaching

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:23.409 
in my own playing in my own teaching

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:26.159 
in my own playing in my own teaching
that's<00:05:24.399> all<00:05:24.550> I<00:05:24.579> can<00:05:24.699> really<00:05:24.909> pass<00:05:25.209> on<00:05:25.449> to<00:05:26.019> you

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 
that's all I can really pass on to you

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:31.049 
that's all I can really pass on to you
in<00:05:26.379> that<00:05:26.469> way<00:05:27.569> so<00:05:28.589> that's<00:05:29.589> basically<00:05:30.579> it<00:05:30.879> in

00:05:31.049 --> 00:05:31.059 
in that way so that's basically it in

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:33.389 
in that way so that's basically it in
terms<00:05:31.569> of<00:05:31.689> fast<00:05:31.929> playing<00:05:32.289> so<00:05:32.860> anyway<00:05:32.919> this<00:05:33.249> has

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:33.399 
terms of fast playing so anyway this has

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:35.159 
terms of fast playing so anyway this has
been<00:05:33.550> Joseph<00:05:33.969> Mendoza<00:05:34.149> with<00:05:34.539> virtual<00:05:34.929> shoot
