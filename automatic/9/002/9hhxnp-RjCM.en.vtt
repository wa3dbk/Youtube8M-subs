00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:29.490 

just<00:02:22.650> quickly<00:02:22.860> try<00:02:23.160> it

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.590 

so<00:02:30.130> there<00:02:30.340> you<00:02:30.400> go<00:02:30.580> edit<00:02:30.940> zeroes<00:02:31.300> what<00:02:31.540> you

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
have to type in first and then you

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.200 
have to type in first and then you
change<00:02:33.280> it<00:02:33.460> so<00:02:34.120> hey<00:02:34.360> dave<00:02:34.600> is<00:02:34.930> my<00:02:34.960> name<00:02:36.210> there

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210

it to a skeleton a zombie whatever you
want<00:04:06.210> so<00:04:07.210> I<00:04:07.240> quickly<00:04:07.510> just<00:04:07.750> change<00:04:07.960> into<00:04:08.230> a

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
want so I quickly just change into a

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.510 
want so I quickly just change into a
villager<00:04:09.300> there<00:04:10.300> you<00:04:10.390> go<00:04:10.570> is<00:04:10.870> now<00:04:11.050> a<00:04:11.080> villager

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.710 

then<00:04:15.520> I<00:04:15.610> can<00:04:15.760> change<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.180> age<00:04:16.299> of<00:04:16.540> the

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
then I can change the age of the

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.770 
then I can change the age of the
villager<00:04:17.080> NPC<00:04:17.950> age<00:04:18.359> you<00:04:19.359> can<00:04:19.510> see<00:04:19.660> that's<00:04:19.810> zero

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
villager NPC age you can see that's zero

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.900 
villager NPC age you can see that's zero
so<00:04:22.780> you<00:04:22.870> can<00:04:22.990> actually<00:04:23.110> change<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.650> age<00:04:23.910> so

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
so you can actually change the age so

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.670 
so you can actually change the age so
one<00:04:25.150> isn't<00:04:25.450> a<00:04:25.480> number<00:04:25.810> it<00:04:26.170> has<00:04:26.260> to<00:04:26.410> be<00:04:26.500> between

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
one isn't a number it has to be between

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.950 
one isn't a number it has to be between
minus<00:04:27.070> two<00:04:27.460> thousand<00:04:27.940> four<00:04:28.150> hundred<00:04:28.270> whatever

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
minus two thousand four hundred whatever

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.670 
minus two thousand four hundred whatever
to<00:04:29.590> zero<00:04:30.000> so<00:04:31.000> if<00:04:31.090> I<00:04:31.180> do<00:04:31.300> -<00:04:31.690> a<00:04:31.780> thousand<00:04:32.260> you<00:04:32.530> can

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
to zero so if I do - a thousand you can

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.250 
to zero so if I do - a thousand you can
see<00:04:32.830> that<00:04:32.950> it's<00:04:33.070> a<00:04:33.100> tiny<00:04:33.340> NPC<00:04:37.110> changing<00:04:38.110> it<00:04:38.230> to

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
see that it's a tiny NPC changing it to

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.020 
see that it's a tiny NPC changing it to
anything<00:04:38.680> else<00:04:38.890> doesn't<00:04:39.340> actually<00:04:39.460> seem<00:04:39.850> to

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
anything else doesn't actually seem to

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.940 
anything else doesn't actually seem to
affect<00:04:40.360> the<00:04:40.480> size<00:04:40.690> it<00:04:40.990> seems<00:04:41.200> to<00:04:41.380> say<00:04:41.560> the<00:04:41.740> same

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
affect the size it seems to say the same

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.450 
affect the size it seems to say the same
but<00:04:42.930> I<00:04:43.930> don't<00:04:44.260> know<00:04:44.320> whether<00:04:44.470> it<00:04:44.620> gets<00:04:45.010> older

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
but I don't know whether it gets older

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.010 
but I don't know whether it gets older
as<00:04:45.550> it<00:04:45.669> progresses<00:04:46.030> I'm<00:04:46.419> not<00:04:46.570> sure<00:04:46.720> but

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
as it progresses I'm not sure but

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.600 
as it progresses I'm not sure but
obviously<00:04:47.770> someone<00:04:48.190> will<00:04:48.310> know<00:04:48.460> the<00:04:48.580> answer

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
obviously someone will know the answer

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.920 
obviously someone will know the answer
to<00:04:49.000> that<00:04:50.400> so<00:04:51.400> you<00:04:51.460> see<00:04:51.700> the<00:04:51.850> NPC's<00:04:52.300> normal<00:04:52.750> size

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
to that so you see the NPC's normal size

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.750 
to that so you see the NPC's normal size
again<00:04:55.530> you<00:04:56.530> can't<00:04:56.830> set<00:04:57.070> the<00:04:57.160> age<00:04:57.280> on<00:04:57.490> all<00:04:57.610> of

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
again you can't set the age on all of

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.150 
again you can't set the age on all of
them<00:04:57.880> but<00:04:58.690> obviously<00:04:59.290> check<00:04:59.590> the<00:04:59.680> wiki<00:04:59.830> and<00:05:00.100> it

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
them but obviously check the wiki and it

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.870 
them but obviously check the wiki and it
will<00:05:00.250> tell<00:05:00.370> you<00:05:00.460> which<00:05:00.580> ones<00:05:00.790> you<00:05:00.910> can<00:05:02.880> then

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
will tell you which ones you can then

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.840 
will tell you which ones you can then
you<00:05:04.000> can<00:05:04.030> do<00:05:04.270> NPC<00:05:04.990> controllable<00:05:05.740> if<00:05:06.370> you<00:05:06.640> spell

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
you can do NPC controllable if you spell

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.520 
you can do NPC controllable if you spell
it<00:05:06.880> right<00:05:07.090> on<00:05:07.330> like<00:05:07.510> life<00:05:07.720> it<00:05:08.140> will<00:05:08.200> actually

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
it right on like life it will actually

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.400 
it right on like life it will actually
work<00:05:08.880> then<00:05:09.880> you<00:05:10.000> can<00:05:10.150> actually<00:05:10.270> use<00:05:10.480> the<00:05:10.870> NPC's

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
work then you can actually use the NPC's

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.800 
work then you can actually use the NPC's
and<00:05:11.680> sit<00:05:11.860> on<00:05:11.890> them<00:05:12.070> then<00:05:13.000> the<00:05:13.120> next<00:05:13.330> command<00:05:13.630> is

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
and sit on them then the next command is

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:19.200 
and sit on them then the next command is
slash<00:05:14.610> NPC<00:05:15.610> and<00:05:15.880> then<00:05:16.570> mount<00:05:18.120> then<00:05:19.120> you

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
slash NPC and then mount then you

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.850 
slash NPC and then mount then you
actually<00:05:19.330> sit<00:05:19.690> on<00:05:19.720> the<00:05:19.900> NPC<00:05:20.380> and<00:05:20.500> as<00:05:20.650> you<00:05:20.740> can

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
actually sit on the NPC and as you can
