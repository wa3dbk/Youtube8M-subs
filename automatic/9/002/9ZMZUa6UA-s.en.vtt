00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.779 
hard coming in because it's off canvas
so<00:01:11.079> you<00:01:11.140> try<00:01:11.409> and<00:01:11.439> get<00:01:11.710> in<00:01:11.860> I<00:01:12.039> try<00:01:12.369> and<00:01:12.670> be<00:01:12.759> in

the middle of the turn around this area

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.859 
the middle of the turn around this area
you'll<00:01:15.310> want<00:01:15.520> to<00:01:15.579> be<00:01:15.700> hugging<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.210> inside<00:01:16.360> and

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
you'll want to be hugging the inside and

you'll want to be hugging the inside and
trying<00:01:17.409> to<00:01:17.530> get<00:01:17.679> a<00:01:17.710> really<00:01:18.070> good<00:01:18.189> drive<00:01:18.490> onto

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
trying to get a really good drive onto

the back straight as this is one of the

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:32.330 
the back straight as this is one of the
most<00:01:20.560> important<00:01:21.159> parts<00:01:21.460> of<00:01:21.549> the<00:01:21.670> circuit

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.760 

and<00:01:32.820> by<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.299> time<00:01:33.360> we<00:01:33.600> get<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.200> about<00:01:34.500> here<00:01:34.649> we

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
and by the time we get to about here we

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.440 
and by the time we get to about here we
should<00:01:34.920> be<00:01:34.979> doing<00:01:35.189> 280<00:01:35.670> climbers<00:01:36.030> now<00:01:36.180> Plus

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
should be doing 280 climbers now Plus

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.420 
should be doing 280 climbers now Plus
and<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:37.079> should<00:01:37.229> be<00:01:37.350> hard<00:01:37.680> on<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.950> brakes<00:01:38.159> here

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
and it should be hard on the brakes here

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.399 
and it should be hard on the brakes here
in<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.700> turn<00:01:38.880> 3<00:01:39.119> getting<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.450> good<00:01:39.600> set<00:01:39.780> up<00:01:39.899> what

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
in the turn 3 getting a good set up what

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.690 
in the turn 3 getting a good set up what
will<00:01:40.530> be<00:01:40.619> hopefully<00:01:40.979> being<00:01:41.159> my<00:01:41.280> supporters

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700
