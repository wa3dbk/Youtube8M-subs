a frizzy mess but that's okay so now I'm

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.709 
a frizzy mess but that's okay so now I'm
gonna<00:00:47.430> take<00:00:47.700> one<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.149> towels<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.539> just

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
gonna take one of the towels and just

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.450 
gonna take one of the towels and just
wrap<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.170> around<00:00:49.260> her<00:00:49.559> body<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.309> it

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
wrap it around her body so that it

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.850 
wrap it around her body so that it
doesn't<00:00:50.820> get<00:00:50.940> wet<00:00:51.180> in<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.449> process<00:00:51.899> okay<00:00:52.800> so

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
doesn't get wet in the process okay so

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.619 
doesn't get wet in the process okay so
she<00:00:53.370> looks<00:00:53.550> really<00:00:53.730> crazy<00:00:53.969> right<00:00:54.270> now<00:00:54.329> but

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
she looks really crazy right now but

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.630 
she looks really crazy right now but
basically<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.110> rubber<00:00:55.379> banded<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.070> towel

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
basically I rubber banded the towel

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.939 
basically I rubber banded the towel
around<00:00:56.969> her<00:00:57.360> like<00:00:57.600> an<00:00:57.780> old<00:00:57.930> cocoon<00:00:58.469> thing<00:00:58.710> and

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
around her like an old cocoon thing and

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.639 
around her like an old cocoon thing and
then<00:00:59.730> pull<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.510> up<00:01:00.690> over<00:01:00.930> her<00:01:01.260> face<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:01.620> that

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
then pull it up over her face so that

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.700 
then pull it up over her face so that
her<00:01:01.890> eyes<00:01:02.100> don't<00:01:02.370> rest<00:01:02.699> forget<00:01:03.149> what<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:04.080> now

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
her eyes don't rest forget what and now

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.800 
her eyes don't rest forget what and now
her<00:01:04.890> ponytail<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.610> just<00:01:05.850> freeing<00:01:06.240> right<00:01:06.479> and

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
her ponytail is just freeing right and

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.240 
her ponytail is just freeing right and
the<00:01:07.170> reason<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.530> pulled<00:01:07.740> her<00:01:07.860> hair<00:01:08.010> into<00:01:08.220> a

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
the reason I pulled her hair into a

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.850 
the reason I pulled her hair into a
ponytail<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:09.030> because<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.659> find<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.710> it's

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
ponytail is because I find that it's

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.740 
ponytail is because I find that it's
easier<00:01:11.280> because<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.729> don't<00:01:11.939> want<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.210> get<00:01:12.390> her

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
easier because you don't want to get her

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.070 
easier because you don't want to get her
actual<00:01:13.439> weight<00:01:13.979> wet<00:01:14.780> because<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.960> could

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
actual weight wet because that could

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.679 
actual weight wet because that could
loosen<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.590> glue<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:17.009> just<00:01:17.220> want<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.580> get<00:01:17.909> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
loosen the glue you just want to get the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.660 
loosen the glue you just want to get the
actual<00:01:19.140> body<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.740> hair<00:01:19.920> wet<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.490> if<00:01:20.580> you

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
actual body of the hair wet so if you

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.249 
actual body of the hair wet so if you
pull<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:20.880> into<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.150> ponytail<00:01:21.420> it's<00:01:21.840> easier<00:01:22.170> to

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
pull it into a ponytail it's easier to

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.460 
pull it into a ponytail it's easier to
wash<00:01:22.439> that's<00:01:23.100> how<00:01:23.250> much<00:01:23.450> so<00:01:24.450> let's<00:01:24.960> just<00:01:25.259> get

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470
