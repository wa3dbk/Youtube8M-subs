flag<00:03:18.050> now<00:03:19.050> does<00:03:19.200> that<00:03:19.230> mean<00:03:19.380> you<00:03:19.530> have<00:03:19.620> a

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
flag now does that mean you have a

flag now does that mean you have a
chance<00:03:20.040> of<00:03:20.220> dying<00:03:20.460> more<00:03:20.820> yeah<00:03:21.300> it<00:03:21.570> does<00:03:21.870> but<00:03:22.140> it

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
chance of dying more yeah it does but it

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:23.960 
chance of dying more yeah it does but it
also<00:03:22.800> means<00:03:23.070> you<00:03:23.190> have<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.340> better<00:03:23.520> chance<00:03:23.580> of

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
also means you have a better chance of

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.670 
also means you have a better chance of
winning<00:03:24.360> which<00:03:24.570> is<00:03:24.720> a<00:03:24.750> lot<00:03:24.960> more<00:03:24.990> important

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
winning which is a lot more important

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.830 
winning which is a lot more important
and<00:03:25.860> plus<00:03:26.610> if<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:26.820> don't<00:03:27.000> play<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.300> objective

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
and plus if you don't play the objective

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.570 
and plus if you don't play the objective
and<00:03:27.990> you<00:03:28.050> don't<00:03:28.230> use<00:03:28.410> each<00:03:28.620> class<00:03:28.890> effectively

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
and you don't use each class effectively

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.010 
and you don't use each class effectively
you'd<00:03:29.880> never<00:03:30.030> get<00:03:30.270> to<00:03:30.360> do<00:03:30.480> stuff<00:03:30.540> like<00:03:30.870> this

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
you'd never get to do stuff like this

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.260 
you'd never get to do stuff like this

change<00:04:16.170> things<00:04:16.470> up<00:04:16.620> a<00:04:16.739> little<00:04:16.859> bit

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
change things up a little bit

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.340 
change things up a little bit
for<00:04:18.669> instance<00:04:19.000> in<00:04:19.209> this<00:04:19.359> clip<00:04:19.630> I<00:04:19.780> blew<00:04:20.079> up<00:04:20.199> a

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
for instance in this clip I blew up a

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.170 
for instance in this clip I blew up a
tree<00:04:20.680> with<00:04:20.949> my<00:04:21.100> grenade<00:04:21.459> because<00:04:21.790> I<00:04:21.880> wanted<00:04:22.090> to

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
tree with my grenade because I wanted to

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.580 
tree with my grenade because I wanted to
see<00:04:22.330> if<00:04:22.360> I<00:04:22.510> could<00:04:22.570> hide<00:04:22.870> in<00:04:22.900> it<00:04:23.230> after<00:04:23.380> our

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
see if I could hide in it after our

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.200 
see if I could hide in it after our
plane<00:04:23.710> of<00:04:23.800> the<00:04:24.010> bomb<00:04:24.190> and<00:04:24.430> use<00:04:24.610> it<00:04:24.730> to<00:04:24.760> protect

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
plane of the bomb and use it to protect

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.000 
plane of the bomb and use it to protect
the<00:04:25.330> bomb<00:04:25.480> site<00:04:25.750> and<00:04:26.020> it<00:04:26.500> ended<00:04:26.710> up<00:04:26.830> working

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
the bomb site and it ended up working

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.800 
the bomb site and it ended up working
out<00:04:27.310> all<00:04:27.490> right<00:04:27.669> I<00:04:27.699> couldn't<00:04:28.030> exactly<00:04:28.150> protect

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
out all right I couldn't exactly protect

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.600 
out all right I couldn't exactly protect
the<00:04:28.900> bomb<00:04:29.080> from<00:04:29.110> in<00:04:29.440> the<00:04:29.560> tree<00:04:29.800> but<00:04:30.340> I<00:04:30.370> was<00:04:30.520> able

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
the bomb from in the tree but I was able

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.219 
the bomb from in the tree but I was able
