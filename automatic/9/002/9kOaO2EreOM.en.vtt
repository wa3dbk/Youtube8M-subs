00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.940
 i 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.520
 to 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.040
 i 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.840
 good to all I am art and that we are 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.990
 here in a new video today I'm going to 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.580
 teach them how to build lamps 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.900
 automatic is a circuit very very 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.600
 simple so it's not going to cost us 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.640
 too much and it's also very effective 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.050
 so you can use it if you want 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.660
 build for example a city 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.550
 pretty big an epic city with 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.500
 gigantic constructions as you can 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.970
 put these lamps that are pretty 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.890
 at the height of a good construction 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.780
 so let's learn to build them 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.699
 It is very simple and practically with 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.170
 what you are seeing you can already learn 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.030
 to do it but just in case I'm going to 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.530
 build them live so you can see 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.180
 how it is done 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.280
 it's very easy first let's start with 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.869
 a suit is worth the part of let's say the 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.700
 foot of the lamp where we are going to place 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.560
 any type of block and I will use 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.810
 quartz columns because I love the 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.990
 quartz and then always the best 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.300
 and we do it a higher block let's say 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.570
 that this block here we will have it 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.700
 remove vale we have to do this well 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.740
 then we put a block of rest of 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.810
 over and we can remove the one below 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.759
 if we want but we can take advantage of it 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.030
 also already directly to place the 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.190
 stairs like this 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.520
 I mainly do this so that 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:37.010
 smaller, everything is worth it so that 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.780
 be more compact and do not look 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.270
 but here you can place any type 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.430
 of blocks as long as it's not a slap for 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.509
 that you do not see the rest block let's go 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.040
 to make day so you can see that 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.360
 they work perfectly and for you to see 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.360
 the back how it moves 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.270
 there you see it as soon as this day the 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.759
 Lamp is deactivated by lowering this piston 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.590
 this is why this block serves us 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.840
 of space that we left right here 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.640
 down as you see right now we can not 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.009
 remove the one we had left so 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.110
 we have to remove one and put it like that 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.220
 ok it's not complicated at all it's very 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.959
 simple 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.060
 now we put the network lamps here 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.370
 they are very simple also right here 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.489
 above the stairs and once the 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.430
 we have put now we can put the 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.680
 that would be the sensor daylight is worth what 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.690
 we put just above a block and 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.180
 now we take advantage of this to put the 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.709
 sticky piston and we have it now 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.709
 missing other stairs over here 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.060
 and end and we have it finished now 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.520
 you will see that if we do at night because 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.010
 directly turns off the lamp it 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.960
 turn on sorry this what it does is that 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.720
 it turns off what is the 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.910
 sensor signal day and night is worth 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.070
 the light sensor this what it does is that 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.020
 I went backwards I do not understand very well 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.610
 what they did like that but it was the 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.640
 main problem when it comes to 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.260
 build this circuit the sensors of 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.080
 this is what they do is they do not emit 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.850
 signal if it is night therefore 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.250
 normally you for what you want is a 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.050
 Light sensor is for making lamps 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.150
 It's good for the lamps to light up 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.390
 when it is night so the logical 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.570
 it would have been for the sensor to emit 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.700
 signal when outside at night and not when 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.770
 it is of the day but how it does it upside down 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.560
 It was very complicated to do something like that 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.510
 of this style that would go on when 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.190
 be at night and as we needed 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.070
 do it in a very small space 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.660
 because it has to be floating like that 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.130
 let's say there is only one stick holding 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.260
 I had to make it a circuit 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.420
 very very small that did not enter here 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.910
 inside so the simplest way that 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.130
 found is to put this piston with 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.830
 a block is a sticky piston by the way 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.720
 what it does is push the block 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.250
 down when it's daytime so the 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.290
 lamps are not activated 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.940
 so I do not expect you to have understood 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.890
 everything quite well as I said is 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.990
 Simple circuit is not very good 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.620
 complicated to understand more than anything is 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:05.740
 a compression job is worth trying 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.150
 compress a circuit a function as 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.970
 you can for you to enter a 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.470
 space as small as this is 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.540
 I hope nothing you liked this 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.760
 video I hope you found it useful 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.049
 this circuit and we in the next 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.049
 goodbye video
