00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
been the one of the biggest keys to my

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.310

to<00:00:45.570> my<00:00:45.600> weight<00:00:45.899> loss<00:00:46.110> so<00:00:47.540> but<00:00:48.540> now<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:48.989> past

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
to my weight loss so but now this past

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.240 
to my weight loss so but now this past
week<00:00:49.649> I've<00:00:49.890> been<00:00:49.920> averaging<00:00:50.219> about<00:00:50.840> 205<00:00:52.250> carbs

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
week I've been averaging about 205 carbs

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.790 
week I've been averaging about 205 carbs
per<00:00:53.520> day<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.780> figured<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.230> was<00:00:55.350> still<00:00:55.559> too

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
per day and I figured that was still too

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.889 
per day and I figured that was still too
much<00:00:56.039> because<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.550> have<00:00:56.910> been<00:00:57.149> having<00:00:57.390> carbs

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
much because I have been having carbs

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.080 
much because I have been having carbs
like<00:00:58.050> like<00:00:58.920> even<00:00:59.129> last<00:00:59.309> night<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.550> had<00:00:59.789> some<00:00:59.969> of

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
like like even last night I had some of

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.689 
like like even last night I had some of
that<00:01:00.180> linguini<00:01:00.960> with<00:01:01.110> the<00:01:01.230> shrimp<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:02.070> I

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
that linguini with the shrimp and I

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.999 
that linguini with the shrimp and I
think<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.210> did<00:01:03.360> a<00:01:03.559> what's<00:01:04.559> for<00:01:04.799> dinner

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
think I did a what's for dinner

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.319 
think I did a what's for dinner
video<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:06.529> so<00:01:07.529> anyway<00:01:08.009> I<00:01:08.090> went<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.240> this

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:09.329 
video and so anyway I went to this

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:10.639 
video and so anyway I went to this
website<00:01:09.509> and<00:01:09.749> it<00:01:09.959> says<00:01:10.139> what<00:01:10.289> you're<00:01:10.409> supposed

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
website and it says what you're supposed

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:12.980 
website and it says what you're supposed
to<00:01:10.679> do<00:01:10.829> is<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.579> take<00:01:11.789> the<00:01:12.029> amount<00:01:12.329> of<00:01:12.509> calories

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
to do is to take the amount of calories

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.569 
to do is to take the amount of calories
that<00:01:13.380> you're<00:01:13.529> supposed<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.799> have<00:01:14.009> every<00:01:14.369> day

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:14.579 
that you're supposed to have every day

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:17.929 
that you're supposed to have every day
and<00:01:14.880> divide<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.079> number<00:01:16.139> by<00:01:16.469> two<00:01:16.709> and<00:01:17.459> then

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
and divide that number by two and then

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.760 
and divide that number by two and then
when<00:01:18.599> you<00:01:18.719> get<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:18.990> number<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.499> divide<00:01:19.590> that

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
when you get that number you divide that

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.339 
when you get that number you divide that
one<00:01:20.219> by<00:01:20.429> four<00:01:20.959> so<00:01:21.959> I<00:01:22.759> believe<00:01:24.139> if<00:01:25.139> you're

00:01:25.339 --> 00:01:25.349 
one by four so I believe if you're

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:29.029 
one by four so I believe if you're
taking<00:01:25.889> in<00:01:25.979> 1200<00:01:26.639> calories<00:01:27.029> per<00:01:27.240> day<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:28.039> then

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
taking in 1200 calories per day and then

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.429 
taking in 1200 calories per day and then
600<00:01:29.789> divided<00:01:30.029> by<00:01:30.179> four<00:01:30.450> what<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.749> that<00:01:30.840> 150<00:01:32.329> so

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
600 divided by four what is that 150 so

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.529 
600 divided by four what is that 150 so
yeah<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:34.859> I'm<00:01:35.039> supposed<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.310> having<00:01:35.579> 150<00:01:36.240> grams

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
yeah so I'm supposed to having 150 grams

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.719 
yeah so I'm supposed to having 150 grams
of<00:01:36.749> carbs<00:01:37.109> per<00:01:37.169> day

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
of carbs per day

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.819 
of carbs per day
and<00:01:39.240> that's<00:01:39.719> supposed<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.990> help<00:01:40.139> with<00:01:40.679> weight

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
and that's supposed to help with weight

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.050 
and that's supposed to help with weight
loss<00:01:40.889> so<00:01:41.429> if<00:01:41.609> you<00:01:42.709> you<00:01:43.709> know<00:01:43.829> take<00:01:44.069> in<00:01:44.310> 2,000

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
loss so if you you know take in 2,000

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.779 
loss so if you you know take in 2,000
calories<00:01:45.359> per<00:01:45.389> day<00:01:46.429> divide<00:01:47.429> that<00:01:47.579> by<00:01:47.729> two

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
calories per day divide that by two

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:49.879 
calories per day divide that by two
that's<00:01:48.239> a<00:01:48.329> thousand<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.229> then<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.709> divide

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:49.889 
that's a thousand and then you divide

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:55.129 
that's a thousand and then you divide
that<00:01:49.950> by<00:01:50.609> four<00:01:51.359> was<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.020> 250<00:01:53.299> yes<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:54.569> 250

00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:55.139 
that by four was that 250 yes so 250

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:57.529 
that by four was that 250 yes so 250
grams<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.159> carbs<00:01:56.429> per<00:01:56.489> day<00:01:56.729> you're<00:01:56.939> allowed<00:01:57.359> to

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
grams of carbs per day you're allowed to

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.109 
grams of carbs per day you're allowed to
have<00:01:57.689> if<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.349> are<00:01:58.709> taking<00:01:59.099> in<00:01:59.189> 2,000<00:01:59.789> calories

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119

to lose like a pound and a half a week

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.750 
to lose like a pound and a half a week
then<00:02:47.870> you<00:02:47.990> need<00:02:48.110> to<00:02:48.200> have<00:02:48.380> you<00:02:48.950> know<00:02:49.070> so<00:02:49.340> so

then you need to have you know so so

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.070 
then you need to have you know so so
many<00:02:49.910> calories<00:02:50.150> per<00:02:50.480> day<00:02:50.510> based<00:02:50.870> on<00:02:50.960> your

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
height and weight and I figured that is

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.790 
height and weight and I figured that is
that<00:02:54.350> if<00:02:54.440> I<00:02:54.500> want<00:02:54.680> to<00:02:54.740> lose<00:02:54.920> to<00:02:56.470> two<00:02:57.470> pounds<00:02:57.650> per

that if I want to lose to two pounds per
week<00:02:57.950> to<00:02:58.900> my<00:02:59.900> keep<00:03:00.080> my<00:03:00.200> calories<00:03:00.500> at<00:03:00.620> a

1,200<00:03:03.500> like<00:03:03.710> dog<00:03:03.860> so<00:03:04.040> I'll<00:03:04.190> aim<00:03:04.430> for<00:03:04.460> a

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
1,200 like dog so I'll aim for a

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.820 
1,200 like dog so I'll aim for a
thousand<00:03:05.120> just<00:03:05.360> to<00:03:05.480> get<00:03:05.630> 1,200<00:03:06.350> you<00:03:06.500> know<00:03:06.590> how

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
thousand just to get 1,200 you know how

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.650 
thousand just to get 1,200 you know how
that<00:03:07.010> works<00:03:07.220> so<00:03:08.530> anyway<00:03:09.530> so<00:03:10.390> it's<00:03:11.390> a<00:03:11.450> really

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
that works so anyway so it's a really

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.940 
that works so anyway so it's a really
cool<00:03:11.780> app<00:03:12.020> and<00:03:12.200> then<00:03:12.290> what<00:03:12.440> you<00:03:12.530> can<00:03:12.590> do<00:03:12.800> is

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
cool app and then what you can do is

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.490 
cool app and then what you can do is
after<00:03:13.340> you<00:03:13.520> it<00:03:14.270> will<00:03:14.450> keep<00:03:14.600> averages<00:03:15.230> of

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
after you it will keep averages of

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.680 
after you it will keep averages of

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.110 
highest calories per day have been
around<00:03:39.620> 1250<00:03:40.250> you<00:03:40.489> know<00:03:40.580> some<00:03:40.730> people<00:03:40.820> think

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
around 1250 you know some people think

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.830 
around 1250 you know some people think
that's<00:03:41.300> too<00:03:41.600> low<00:03:41.840> but<00:03:42.140> that's<00:03:42.440> I<00:03:42.890> figured<00:03:43.310> out

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
that's too low but that's I figured out

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.840 
that's too low but that's I figured out
what<00:03:44.840> works<00:03:45.050> for<00:03:45.170> me<00:03:45.410> because<00:03:45.620> you<00:03:46.430> know<00:03:46.489> if<00:03:46.700> I

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
what works for me because you know if I

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.510 
what works for me because you know if I
have<00:03:47.120> anything<00:03:47.420> more<00:03:47.600> than<00:03:47.989> 1200<00:03:48.560> I<00:03:48.800> can't

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
have anything more than 1200 I can't

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.920 
have anything more than 1200 I can't
I<00:03:49.580> pretty<00:03:49.910> much<00:03:50.000> seem<00:03:50.270> to<00:03:50.420> stay<00:03:50.690> the<00:03:50.900> same

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
I pretty much seem to stay the same

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.810 
I pretty much seem to stay the same
because<00:03:51.260> I'm<00:03:51.500> not<00:03:51.650> but<00:03:52.340> now<00:03:52.550> that<00:03:52.730> I'm

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
because I'm not but now that I'm

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.460 
because I'm not but now that I'm
exercising<00:03:53.060> and<00:03:53.540> I'm<00:03:53.600> doing<00:03:53.840> Zumba<00:03:53.989> every<00:03:54.350> day

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
exercising and I'm doing Zumba every day

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.030 
exercising and I'm doing Zumba every day
I<00:03:54.500> don't<00:03:54.830> know<00:03:55.390> if<00:03:56.390> I<00:03:57.170> can<00:03:57.350> increase<00:03:57.680> them<00:03:57.890> if

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
I don't know if I can increase them if

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.590 
I don't know if I can increase them if
I'm<00:03:58.160> should<00:03:58.459> be<00:03:58.520> increasing<00:03:58.910> my<00:03:59.120> calories<00:03:59.480> or

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
I'm should be increasing my calories or

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.990 
I'm should be increasing my calories or
not<00:03:59.750> but<00:04:00.050> anyway<00:04:01.010> so<00:04:01.070> it<00:04:01.250> gives<00:04:01.400> you<00:04:01.489> a<00:04:01.519> Verge's

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
not but anyway so it gives you a Verge's

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.600 
not but anyway so it gives you a Verge's
so<00:04:02.180> my<00:04:02.360> average<00:04:02.570> was<00:04:02.750> like<00:04:02.989> 200<00:04:03.290> 205<00:04:03.980> grams<00:04:04.340> of

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
so my average was like 200 205 grams of

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.590 
so my average was like 200 205 grams of
carbs<00:04:05.060> per<00:04:05.390> day

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
carbs per day

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.630 
carbs per day
for<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:06.960> week<00:04:07.140> so<00:04:07.470> that's<00:04:07.650> my<00:04:07.770> average<00:04:08.160> so<00:04:08.430> one

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
for the week so that's my average so one

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.280 
for the week so that's my average so one
day<00:04:08.760> it<00:04:08.850> was<00:04:08.910> like<00:04:08.970> 2:16<00:04:09.720> and<00:04:09.750> then<00:04:10.110> another

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
day it was like 2:16 and then another

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.010 
day it was like 2:16 and then another
day<00:04:10.560> it<00:04:10.650> was<00:04:10.770> like<00:04:10.890> 180<00:04:11.610> but<00:04:12.480> I<00:04:12.510> guess<00:04:12.750> I<00:04:12.870> need

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
day it was like 180 but I guess I need

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.440 
day it was like 180 but I guess I need
to<00:04:13.050> be<00:04:13.140> aiming<00:04:13.350> for<00:04:13.470> about<00:04:13.740> 150<00:04:14.700> grams<00:04:15.240> of

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
to be aiming for about 150 grams of

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.490 
to be aiming for about 150 grams of
carbs<00:04:15.690> per<00:04:15.750> day<00:04:15.960> so<00:04:16.020> I<00:04:16.200> thought<00:04:16.350> that<00:04:16.440> was
