okay<00:00:03.659> friends<00:00:04.020> now<00:00:04.200> let<00:00:04.440> us<00:00:04.500> talk<00:00:04.740> about

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:04.970 
okay friends now let us talk about

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.230 
okay friends now let us talk about
motifs

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
motifs

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.030 
motifs
now<00:00:06.839> motifs<00:00:07.770> are<00:00:08.330> just<00:00:09.530> printed<00:00:10.530> in<00:00:10.650> your<00:00:10.679> mind

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
now motifs are just printed in your mind

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.850 
now motifs are just printed in your mind
that<00:00:11.250> motifs<00:00:11.700> are<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.450> base<00:00:12.750> of<00:00:12.860> making

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
that motifs are the base of making

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.770 
that motifs are the base of making
three-dimensional<00:00:14.730> protein<00:00:15.059> structure<00:00:15.570> or

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
three-dimensional protein structure or

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.260 
three-dimensional protein structure or
fully<00:00:16.199> functional<00:00:16.800> protein<00:00:17.130> structure<00:00:17.580> so

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
fully functional protein structure so

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.450 
fully functional protein structure so
more<00:00:18.510> teens<00:00:18.720> are<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.230> build<00:00:19.590> motifs<00:00:20.160> are<00:00:20.310> the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
more teens are the build motifs are the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.939 
more teens are the build motifs are the
building<00:00:21.000> blocks<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:22.080> 3d<00:00:22.590> protein

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
building blocks of a 3d protein

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.890 
building blocks of a 3d protein
structure<00:00:23.369> or<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.550> fully<00:00:23.820> functional<00:00:24.539> protein

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
structure or a fully functional protein

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.529 
structure or a fully functional protein
structure<00:00:25.439> okay<00:00:26.099> now<00:00:26.580> what<00:00:26.849> are<00:00:27.060> these<00:00:27.269> motifs

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
structure okay now what are these motifs

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.169 
structure okay now what are these motifs
actually<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.710> more<00:00:28.920> teens<00:00:29.160> are<00:00:29.429> motifs<00:00:29.970> are

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
actually the more teens are motifs are

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.730 
actually the more teens are motifs are
the<00:00:30.300> certain<00:00:30.510> groups<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.230> secondary

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
the certain groups of secondary

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.130 
the certain groups of secondary
structural<00:00:32.189> elements<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.270> interaction

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
structural elements and the interaction

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.600

each<00:00:35.640> other<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.460> giving

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
each other that that is a that is giving

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.420 
each other that that is a that is giving
rise<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.870> fully<00:00:40.350> functional<00:00:40.920> protein<00:00:41.280> is

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
rise to a fully functional protein is

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.150 
rise to a fully functional protein is
called<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.760> motif<00:00:41.969> so<00:00:42.570> it's<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.750> unit<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.410> fully

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
called a motif so it's a unit of fully

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.430 
called a motif so it's a unit of fully
functional<00:00:44.700> protein<00:00:45.059> which<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.270> having<00:00:45.809> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440

the property of folded protein okay and
this<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.629> smallest<00:00:55.050> unit<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.739> protein

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
this is the smallest unit of a protein

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.430 
this is the smallest unit of a protein
which<00:00:57.030> processes<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.660> function<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.350> a

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
feature of a protein and motifs are

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.479 
feature of a protein and motifs are
actually<00:01:03.629> based<00:01:03.870> on<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.680> interactions<00:01:05.400> of

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
actually based on the interactions of

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.219 
actually based on the interactions of
the<00:01:05.970> domains<00:01:06.360> which<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.960> secondary

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
the domains which is the secondary

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.990 
the domains which is the secondary
structure<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:08.189> there<00:01:08.340> are<00:01:08.670> secondary

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
structure so there are secondary

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.730 
structure so there are secondary
structures<00:01:09.450> like<00:01:09.630> alpha<00:01:09.930> helix<00:01:10.229> like<00:01:10.470> beta

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
structures like alpha helix like beta

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.380 
structures like alpha helix like beta
sheets<00:01:11.070> now<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.580> alpha<00:01:11.820> helix<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.330> beta

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
sheets now this alpha helix and beta

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.630 
sheets now this alpha helix and beta
sheets<00:01:12.840> all<00:01:13.020> will<00:01:13.560> work<00:01:14.010> together<00:01:14.280> will

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
sheets all will work together will

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.480 
sheets all will work together will
interact<00:01:14.939> together<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.960> make<00:01:16.200> motifs<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:17.070> what

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
interact together to make motifs so what

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.330 
interact together to make motifs so what
are<00:01:17.700> motifs<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.409> basically<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.710> interaction

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
are motifs is basically the interaction

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.340 
are motifs is basically the interaction
between<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:20.729> alpha<00:01:21.150> helix<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.509> Vita<00:01:22.110> sheets

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
between this alpha helix and Vita sheets

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.620 
between this alpha helix and Vita sheets
and<00:01:22.530> basically<00:01:23.340> alpha<00:01:23.520> beta<00:01:24.000> sheets<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.360> beta

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
and basically alpha beta sheets and beta

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.960 
and basically alpha beta sheets and beta
wounds<00:01:25.049> are<00:01:25.229> turns<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.220> all<00:01:26.460> these<00:01:26.670> things<00:01:26.850> so

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
wounds are turns and all these things so

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.179 
wounds are turns and all these things so
all<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.600> secondary<00:01:27.990> structures<00:01:28.590> are<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.210 
given four types of motifs are denoted
here<00:01:41.310> one<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.630> beta<00:01:43.320> alpha<00:01:43.500> beta<00:01:43.799> motif

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
here one is the beta alpha beta motif

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.149 
here one is the beta alpha beta motif
which<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.820> usually<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:46.200> most<00:01:46.439> abundant<00:01:46.799> or

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
which is usually the most abundant or

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.920 
which is usually the most abundant or
most<00:01:47.399> common<00:01:47.759> type<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:47.970> super<00:01:48.509> secondary

most common type of super secondary

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.060 
most common type of super secondary
structure<00:01:49.350> or<00:01:49.530> motif

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
structure or motif

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.789 
structure or motif
usually<00:01:50.880> right-handed<00:01:51.509> cross<00:01:51.840> over<00:01:52.380> as<00:01:52.649> we

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
usually right-handed cross over as we

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.440 
usually right-handed cross over as we
can<00:01:52.950> see<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.340> we<00:01:53.549> have<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.670> beta<00:01:53.909> strand<00:01:54.180> you

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
can see so we have a beta strand you

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.850 
can see so we have a beta strand you
have<00:01:54.540> another<00:01:54.810> beta<00:01:55.079> strand<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.470> as<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.740> know

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
have another beta strand and as you know

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.889 
have another beta strand and as you know
these<00:01:56.040> beta<00:01:56.250> strands<00:01:56.549> are<00:01:56.759> parallel<00:01:57.270> as<00:01:57.390> we

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
these beta strands are parallel as we

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.240 
these beta strands are parallel as we
know<00:01:58.049> when<00:01:58.469> you're<00:01:58.590> talking<00:01:58.890> about<00:01:58.950> beta

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
know when you're talking about beta

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.160 
know when you're talking about beta
strands<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.820> when<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.060> have<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.570> attach

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
strands and when you have to attach

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.170 
strands and when you have to attach
those<00:02:01.500> buta<00:02:01.860> beta<00:02:02.070> strands<00:02:02.399> together<00:02:02.790> we

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
those buta beta strands together we

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.389 
those buta beta strands together we
cannot<00:02:03.509> attach<00:02:03.869> Y<00:02:04.079> as<00:02:04.350> normal<00:02:04.770> hair<00:02:04.950> pins<00:02:05.219> or

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
cannot attach Y as normal hair pins or

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.679 
cannot attach Y as normal hair pins or
something<00:02:05.700> like<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:05.880> we<00:02:06.119> have<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.509> make

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
something like that we have to make

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.330 
something like that we have to make
something<00:02:06.960> which<00:02:07.469> will<00:02:07.619> pass<00:02:07.829> through<00:02:08.190> the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
something which will pass through the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.249 
something which will pass through the
plane<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:09.000> if<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.149> consider<00:02:09.360> this<00:02:09.720> in<00:02:10.140> this

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
plane so if you consider this in this

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.500 
plane so if you consider this in this
one<00:02:10.619> plane<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.400> we<00:02:11.459> need<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.760> have<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:11.970> linker

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
one plane so we need to have a linker

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.940 
one plane so we need to have a linker
which<00:02:12.870> will<00:02:12.989> pass<00:02:13.200> through<00:02:13.440> either

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
which will pass through either

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.740 
which will pass through either
upper<00:02:14.250> of<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:14.670> pain<00:02:14.910> all<00:02:15.150> lowering<00:02:15.599> that

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
upper of that pain all lowering that

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.580 
upper of that pain all lowering that
plane<00:02:15.989> so<00:02:16.379> it<00:02:16.680> will<00:02:17.099> make<00:02:17.340> something<00:02:18.590> cropper

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
plane so it will make something cropper

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.900 
plane so it will make something cropper
lowering<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.129> the<00:02:20.250> plane<00:02:20.459> which<00:02:20.610> is<00:02:20.730> called

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
lowering that the plane which is called

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
lowering that the plane which is called
a<00:02:21.000> cross<00:02:21.269> over<00:02:21.629> so<00:02:21.989> this<00:02:22.140> cross<00:02:22.500> over<00:02:22.769> of<00:02:23.930> type

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
a cross over so this cross over of type

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.229 
a cross over so this cross over of type
of<00:02:24.959> arrangement<00:02:25.920> is<00:02:26.010> needed<00:02:26.459> for<00:02:26.819> cross

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
of arrangement is needed for cross

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.540 
of arrangement is needed for cross
linking<00:02:27.810> this<00:02:27.989> alpha-helices<00:02:28.769> parallel<00:02:29.310> beta

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
linking this alpha-helices parallel beta

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.820 
linking this alpha-helices parallel beta
sheets<00:02:29.879> together<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.569> in<00:02:30.780> this<00:02:30.959> case<00:02:31.230> it<00:02:31.590> is

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
sheets together and in this case it is

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.920 
sheets together and in this case it is
an<00:02:32.010> alpha<00:02:32.430> helix<00:02:32.640> which<00:02:33.150> is<00:02:33.300> making<00:02:33.690> this

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
an alpha helix which is making this

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.660 
an alpha helix which is making this
cross<00:02:34.260> over<00:02:34.680> so<00:02:35.040> this<00:02:35.250> cross<00:02:35.550> over<00:02:36.060> type<00:02:36.630> of

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
cross over so this cross over type of

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.430 
cross over so this cross over type of
protein<00:02:38.670> attachment<00:02:39.330> can<00:02:39.420> be<00:02:39.569> found<00:02:39.840> so<00:02:40.290> this

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
protein attachment can be found so this

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.320 
protein attachment can be found so this
is<00:02:40.560> called<00:02:40.769> a<00:02:40.830> bt<00:02:41.130> alpha<00:02:41.430> beta<00:02:41.730> motif<00:02:42.060> which<00:02:42.209> is

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
is called a bt alpha beta motif which is

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.240 
is called a bt alpha beta motif which is
really<00:02:42.660> really<00:02:42.780> most<00:02:43.200> common<00:02:43.590> type<00:02:43.769> of<00:02:43.799> motifs

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
really really most common type of motifs

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.220 
really really most common type of motifs
we<00:02:44.340> can<00:02:44.489> find<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:45.090> have<00:02:45.209> one<00:02:45.510> beta<00:02:45.750> sheet<00:02:46.019> then

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
we can find so have one beta sheet then

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.839 
we can find so have one beta sheet then

third kind of motive I am going to talk

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.860 
third kind of motive I am going to talk
about<00:03:59.069> is<00:03:59.250> called<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.609> alpha<00:04:00.150> alpha<00:04:00.209> motif

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
about is called the alpha alpha motif

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.690 
about is called the alpha alpha motif
that<00:04:01.290> means<00:04:01.530> as<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:01.859> name<00:04:02.010> suggests<00:04:02.430> two

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
that means as the name suggests two

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.490 
that means as the name suggests two
alpha<00:04:03.060> helixes<00:04:03.480> are<00:04:03.690> attached<00:04:04.079> to<00:04:04.200> be<00:04:04.319> this<00:04:04.410> is

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
alpha helixes are attached to be this is

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.319 
alpha helixes are attached to be this is
not<00:04:04.620> only<00:04:04.769> two<00:04:05.069> but<00:04:05.459> many<00:04:05.670> alpha<00:04:05.970> legs<00:04:06.180> can

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
not only two but many alpha legs can

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.000 
not only two but many alpha legs can
interact<00:04:06.690> together<00:04:06.870> to<00:04:07.319> make<00:04:07.470> this<00:04:07.620> kind<00:04:07.889> of

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
interact together to make this kind of

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.640 
interact together to make this kind of
motifs<00:04:08.489> now<00:04:09.000> this<00:04:09.239> is<00:04:09.359> an<00:04:09.569> example<00:04:09.870> of<00:04:10.319> alpha

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
motifs now this is an example of alpha

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.379 
motifs now this is an example of alpha
motifs<00:04:11.010> and<00:04:11.130> in<00:04:11.250> between<00:04:11.549> them<00:04:11.790> we<00:04:12.209> have

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
motifs and in between them we have

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:15.920 
motifs and in between them we have
stretches<00:04:13.169> of<00:04:13.380> loop<00:04:13.799> so<00:04:14.190> loop<00:04:15.060> is<00:04:15.209> there<00:04:15.450> alpha

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
stretches of loop so loop is there alpha

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.409 
stretches of loop so loop is there alpha
loop<00:04:16.109> or<00:04:16.289> alpha<00:04:16.590> pin<00:04:17.430> is<00:04:17.609> there<00:04:17.820> so<00:04:18.030> this<00:04:18.180> alpha

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
loop or alpha pin is there so this alpha

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.659 
loop or alpha pin is there so this alpha
this<00:04:18.930> kind<00:04:19.139> of<00:04:19.229> loop<00:04:19.500> is<00:04:19.709> joining<00:04:20.039> this<00:04:20.340> alpha

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
this kind of loop is joining this alpha

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.210 
this kind of loop is joining this alpha
helixes<00:04:21.060> or<00:04:21.209> sometimes<00:04:21.630> this<00:04:22.200> the<00:04:22.650> continuous

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
helixes or sometimes this the continuous

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.920 
helixes or sometimes this the continuous
stretch<00:04:23.460> of<00:04:23.640> alpha<00:04:23.880> helices<00:04:24.000> can<00:04:24.479> we<00:04:24.659> make

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
stretch of alpha helices can we make

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.050 
stretch of alpha helices can we make
this<00:04:25.080> kind<00:04:25.320> of<00:04:25.440> loops<00:04:25.680> to<00:04:25.919> arrange<00:04:26.370> in<00:04:26.729> such<00:04:26.789> a

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
this kind of loops to arrange in such a

this kind of loops to arrange in such a
way<00:04:27.300> there

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
way there

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.740 
way there
they<00:04:27.979> are<00:04:28.099> they<00:04:28.610> make<00:04:29.030> a<00:04:29.060> structure<00:04:29.569> that

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
they are they make a structure that

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.200 
they are they make a structure that
seems<00:04:30.289> or<00:04:30.830> resembling<00:04:31.340> the<00:04:31.490> two<00:04:31.610> Alf<00:04:31.789> Alex<00:04:32.120> are

fourth kind of a motifs that we are

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.839 
fourth kind of a motifs that we are
talking<00:04:38.659> about<00:04:38.750> is<00:04:39.080> called<00:04:39.979> the<00:04:40.219> Greek<00:04:40.580> key

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:40.849 
talking about is called the Greek key

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:42.550 
talking about is called the Greek key
motif<00:04:40.879> this<00:04:41.360> is<00:04:41.479> another<00:04:41.810> very<00:04:42.110> important

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
motif this is another very important

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.040 
motif this is another very important
kind<00:04:42.650> of<00:04:42.889> motif<00:04:43.129> very<00:04:43.520> very<00:04:43.909> abundant<00:04:44.449> motif

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
kind of motif very very abundant motif

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.809 
kind of motif very very abundant motif
now<00:04:45.289> this<00:04:45.500> Greek<00:04:45.860> key<00:04:46.099> motif<00:04:46.129> what<00:04:46.610> we<00:04:46.729> are

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:46.819 
now this Greek key motif what we are

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:48.700 
now this Greek key motif what we are
talking<00:04:47.000> about<00:04:47.389> is<00:04:47.509> from<00:04:47.629> n-terminal<00:04:48.409> towards

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
talking about is from n-terminal towards

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.950 
talking about is from n-terminal towards
the<00:04:48.800> sea<00:04:48.979> terminals<00:04:49.460> from<00:04:49.610> from<00:04:50.060> here<00:04:50.419> so<00:04:50.840> we

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
the sea terminals from from here so we

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.510 
the sea terminals from from here so we
have<00:04:51.110> a<00:04:51.139> stretch<00:04:51.590> of<00:04:51.620> amina<00:04:52.189> so<00:04:52.250> if<00:04:52.400> we

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
have a stretch of amina so if we

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.640 
have a stretch of amina so if we
consider<00:04:52.699> this<00:04:53.060> at<00:04:53.449> a<00:04:53.509> straight<00:04:53.930> amino<00:04:54.349> acid

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
consider this at a straight amino acid

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.640 
consider this at a straight amino acid
then<00:04:54.740> we<00:04:54.889> have<00:04:54.979> n1<00:04:55.909> then<00:04:56.300> blue<00:04:56.810> which<00:04:57.110> is<00:04:57.349> 2

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
then we have n1 then blue which is 2

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.010 
then we have n1 then blue which is 2
then<00:04:57.919> 3<00:04:58.129> if<00:04:58.669> we<00:04:58.699> draw<00:04:59.000> it<00:04:59.120> straight<00:04:59.240> then<00:04:59.930> you

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
then 3 if we draw it straight then you

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.439 
then 3 if we draw it straight then you
have<00:05:00.110> 4<00:05:00.379> now<00:05:00.770> we<00:05:00.830> have<00:05:01.069> a<00:05:01.099> fold<00:05:01.490> from<00:05:01.699> 2<00:05:02.000> and<00:05:02.210> CI

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
have 4 now we have a fold from 2 and CI

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:04.300 
have 4 now we have a fold from 2 and CI
amino<00:05:02.690> acids<00:05:02.990> we<00:05:03.080> have<00:05:03.169> a<00:05:03.199> turn<00:05:03.500> here<00:05:03.979> so<00:05:04.159> this

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
amino acids we have a turn here so this

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.730 
amino acids we have a turn here so this
is<00:05:04.430> a<00:05:04.460> hairpin<00:05:05.180> turn<00:05:05.479> with<00:05:05.629> a<00:05:05.750> hairpin<00:05:06.229> because

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
is a hairpin turn with a hairpin because

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.589 
is a hairpin turn with a hairpin because
we<00:05:06.860> have<00:05:06.949> anti<00:05:07.190> parallel<00:05:07.310> beta<00:05:07.669> strands<00:05:08.240> now

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:08.599 
we have anti parallel beta strands now

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:11.260 
we have anti parallel beta strands now
after<00:05:08.870> the<00:05:09.099> hairpin<00:05:10.099> then<00:05:10.340> then<00:05:10.580> the<00:05:10.849> finally

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
after the hairpin then then the finally

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.029 
after the hairpin then then the finally
this<00:05:11.479> kind<00:05:11.719> of<00:05:11.840> arrangement<00:05:12.050> so<00:05:12.560> what<00:05:12.770> will<00:05:13.009> be

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 
this kind of arrangement so what will be

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:16.209 
this kind of arrangement so what will be
the<00:05:13.580> arrangement<00:05:13.879> we<00:05:14.690> just<00:05:15.080> take<00:05:15.289> this<00:05:15.800> second

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:16.219 
the arrangement we just take this second

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:19.029 
the arrangement we just take this second
strand<00:05:16.520> and<00:05:17.180> this<00:05:17.690> put<00:05:17.960> them<00:05:18.229> together<00:05:18.650> at

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
strand and this put them together at

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:20.860 
strand and this put them together at
this<00:05:19.250> orientation<00:05:19.759> then<00:05:20.060> we<00:05:20.150> need<00:05:20.419> to<00:05:20.629> form

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
this orientation then we need to form

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.959 
this orientation then we need to form
this<00:05:21.319> kind<00:05:21.590> of<00:05:21.710> structure<00:05:22.129> which<00:05:22.279> is<00:05:22.610> called<00:05:22.849> a

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:22.969 
this kind of structure which is called a

beta which is called a Greek key motif

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.010 
beta which is called a Greek key motif
why<00:05:25.430> it<00:05:25.490> is<00:05:25.729> called<00:05:25.879> a<00:05:26.000> Greek<00:05:26.210> key<00:05:26.389> because<00:05:26.659> in

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
why it is called a Greek key because in

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.830 
why it is called a Greek key because in
this<00:05:27.590> is<00:05:27.740> the<00:05:27.860> key<00:05:28.099> word

motifs are really important because this
motifs<00:06:02.629> are<00:06:02.810> the<00:06:03.199> arrangement<00:06:03.979> and<00:06:04.099> the<00:06:04.159> type

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
motifs are the arrangement and the type

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.339 
motifs are the arrangement and the type
of<00:06:04.639> arrangement<00:06:05.089> that<00:06:05.210> tells<00:06:05.779> us<00:06:06.020> the<00:06:06.169> what

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:06.349 
of arrangement that tells us the what

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:07.869

interactions which blakely very

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:25.930 
interactions which blakely very
important<00:06:24.500> role<00:06:24.680> for<00:06:24.710> these<00:06:25.069> purposes<00:06:25.580> to

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:25.940 
important role for these purposes to

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.129 
important role for these purposes to
make<00:06:26.120> this<00:06:26.270> motifs

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:27.139 
make this motifs

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:29.499 
make this motifs
now<00:06:27.379> this<00:06:27.560> motifs<00:06:28.069> are<00:06:28.279> called<00:06:28.729> the<00:06:29.180> super

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:29.509 
now this motifs are called the super

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:32.129 
now this motifs are called the super
secondary<00:06:29.900> structure<00:06:30.319> and<00:06:30.500> this<00:06:30.800> motifs<00:06:31.339> are

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:32.139 
secondary structure and this motifs are

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:35.140 
secondary structure and this motifs are
something<00:06:33.139> which<00:06:33.440> denotes<00:06:34.039> which<00:06:34.370> which<00:06:34.639> just

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150 
something which denotes which which just

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.899 
something which denotes which which just
represents<00:06:35.750> a<00:06:35.779> part<00:06:36.649> of<00:06:36.830> the<00:06:36.979> protein<00:06:37.310> okay<00:06:37.849> so

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:37.909 
represents a part of the protein okay so

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:40.029 
represents a part of the protein okay so
when<00:06:38.539> you<00:06:38.659> form<00:06:38.930> a<00:06:39.020> motif<00:06:39.259> that<00:06:39.589> that<00:06:39.800> means<00:06:39.979> we

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:40.039 
when you form a motif that that means we

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:41.660 
when you form a motif that that means we
can<00:06:40.219> say<00:06:40.430> that<00:06:40.849> we<00:06:41.029> are<00:06:41.060> going

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:41.670 
can say that we are going

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.820 
can say that we are going
the<00:06:41.940> formation<00:06:42.390> of<00:06:42.480> protein<00:06:42.930> is<00:06:43.080> a<00:06:43.200> very<00:06:43.500> very

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:43.830 
the formation of protein is a very very

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.610 
the formation of protein is a very very
first<00:06:44.250> step<00:06:44.580> for<00:06:44.940> making<00:06:45.150> a<00:06:45.390> protein<00:06:45.870> so<00:06:46.170> we<00:06:46.200> if

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.620 
first step for making a protein so we if

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.800 
first step for making a protein so we if
we<00:06:46.740> divide<00:06:47.160> a<00:06:47.190> protein<00:06:47.640> functionally<00:06:48.630> and

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:48.810 
we divide a protein functionally and

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.810 
we divide a protein functionally and
take<00:06:49.200> one<00:06:49.500> of<00:06:49.620> them<00:06:49.830> which<00:06:50.220> represents<00:06:50.760> the

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:50.820 
take one of them which represents the

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.520 
take one of them which represents the
function<00:06:50.970> of<00:06:51.240> a<00:06:51.330> protein<00:06:51.450> that<00:06:51.840> will<00:06:52.260> be<00:06:52.410> the

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:52.530 
function of a protein that will be the

domains<00:07:03.420> we<00:07:03.720> cannot<00:07:04.050> have<00:07:04.230> a<00:07:04.260> meaning<00:07:04.680> to<00:07:04.710> make

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:04.980 
domains we cannot have a meaning to make

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.850 
domains we cannot have a meaning to make
a<00:07:05.010> protein<00:07:05.400> so<00:07:05.850> when<00:07:06.360> you<00:07:06.480> make<00:07:06.630> motifs<00:07:07.470> that

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:07.860 
a protein so when you make motifs that

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.430 
a protein so when you make motifs that
means<00:07:08.070> we<00:07:08.370> organize<00:07:09.120> things<00:07:09.420> we<00:07:09.960> organize

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 
means we organize things we organize

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.050 
means we organize things we organize
things<00:07:10.650> we<00:07:10.860> give<00:07:11.010> a<00:07:11.040> meaning<00:07:11.550> to<00:07:11.580> their

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:12.060 
things we give a meaning to their

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.570 
things we give a meaning to their
organization<00:07:12.810> go<00:07:13.650> towards<00:07:13.950> the<00:07:14.040> functional

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:14.580 
organization go towards the functional

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.940 
organization go towards the functional
functional<00:07:15.240> protein<00:07:15.570> structure<00:07:15.990> okay<00:07:16.470> that's

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:16.950 
functional protein structure okay that's

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:18.650 
functional protein structure okay that's
it<00:07:17.190> and<00:07:17.580> I<00:07:17.640> hope<00:07:17.880> that's<00:07:18.090> going<00:07:18.270> to<00:07:18.360> help<00:07:18.540> you

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:18.660 
it and I hope that's going to help you

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.350 
it and I hope that's going to help you
thank<00:07:19.200> you
