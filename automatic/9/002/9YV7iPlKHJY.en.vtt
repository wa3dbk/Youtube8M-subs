00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
had to do is just had to figure out the

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.089 
had to do is just had to figure out the
dimensions<00:00:12.300> with<00:00:12.570> with<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.139> wood<00:00:13.290> I<00:00:13.500> swiped

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
dimensions with with the wood I swiped

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:21.759 
dimensions with with the wood I swiped
from<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:15.320> garbage<00:00:16.320> cans<00:00:16.940> and<00:00:19.220> I'll<00:00:20.220> try<00:00:20.430> to

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 
from the garbage cans and I'll try to

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:24.170 
from the garbage cans and I'll try to
show<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.949> plans<00:00:23.250> over<00:00:23.730> here

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
show the plans over here

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.609 
show the plans over here
so<00:00:24.650> kind<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.710> trying<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.010> draw<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.490> out<00:00:27.619> ahead

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
so kind of trying to draw it out ahead

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:37.790 
so kind of trying to draw it out ahead
of<00:00:28.800> time<00:00:30.410> and<00:00:33.860> draw<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.920> plans<00:00:36.590> and<00:00:37.590> write

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
of time and draw the plans and write

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.010 
of time and draw the plans and write
myself<00:00:38.280> some<00:00:38.550> directions<00:00:39.180> Buzzbee

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
myself some directions Buzzbee

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.850 
myself some directions Buzzbee
I've<00:00:40.469> never<00:00:40.770> really<00:00:41.070> built<00:00:41.340> anything<00:00:41.670> before

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
I've never really built anything before

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.069 
I've never really built anything before
this<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:44.070> my<00:00:44.250> first<00:00:44.579> go<00:00:44.850> at<00:00:47.180> actually<00:00:48.180> building

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
this is my first go at actually building

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.479 
this is my first go at actually building
something<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:49.649> it's<00:00:49.770> probably<00:00:50.039> gonna<00:00:50.190> take<00:00:50.280> me

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
something so it's probably gonna take me

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.779 
something so it's probably gonna take me
10<00:00:51.420> times<00:00:51.690> longer<00:00:51.960> than<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.440> would<00:00:52.789> somebody

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
10 times longer than it would somebody

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.150 
10 times longer than it would somebody
who's<00:00:53.910> got<00:00:54.120> some<00:00:54.300> experience<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:55.489> so

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
who's got some experience so so

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.310 
who's got some experience so so
basically<00:00:59.160> what<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.670> did<00:00:59.789> was<00:01:00.770> first<00:01:01.770> step<00:01:02.129> was

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
basically what I did was first step was

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.580 
basically what I did was first step was
measured<00:01:04.320> out<00:01:04.470> all<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.920> platform<00:01:05.610> pieces

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
measured out all the platform pieces

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.760 
measured out all the platform pieces
they<00:01:07.590> had<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.830> base<00:01:08.520> unit<00:01:08.820> which<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.650> just<00:01:10.650> a

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
they had a base unit which is just a

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.960 
they had a base unit which is just a
piece<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.130> plywood<00:01:11.960> about<00:01:13.340> 43<00:01:14.340> inches<00:01:14.369> long

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
piece of plywood about 43 inches long

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.350 
piece of plywood about 43 inches long
and<00:01:15.299> made<00:01:15.810> everything<00:01:16.110> 24<00:01:16.860> inches<00:01:17.130> wide<00:01:18.439> and

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
and made everything 24 inches wide and

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.870 
and made everything 24 inches wide and
today<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.390> found<00:01:22.290> some<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.560> these<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.070> bin<00:01:23.280> so

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
today I found some of these in a bin so

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.590 
today I found some of these in a bin so
I<00:01:23.909> figured<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.390> use<00:01:24.509> one<00:01:24.750> for<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.080> post<00:01:25.380> and

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
I figured to use one for this post and

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.600 
I figured to use one for this post and
what<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:27.750> going<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.799> look<00:01:28.890> like<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.490> I'm

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
what it's going to look like is I'm

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.170 
what it's going to look like is I'm
going<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.820> put<00:01:30.060> another<00:01:31.049> layer<00:01:31.790> like<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.820> floor

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
going to put another layer like a floor

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.380 
going to put another layer like a floor
here<00:01:33.630> there's<00:01:33.810> gonna<00:01:33.869> be<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.140> house<00:01:35.329> there's<00:01:36.329> a

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
here there's gonna be a house there's a

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.520 
here there's gonna be a house there's a
basically<00:01:36.840> about<00:01:37.140> four<00:01:37.439> stories<00:01:37.950> here<00:01:40.430> so

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
basically about four stories here so

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:49.399 
basically about four stories here so
step<00:01:43.530> one<00:01:43.799> was<00:01:43.979> cut<00:01:44.189> all<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.610> bases<00:01:46.070> then<00:01:48.409> step

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
step one was cut all the bases then step

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.800 
step one was cut all the bases then step
two<00:01:50.030> was<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:52.009> got<00:01:53.009> all<00:01:53.189> these<00:01:53.399> pieces<00:01:54.060> figured

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
two was I got all these pieces figured

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.380 
two was I got all these pieces figured
out<00:01:54.930> which<00:01:55.110> none<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.560> what<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:55.950> wanted<00:01:56.490> then

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
out which none that I what I wanted then

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.560 
out which none that I what I wanted then
I<00:01:57.509> took<00:01:58.310> measured<00:01:59.310> out<00:01:59.460> each<00:01:59.820> basically<00:02:00.479> each

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
I took measured out each basically each

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.830 
I took measured out each basically each
floor<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:01.110> gonna<00:02:01.200> be<00:02:01.320> about<00:02:01.500> 18<00:02:01.950> inches<00:02:02.840> apart

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
floor is gonna be about 18 inches apart

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.240 
floor is gonna be about 18 inches apart
so<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:05.040> cut<00:02:05.479> three<00:02:06.479> 18<00:02:07.079> inch

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
so I cut three 18 inch

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.720 
so I cut three 18 inch
pieces<00:02:09.880> of<00:02:10.000> wood<00:02:10.150> or<00:02:10.180> two-by-fours<00:02:11.020> and<00:02:11.730> then

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
pieces of wood or two-by-fours and then

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.200 
pieces of wood or two-by-fours and then
I<00:02:13.590> screwed<00:02:14.590> with<00:02:15.250> just<00:02:15.610> I<00:02:15.730> just<00:02:15.760> put<00:02:16.030> two

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
I screwed with just I just put two

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
I screwed with just I just put two
screws<00:02:16.600> and<00:02:17.250> connected<00:02:18.250> this<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:19.720> this<00:02:19.870> sunny

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
screws and connected this to this sunny

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.610 
screws and connected this to this sunny
on<00:02:20.560> all<00:02:20.800> three<00:02:21.100> of<00:02:21.220> those<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:23.880> then<00:02:24.900> on<00:02:25.900> the

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
on all three of those and then on the

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.950 
on all three of those and then on the
bottom<00:02:26.950> I<00:02:27.430> don't<00:02:28.150> know<00:02:28.270> if<00:02:28.360> this<00:02:28.480> is<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.780> best

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
bottom I don't know if this is the best

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
bottom I don't know if this is the best
way<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.140> do<00:02:29.380> it<00:02:29.530> but<00:02:29.760> on<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:30.820> bottom<00:02:31.740> and<00:02:32.740> I

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
way to do it but on the bottom and I

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.930 
way to do it but on the bottom and I
actually<00:02:33.430> drew<00:02:33.910> it<00:02:33.940> out<00:02:34.240> on<00:02:35.110> here<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:36.100> put

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
actually drew it out on here and put

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.530 
actually drew it out on here and put
little<00:02:37.290> drew<00:02:38.290> trace<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:40.200> trace<00:02:41.200> this<00:02:42.240> on<00:02:43.240> the

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
little drew trace the trace this on the

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.700 
little drew trace the trace this on the
floor<00:02:43.840> where<00:02:44.110> I<00:02:44.140> was<00:02:44.290> gonna<00:02:44.380> go<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:46.090> then

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
floor where I was gonna go and then

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.830 
floor where I was gonna go and then
drilled<00:02:47.710> holes<00:02:49.140> basically<00:02:51.150> on<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.360> bottom<00:02:52.750> of

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
drilled holes basically on the bottom of

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.450 
drilled holes basically on the bottom of
this<00:02:52.960> board<00:02:53.320> I<00:02:54.030> think<00:02:55.080> drilled<00:02:56.080> a<00:02:56.140> hole<00:02:56.170> here

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.830 

one<00:03:00.460> here<00:03:00.670> in<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.000> middle<00:03:01.300> and<00:03:01.330> then<00:03:01.600> another

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
one here in the middle and then another

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.720 
one here in the middle and then another
one<00:03:02.110> on<00:03:02.140> that<00:03:02.350> side<00:03:02.410> and<00:03:03.040> then<00:03:03.940> on<00:03:04.240> each<00:03:04.660> four

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
one on that side and then on each four

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.430 
one on that side and then on each four
and<00:03:06.730> all<00:03:06.880> four<00:03:07.210> spots<00:03:07.540> coming<00:03:08.080> from<00:03:08.290> the

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440

and stuck them on the nails and hammered

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.410 
and stuck them on the nails and hammered
them<00:03:25.720> in<00:03:25.900> as<00:03:26.170> best<00:03:26.560> I<00:03:26.740> could

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
them in as best I could

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.540 
them in as best I could
and<00:03:28.420> got<00:03:29.350> them<00:03:29.440> pretty<00:03:29.650> much<00:03:29.680> all<00:03:30.040> the<00:03:30.160> way<00:03:30.250> in

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
and got them pretty much all the way in

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.930 
and got them pretty much all the way in
look<00:03:31.240> a<00:03:31.330> little<00:03:31.450> to<00:03:32.380> go<00:03:32.560> then<00:03:32.770> I<00:03:32.860> laid<00:03:33.700> it<00:03:33.910> down

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
look a little to go then I laid it down

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.330 
look a little to go then I laid it down
on<00:03:34.120> its<00:03:34.450> side<00:03:34.510> and<00:03:34.990> I<00:03:35.110> hammered<00:03:35.980> it<00:03:36.100> from<00:03:36.250> the

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
on its side and I hammered it from the

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.050 
on its side and I hammered it from the
bottom<00:03:36.730> to<00:03:36.760> get<00:03:37.030> it<00:03:38.640> basically<00:03:39.640> all<00:03:39.850> the<00:03:39.970> way

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
bottom to get it basically all the way

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.840 
bottom to get it basically all the way
and<00:03:40.270> then<00:03:40.420> stood<00:03:40.660> it<00:03:40.780> back<00:03:40.930> up<00:03:41.140> here<00:03:41.850> actually

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
and then stood it back up here actually

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.730 
and then stood it back up here actually
I<00:03:43.030> missed<00:03:43.240> a<00:03:43.330> step<00:03:43.390> before<00:03:43.810> I<00:03:44.020> put<00:03:44.290> these<00:03:44.440> beams

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
I missed a step before I put these beams

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.970 
I missed a step before I put these beams
on<00:03:45.360> before<00:03:46.360> I<00:03:46.390> did<00:03:46.570> any<00:03:46.720> nailing<00:03:47.290> of<00:03:47.410> these<00:03:47.620> I

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
on before I did any nailing of these I

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.600 
on before I did any nailing of these I
laid<00:03:48.760> the<00:03:48.880> carpet<00:03:49.470> down<00:03:50.470> on<00:03:50.950> top<00:03:51.190> of<00:03:51.220> the<00:03:51.430> base

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
laid the carpet down on top of the base

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.040 
laid the carpet down on top of the base
and<00:03:52.920> since<00:03:53.920> I<00:03:54.070> had<00:03:54.280> my<00:03:54.310> pencil<00:03:55.240> marks<00:03:55.540> on<00:03:55.780> the

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
and since I had my pencil marks on the

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.490 
and since I had my pencil marks on the
on<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.500> base<00:03:56.709> where<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.250> beams<00:03:57.459> are<00:03:57.670> gonna<00:03:57.760> be

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
on the base where the beams are gonna be

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.710 
on the base where the beams are gonna be
right<00:03:59.500> to<00:03:59.650> the<00:03:59.770> best<00:03:59.950> of<00:04:00.130> my<00:04:00.450> ability<00:04:01.450> I<00:04:01.480> just

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
right to the best of my ability I just

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.630 
right to the best of my ability I just
took<00:04:01.810> a<00:04:01.959> razor<00:04:02.560> blade<00:04:02.830> and<00:04:02.950> cut<00:04:03.280> out<00:04:03.430> where

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
took a razor blade and cut out where

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.710 
took a razor blade and cut out where
this<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:04.570> beams<00:04:04.810> were<00:04:05.050> going<00:04:05.260> to<00:04:05.380> go<00:04:06.450> and<00:04:07.450> so<00:04:07.660> I

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
this the beams were going to go and so I

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.880 
this the beams were going to go and so I
cut<00:04:07.900> all<00:04:08.020> the<00:04:08.200> four<00:04:08.410> squares<00:04:08.800> and<00:04:09.720> and<00:04:10.890> before

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
cut all the four squares and and before

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.199 
cut all the four squares and and before
I<00:04:11.920> did<00:04:12.100> that<00:04:12.130> I<00:04:12.280> actually<00:04:12.550> had<00:04:12.820> to<00:04:12.940> cut<00:04:13.120> the

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
I did that I actually had to cut the

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.620 
I did that I actually had to cut the
carpet<00:04:13.480> to<00:04:14.350> size<00:04:14.590> i<00:04:15.070> luckily<00:04:15.790> had<00:04:16.120> a<00:04:16.150> piece<00:04:16.390> big

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
carpet to size i luckily had a piece big

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.710 
carpet to size i luckily had a piece big
enough

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
enough

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.870 
enough
and<00:04:17.810> left<00:04:20.769> about<00:04:21.769> four<00:04:22.130> inches<00:04:22.520> on<00:04:22.580> each<00:04:22.850> side

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
and left about four inches on each side

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.440 
and left about four inches on each side
because<00:04:23.420> what<00:04:24.410> I'm<00:04:24.740> gonna<00:04:24.860> do<00:04:25.130> is<00:04:25.310> saw<00:04:26.090> another

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
because what I'm gonna do is saw another

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.040 
because what I'm gonna do is saw another
video<00:04:26.780> where<00:04:27.080> you<00:04:27.170> just<00:04:28.510> you'll<00:04:29.510> use<00:04:29.750> this<00:04:29.990> to

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
video where you just you'll use this to

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.960 
video where you just you'll use this to
tuck<00:04:30.500> it<00:04:30.650> underneath<00:04:30.950> and<00:04:31.340> staple<00:04:31.730> it<00:04:31.820> and

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
tuck it underneath and staple it and

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.550 
tuck it underneath and staple it and
I'll<00:04:32.060> show<00:04:32.270> that<00:04:32.300> hopefully<00:04:33.230> in<00:04:33.320> another

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
I'll show that hopefully in another

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.220 
I'll show that hopefully in another
video<00:04:33.970> so<00:04:34.970> it<00:04:35.300> looks<00:04:35.450> like<00:04:35.510> I<00:04:35.660> did<00:04:35.840> alright

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
video so it looks like I did alright

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.870 
video so it looks like I did alright
because<00:04:36.470> after<00:04:36.830> I<00:04:36.860> got<00:04:37.040> these<00:04:37.280> beams<00:04:37.520> all

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
because after I got these beams all

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.690 
because after I got these beams all
nailed<00:04:38.210> in<00:04:38.830> then<00:04:39.830> I<00:04:39.980> just<00:04:40.130> took<00:04:40.280> the<00:04:40.430> carpet

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
nailed in then I just took the carpet

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.430 
nailed in then I just took the carpet
and<00:04:41.680> slid<00:04:42.680> it<00:04:42.830> down<00:04:43.750> on<00:04:44.750> all<00:04:44.990> four<00:04:45.290> of<00:04:45.320> the

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
and slid it down on all four of the

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.730 
and slid it down on all four of the
beams<00:04:45.620> and<00:04:45.950> now<00:04:46.010> it's<00:04:46.160> sitting<00:04:46.310> there<00:04:47.470> so<00:04:48.470> the

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
beams and now it's sitting there so the

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.400 
beams and now it's sitting there so the
next<00:04:48.920> step<00:04:50.440> the<00:04:51.440> next<00:04:51.610> project<00:04:52.610> is<00:04:53.300> going<00:04:54.110> to

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
next step the next project is going to

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.470 
next step the next project is going to
be<00:04:54.500> I'm<00:04:55.220> just<00:04:55.280> gonna<00:04:55.460> leave<00:04:55.670> this<00:04:55.820> carpet<00:04:56.270> here

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
a cut out these just this side that one

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.760 
a cut out these just this side that one
I'm<00:05:27.800> gonna<00:05:27.919> cut<00:05:28.160> out<00:05:28.190> that<00:05:28.460> one<00:05:28.730> and<00:05:29.710> this<00:05:30.710> one

I'm gonna cut out that one and this one

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.140 
I'm gonna cut out that one and this one
because<00:05:31.430> I'm<00:05:31.550> gonna<00:05:31.669> take<00:05:31.910> this<00:05:32.150> and<00:05:32.770> then

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
because I'm gonna take this and then

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:41.100 
because I'm gonna take this and then
slide<00:05:35.150> it<00:05:35.330> down<00:05:35.540> on<00:05:36.410> top<00:05:37.250> of<00:05:37.460> those<00:05:37.550> three<00:05:38.150> and

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.680 

it'll<00:05:42.110> slide<00:05:42.470> down<00:05:42.740> here<00:05:43.250> it'll<00:05:44.060> rest<00:05:44.450> on

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
it'll slide down here it'll rest on

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.580 
it'll slide down here it'll rest on
these<00:05:45.430> three<00:05:46.430> or<00:05:46.700> four<00:05:47.000> things<00:05:47.270> and<00:05:47.600> so<00:05:48.440> then

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
these three or four things and so then

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.710 
these three or four things and so then
I'll<00:05:48.740> nail<00:05:49.610> it<00:05:49.820> and<00:05:49.850> screw<00:05:50.270> it<00:05:50.590> in<00:05:51.590> here<00:05:52.720> on

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
I'll nail it and screw it in here on

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.680 
I'll nail it and screw it in here on
each<00:05:53.870> of<00:05:54.080> those<00:05:54.169> four<00:05:55.150> and<00:05:56.150> so<00:05:56.330> that<00:05:56.480> would<00:05:56.570> be

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
each of those four and so that would be

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.150 
each of those four and so that would be
the<00:05:56.810> next<00:05:57.080> step<00:05:57.290> and<00:05:59.650> then<00:06:00.650> we'll<00:06:00.830> see<00:06:00.980> where

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 
the next step and then we'll see where

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.020 
the next step and then we'll see where
we<00:06:01.280> go<00:06:01.310> from<00:06:01.460> there

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
we go from there

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.440 
we go from there
I<00:06:02.060> might<00:06:02.810> then<00:06:03.140> once<00:06:03.440> that<00:06:03.530> that<00:06:04.520> is<00:06:04.940> put<00:06:05.300> on<00:06:05.419> I

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:05.450 
I might then once that that is put on I

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.170 
I might then once that that is put on I
might<00:06:05.780> then<00:06:05.990> lay<00:06:06.830> this<00:06:07.070> back<00:06:07.130> down<00:06:07.669> and<00:06:08.090> put

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
might then lay this back down and put

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.760 
might then lay this back down and put
some<00:06:08.510> more<00:06:08.720> screws<00:06:09.350> and<00:06:09.710> nails<00:06:10.870> on<00:06:11.870> the<00:06:11.930> bottom

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
some more screws and nails on the bottom

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.170 
some more screws and nails on the bottom
of<00:06:12.890> this<00:06:12.980> because<00:06:13.160> you<00:06:13.370> can<00:06:13.460> see<00:06:13.640> it's<00:06:13.760> still<00:06:14.150> a

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
of this because you can see it's still a

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.960 
of this because you can see it's still a
little<00:06:14.330> wobbly<00:06:14.660> so<00:06:15.169> yeah<00:06:15.950> I<00:06:16.340> don't<00:06:16.520> want<00:06:16.760> just

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:16.970 
little wobbly so yeah I don't want just

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.950 
little wobbly so yeah I don't want just
two<00:06:17.240> nails<00:06:17.540> it's<00:06:18.320> probably<00:06:18.560> gonna<00:06:18.650> be<00:06:18.740> six<00:06:19.960> six

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
two nails it's probably gonna be six six

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.560 
two nails it's probably gonna be six six
screws<00:06:21.350> or<00:06:21.590> nails<00:06:21.620> on<00:06:22.490> each<00:06:23.090> one<00:06:23.330> of<00:06:23.450> those

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
screws or nails on each one of those

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.950 
screws or nails on each one of those
come<00:06:24.470> up<00:06:24.620> from<00:06:24.830> the<00:06:24.919> bottom<00:06:25.450> so<00:06:26.450> that's<00:06:26.690> it

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
come up from the bottom so that's it

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.379 
come up from the bottom so that's it
that's<00:06:27.710> the<00:06:27.950> end<00:06:28.070> of<00:06:28.130> day<00:06:28.310> one

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:29.389 
that's the end of day one

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:33.010 
that's the end of day one
so<00:06:29.659> far<00:06:29.960> the<00:06:30.199> only<00:06:30.289> thing<00:06:30.409> I've<00:06:31.389> spent<00:06:32.389> is<00:06:32.599> time

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.020 
so far the only thing I've spent is time

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.399 
so far the only thing I've spent is time
and<00:06:33.639> I<00:06:34.639> did<00:06:34.819> go<00:06:34.969> out<00:06:35.000> to<00:06:35.389> Lowe's<00:06:35.659> and<00:06:35.689> pick<00:06:36.199> up

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:36.409 
and I did go out to Lowe's and pick up

some sisal rope

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:41.290 
some sisal rope
hopefully<00:06:38.840> that's<00:06:39.020> how<00:06:39.110> you<00:06:39.169> pronounce<00:06:39.409> it<00:06:40.300> so

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
hopefully that's how you pronounce it so

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.879 
hopefully that's how you pronounce it so
but<00:06:41.479> I'll<00:06:41.599> get<00:06:41.780> to<00:06:41.900> that<00:06:41.930> another<00:06:42.259> time<00:06:42.590> so

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:42.889 
but I'll get to that another time so

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:45.490 
but I'll get to that another time so
that's<00:06:43.819> the<00:06:43.939> end<00:06:44.030> of<00:06:44.120> day<00:06:44.240> one<00:06:44.479> and<00:06:45.379> we'll<00:06:45.469> see

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:45.500

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.460 
that's the end of day one and we'll see
how<00:06:45.770> it<00:06:45.889> goes<00:06:46.099> from<00:06:46.250> here
