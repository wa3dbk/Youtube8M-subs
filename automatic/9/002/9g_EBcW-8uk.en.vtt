00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.259
 in a museum well we are going to receive the 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.259
 great faith of the lopez 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.300

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:33.870

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:44.390
 keep out for the love of god 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:47.390
 Be careful, because I'm not 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.390

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:59.090
 ok ok 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.570
 well I think that assume there is 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.190
 worry that it's so big that it does not 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.619
 have a solution and if you do not have to 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:17.440

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:23.240

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:24.260
 thank you happy family with whom too 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.760
 all this program 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.760
 look, you will still be flamenco 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.760
 yeah well I think that one has to go 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.010
 learning from things and already leaving them 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.450
 back to continue growing that 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.420
 It was a stage in my life where I danced 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.490
 I appreciate it very much because really 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.690
 I am filled with beautiful experiences and 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.010
 it gave me great lessons 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.350
 and from there, nothing that I dedicated to the 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:53.700
 acting already but if you put on that 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:58.280
 maybe it's good, maybe more or 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.280
 less Sevillanas and very low 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:04.100
 not now for what he has given me is for 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.100
 sing carioca 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.520
 It depends 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.490
 some depend on drunkenness some 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.290
 says I am your pledge yes and others 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.340
 say goodbye to me not to continue dedicating myself to 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.870
 acting to any other because 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.570
 not yet but I do not lose 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.090
 hopes now returning to that 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.650
 carl's flamenco period the argument 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.350
 of what is so big that those 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.350
 years was very hectic there were very many 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.990
 presentations women this I was in 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.720
 the group since we were 12 until 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:39.660
 was later reduced to six girls today 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.010
 in day they still continue to have four 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.260
 today there are four women 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.799
 look for me it was great because it gave me 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.269
 the opportunity to meet several countries 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.489
 practically all south america part of 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.860
 Europe in North America and you know 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.360
 different cultures people who had that 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.360
 particularity that she was very sexy 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.860
 but anyway who has seen the 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.900
 show knows that really the 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.360
 show is not only boys but 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.629
 that Juan Carlos the guitarist who is a 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.250
 showman that is my who is my dad and this 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.440
 the girls what we do is like 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.319
 illustrate in a beautiful way with the 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.909
 dance what he is saying but in 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.909
 reality the audio show 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:26.920
 well we four presentations 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.750
 daily will be like that starts up let's go at 7 8 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:37.180
 night got 3 in the morning and 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:39.099
 We were still determined to leave 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.650
 full flamenco and go by 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.060
 acting good my children my children a 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.040
 Once I get pregnant with me 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.340
 and good as continue in this because it was 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.900
 a clear was very rich but for a child 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.390
 it is very unstable because it can not be 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.810
 living 23 months in each country for here 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:04:03.220
 and then there they need 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:09.310
 that he had to look to work and do 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:11.370
 some classes and practically study 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.900
 two years at the nelson ortega academy 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.640
 I was there after he hired me 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.799
 archimedes rivero in venevisiÃ³n gave me 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.799
 my first chance and good 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.500
 yes but I wanted to ask you by returning a 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:31.060
 little more back how many times have we seen 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:33.550
 the little box of looks because this is 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.590
 made something like a pop icon of 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.840
 the national culture or the subject of 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.790
 move the box and it 's something that today 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.590
 many people who did not see it 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.450
 they know as as a custom 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.460
 strange to us that not for it not 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.550
 it makes sense to us that we have 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.110
 move the box and it 's something that we brought 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.510
 but the truth is that if I start 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.240
 take out accounts could know how many in 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.890
 the programs of joselo but after the 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.730
 program every time I went somewhere 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:03.120
 I had to move the little body too but 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.120
 really
