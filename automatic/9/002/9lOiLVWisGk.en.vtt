00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 I'll only show big differences in this video. 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.000
 But apart from these differences, the characters get stronger when they level up. 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.000
 For all speed characters, when using a homing attack on a pole ... 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 ... at levels 0, 1 or 2, nothing happens. 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 At level 3, however, wind is automatically created. 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.000
 The characters can also blow the shields of robots, blow out flames, etc. 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.500
 If you use Thunder Shoot near rings, they will be picked up ... 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.000
 ... but those around, not at levels 0, 1 and 2. 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.500
 At level 3, however, the surrounding rings are automatically drawn. 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.000
 This is also true for all teams. 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.000
 Each power character has a different 3rd strike for each level. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 At level 0, no power character has a 3rd attack. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.500
 Knuckles Level 1 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.500
 Knuckles Level 2 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.000
 Knuckles Level 3 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.500
 E-123 Omega Level 1 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.500
 E-123 Omega Level 2 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.500
 E-123 Omega Level 3 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:31.000
 Big Level 1 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.500
 Big Level 2 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:48.000
 Big Level 3 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.500
 Vector Level 1 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.500
 Vector Level 2 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.000
 Vector Level 3 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 And I also found a bug while doing this video. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.559
 With Knuckles, press the attack button very fast.
