so it's the exact same fingers okay so
what<00:01:17.970> one<00:01:18.270> more<00:01:18.509> time<00:01:18.720> slowly

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.760 

okay<00:01:31.210> okay<00:01:32.210> so<00:01:32.390> just<00:01:32.750> remember<00:01:32.990> you<00:01:33.320> keep<00:01:33.500> your

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
okay okay so just remember you keep your

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.220

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
fingers nice and curved and play with

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.490

the spread on your thumb okay
so<00:01:40.930> yeah<00:01:42.400> and<00:01:43.400> I<00:01:43.550> think<00:01:43.700> that's<00:01:44.150> about<00:01:44.390> it<00:01:44.690> with

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
so yeah and I think that's about it with

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.610 
so yeah and I think that's about it with
these<00:01:45.200> will<00:01:45.860> go<00:01:46.040> on<00:01:46.280> to<00:01:46.730> D<00:01:47.300> major<00:01:47.480> scale<00:01:47.780> which

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
these will go on to D major scale which

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.440 
these will go on to D major scale which
is<00:01:48.650> the<00:01:48.860> next<00:01:49.130> scale<00:01:49.310> we're<00:01:49.520> gonna<00:01:49.580> line<00:01:49.850> cuz

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
is the next scale we're gonna line cuz

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.900 
is the next scale we're gonna line cuz
this<00:01:50.570> one's<00:01:50.780> actually<00:01:50.990> pretty<00:01:51.410> easy<00:01:52.130> free<00:01:52.790> of

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
this one's actually pretty easy free of

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.250 
this one's actually pretty easy free of
the<00:01:53.060> tech<00:01:53.270> of<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.570> thumb<00:01:53.780> and<00:01:53.960> it's<00:01:54.110> a<00:01:54.170> little

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
the tech of the thumb and it's a little

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.800 
the tech of the thumb and it's a little
bit<00:01:54.440> different<00:01:54.860> so<00:01:55.550> in<00:01:55.970> the<00:01:56.180> circle<00:01:56.510> of<00:01:56.600> fifths

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
bit different so in the circle of fifths

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.510 
bit different so in the circle of fifths
which<00:01:57.050> I<00:01:57.230> was<00:01:57.320> like<00:01:57.440> kind<00:01:57.950> of<00:01:58.070> talking<00:01:58.310> about

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
which I was like kind of talking about

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.550 
which I was like kind of talking about
last<00:01:59.030> lesson<00:01:59.600> but<00:01:59.750> I'll<00:01:59.930> probably<00:02:00.110> get<00:02:00.380> into

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
last lesson but I'll probably get into

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.810 
last lesson but I'll probably get into
it<00:02:00.740> in<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:00.920> next<00:02:01.190> one<00:02:01.310> and<00:02:01.460> I'm<00:02:01.550> gonna<00:02:01.640> be

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
it in the next one and I'm gonna be

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.020 
it in the next one and I'm gonna be
teaching<00:02:02.000> more<00:02:02.450> with<00:02:03.190> like<00:02:04.190> theory<00:02:04.700> stuff

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
teaching more with like theory stuff

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.770 
teaching more with like theory stuff
like<00:02:06.760> I'll<00:02:07.760> get<00:02:07.910> into<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.240> circle<00:02:08.540> of<00:02:08.570> fifths

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
like I'll get into the circle of fifths

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.140 
like I'll get into the circle of fifths
a<00:02:08.960> bit<00:02:09.140> and<00:02:09.350> then<00:02:09.440> maybe<00:02:09.890> some<00:02:10.340> sheet<00:02:10.940> music

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
a bit and then maybe some sheet music

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.830 
a bit and then maybe some sheet music
and<00:02:11.660> whatnot<00:02:11.990> stuff<00:02:12.590> like<00:02:12.770> that<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:13.840> read

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
and whatnot stuff like that and read

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.510 
and whatnot stuff like that and read
them<00:02:14.990> and<00:02:15.140> time<00:02:15.350> signatures<00:02:15.950> and<00:02:16.130> stuff<00:02:16.370> like

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
them and time signatures and stuff like

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.970 
them and time signatures and stuff like
that<00:02:16.730> okay<00:02:16.880> anyway<00:02:17.480> so<00:02:17.870> for<00:02:18.020> D<00:02:18.140> major<00:02:18.320> we

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
that okay anyway so for D major we

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.860 
that okay anyway so for D major we
remember<00:02:19.520> our<00:02:19.760> pattern<00:02:20.270> alright
