give you a little insight of why you get

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.029 
give you a little insight of why you get
clutch<00:00:13.170> chatter<00:00:13.820> when<00:00:14.820> you<00:00:14.940> take<00:00:15.240> off<00:00:15.480> on<00:00:15.719> your

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
clutch chatter when you take off on your

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.240 
clutch chatter when you take off on your
starter<00:00:17.039> poop<00:00:17.279> 500<00:00:18.060> or<00:00:18.240> 650<00:00:18.990> or<00:00:19.289> 750<00:00:20.160> or

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
starter poop 500 or 650 or 750 or

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.450 
starter poop 500 or 650 or 750 or
whatever<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.670> got<00:00:21.170> the<00:00:22.170> basic<00:00:22.590> problem<00:00:22.890> is

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
whatever you got the basic problem is

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.759 
whatever you got the basic problem is
not<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.269> clutch<00:00:24.689> disc<00:00:25.109> but<00:00:25.410> it's<00:00:25.529> the

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
not the clutch disc but it's the

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.650 
not the clutch disc but it's the
pressure<00:00:26.010> plate<00:00:26.310> that<00:00:26.609> causes<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.029> lot<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.449> the

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
pressure plate that causes a lot of the

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.800 
pressure plate that causes a lot of the
problems<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.970> the<00:00:29.970> first<00:00:30.210> thing<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.599> notice

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
problems and the first thing to notice

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.010 
problems and the first thing to notice
is<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:32.279> basically<00:00:32.520> just<00:00:33.030> sticks<00:00:33.480> in<00:00:33.750> here

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
is is it basically just sticks in here

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.380 
is is it basically just sticks in here
like<00:00:34.200> this<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.770> then<00:00:34.860> pushes<00:00:35.250> on<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.460> bearing

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
like this and then pushes on the bearing

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.330 
like this and then pushes on the bearing
the<00:00:36.510> bearing<00:00:36.780> pushes<00:00:37.110> on<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.410> blade<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.100> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
the bearing pushes on the blade and the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.900 
the bearing pushes on the blade and the
blade<00:00:38.670> pushes<00:00:39.510> down<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.170> releases<00:00:40.469> it

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
blade pushes down and it releases it

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.240 
blade pushes down and it releases it
well<00:00:41.910> on<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.090> backside<00:00:42.770> if<00:00:43.770> you'll<00:00:43.980> look

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.830 

there's<00:00:47.250> two<00:00:47.399> parts<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.850> where<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.539> first

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
there's two parts of where the first

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.170 
there's two parts of where the first
part<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.260> wears<00:00:49.440> if<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.860> see<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.250> if<00:00:50.820> you

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
part that wears if you see this if you

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.400 
part that wears if you see this if you
look<00:00:51.360> right<00:00:51.539> here<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:52.230> right<00:00:52.820> here<00:00:53.820> on<00:00:54.420> each

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
look right here and right here on each

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.520 
look right here and right here on each
of<00:00:55.590> these<00:00:55.739> three<00:00:55.800> arms<00:00:57.079> you'll<00:00:58.079> see<00:00:58.350> that

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
of these three arms you'll see that

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.340 
of these three arms you'll see that
there's<00:00:58.800> divots<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.430> there<00:00:59.870> where<00:01:00.870> it

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
there's divots in there where it

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.939 
there's divots in there where it
actually<00:01:01.620> has<00:01:02.039> worn<00:01:02.399> out<00:01:02.640> its<00:01:03.210> cup<00:01:03.660> shape<00:01:03.960> in

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
actually has worn out its cup shape in

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.670 
actually has worn out its cup shape in
other<00:01:05.129> words<00:01:05.309> it's<00:01:05.519> not<00:01:05.670> flat<00:01:06.060> across<00:01:06.680> so

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
other words it's not flat across so

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.800 
other words it's not flat across so
that's<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.100> where<00:01:08.340> factor<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.659> other

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
that's a where factor and the other

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.280 
that's a where factor and the other
where<00:01:10.049> factor<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.939> on<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.090> fingers<00:01:12.540> on<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
where factor is on the fingers on the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.010 
where factor is on the fingers on the
face<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.799> fingers<00:01:14.130> here<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:15.240> here<00:01:15.990> and

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
face of the fingers here and here and

face of the fingers here and here and
here<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.439> here<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.000> there<00:01:18.000> eat<00:01:18.119> these<00:01:18.390> spots

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
here and here and there eat these spots

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.880 
here and here and there eat these spots
right<00:01:18.930> here<00:01:19.259> well<00:01:20.159> if<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.460> see<00:01:20.670> there's<00:01:20.909> the

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
right here well if you see there's the

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.280 
right here well if you see there's the
15,000<00:01:22.890> Scout<00:01:23.250> right<00:01:23.610> here<00:01:24.030> where<00:01:24.869> it's<00:01:25.049> lower

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
15,000 Scout right here where it's lower

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.340 
15,000 Scout right here where it's lower
than<00:01:25.650> on<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.670> edge<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:27.930> other<00:01:28.049> words<00:01:28.259> that

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
than on the edge so in other words that

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.370 
than on the edge so in other words that
the<00:01:28.470> where<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.520> right<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.060> middle<00:01:30.320> in<00:01:31.320> the

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
the where is right in the middle in the

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.960 
the where is right in the middle in the
middle<00:01:31.500> here<00:01:31.890> where<00:01:32.159> it's<00:01:32.280> flat<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.579> it

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
middle here where it's flat and it

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.910 
middle here where it's flat and it
actually<00:01:33.180> wears<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.439> point<00:01:34.650> where<00:01:34.799> it's

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
actually wears to the point where it's

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.319 
actually wears to the point where it's
got<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.070> little<00:01:35.189> u-shaped<00:01:35.790> if<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.090> look<00:01:36.240> at

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
got a little u-shaped if you look at

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.039 
got a little u-shaped if you look at
this<00:01:36.450> one<00:01:36.659> real<00:01:36.840> close<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:38.659> don't<00:01:39.659> if<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.840> can<00:01:39.960> get

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
this one real close I don't if I can get

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.020 
this one real close I don't if I can get
it<00:01:40.200> at<00:01:40.290> an<00:01:40.380> eye<00:01:40.500> on<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.829> see<00:01:41.070> right<00:01:41.430> there<00:01:42.799> it's

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
it at an eye on and see right there it's

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.499 
it at an eye on and see right there it's
it's<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.329> u-shape<00:01:45.840> right<00:01:46.079> there<00:01:47.270> anyhow<00:01:48.270> that's

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
it's a u-shape right there anyhow that's

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.950 
it's a u-shape right there anyhow that's
between<00:01:49.380> these<00:01:49.649> two<00:01:49.860> pieces<00:01:50.360> what<00:01:51.360> happens<00:01:51.750> is

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
between these two pieces what happens is

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.660 
between these two pieces what happens is
when<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.320> push<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.829> on<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.130> one<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.369> push<00:01:53.549> on

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
when you push it on the one you push on

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.600 
when you push it on the one you push on
the<00:01:53.790> Bering<00:01:54.149> when<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.170> wears<00:01:55.290> out<00:01:55.610> it's

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
the Bering when it wears out it's

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.270 
the Bering when it wears out it's
actually<00:01:57.000> not<00:01:57.119> flat<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:58.140> gets<00:01:58.649> off<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.100> one

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
actually not flat it gets off to one

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.130 
actually not flat it gets off to one
side<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.729> then<00:01:59.850> wobbles<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.780> that's<00:02:00.960> what

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
side and then wobbles and that's what

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.069 
side and then wobbles and that's what
causes<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:02.009> judge<00:02:02.310> clutch<00:02:02.820> chatter<00:02:03.149> because<00:02:03.600> it

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
causes a judge clutch chatter because it

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.649 
causes a judge clutch chatter because it
has<00:02:04.229> different<00:02:04.500> as<00:02:04.850> it<00:02:05.850> wobbles<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.390> puts

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
has different as it wobbles it puts

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.109 
has different as it wobbles it puts
different<00:02:07.110> tension<00:02:07.829> on<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.550> sides<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:08.910> the

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
different tension on the sides of the

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.779 
different tension on the sides of the
pressure<00:02:09.899> plate

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
pressure plate

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
some of the where spots so these need to

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.140 
some of the where spots so these need to
be<00:02:42.139> serviced<00:02:42.709> they<00:02:42.950> need<00:02:43.159> to<00:02:43.250> be<00:02:43.370> ground<00:02:43.760> and

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
be serviced they need to be ground and

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.800 
be serviced they need to be ground and
they<00:02:44.959> need<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.230> be<00:02:45.379> even<00:02:46.099> so<00:02:47.000> when<00:02:47.299> you<00:02:47.450> put

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
they need to be even so when you put

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.059 
they need to be even so when you put
these<00:02:47.959> in<00:02:48.200> a<00:02:48.290> you're<00:02:48.560> going<00:02:48.680> to<00:02:48.739> have<00:02:48.829> to<00:02:48.889> put

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
these in a you're going to have to put

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.640 
these in a you're going to have to put
this<00:02:49.280> take<00:02:49.669> these<00:02:49.879> out<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.389> then<00:02:51.200> put<00:02:51.470> them<00:02:51.530> in

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
this take these out and then put them in

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.559 
this take these out and then put them in
a<00:02:51.709> flat<00:02:52.069> machine<00:02:52.489> where<00:02:52.700> these<00:02:53.030> are<00:02:53.269> ground

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
a flat machine where these are ground

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.580 
a flat machine where these are ground
flat<00:02:54.010> so<00:02:55.780> most<00:02:56.780> people<00:02:56.930> don't<00:02:57.230> have<00:02:57.439> the

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
flat so most people don't have the

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.330 
flat so most people don't have the
equipment<00:02:57.829> to<00:02:58.099> do<00:02:58.310> this<00:02:58.489> properly<00:02:58.819> and<00:03:00.340> they

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
equipment to do this properly and they

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.710 
equipment to do this properly and they
should<00:03:01.669> be<00:03:01.819> done<00:03:02.060> by<00:03:02.090> a<00:03:03.099> clutch<00:03:04.099> rebuilder<00:03:04.720> the

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
should be done by a clutch rebuilder the

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.159 
should be done by a clutch rebuilder the
next<00:03:06.019> problem<00:03:06.769> that<00:03:07.069> goes<00:03:07.220> bad<00:03:07.519> on<00:03:07.840> these<00:03:08.840> type

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:09.169 
next problem that goes bad on these type

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:13.179 
next problem that goes bad on these type
of<00:03:09.200> F&amp;S<00:03:09.799> clutches<00:03:10.310> is<00:03:10.459> the<00:03:11.299> springs<00:03:12.189> inside

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:13.189 
of F&amp;S clutches is the springs inside

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:16.149 
of F&amp;S clutches is the springs inside
the<00:03:13.459> cups<00:03:13.730> lose<00:03:14.689> their<00:03:14.959> spring<00:03:15.409> pressure<00:03:15.620> over

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 
the cups lose their spring pressure over

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.460 
the cups lose their spring pressure over
the<00:03:16.400> years<00:03:16.669> so<00:03:17.120> they<00:03:17.479> might<00:03:17.690> be<00:03:17.930> strong<00:03:18.290> when

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
the years so they might be strong when

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.159 
the years so they might be strong when
they<00:03:18.530> first<00:03:18.859> start<00:03:19.099> off<00:03:19.329> but<00:03:20.329> 20<00:03:20.690> years<00:03:20.900> down

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
they first start off but 20 years down

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
their tension so compared to what they

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.289 
their tension so compared to what they
were<00:03:30.560> originally<00:03:30.949> these<00:03:31.519> are<00:03:31.729> probably<00:03:32.090> only

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
were originally these are probably only

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.390 
were originally these are probably only
fifty<00:03:32.840> percent<00:03:33.290> of<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:33.739> pressure<00:03:33.979> that<00:03:34.099> they

fifty percent of the pressure that they
used<00:03:34.579> to<00:03:34.729> have<00:03:35.440> so<00:03:36.440> you<00:03:36.500> may<00:03:36.979> want<00:03:37.250> to<00:03:37.810> call<00:03:38.810> mr.
