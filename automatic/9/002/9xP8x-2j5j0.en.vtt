00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.220
 delicate blend indicating we ask you 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.160
 a frame with clouds 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.099
 they are nice to their friends even 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.039
 her practices that she jumped to the air at 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.860
 the air goes to air press the 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.290
 enter key to start the game 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.290
 20 you will not have city bike 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.030
 confronting this game we will defeat the 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.290
 virus the ropes 200 looks nice world 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.550
 it's squeeze and today we're 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.590
 found on a rather special game 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.730
 since this is a game with a 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.059
 unicorn 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.739
 so good game we will say a little vain 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.270
 certainly that is to say that control 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.430
 unicorn and we are in a world 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.770
 we need to recover species of 2 min 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.360
 unicorn who fly and we have to break 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.700
 stars and then that's it and the goal is 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.620
 to go as far as possible without 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.329
 lose his head as now then 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.430
 we can notice something quite 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.770
 annoying a complicating task 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.770
 the music listened to just that 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:09.550
 hence this music was created for you 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.020
 piss 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.610
 so we have the right to a double of 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.170
 are not it's still a very 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.370
 big technical advance do not ask me 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.610
 not how I found this game it's 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.190
 wrong it's not me without laughing it's a 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.410
 Nazi who gave me games and names but 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.630
 no but we sulk the village 2 stars 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.340
 what the fuck a bus at the base a 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.640
 star is gas and it does not hurt 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.560
 like that the carcinogenic impact 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.060
 short brief then you'll say but 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.880
 why he did this but it is something 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.750
 My con frankly you will have 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.670
 bad to believe me but I can tell you 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.080
 that this game is really really fun 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.550
 at lengthening we lost our three y 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.100
 unfortunately we did a little 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.150
 5000 good is not too bad it's the 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.580
 highest score we will try to beat 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.380
 all this but this game I mean who 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.480
 can entertain you especially and there you 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.940
 tell me I bet you'll tell me the 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.190
 cdi and yes when you're at the lease at 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.780
 cdi and you're bored and well you 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.190
 throw this game you put are very strong 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.960
 story that all your place you 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.790
 watch playing a game with 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.390
 a completely 70s music is 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.390
 pretty epic 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.780
 excuse me you're playing 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.430
 the voice announces anytime it's a 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.100
 exposed on the seventies 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.960
 students I'm typing on the 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.610
 songs of the time so that's it 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.110
 this is what explains a little there excuse me 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.980
 the background sound a little boring but 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.060
 agree to support and 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.320
 you type bars or just 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.480
 that you come back from a shitty day 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.080
 makes me want to think about nothing 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.370
 you piss 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.840
 they wanted it is still the game 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.460
 and honestly unicorns and when 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.100
 even very well done since we can 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.980
 note that already this is a unicorn robots 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.510
 and then it cried rayssac that no 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.700
 but wait but it's Maya he takes himself 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.100
 the tip of the thing that zack nothing and that that 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.750
 are multicolored and yes it's flashing 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.400
 red blue and yellow and it's an advanced 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.840
 very very very technological 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.450
 particular good I'd like to do 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.709
 a high enough score and in fact I'm 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.600
 always ask a question when I see 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.680
 this kind of game makes it good I think 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.780
 it's the same everyone is asking 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.750
 right now the guy who created this 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.580
 game is what the fuck the biggest 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.830
 hockey honor in which honor 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.020
 finally he was bad in his skin he 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.060
 wanted to make a game and he had some 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.480
 weird ideas or even lost a 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.820
 parish sorry that when plunges 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.019
 in I do not know but their voices when 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.100
 I wonder if it's people who 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.810
 come back at night etc have the idea of 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.519
 create a game like support will sa 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.750
 notice it's a bit cracked too but 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.050
 it's still way more fun than I 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:30.980
 put it there I confess that we play it without 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.269
 minutes and it's very much fun no but 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.970
 the ass of the fucking star but 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.560
 crap that go official canvases 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.730
 that of all so if it was enough lost 3 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.700
 right making the firecrackers new in 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.200
 basset these good old days 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.060
 it's after what I say it's really 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.230
 awful and I left the mouse at 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.920
 middle of the video during all the stuff 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.360
 it 's good to finally stress myself good 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.099
 otherwise there is not much to tell 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.530
 on this game and that's why I had 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.790
 planned the blow and I will tell you 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.920
 my new year and I think you're going 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.819
 really laugh then actually before 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.959
 everything newly I did for 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.010
 the money they want is fighting them 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.319
 balls to but hey like a 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.480
 story told it's always fun and 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.040
 not the che star 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.599
 to say kata mouth and tells 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.129
 the party in history where the New Year 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.110
 was we were at the base that 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:13.780
 some at a friend's house and we decided 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.790
 to go to a party so here we are 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.950
 happened to the Greeks and all were great on 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.739
 went to the party and in fact it was the 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.020
 most rotten evening but really the 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.930
 no more than I saw from my motto is 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.950
 the laughter once you enter the 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.750
 piece you know you it's from the 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.190
 shit so in fact we opened the door 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.479
 entrance we were there yeah we go 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.729
 stay with a friend of mine we go 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:35.290
 do it tomorrow can be funny more 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.910
 he has an office where everything will be fine 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.750
 fun a good month this - actually it's a 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.340
 thing that makes me laugh is always the 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.840
 people who could schemas and people who 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:52.389
 leave the shy they get off 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:55.150
 totally hello excavations 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:05:00.610
 it takes a lot of bullshit 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:03.820
 and there are some who make one to me 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:06.700
 look like fox I was going 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:10.060
 rethink everything does look like that for 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.770
 adults you want to see you two no thain 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.690
 that do not touch my girlfriend is 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.830
 obvious the sleeve there are plenty of people 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.710
 who reacts differently alcohol and I 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.260
 I looked at this finally brief kinship 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.910
 on the finished school we enter and there the 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.010
 people were sitting in circles on 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.680
 chairs that were positioned all 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.490
 around the entrance then a little bit you 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.170
 to say but what the fuck 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.200
 in fact when you come back into the room 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.700
 you have a bunch of people who 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.850
 look and who do not speak and who 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.350
 make a person great and so early 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.210
 I say fucking but what the fuck 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.550
 sacred a piano a kind of mecca that 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.890
 sounded for wiz khalifa white version 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:48.100
 even leaner to see she is 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:50.320
 then the stone yeah yeahs helped a lot 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.970
 rue des pins but how dove it went 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.300
 shit but you're just a big shit 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.950
 mastiff 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.000
 after that it's true basset layer for 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.760
 become a good job it's now 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.740
 to the lawyers like so it was 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.000
 really weird a delusion really 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.550
 home with what is your 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.230
 personality and I'm really better 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:08.020
 lodged bed like a passerby and in fact 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.100
 people would have said I did this 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.140
 little theory people were happy 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.190
 to come to the party he was not 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.480
 happy because we were going to animate the 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.730
 thing or what we left three minutes 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.590
 afterwards but he was happy because we 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.000
 came and we saw it is to shit 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.010
 with them and that when we arrive and 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.090
 usually receives we are supposed to stay 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.650
 at least one hour pressure is done 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.440
 not and suddenly you see on their 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:28.120
 gold faces the you are what's that with 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.250
 we have you pissed off the whole 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.180
 evening and that made me read enough that 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.920
 when I thought I was fucking 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.620
 it's really a koala thing 

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.670
 the big thing well down well in what 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.950
 she would be really hard I had to 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:40.969
 to stay brief we left because I 

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:43.369
 received a text message from the mother tells me ok 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:45.860
 I 'm going to stop yes it's an excuse 

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:48.349
 between us six matches not this video 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.969
 do not blame me alas this story 

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:50.989
 really stupid that there had to be some 

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:52.969
 count of the new year because 

00:06:50.989 --> 00:06:54.229
 frankly it was just the evening but 

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:56.779
 one of the evenings but the plans and the 

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:58.399
 zero lice of the planet earth on time 

00:06:56.779 --> 00:07:00.169
 current in any case I hope this little 

00:06:58.399 --> 00:07:02.479
 Unicorn game will be more of a hunting 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:05.179
 little video to introduce stupid game 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:06.379
 and my new investigation here is a beauf and 

00:07:05.179 --> 00:07:08.239
 do not worry there will be videos 

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:10.789
 much longer especially from the week 

00:07:08.239 --> 00:07:12.709
 next a little series with the i 

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:14.179
