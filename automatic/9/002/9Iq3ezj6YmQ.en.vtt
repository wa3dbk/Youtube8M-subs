00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.940
 no matter 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.170
 I would have to download prerequisite 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.269
 you have to be one in all cases 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.789
 strong pc have on the server yes 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.620
 your pc is running and he needs it too 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.899
 still good internet if you have one 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.339
 then there will be bad connection 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:56.289
 has some problems for the others 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.539
 people because they somehow 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.280
 of course then have to connect 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.659
 does he need the server as you go 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.819
 just a ticket sorry 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:06.220
 you will find right there is coming 

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:08.020
 it does not depend on the technology platform and 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.759
 just donald the server here 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.759
 that is always the most recent of the 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.530
 disposal is therefore the primary 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:18.430
 is spent or how come the 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.899
 bulls and miami are the version you get 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.649
 has now got louder with the czech 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.909
 those are the ones that are not finished so 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.850
 still contain wax 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.960
 then installing simple matthies 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.030
 I have already made 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.469
 hertie is now to where I 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:38.079
 hides some animal then you go 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:39.369
 just put on network and 90 and 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:40.719
 create a network i just do 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:46.340
 to set the short time 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:50.539
 I now say just once firmly ticket 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:53.750
 and that forssell assumes 32 31 23 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:55.520
 is now power is it is there now that 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.380
 top I would be just now ne 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.689
 delete bottle 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.789
 and then you can already have the npd is 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.700
 ever before copy and then wait 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:07.250
 until it's done there's a yes 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.259
 would be with higher but only the one 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:14.060
 It does not sound like that now 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:20.390
 has a problem with the internet says 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:22.400
 The other one does not want to talk 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.010
 So then maybe just a new one 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.560
 Folder you just have to like that 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.319
 you want to have your folder standing 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.690
 because we already had the problem 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.640
 that you simply tried applications in 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:41.450
 a file to open or in one 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:45.260
 zip file so no comment on it knows 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:48.530
 I do not but I can come it yes me 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.220
 If you want them, then you go up 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.530
 server properties and then goes up 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.470
 yours either with or with the whole 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.299
 normal ze vitor and i just go 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.290
 here the servers ip one always 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.410
 on 1 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.060
 at the same time her pcs but not 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.819
 now try to copy here and 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.859
 think mark ii does not bring you there 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.940
 They always changed every two hours 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:17.520
 will be so yes 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.690
 cilia example when I make videos 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.360
 So then you save the whole 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.360
 just start and then just start the 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.010
 ticket will be on your whole mods 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.600
 can be loaded minecraft year you can 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.520
 start but I noticed 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.380
 that everyone has to work 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.120
 Therefore, you should prefer the ticket to 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.180
 he and I will show you how 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.450
 everything works just like it does now 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.730
 good the server in addition to it 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.950
 State-once technology twice louder 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.140
 once inside the place as if it knows 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.960
 it works and a bilateral once 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.550
 my version namely the cracked for 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.530
 they minecraft mine not bought 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.260
 have I go here ever since on 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.780
 play and if of course respect 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.340
 minecraft have what most yes 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.030
 my homepage you can this here 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.920
 download 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.560
 he even includes all motech 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.540
 few more like from the original we now 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.250
 can see here and always the 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.440
 latest version like here to 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.840
 disposal so really even expand 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.109
 and once thus equipped with premium and 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:21.489
 not even the others and that 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:25.060
 times so connecting still create such day 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:27.540
 updates bound so last and had 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.820
 the one again and again 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.860
 the server is now loaded 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:37.930
 I'll give me op rights with it 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:39.400
 I forgot again and then 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.300
 just start both minecraft 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:45.430
 things so the friends who now have you 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.790
 you have to to all cases the networks 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.710
 give and of course the extra ip 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.560
 Normally you are here now 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:56.230
 you have to fold out your name is here 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.940
 not there is always behind me 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.340
 But it was best to let it again 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.980
 give because sometimes unmistakable 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.100
 sometimes that too and that's it 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:08.020
 problem with that then does not work 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.360
 then now on multiplayer beta server 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:14.940
 and add the server here 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.940
 that's about original us now 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:22.540
 server from are eighth on many lines 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:27.250
 which she of course is here now 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:28.510
 Zero point 6.1 is so bad now 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.800
 get out of here and just say over 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.150
 because that's the latest one 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.460
 version with 98 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.240
 But that's how they got out of the rudder 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.100
 function 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.740
 here has already been tested by me 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:43.390
 started 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.390
 and it blew through quite well 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:52.690
 shows right in it comes so close to rule 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.690
 Here I found you once 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:06:00.460
 well that's a little bit now 

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:01.599
 with the matter explained that bothers me 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.009
 not now because I do not know about it now 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:04.990
 I have to stop some of that 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:09.240
 stop opening what do you understand? 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.240
 again and again on the solving things alone 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.919
 he does not have to laugh at this 

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:13.919
 getting worse 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:20.139
 a little later a problem gets so 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:21.099
 certainly can tell the matter 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:24.039
 decided and can now also here 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:25.330
 Put everything if you are now 24 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:26.650
 have started or something else 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.419
 then you can check out the items they all 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.029
 but if you then try to get it 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:33.159
 to put what you little that click on it 

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:34.409
 and finished my hand and here it is 

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:36.699
 here 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:38.590
 Therefore , this is the work that works now 

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:41.979
 was now having some variant so 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:44.650
 speak free variant next few 

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:46.449
 We namely digital variant it namely 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:50.979
 can make over the question namely 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:54.580
 a 24 on the other hand what else 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:56.740
 in time fdp variant can be so 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.060
 that 's it then now i have people and 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:02.409
 You can now easily select here 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:04.419
 between the stretcher or dvd can us 

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:07.180
 again press play and the video 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:11.819
 Look again so that's it 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.819
 today and cattle herders next part
