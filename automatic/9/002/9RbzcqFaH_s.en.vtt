00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 hello friends of the club welcome to 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.529
 dvd criticism one more trailer check 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.630
 or better, second trailer check 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:14.990
 to 300 empire are the words of the oracle 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.990
 a warning 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.830
 or will fall 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.560
 whole greece will fall 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.480
 and only warships can still do it 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.480
 rescue 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.560
 warships 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.560
 and a tidal wave will be made 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.949
 only the gods can the greeks 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.290
 to be God King 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.840
 the glory 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.830
 Today is also the 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.570
 responsible dancing 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.800
 passing 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.800
 sold the death itself 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.820
 bring them all 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.320
 leonidas and the brave 310 deaths have 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.729
 I'm not enough for your dream one 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.870
 small greece sacrificed the 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:41.940
 masterclass a king 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:44.210
 A smile on my guest 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.210
 For 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.290
 the resort could 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.130
 we prefer to die standing 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.130
 on the 2 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.380
 I'm getting ready today , I 'm ready 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.460
 the deep ones or see 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.460
 otherwise would be 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.540
 a storm is over greece 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.469
 a storm of retribution 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.060
 I have to honestly say the second 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.710
 trailer is very similar to the first one 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.270
 little dramatically with the 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.920
 musical background there is still 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.390
 more than logos many sequences double 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.010
 but if you can see that 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.240
 mainly happen on 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.420
 high seas and with warships 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.550
 300 nm will take us 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.560
 warner brothers expected from the 6 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.820
 march 2014 in German cinemas 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.160
 told the story after the 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.140
 sealing the 300 all around leonidas and 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.610
 the next Persian wave on 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.200
 greece to roll the fights 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.300
 Must be on high seas this time 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.180
 played against a war leader 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.830
 from evergreen the only sex is just god 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.110
 he called himself god 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.130
 people from that commands and accepts 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.050
 then they come to a battle 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.490
 high seas and that with a whole lot 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.800
 brute action will be very strong 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.970
 very many logos will be bloody 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.170
 at least you can see that in there 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.520
 in the trailer and many will be very 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.530
 Epic work with this metal 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.480
 straughan look probably a whole 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.130
 amount where it is up I'm curious if 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.200
 the film can keep up with the template 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.780
 which I think she always sees 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.190
 is epic and that is sparta is in 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.800
 Such a sentence has somehow turned out 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.330
 brought the blockbuster out in the year 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.470
 and very much in many minds 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.810
 implanted but I have to be honest 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.400
 say that at 300 I also liked that 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.930
 it has just been told two levels 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.980
 always went for the battle on the one 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.860
 side and on one side the 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.990
 intrigues of the senate in sparta itself ob 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.730
 you will not be here at 303 now empire 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.110
 this second level is also there 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.030
 I'm very curious because both trailer 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.920
 currently see only in quotation marks 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.360
 after very many battles and blood 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.830
 I'm curious, I think 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.380
 The whole thing is even in 3d in the cinemas 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.760
 which could then very peaceful during 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.900
 I'm curious and open 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.490
 I hope that one here narrative 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.680
 just this second level is because 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.910
 just knock each other for blood 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.470
 maybe I can inject too 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.940
 a bit too monotonous so quite 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.800
 a bit skeptical 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.750
 and then we look like 300 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.060
 houses of empire on the high seas starting from the 6th 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.470
 March 2014 will hit the cinemas in the cinemas 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.470
 it was now with my second raczek too 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.790
 give 300 travel of the empire like 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.110
 A thumb in this motto let it 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.490
 stay if not like because you look 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.260
 past two movie reviews over or 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.460
 one more at twitter and facebook 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.810
 want to write a bit about movies 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.460
 subscribe to this or second channel 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.560
 if you have no videos from and with me 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.000
 Let's miss it 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.860
 but that will decide the day after tomorrow 50 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.900
 there is a new video here at the latest 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:45.840
 and by then I hope since tomorrow 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.840
 again, of course, on 3
