00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.650 
hopefully I mean we won't get sound on
the<00:00:17.670> output<00:00:18.439> we<00:00:19.439> can<00:00:19.910> we'll<00:00:20.910> get<00:00:21.060> my<00:00:21.180> voice<00:00:21.390> if

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
don't know many bloodlines we're going

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.450 
don't know many bloodlines we're going
to<00:00:27.900> do<00:00:28.019> on<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.260> because<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.830> think<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.279> don't

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
to do on this because I think I don't

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.679 
to do on this because I think I don't
know<00:00:29.519> how<00:00:29.580> long<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.880> goes<00:00:30.000> on<00:00:30.150> fire<00:00:30.359> but<00:00:30.539> we

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
know how long it goes on fire but we

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.540 
know how long it goes on fire but we
won't<00:00:30.869> do<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.230> first<00:00:31.410> one<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.489> I'm

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
won't do it in the first one so I'm

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.889 
won't do it in the first one so I'm
guessing<00:00:32.790> maybe<00:00:33.090> about<00:00:33.390> two<00:00:33.630> or<00:00:33.719> three

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
guessing maybe about two or three

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:34.970 
guessing maybe about two or three
because<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.290> can<00:00:34.320> be<00:00:34.469> do<00:00:34.590> different<00:00:34.950> things

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
because you can be do different things

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:47.200 
because you can be do different things
each<00:00:35.250> time<00:00:36.890> that's<00:00:37.890> cool<00:00:42.140> one<00:00:43.140> is
