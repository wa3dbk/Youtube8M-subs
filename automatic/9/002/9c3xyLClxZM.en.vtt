00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
start from the first 30 seconds would

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.440

was big Curtis miss one and anybody

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.110 
was big Curtis miss one and anybody
mistake<00:01:25.740> he<00:01:25.860> made<00:01:26.010> by<00:01:26.190> the<00:01:26.250> way<00:01:26.430> all<00:01:26.550> day<00:01:26.760> but

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
mistake he made by the way all day but

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.120 
mistake he made by the way all day but
yeah<00:01:27.810> you're<00:01:27.960> right<00:01:28.140> we<00:01:28.380> we<00:01:28.680> got<00:01:28.830> off<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.040> an

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
yeah you're right we we got off to an

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.100 
yeah you're right we we got off to an
office<00:01:29.430> job<00:01:29.460> but<00:01:29.760> the<00:01:29.820> longer<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.180> went<00:01:30.330> in<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
office job but the longer it went in the

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.180 
office job but the longer it went in the
second<00:01:31.440> half<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.710> thought<00:01:31.890> we<00:01:32.010> were<00:01:32.100> excellent

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
second half I thought we were excellent

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.460 
second half I thought we were excellent
I<00:01:32.670> thought<00:01:32.850> apart<00:01:33.720> from<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.990> mistake<00:01:34.320> from

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
I thought apart from the mistake from

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.650 
I thought apart from the mistake from
the<00:01:34.530> goalkeeper<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.610> really<00:01:36.030> didn't<00:01:36.300> cause<00:01:36.450> as

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
the goalkeeper it really didn't cause as

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.510 
the goalkeeper it really didn't cause as
much<00:01:36.780> problems<00:01:37.260> and<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.979> longer<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.369> game

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
much problems and the longer the game

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.030 
much problems and the longer the game
went<00:01:38.729> on<00:01:38.850> we<00:01:39.090> looked<00:01:39.300> more<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.080> threat<00:01:40.260> love

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
went on we looked more of a threat love

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.310 
went on we looked more of a threat love
the<00:01:41.160> threat<00:01:41.430> getting<00:01:41.729> forward<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.110> thought

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
the threat getting forward and I thought

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.140 
the threat getting forward and I thought
if<00:01:43.979> anybody's<00:01:44.369> going<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.580> win<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.880> game<00:01:44.910> was

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
if anybody's going to win the game was

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.180 
if anybody's going to win the game was
going<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.360> be<00:01:45.450> us<00:01:45.570> but<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.800> know<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.040> one
