solo<00:01:46.799> tripper<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.520> best<00:01:47.729> girl<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.329> world

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
solo tripper the best girl in the world

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.080 
solo tripper the best girl in the world
so<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.439> comes<00:01:49.619> in<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.860> little<00:01:49.979> case<00:01:50.250> which<00:01:50.909> is

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
so it comes in a little case which is

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.520 
so it comes in a little case which is
handy<00:01:51.450> only<00:01:51.869> for<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.079> reason<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.320> it's

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
handy only for the reason that it's

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.380 
handy only for the reason that it's
gonna<00:01:52.710> be<00:01:52.799> covered<00:01:53.280> in<00:01:53.430> Korea<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.090> it's<00:01:54.270> going

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
gonna be covered in Korea so it's going

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.969 
gonna be covered in Korea so it's going
to<00:01:54.450> be<00:01:54.509> covered<00:01:54.720> in<00:01:54.899> black<00:01:55.170> all<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.439> time<00:01:55.740> so

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
to be covered in black all the time so

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.170 
to be covered in black all the time so
this<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.130> just<00:01:56.340> gonna<00:01:56.490> keep<00:01:56.700> everything<00:01:57.000> else

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
this is just gonna keep everything else

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.450 
this is just gonna keep everything else
in<00:01:57.329> your<00:01:57.420> pack<00:01:57.630> nice<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.049> clean<00:01:58.200> now<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.340> open

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
in your pack nice and clean now you open

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.010 
in your pack nice and clean now you open
it<00:01:59.729> up<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.829> it's<00:02:01.829> just<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:02.130> very<00:02:02.340> simple<00:02:03.020> grill

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
it up and it's just a very simple grill

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.840 
it up and it's just a very simple grill
first<00:02:04.740> thing<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.100> notice<00:02:05.399> is<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.579> there's

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
first thing you notice is that there's

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.089 
first thing you notice is that there's
no<00:02:05.969> legs<00:02:06.540> on<00:02:06.750> this<00:02:06.899> grill<00:02:07.140> but<00:02:07.619> that's<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:07.950> good

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
no legs on this grill but that's a good

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.479 
no legs on this grill but that's a good
thing<00:02:08.280> so<00:02:08.849> I<00:02:09.539> looked<00:02:10.289> at<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:10.500> product<00:02:10.950> for

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
thing so I looked at this product for

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.880 
thing so I looked at this product for
about<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.730> year<00:02:12.030> before<00:02:12.330> actually<00:02:13.110> purchasing

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
about a year before actually purchasing

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.740 
about a year before actually purchasing
and<00:02:13.950> I<00:02:14.010> think<00:02:14.069> I<00:02:14.280> paid<00:02:14.490> around<00:02:14.760> $60<00:02:15.450> for<00:02:15.720> it

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
and I think I paid around $60 for it

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.380 
and I think I paid around $60 for it
which<00:02:16.200> seems<00:02:16.410> like<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.620> lot<00:02:16.860> but<00:02:17.100> I've<00:02:18.030> had<00:02:18.270> it

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
which seems like a lot but I've had it

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.910 
which seems like a lot but I've had it
for<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.569> couple<00:02:18.630> years<00:02:18.900> it's<00:02:19.290> gonna<00:02:19.410> last<00:02:19.680> my

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
for a couple years it's gonna last my

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.320 
for a couple years it's gonna last my
lifetime<00:02:20.370> providing<00:02:20.819> I<00:02:20.880> don't<00:02:21.060> leave<00:02:21.209> it

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
lifetime providing I don't leave it

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.320 
lifetime providing I don't leave it
anywhere<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.920> it<00:02:22.920> has<00:02:23.100> probably<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.180> most

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
anywhere and it has probably the most

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.210 
anywhere and it has probably the most
simple<00:02:24.600> but<00:02:25.080> most<00:02:25.260> essential<00:02:25.590> features<00:02:26.069> that

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
simple but most essential features that

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.160 
simple but most essential features that
you<00:02:26.310> could<00:02:26.459> ever<00:02:26.580> need<00:02:26.760> in<00:02:26.880> a<00:02:26.940> grill<00:02:27.150> so<00:02:27.360> number

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
you could ever need in a grill so number

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.900 
you could ever need in a grill so number
one<00:02:28.350> it's<00:02:28.709> extremely<00:02:28.860> lightweight

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
one it's extremely lightweight

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.760 
one it's extremely lightweight
I<00:02:29.940> haven't<00:02:30.420> weed<00:02:30.660> this<00:02:30.900> I<00:02:31.170> probably<00:02:31.530> should

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
I haven't weed this I probably should

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.400 
I haven't weed this I probably should
weigh<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.070> on<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.190> little<00:02:32.459> scale<00:02:32.700> but<00:02:33.300> it's<00:02:34.200> not

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
weigh it on a little scale but it's not

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.550 
weigh it on a little scale but it's not
very<00:02:34.650> heavy<00:02:34.830> at<00:02:35.010> all<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:37.170> person<00:02:37.530> that

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
very heavy at all and the person that

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.380 
very heavy at all and the person that
makes<00:02:37.830> these<00:02:37.980> girls<00:02:38.280> at<00:02:38.490> Purcell<00:02:38.790> ranch<00:02:39.150> you

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
makes these girls at Purcell ranch you

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.790 
makes these girls at Purcell ranch you
really<00:02:39.690> thought<00:02:39.870> about<00:02:40.140> okay<00:02:40.410> what's<00:02:40.650> the

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
really thought about okay what's the

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.650 
really thought about okay what's the
simplest<00:02:41.100> way<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.400> make<00:02:41.520> a<00:02:41.670> grill<00:02:42.000> but<00:02:42.480> what's

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
simplest way to make a grill but what's

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.090 
simplest way to make a grill but what's
the<00:02:42.780> best<00:02:42.959> way<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.200> make<00:02:43.440> it<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.800> ensure<00:02:44.069> that

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
the best way to make it to ensure that

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.280 
the best way to make it to ensure that
there's<00:02:44.400> no<00:02:44.550> aggravation<00:02:45.209> that<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.959> does<00:02:46.140> what

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
there's no aggravation that it does what

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.870 
there's no aggravation that it does what
it's<00:02:46.440> supposed<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.770> do<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.100> that<00:02:47.190> it's<00:02:47.820> really

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
it's supposed to do and that it's really

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.650 
it's supposed to do and that it's really
easy<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.420> work<00:02:48.540> with<00:02:48.600> so<00:02:50.090> what<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.209> got<00:02:51.420> here

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
easy to work with so what you got here

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.120 
easy to work with so what you got here
the<00:02:52.230> entire<00:02:52.650> grill<00:02:53.100> is<00:02:53.360> tubular<00:02:54.590> steel<00:02:55.590> it's

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
the entire grill is tubular steel it's

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.979 
the entire grill is tubular steel it's
all<00:02:56.280> tubed<00:02:56.550> steel<00:02:56.970> which<00:02:57.660> is<00:02:57.810> going<00:02:57.930> to

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
all tubed steel which is going to

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.540 
all tubed steel which is going to
provide<00:02:58.320> two<00:02:58.530> things<00:02:58.769> number<00:02:58.950> one<00:02:59.250> it's<00:02:59.430> going

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
provide two things number one it's going

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.000 
provide two things number one it's going
to<00:02:59.610> provide<00:03:00.140> exceptional<00:03:01.140> strength<00:03:01.769> to

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
to provide exceptional strength to

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.009 
to provide exceptional strength to
weight<00:03:02.160> ratio<00:03:02.450> so<00:03:03.450> it's<00:03:03.570> gonna<00:03:03.690> be<00:03:03.810> really

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
weight ratio so it's gonna be really

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.250 
weight ratio so it's gonna be really
strong<00:03:04.380> and<00:03:04.650> number<00:03:05.640> two<00:03:05.959> this<00:03:06.959> thing<00:03:07.170> is

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
strong and number two this thing is

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.500 
strong and number two this thing is
going<00:03:07.380> to<00:03:07.470> cool<00:03:07.650> off<00:03:07.860> really<00:03:08.580> quickly<00:03:08.970> I<00:03:09.150> could

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
going to cool off really quickly I could

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.610 
going to cool off really quickly I could
probably<00:03:09.660> take<00:03:09.870> this<00:03:10.019> off<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.380> fire<00:03:10.590> and

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
probably take this off the fire and

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.400 
probably take this off the fire and
within<00:03:11.070> two<00:03:11.790> minutes<00:03:12.120> three<00:03:12.330> minutes<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:12.930> can

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
within two minutes three minutes I can

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.960 
within two minutes three minutes I can
pick<00:03:13.560> it<00:03:13.590> up<00:03:13.769> put<00:03:13.980> in<00:03:14.070> my<00:03:14.190> packet<00:03:14.580> cools<00:03:14.790> off

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
pick it up put in my packet cools off

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.210 
pick it up put in my packet cools off
really<00:03:15.480> quickly<00:03:15.870> yeah<00:03:16.380> it's<00:03:16.620> super<00:03:16.769> strong

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
really quickly yeah it's super strong

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.610 
really quickly yeah it's super strong
the<00:03:17.880> next<00:03:18.150> thing<00:03:18.360> and<00:03:18.540> I<00:03:19.170> hope<00:03:19.290> that<00:03:19.440> everyone

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
edges everything has been rounded off

for solo use again I use this for solo

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.860 
for solo use again I use this for solo
but<00:05:44.220> some<00:05:44.460> guys<00:05:44.610> want<00:05:44.910> you<00:05:45.120> know<00:05:45.210> just<00:05:45.450> the<00:05:45.690> one

pot thing so for solo use you can get a

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.510 
pot thing so for solo use you can get a
smaller<00:05:48.840> one<00:05:49.110> which<00:05:49.680> is<00:05:49.830> more<00:05:50.010> streamlined

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
smaller one which is more streamlined

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.530 
smaller one which is more streamlined
and<00:05:50.790> they<00:05:51.210> also<00:05:51.390> make<00:05:51.690> them<00:05:51.950> in<00:05:53.000> in<00:05:54.000> a

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 
and they also make them in in a

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.240 
and they also make them in in a
different<00:05:54.900> shape<00:05:55.440> where<00:05:55.710> it's<00:05:55.830> not<00:05:55.980> just

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
different shape where it's not just

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.610 
different shape where it's not just
these<00:05:56.340> grill<00:05:56.610> supports<00:05:57.030> but<00:05:57.270> there's<00:05:57.450> also

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
these grill supports but there's also

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.440 
these grill supports but there's also
like<00:05:58.620> a<00:05:58.680> grid<00:05:58.980> area<00:05:59.130> almost<00:05:59.640> where<00:05:59.880> you<00:06:00.240> can

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:00.450 
like a grid area almost where you can

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.030 
like a grid area almost where you can
cook<00:06:00.720> fish<00:06:00.930> over<00:06:01.170> top<00:06:01.380> of<00:06:01.530> it<00:06:01.620> and<00:06:01.710> broiled

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.040 
cook fish over top of it and broiled

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.920 
cook fish over top of it and broiled
fish<00:06:02.190> and<00:06:02.430> it's<00:06:03.060> really<00:06:03.360> easy<00:06:03.480> to<00:06:03.570> work<00:06:03.660> with

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
fish and it's really easy to work with

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.920 
fish and it's really easy to work with
with<00:06:04.080> that<00:06:04.230> so<00:06:04.950> we're<00:06:05.670> gonna<00:06:05.760> turn<00:06:06.510> the<00:06:06.630> camera

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
with that so we're gonna turn the camera

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.420 
with that so we're gonna turn the camera
off<00:06:06.990> now<00:06:07.050> we're<00:06:07.470> gonna<00:06:07.560> switch<00:06:07.860> locations

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
off now we're gonna switch locations

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.580 
off now we're gonna switch locations
down<00:06:08.670> to<00:06:08.850> the<00:06:08.940> lake<00:06:09.120> and<00:06:09.330> we're<00:06:10.110> gonna<00:06:10.230> look<00:06:10.440> at

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
down to the lake and we're gonna look at

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.370 
down to the lake and we're gonna look at
some<00:06:11.150> boiling<00:06:12.150> water<00:06:12.390> and<00:06:12.750> action<00:06:13.110> with<00:06:13.260> this
