00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.910 

now<00:00:13.630> we're<00:00:13.809> dealing<00:00:14.140> with<00:00:14.170> the<00:00:14.380> stream<00:00:14.680> line

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:14.920 
now we're dealing with the stream line

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.590 
now we're dealing with the stream line
now<00:00:15.160> the<00:00:15.219> stream<00:00:15.639> line<00:00:15.850> is<00:00:16.059> one<00:00:16.209> of<00:00:16.330> the<00:00:16.390> most

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:16.600 
now the stream line is one of the most

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.330 
now the stream line is one of the most
critical<00:00:17.080> skills<00:00:17.410> that<00:00:17.740> a<00:00:17.770> swimmer<00:00:18.100> can

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.340 
critical skills that a swimmer can

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.790 
critical skills that a swimmer can
develop<00:00:18.820> the<00:00:19.510> reason<00:00:19.869> that<00:00:19.960> it's<00:00:20.140> so<00:00:20.200> critical

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
develop the reason that it's so critical

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.310 
develop the reason that it's so critical
is<00:00:20.950> because<00:00:21.550> it<00:00:22.029> is<00:00:22.270> the<00:00:22.420> fastest<00:00:23.110> that<00:00:23.259> a

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
is because it is the fastest that a

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.170 
is because it is the fastest that a
swimmer<00:00:23.680> will<00:00:23.920> actually<00:00:24.430> move<00:00:24.640> in<00:00:24.849> the<00:00:24.970> water

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
swimmer will actually move in the water

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.120 
swimmer will actually move in the water
coming<00:00:25.810> off<00:00:25.990> of<00:00:26.170> the<00:00:26.230> walls<00:00:26.470> and<00:00:26.830> on<00:00:27.099> the

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
coming off of the walls and on the

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.179 
coming off of the walls and on the
starts<00:00:27.910> with<00:00:28.090> a<00:00:28.509> tight<00:00:28.989> streamline<00:00:29.410> you'll

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
starts with a tight streamline you'll

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.580 
starts with a tight streamline you'll
never<00:00:30.460> swim<00:00:30.970> as<00:00:31.270> fast<00:00:31.509> as<00:00:31.840> you're<00:00:32.020> moving<00:00:32.200> as

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
never swim as fast as you're moving as

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.800 
never swim as fast as you're moving as
you<00:00:32.619> explode<00:00:33.280> off<00:00:33.489> of<00:00:33.640> the<00:00:33.730> wall<00:00:33.910> so<00:00:34.450> it's<00:00:34.630> very

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:34.810 
you explode off of the wall so it's very

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.389 
you explode off of the wall so it's very
very<00:00:35.079> important<00:00:35.649> that<00:00:35.710> you<00:00:35.920> have<00:00:35.950> a<00:00:36.130> tight

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399 
very important that you have a tight

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:41.860 
very important that you have a tight
streamline

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.500 

now<00:00:42.590> essentially<00:00:43.130> a<00:00:43.280> streamline<00:00:43.970> is<00:00:44.150> making

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
now essentially a streamline is making

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.080 
now essentially a streamline is making
the<00:00:44.600> body<00:00:44.750> as<00:00:45.050> slender<00:00:45.800> as<00:00:46.220> skinny<00:00:46.700> in<00:00:46.940> the

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
the body as slender as skinny in the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.420 
the body as slender as skinny in the
water<00:00:47.300> as<00:00:47.540> possible<00:00:47.960> to<00:00:48.770> cut<00:00:49.010> down<00:00:49.220> on

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
water as possible to cut down on

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.400 
water as possible to cut down on
resistance<00:00:50.120> so<00:00:50.300> the<00:00:50.420> body<00:00:50.630> moves<00:00:51.050> more

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
resistance so the body moves more

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.950 
resistance so the body moves more
smoothly<00:00:51.980> through<00:00:52.460> the<00:00:52.489> water<00:00:52.960> maintaining

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
smoothly through the water maintaining

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.170 
smoothly through the water maintaining
speed<00:00:54.320> and<00:00:54.530> momentum<00:00:54.680> now<00:00:55.520> that<00:00:55.940> the

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
speed and momentum now that the

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.479 
speed and momentum now that the
important<00:00:56.630> parts<00:00:56.900> of<00:00:57.020> a<00:00:57.290> streamline<00:00:57.890> number

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
important parts of a streamline number

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.670 
important parts of a streamline number
one<00:00:58.730> is<00:00:59.000> the<00:00:59.239> shoulders<00:00:59.780> the<00:01:00.020> shoulders<00:01:00.050> are

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
one is the shoulders the shoulders are

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.770 
one is the shoulders the shoulders are
the<00:01:00.710> widest<00:01:01.280> part<00:01:01.489> of<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:01.699> body<00:01:01.940> structurally

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
the widest part of the body structurally

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.540 
the widest part of the body structurally
so<00:01:03.170> they're<00:01:03.320> going<00:01:03.410> to<00:01:03.500> catch<00:01:03.830> the<00:01:04.070> most<00:01:04.250> water

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
so they're going to catch the most water

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.590 
so they're going to catch the most water
they're<00:01:04.820> going<00:01:04.940> to<00:01:05.030> catch<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:05.420> most

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
they're going to catch the most

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.330 
they're going to catch the most
resistance<00:01:06.200> so<00:01:06.650> you<00:01:06.680> want<00:01:06.979> to<00:01:07.070> try<00:01:07.280> to

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
resistance so you want to try to

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.420 
resistance so you want to try to
eliminate<00:01:07.970> that<00:01:08.540> resistance<00:01:09.170> by<00:01:09.619> making<00:01:10.160> by

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
eliminate that resistance by making by

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.430 
eliminate that resistance by making by
allowing<00:01:10.970> the<00:01:11.060> water<00:01:11.270> to<00:01:11.450> actually<00:01:11.900> slide

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
allowing the water to actually slide

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.859 
allowing the water to actually slide
around<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:13.040> shoulders<00:01:13.460> making<00:01:14.420> them<00:01:14.690> as

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
around the shoulders making them as

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.530 
around the shoulders making them as
slender<00:01:15.229> as<00:01:15.619> possible<00:01:16.310> in<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:16.640> water<00:01:16.850> I<00:01:17.090> like

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
slender as possible in the water I like

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.630 
slender as possible in the water I like
to<00:01:17.660> tell<00:01:17.899> my<00:01:18.080> swimmers<00:01:18.500> that<00:01:18.800> your<00:01:19.250> what<00:01:19.460> your

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
to tell my swimmers that your what your

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.070 
to tell my swimmers that your what your
shoulders<00:01:20.119> are<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.330> widest<00:01:20.750> part<00:01:20.930> of<00:01:21.020> your

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
shoulders are the widest part of your

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.780 
shoulders are the widest part of your
body<00:01:21.380> but<00:01:21.830> you're<00:01:22.100> going<00:01:22.220> to<00:01:22.280> try<00:01:22.520> to<00:01:22.550> make

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
body but you're going to try to make

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.999 
body but you're going to try to make
them<00:01:23.030> one<00:01:23.540> of<00:01:23.660> the<00:01:23.780> skinniest<00:01:24.290> parts<00:01:24.740> of<00:01:24.860> your

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
them one of the skinniest parts of your

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:45.990 
them one of the skinniest parts of your
body

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.260 

number<00:01:46.900> one<00:01:47.110> hands<00:01:47.920> overlapped<00:01:48.490> this<00:01:49.090> is<00:01:49.240> a

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
number one hands overlapped this is a

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.270 
number one hands overlapped this is a
bad<00:01:49.540> habit<00:01:49.570> don't<00:01:50.230> have<00:01:50.410> your<00:01:50.560> hands<00:01:50.770> next<00:01:51.130> to

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
bad habit don't have your hands next to

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.810 
bad habit don't have your hands next to
each<00:01:51.400> other

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
each other

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.540 
each other
alright<00:01:52.360> so<00:01:52.630> hands<00:01:53.080> overlap<00:01:53.470> you<00:01:54.250> want<00:01:54.460> to

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
alright so hands overlap you want to

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.480 
alright so hands overlap you want to
lock<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:55.120> streamline<00:01:55.750> just<00:01:56.620> behind<00:01:56.980> the<00:01:57.220> head

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
lock the streamline just behind the head

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.060 
lock the streamline just behind the head
with<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:57.970> head<00:01:58.180> resting<00:01:59.170> on<00:01:59.350> the<00:01:59.530> biceps

with the head resting on the biceps

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.980 
with the head resting on the biceps
alright<00:02:00.400> it<00:02:00.520> should<00:02:00.670> be<00:02:00.790> nice<00:02:01.030> and<00:02:01.420> tight<00:02:01.720> now

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
alright it should be nice and tight now

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.040 
alright it should be nice and tight now
the<00:02:02.320> key<00:02:02.680> points<00:02:03.220> to<00:02:03.370> locking<00:02:03.910> it<00:02:04.060> is<00:02:04.240> making

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
the key points to locking it is making

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.230 
the key points to locking it is making
sure<00:02:05.200> that<00:02:05.350> you<00:02:05.620> eliminate<00:02:06.160> any<00:02:06.340> open<00:02:07.000> space

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
sure that you eliminate any open space

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.290 
sure that you eliminate any open space
that<00:02:07.780> will<00:02:08.200> be<00:02:08.350> between<00:02:08.530> your<00:02:08.920> head<00:02:09.220> and<00:02:09.550> your

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
that will be between your head and your

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.150 
that will be between your head and your
shoulders<00:02:10.330> alright<00:02:11.260> that<00:02:11.470> will<00:02:11.590> kill<00:02:11.860> you<00:02:12.070> in

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
shoulders alright that will kill you in

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.130 
shoulders alright that will kill you in
the<00:02:12.310> long<00:02:12.490> run<00:02:12.760> as<00:02:12.910> far<00:02:13.060> as<00:02:13.180> a<00:02:13.240> swimmer<00:02:13.510> because

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
the long run as far as a swimmer because

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.660 
the long run as far as a swimmer because
any<00:02:14.350> open<00:02:14.740> space<00:02:14.950> right<00:02:15.160> there<00:02:15.340> is<00:02:15.460> going<00:02:15.580> to

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
any open space right there is going to

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.400 
any open space right there is going to
catch<00:02:16.000> water<00:02:16.360> which<00:02:16.810> is<00:02:16.960> going<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.140> create

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
catch water which is going to create

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.770 
catch water which is going to create
resistance

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.050

are pointed behind you one of the common
things<00:02:31.850> that<00:02:31.940> I<00:02:32.090> have<00:02:32.210> found<00:02:32.390> that<00:02:32.600> swimmers

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
things that I have found that swimmers

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.270 
things that I have found that swimmers
when<00:02:33.170> they're<00:02:33.320> starting<00:02:33.620> to<00:02:33.650> develop<00:02:33.920> their

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
when they're starting to develop their

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.100 
when they're starting to develop their
streamline<00:02:34.760> is<00:02:34.970> that<00:02:35.420> they'll<00:02:35.600> allow<00:02:35.840> their

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
streamline is that they'll allow their

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.340 
streamline is that they'll allow their
feet<00:02:36.440> to<00:02:36.710> hang<00:02:37.040> off<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.910> end<00:02:38.060> now<00:02:38.720> remember<00:02:39.200> as

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
feet to hang off the end now remember as

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.080 
feet to hang off the end now remember as
a<00:02:39.410> competitive<00:02:40.310> swimmer<00:02:40.430> you're<00:02:40.790> trying<00:02:41.030> to

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
a competitive swimmer you're trying to

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.570 
a competitive swimmer you're trying to
cut<00:02:41.300> down<00:02:41.330> on<00:02:41.540> resistance<00:02:42.290> so<00:02:42.770> keep<00:02:43.370> those

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
cut down on resistance so keep those

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.060 
cut down on resistance so keep those
pointed<00:02:44.090> just<00:02:44.570> like<00:02:44.720> a<00:02:44.750> ballerina<00:02:45.050> and<00:02:45.650> make

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
pointed just like a ballerina and make

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.410 
pointed just like a ballerina and make
sure<00:02:46.250> that<00:02:46.430> you<00:02:46.550> eliminate<00:02:47.030> all<00:02:47.150> the

are some secret tricks when dealing with
a<00:02:57.680> swimmer<00:02:58.070> to<00:02:58.310> help<00:02:58.520> them<00:02:58.790> actually<00:02:59.060> develop

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
a swimmer to help them actually develop

a swimmer to help them actually develop
a<00:02:59.900> tighter<00:03:00.200> streamline<00:03:00.830> something<00:03:01.640> that<00:03:01.790> I

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
a tighter streamline something that I

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.880 
a tighter streamline something that I
tell<00:03:02.150> my<00:03:02.180> swimmers<00:03:02.570> is<00:03:02.990> that<00:03:03.140> your<00:03:03.290> streamline

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
tell my swimmers is that your streamline

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.760 
tell my swimmers is that your streamline
can<00:03:04.220> never<00:03:04.580> ever<00:03:04.940> be<00:03:05.209> too<00:03:05.780> tight<00:03:06.110> you're<00:03:06.590> never

can never ever be too tight you're never

can never ever be too tight you're never

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
going to hear a swim coach come up and

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.120 
going to hear a swim coach come up and
say<00:03:08.780> ooh<00:03:08.959> you<00:03:09.290> need<00:03:09.410> to<00:03:09.560> loosen<00:03:09.950> up<00:03:10.070> that

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
say ooh you need to loosen up that

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.310 
say ooh you need to loosen up that
streamline<00:03:10.820> it's<00:03:11.030> just<00:03:11.270> too<00:03:11.480> tight<00:03:11.750> you<00:03:12.230> know

streamline it's just too tight you know

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.680 
streamline it's just too tight you know
the<00:03:12.590> tighter<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:13.459> better<00:03:13.790> that<00:03:14.060> is<00:03:14.209> always

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
the tighter the better that is always

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.210 
the tighter the better that is always
the<00:03:14.900> case<00:03:15.080> another<00:03:15.470> thing<00:03:15.770> that<00:03:15.890> I<00:03:15.920> tell<00:03:16.190> my

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
the case another thing that I tell my

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.980 
the case another thing that I tell my
swimmers<00:03:16.490> is<00:03:16.880> that<00:03:17.270> a<00:03:17.300> tight<00:03:17.630> streamline

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990 
swimmers is that a tight streamline

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.680 
swimmers is that a tight streamline
actually<00:03:18.890> makes<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:19.340> pool<00:03:19.580> shorter<00:03:20.150> with<00:03:20.660> a

actually makes the pool shorter with a

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.960 
actually makes the pool shorter with a
tight<00:03:21.080> streamline<00:03:21.500> you'll<00:03:22.190> come<00:03:22.430> off<00:03:22.610> of<00:03:22.850> the

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
tight streamline you'll come off of the
