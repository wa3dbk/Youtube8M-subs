we're<00:00:00.329> going<00:00:00.450> to<00:00:00.510> tie<00:00:00.690> a<00:00:00.719> perfection<00:00:01.380> loop<00:00:01.560> and

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
we're going to tie a perfection loop and

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.180 
we're going to tie a perfection loop and

I must reduce the size of that loop to

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.930 
I must reduce the size of that loop to
about<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.640> size<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.059> dime<00:00:40.550> with<00:00:41.550> my<00:00:41.700> butt

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940

still holding it onto my butt end now

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.210 
still holding it onto my butt end now
I'm<00:01:03.059> just<00:01:03.300> gonna<00:01:03.480> lay<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:04.080> between<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.100> two

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
I'm just gonna lay it in between the two

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.179 
I'm just gonna lay it in between the two

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
loops and pinch that also now I'm going

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.749 
loops and pinch that also now I'm going
to<00:01:15.210> take<00:01:15.360> my<00:01:15.509> front<00:01:15.810> loop<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.729> pull<00:01:17.729> it

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
to take my front loop and pull it

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:28.810 
to take my front loop and pull it
through<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.509> back<00:01:18.720> loop

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:36.060

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
I'll trim that butt end now pretending

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:51.330 
I'll trim that butt end now pretending
this<00:01:44.950> is<00:01:45.160> my<00:01:45.340> leader<00:01:45.640> and<00:01:49.800> this<00:01:50.800> yellow<00:01:51.070> line

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
loop I'll take my leader loop and go up

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.870

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.180 

tighten<00:02:21.110> up<00:02:21.200> on<00:02:21.380> it<00:02:21.470> and<00:02:21.620> that's<00:02:21.740> gonna<00:02:21.890> want

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
tighten up on it and that's gonna want

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.240 
tighten up on it and that's gonna want
to<00:02:22.250> stay<00:02:22.490> like<00:02:22.700> that<00:02:22.940> but<00:02:23.210> we<00:02:23.330> don't<00:02:23.510> want<00:02:23.720> that

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
to stay like that but we don't want that

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.860 
to stay like that but we don't want that
want<00:02:25.250> to<00:02:25.340> take<00:02:25.490> this<00:02:25.700> front<00:02:26.030> loop<00:02:26.360> and<00:02:26.630> just

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
want to take this front loop and just

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.620 
want to take this front loop and just
pull<00:02:27.080> it<00:02:27.890> over<00:02:28.090> so<00:02:29.090> now<00:02:29.210> it<00:02:29.330> looks<00:02:29.360> like<00:02:29.540> a

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
pull it over so now it looks like a

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:36.820 
pull it over so now it looks like a
square<00:02:29.960> knot<00:02:34.840> now<00:02:35.840> we<00:02:35.900> have<00:02:36.170> our<00:02:36.380> leader

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
square knot now we have our leader

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.730 
square knot now we have our leader
attached<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.430> our<00:02:37.460> flower<00:02:37.760> line<00:02:38.410> it's<00:02:39.410> time<00:02:39.620> to

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
attached to our flower line it's time to

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.260 
attached to our flower line it's time to
change<00:02:39.950> leaders<00:02:40.400> now<00:02:40.550> we<00:02:40.610> don't<00:02:40.850> have<00:02:40.970> any

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
change leaders now we don't have any

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.770 
change leaders now we don't have any
knots<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.750> tie<00:02:42.310> we'll<00:02:43.310> just<00:02:43.520> back<00:02:43.730> off<00:02:46.780> and

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
knots to tie we'll just back off and

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:48.490 
knots to tie we'll just back off and
pull<00:02:48.080> it<00:02:48.170> off

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
pull it off

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.820 
pull it off
it's<00:02:49.010> that<00:02:49.220> simple<00:02:50.530> perfection<00:02:51.530> loop<00:02:51.680> is<00:02:51.770> a

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
it's that simple perfection loop is a

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.270 
it's that simple perfection loop is a
very<00:02:52.010> easy<00:02:52.190> loop<00:02:52.490> to<00:02:52.640> tie<00:02:53.290> all<00:02:54.290> your<00:02:54.980> leaders

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
very easy loop to tie all your leaders

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.040 
very easy loop to tie all your leaders
now<00:02:55.459> come<00:02:56.120> with<00:02:56.450> a<00:02:56.480> loop<00:02:56.720> on<00:02:56.930> them<00:02:58.750> but<00:02:59.750> every

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
now come with a loop on them but every

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.210 
now come with a loop on them but every
now<00:03:00.170> and<00:03:00.320> then<00:03:00.380> those<00:03:00.590> if<00:03:00.739> there's<00:03:00.920> a<00:03:01.010> chance

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
now and then those if there's a chance

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.570 
now and then those if there's a chance
you<00:03:01.400> have<00:03:01.580> to<00:03:01.760> use<00:03:01.910> that<00:03:02.120> loop<00:03:03.080> so<00:03:03.310> it's<00:03:04.310> a<00:03:04.400> neat

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
you have to use that loop so it's a neat

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:13.610 
you have to use that loop so it's a neat
knot<00:03:04.880> to<00:03:05.090> learn<00:03:05.239> how<00:03:05.480> to<00:03:05.510> time

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.680
