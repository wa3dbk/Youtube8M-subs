00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:09.000
 I said before, but in the previous sequel 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:19.550
 Hmm 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:20.150
 I heard it was just so good I actually met only 6 strings and 2 strings 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.270
 was 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.280
 I have now properly prepared for reduction 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:30.320
 Arm tuning 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:37.700
 Stretch clogging from the beat and I was have been tuned Well Deko' 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:39.590
 I 'm extending the matter I 'm extending , but I often hear that you have probably seen a book or this person 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:44.780
 Things to say in which say that there is 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:47.080
 In other words, this general hearing loss is in the middle only 12 frets 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.080
 Where 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:11.110
 here i think 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:16.480
 So although we have to say we at work I'm doing with this fellow is quite head 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:19.540
 Well, let's show it to you from now on, right? Well, this beach 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:25.280
 I understand that during the event 23 1115 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:30.200
 15m Especially the right hand thumb makes a good buy 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:32.380
 I'm holding it, I'm making it visible now, but I'm open this way 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.380
 Five 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.299
 here 2nd place here 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.299
 Eat your Lecco 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:02.780
 Yes, now 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.780
 Is the end of the 6 yen for the stretch being evil? 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.920
 A while ago 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:13.210
 I said there were 12 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:17.890
 Oh, I'm going to grow a problem 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:21.010
 So in this case, you will be inducted into the school while you are playing 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:26.670
 So do this stretch properly 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.670
 Gallura It Again this is also the first minute of Aging
