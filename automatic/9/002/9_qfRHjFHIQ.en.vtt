how to use your shockwave ability with
right<00:00:53.910> bumper<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.170> where<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.649> first

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
right bumper and that is where the first

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.060 
right bumper and that is where the first
and<00:00:56.160> only<00:00:56.340> blueprint<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.420> level<00:00:57.719> will<00:00:57.870> be

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
and only blueprint of this level will be

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.590 
and only blueprint of this level will be
just<00:00:59.070> after<00:00:59.430> this<00:00:59.550> we've<00:00:59.760> also<00:00:59.850> got<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.270> audio

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
just after this we've also got the audio

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.070 
just after this we've also got the audio
log<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.379> after<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.710> blueprint<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.340> drop<00:01:02.640> down

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
log so after the blueprint you drop down

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.149 
log so after the blueprint you drop down
underneath<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.379> bridge<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.769> you'll<00:01:04.890> see<00:01:05.070> it
