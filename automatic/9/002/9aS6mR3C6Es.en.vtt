SOS signal hoping desperately that

somebody in the valley below would see

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.130

first ledge we were in terra incognita
with<00:02:49.709> that<00:02:49.920> that<00:02:50.280> no<00:02:50.610> one<00:02:50.790> had<00:02:50.970> ever<00:02:51.150> been

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
with that that no one had ever been

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.240 
with that that no one had ever been
there<00:02:51.630> going<00:02:52.019> to<00:02:52.110> ever<00:02:52.350> climb<00:02:52.560> there<00:02:52.920> condone

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
there going to ever climb there condone

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.809 
there going to ever climb there condone
it

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
it

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.989 
it
down<00:02:54.120> it<00:02:54.329> so<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.170> question<00:02:55.590> was<00:02:55.739> could<00:02:56.670> we<00:02:56.730> get

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:56.999 
down it so the question was could we get

00:02:56.999 --> 00:02:59.750 
down it so the question was could we get
down<00:02:57.299> it<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.689> once<00:02:58.290> we<00:02:58.530> left<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:59.129> west<00:02:59.340> end<00:02:59.609> of

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
down it and once we left the west end of

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.099 
down it and once we left the west end of
the<00:02:59.819> first<00:03:00.030> ledge<00:03:00.299> we<00:03:00.599> were<00:03:00.719> irrevocably

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
the first ledge we were irrevocably

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.050 
the first ledge we were irrevocably
committed<00:03:01.739> to<00:03:02.159> going<00:03:02.340> down<00:03:02.609> there<00:03:02.790> was<00:03:02.879> no

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
committed to going down there was no

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.110 
committed to going down there was no
going<00:03:03.239> back<00:03:03.510> up<00:03:03.920> suddenly<00:03:04.920> I<00:03:05.129> was<00:03:05.280> on<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.849> most

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
going back up suddenly I was on the most

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.270 
going back up suddenly I was on the most
complex<00:03:06.629> risky<00:03:07.139> I<00:03:07.379> could<00:03:07.889> imagine

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:19.300 

I<00:03:16.490> don't<00:03:17.490> think<00:03:17.550> I'd<00:03:17.819> ever<00:03:17.850> try<00:03:18.270> this<00:03:18.330> again

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
I don't think I'd ever try this again

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.150 
I don't think I'd ever try this again
with<00:03:20.310> six<00:03:20.550> other<00:03:20.730> people
