00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
you're playing everybody just they don't

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.119

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
get a feel for each other but I mean the

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.800 
get a feel for each other but I mean the
game<00:01:04.309> here<00:01:04.790> we<00:01:05.059> didn't<00:01:05.330> get<00:01:05.390> a<00:01:05.449> double<00:01:05.780> play

could<00:01:06.590> have<00:01:06.680> got<00:01:06.890> and<00:01:07.100> I<00:01:07.160> think<00:01:07.430> led<00:01:08.360> to<00:01:08.390> one

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:08.660 
could have got and I think led to one

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.460 
could have got and I think led to one
run<00:01:08.950> and<00:01:10.090> the<00:01:11.090> other<00:01:11.240> run<00:01:11.510> was<00:01:11.720> as<00:01:11.930> a<00:01:11.960> result<00:01:12.350> of

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
run and the other run was as a result of

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.320 
run and the other run was as a result of
not<00:01:12.620> getting<00:01:12.830> out<00:01:13.040> on<00:01:13.220> a<00:01:13.250> run<00:01:13.430> down<00:01:13.640> so<00:01:13.970> I<00:01:14.120> mean

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
not getting out on a run down so I mean

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.630 
not getting out on a run down so I mean

of<00:02:29.930> work<00:02:30.050> to<00:02:30.170> do<00:02:30.290> with<00:02:30.410> all<00:02:30.560> that

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
of work to do with all that

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.780 
of work to do with all that
is<00:02:32.620> there<00:02:32.860> any<00:02:33.010> like<00:02:33.220> one<00:02:33.460> thing<00:02:33.670> in

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
is there any like one thing in

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.280 
is there any like one thing in
particular<00:02:34.360> when<00:02:34.510> you<00:02:34.600> go<00:02:34.690> to<00:02:34.750> practice<00:02:35.170> this

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
particular when you go to practice this

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.200 
particular when you go to practice this
week<00:02:35.500> that<00:02:35.800> you'll<00:02:36.490> stress<00:02:36.820> more<00:02:37.060> than

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
week that you'll stress more than

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.660 
week that you'll stress more than
another<00:02:38.310> competitiveness<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:39.460> guess

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
another competitiveness I guess

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.500 
another competitiveness I guess
competing<00:02:40.390> and<00:02:40.710> being<00:02:41.710> aggressive<00:02:42.360> in<00:02:43.360> the

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
competing and being aggressive in the

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.650 
competing and being aggressive in the
batter's<00:02:43.840> box<00:02:44.010> would<00:02:45.010> be<00:02:45.040> where<00:02:45.820> you<00:02:46.210> got<00:02:46.570> to

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
batter's box would be where you got to

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.150 
batter's box would be where you got to
swing<00:02:46.900> that<00:02:47.080> back<00:02:47.290> to<00:02:47.470> start<00:02:47.740> to<00:02:47.830> get<00:02:47.980> your

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
swing that back to start to get your

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.290 
swing that back to start to get your
timing<00:02:48.520> in<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.730> rhythm

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
timing in a rhythm

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.880 
timing in a rhythm
we<00:02:49.480> take<00:02:49.690> strikes<00:02:49.990> right<00:02:50.320> now<00:02:50.500> we're<00:02:50.770> taking

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
we take strikes right now we're taking

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.190 
we take strikes right now we're taking
strikes<00:02:51.370> that's<00:02:51.610> way<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.850> ball<00:02:52.120> so<00:02:52.450> we've<00:02:53.050> got

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
strikes that's way to ball so we've got

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.030

Walsh make he he reached um yeah yeah he

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.520 
Walsh make he he reached um yeah yeah he
was<00:03:38.730> slid<00:03:39.330> into<00:03:39.510> home<00:03:39.600> plate<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:40.110> scrimmage

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
was slid into home plate the scrimmage

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.380 
was slid into home plate the scrimmage
and<00:03:40.710> damndest<00:03:41.190> stuff<00:03:41.430> so<00:03:41.700> that's<00:03:41.820> no<00:03:42.060> reason

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
and damndest stuff so that's no reason

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.050 
and damndest stuff so that's no reason
else<00:03:42.980> that's<00:03:43.980> happened<00:03:44.400> but<00:03:44.550> we<00:03:44.670> do<00:03:44.790> think

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
else that's happened but we do think

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.370 
else that's happened but we do think
he's<00:03:45.620> potentially<00:03:46.620> a<00:03:47.040> strong<00:03:47.460> player<00:03:47.760> and<00:03:48.380> we

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
he's potentially a strong player and we

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.870 
he's potentially a strong player and we
like<00:03:49.560> his<00:03:49.740> work<00:03:49.950> ethic<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:50.460> we<00:03:50.580> like<00:03:50.730> this

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
like his work ethic and we like this

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:57.150 
like his work ethic and we like this
commitment<00:03:51.270> and<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:52.230> same<00:03:52.440> with<00:03:52.940> step

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.580 

we're<00:03:57.310> gonna<00:03:57.400> have<00:03:57.610> something

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
we're gonna have something

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.490 
we're gonna have something
just<00:04:00.590> I<00:04:00.830> mean<00:04:00.920> it's<00:04:01.400> freshmen<00:04:02.200> well<00:04:03.200> the

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
just I mean it's freshmen well the

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.920 
just I mean it's freshmen well the
Marlowe<00:04:04.280> of<00:04:04.430> the<00:04:04.519> second<00:04:04.849> baseman<00:04:05.299> becomes

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
Marlowe of the second baseman becomes

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.100 
Marlowe of the second baseman becomes
very<00:04:06.140> important<00:04:06.709> and<00:04:07.659> right<00:04:08.659> now<00:04:08.870> that's

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
very important and right now that's

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.170 
very important and right now that's
about<00:04:09.260> timing<00:04:09.709> and<00:04:09.980> positioning<00:04:10.580> we<00:04:11.000> didn't

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
about timing and positioning we didn't

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.280 
about timing and positioning we didn't
get<00:04:11.269> the<00:04:11.390> double<00:04:11.599> play<00:04:11.810> because<00:04:12.019> your

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
get the double play because your

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.319 
get the double play because your
position<00:04:12.489> quite<00:04:13.489> right

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.149 

inexperience<00:04:17.049> short<00:04:17.289> stuff<00:04:17.590> we've<00:04:17.889> got<00:04:18.039> an

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:18.159 
inexperience short stuff we've got an

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:20.399 
inexperience short stuff we've got an
inexperienced<00:04:18.699> second<00:04:19.030> baseman<00:04:19.299> it<00:04:20.019> takes<00:04:20.259> a

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:20.409 
inexperienced second baseman it takes a

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:24.689 
inexperienced second baseman it takes a
lot<00:04:20.620> to<00:04:21.270> get<00:04:22.270> that<00:04:22.449> worried<00:04:22.780> a<00:04:23.530> tear<00:04:24.009> and<00:04:24.220> why

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:24.699 
lot to get that worried a tear and why

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:27.640 
lot to get that worried a tear and why
modalities

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.659 

it<00:04:28.100> isn't<00:04:28.370> that<00:04:28.610> easy<00:04:30.160> but<00:04:31.160> like<00:04:31.340> I<00:04:31.370> said

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
it isn't that easy but like I said

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.470 
it isn't that easy but like I said
defense<00:04:32.120> is<00:04:32.270> easier<00:04:32.660> of<00:04:32.750> privatizations
