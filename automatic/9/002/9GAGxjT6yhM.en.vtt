 built me nickname it gepeto hora 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.370
 because it gives life to a piece of 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.039
 wood 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.690

 are made by them 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.970
 which we are worried about 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.500
 ecologically concerned everyone 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:34.259

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.479
 florindo's carpentry we would not have 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.079
 for this purpose all the 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.860
 helpers here are retired with good 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.470
 humor 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.799

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.530
 for everyone including his wife 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.710

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.320
 house is quieter than imagined 4 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.929
 retired if he does not have to do what 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.700
 can do indoors so they can 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.470
 Call life when we come here. 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.710
 and starts with 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.720
 the material thus still raw and with a 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.090
 good idea and dedication 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.020

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.780
 of the year 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:28.500
 for these men the smile and the joy 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.690
 of the children who receive the toys is 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.080
 the best pay for this job 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.330
 carried out throughout the year is very 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.640
 rewarding to see children 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.490
 Playing around playing with our 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.830
 since parents may not 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.580
 can buy this is very rewarding 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.580
 for us
