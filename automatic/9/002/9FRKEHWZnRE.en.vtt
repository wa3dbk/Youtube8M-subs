00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
watch that and then I'll explain how to

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.340 
watch that and then I'll explain how to
solve<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.360> clues<00:00:36.570> afterwards<00:00:37.079> for<00:00:37.260> the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.710 

so<00:02:34.980> once<00:02:35.189> the<00:02:35.400> cutscene<00:02:35.939> is<00:02:36.090> over<00:02:36.360> you<00:02:36.480> want<00:02:36.659> to

so once the cutscene is over you want to

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.780 
so once the cutscene is over you want to
head<00:02:36.900> down<00:02:37.079> to<00:02:37.110> drain<00:02:37.680> or<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.129> talk<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:38.579> the
