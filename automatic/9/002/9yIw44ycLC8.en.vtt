game in the league and didn't well
obviously<00:03:10.390> didn't<00:03:10.720> do<00:03:11.049> enough<00:03:11.170> to<00:03:11.440> get<00:03:11.530> an

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
obviously didn't do enough to get an

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.870 
obviously didn't do enough to get an
average<00:03:11.799> rating<00:03:12.040> in<00:03:12.280> that<00:03:12.370> one<00:03:12.519> game<00:03:12.730> he

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
average rating in that one game he

played 12 non competitive games one goal
one<00:03:15.340> assist<00:03:15.400> so<00:03:15.819> I<00:03:15.849> suppose<00:03:16.060> this<00:03:16.180> was<00:03:16.330> in<00:03:16.450> the

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510

getting<00:07:30.080> in<00:07:30.289> the<00:07:30.410> way<00:07:30.580> I'm<00:07:31.580> looking<00:07:31.759> forward

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:32.090

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000

it<00:07:35.449> will<00:07:35.570> work<00:07:35.780> out<00:07:35.990> and<00:07:36.199> he<00:07:36.229> may<00:07:36.470> break<00:07:36.740> into

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:37.010 
it will work out and he may break into

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.399 
it will work out and he may break into
the<00:07:37.099> England<00:07:37.340> team<00:07:37.400> one<00:07:37.699> day<00:07:37.880> but<00:07:38.180> it<00:07:39.020> doesn't
