00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 Hello everyone today the new video for 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:10.130
 show you how I make this hair 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:13.469
 so moved belen style we say without 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:16.160
 heat therefore without plate sometimes with 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.779
 the use of the phon sometimes the new depends 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.730
 as I tell you also during the video from 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.910
 when you wash your hair if maybe 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.800
 detected in the morning and for example 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.630
 in summer there is a beautiful day you can 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.150
 let them air dry 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.800
 I did not keep reading at all heat 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.270
 otherwise just a little bit the oven 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.460
 at the beginning to dry the hair a little 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.469
 I like the effect so fast 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.469
 I like it on long hair 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.539
 you see type belen both on the hair of 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.789
 this length but also shorter and a 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.890
 effect that I really like and 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.170
 very comfortable when you don't feel like 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.899
 to stand there doing your hair 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.910
 when you want something more fancy 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.670
 now they are just made so i am 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.410
 right up at the floor level 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.110
 these waves soften and 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.540
 the effect I assure you is beautiful 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.460
 anyway no more talk I leave you 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.310
 to the video in which I show you how 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.260
 realize these wavy hair estimates 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.320
 belen 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:21.630
 here we are first of all start ad 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:25.770
 dry your hair if you are used to it 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:30.750
 use not only some oil with the show 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.939
 given the hair or I don't know if you have i 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.060
 particularly successful hair you want 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:39.770
 use a little foam you see 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.770
 in short, me 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.220
 now I start to dry my hair 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.120
 but I don't dry them completely 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.670
 slightly moist release into the sauce 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.770
 mainly here behind the neck and to 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.460
 contact with the acute in a way that then 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:09.280
 during the night there is no risk from 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:12.280
 morning to wake up with a stiff neck i 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.240
 my hair is still wet 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.190
 mainly dries your skin 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.230
 as close to the head 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:24.610
 now what I do started doing the 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:28.780
 braids then began to pour mine 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:37.810
 hair then to separate them in various 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:41.320
 bands start from below and let 's say a 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.570
 trick lies in doing what and braids 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.550
 obviously possible in a way 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:51.400
 compatible the desire we have of 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:54.610
 to make braids I use these and 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:03:01.800
 public paving use these 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:05.140
 elastic these little ones here then 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:09.300
 usually started with doing the part 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.300
 below I make one or two braids 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:18.060
 obviously if you go to sleep right away 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:21.020
 dry your hair as much as possible 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:26.480
 in 2001 wet head if instead 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:29.310
 detected you do not know the morning and you have 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.020
 let's say free morning you have to 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.660
 go out you can let them air dry 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.550
 you can also avoid drying of 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.160
 much more will come with the hair dryer first 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:42.180
 soft like that 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.830
 I am now evening and not really right away 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.690
 however immediately sleep however on a 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.010
 little to sleep 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.630
 then he started to dry a little bit 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:56.209
 just to not go to sleep with the 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:04:02.819
 head or wet you see I make some 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:10.170
 simple braids this braid more 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:13.140
 classic and try to do it until 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.470
 end of your length 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.470
 hair 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:25.310
 obviously they must not be braids 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.310
 so perfect they are not for going out 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:42.010
 and continue with the same procedure on 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:47.490
 the whole head then I take bands 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.490
 of hair and I make braids 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.460
 well as soon as you look like a sister 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.689
 tarzan fool you will be ready to go 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.840
 to sleep 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:11.659
 I left the plunge without a braid 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.659
 because anyway being short doing the 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:15.999
 braids then become unmanageable if instead 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:19.370
 you have long hair 

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:21.460
 you can safely weave them 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.919
 all because the effect will be very beautiful 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.719
 nothing i go to sleep see you 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:28.279
 tomorrow morning to see how 

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:31.210
 continue 

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:34.639
 here we are and the next morning is 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:39.800
 we can undo all our braids 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:43.389
 then it usually started from below 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:47.000
 I simply remove the elastic loosen 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:52.089
 the braids start from the bottom and go towards 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.089
 the top of the braid in a manner 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.660
 to ruin the effect too much 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:46.010
 here here then check that you have 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.540
 all the braids state well solved 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:50.360
 hands in your hair 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:53.150
 I especially here in high free a 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:57.860
 a little hair doing so with your fingers in 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:07:00.790
 so that you can't really see the sign 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:07.130
 of the beginning of the braid system also 

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:08.840
 the tuft and the game is done as you see 

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:11.150
 it's very simple 

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:14.210
 then over time you will become more and more 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:16.880
 quick to make and undo the braids 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:19.070
 if you want you can pull them up 

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:22.490
 see you or leave them free 

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:24.590
 so loose anything i hope this 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:26.240
 video could be useful I wish you 

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:29.350
 a good day and see you at 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.350
