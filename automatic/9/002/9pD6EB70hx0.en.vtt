YouTube I think video pad does it in a

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.569 
YouTube I think video pad does it in a
format<00:01:37.290> where<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.829> fraction<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.460> the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
think that the software is great and

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.860 
think that the software is great and
cameras<00:02:20.519> are<00:02:20.670> great<00:02:20.790> but<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:21.480> can<00:02:21.629> only<00:02:21.750> take

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
cameras are great but that can only take

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.509

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
them all in there for future because you

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.210

all<00:03:19.829> in<00:03:20.100> there<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:20.430> add<00:03:20.579> to<00:03:20.880> them<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.269> that

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
all in there and add to them and that

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.629 
all in there and add to them and that
really<00:03:21.540> helps<00:03:21.870> me<00:03:21.989> stay<00:03:22.230> organized<00:03:22.739> and

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
really helps me stay organized and

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.210 
really helps me stay organized and
that's<00:03:24.209> why<00:03:24.389> I<00:03:24.420> don't<00:03:24.690> need<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:24.870> planner<00:03:25.170> I<00:03:25.650> love
