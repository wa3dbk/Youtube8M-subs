right so we're going to take a look at

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.560 
right so we're going to take a look at
the<00:00:32.029> screwed<00:00:32.329> back<00:00:32.510> shots<00:00:32.930> and<00:00:34.390> the<00:00:35.390> main

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
the screwed back shots and the main

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.020 
the screwed back shots and the main
thing<00:00:35.810> is<00:00:35.990> is<00:00:36.260> to<00:00:36.800> hit<00:00:37.070> at<00:00:37.340> the<00:00:37.460> bottom<00:00:37.820> of<00:00:37.940> the

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
thing is is to hit at the bottom of the

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.360 
thing is is to hit at the bottom of the
cue<00:00:38.300> ball<00:00:38.540> now<00:00:39.230> you<00:00:39.320> got<00:00:39.440> be<00:00:39.500> careful<00:00:39.680> not<00:00:40.130> so

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
cue ball now you got be careful not so

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.490 
cue ball now you got be careful not so
you<00:00:40.430> want<00:00:40.670> something<00:00:40.880> a<00:00:40.910> little<00:00:41.150> bit<00:00:41.300> of

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
you want something a little bit of

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.200 
you want something a little bit of
aiming<00:00:42.500> down<00:00:42.740> and<00:00:43.040> not<00:00:43.130> too<00:00:43.430> much<00:00:43.670> so<00:00:43.940> you<00:00:44.000> can

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
aiming down and not too much so you can

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.180 
aiming down and not too much so you can
have<00:00:44.360> it<00:00:44.390> flat<00:00:44.750> as<00:00:44.960> well<00:00:45.110> depends<00:00:45.980> how<00:00:46.070> much

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
have it flat as well depends how much

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.040 
have it flat as well depends how much
you<00:00:46.250> want<00:00:46.460> to<00:00:46.520> get<00:00:46.640> into<00:00:46.850> it<00:00:46.970> you<00:00:47.150> have<00:00:47.780> to<00:00:47.930> hit

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
you want to get into it you have to hit

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.880 
you want to get into it you have to hit
it<00:00:48.170> pretty<00:00:48.920> hard<00:00:49.130> and<00:00:50.260> and<00:00:51.260> also<00:00:51.410> you<00:00:51.620> want<00:00:51.710> the

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
it pretty hard and and also you want the

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.040 
it pretty hard and and also you want the
cue<00:00:52.250> sort<00:00:52.580> of<00:00:52.670> to<00:00:52.850> go<00:00:53.170> through<00:00:54.170> so<00:00:54.800> probably

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
cue sort of to go through so probably

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.630 
cue sort of to go through so probably
it's<00:00:57.050> difficult<00:00:57.380> to<00:00:57.440> see<00:00:57.590> how<00:00:58.070> much<00:00:58.280> to<00:00:58.460> go

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
it's difficult to see how much to go

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.520 
it's difficult to see how much to go
through<00:00:59.120> but<00:00:59.450> as<00:00:59.570> long<00:00:59.780> as<00:00:59.810> you<00:01:00.079> know<00:01:00.200> actually

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
through but as long as you know actually

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.740 
through but as long as you know actually
pushing<00:01:01.040> the<00:01:01.070> cue<00:01:01.430> ball<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:02.300> difference

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
pushing the cue ball the difference

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.800 
pushing the cue ball the difference
between<00:01:02.870> pushing<00:01:03.320> and<00:01:04.390> striking<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:05.540> cue

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
between pushing and striking the cue

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.110 
between pushing and striking the cue
ball<00:01:06.050> because<00:01:06.950> you<00:01:07.070> got<00:01:07.220> the<00:01:07.280> striking<00:01:07.640> where

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 
ball because you got the striking where

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.330 
ball because you got the striking where
you<00:01:08.210> can<00:01:08.330> push<00:01:08.600> wait<00:01:08.960> say<00:01:09.770> where<00:01:09.920> you<00:01:09.980> can<00:01:10.130> put

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
you can push wait say where you can put

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.360 
you can push wait say where you can put
it<00:01:10.520> where<00:01:11.330> you<00:01:11.480> sort<00:01:11.750> of<00:01:11.780> go<00:01:12.260> through<00:01:12.680> like

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
it where you sort of go through like

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.620 
it where you sort of go through like
that<00:01:13.550> but<00:01:13.760> you've<00:01:13.850> already<00:01:14.030> hit<00:01:14.270> the<00:01:14.390> cue<00:01:14.600> ball

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
that but you've already hit the cue ball

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.830 
that but you've already hit the cue ball
that's<00:01:14.960> not<00:01:15.490> pushing<00:01:16.490> which<00:01:17.000> is<00:01:17.440> that<00:01:19.330> so<00:01:20.330> you

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
that's not pushing which is that so you

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.600 
that's not pushing which is that so you
can<00:01:20.990> see<00:01:21.170> the<00:01:21.290> difference<00:01:21.740> if<00:01:22.010> you<00:01:22.130> can't<00:01:22.370> then

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
can see the difference if you can't then

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.140 
can see the difference if you can't then
you're<00:01:22.760> blind<00:01:22.909> and<00:01:24.610> so<00:01:25.610> you<00:01:25.670> get<00:01:25.790> the<00:01:25.880> screws

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
you're blind and so you get the screws

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.180 
you're blind and so you get the screws
back<00:01:26.300> shop

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
back shop

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.590 
back shop
and<00:01:28.190> that's<00:01:28.370> about<00:01:28.460> forces<00:01:29.090> make<00:01:29.299> sure<00:01:29.479> you

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
and that's about forces make sure you

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.320 
and that's about forces make sure you
hit<00:01:29.750> the<00:01:29.900> bottom<00:01:30.170> of<00:01:30.260> the<00:01:30.380> cue<00:01:30.590> ball<00:01:30.860> so<00:01:31.700> as

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
hit the bottom of the cue ball so as

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.149 
hit the bottom of the cue ball so as
they<00:01:32.540> say<00:01:32.750> if<00:01:32.960> you<00:01:33.110> look<00:01:33.290> at<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:33.530> cue<00:01:33.770> ball<00:01:33.950> as

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
they say if you look at the cue ball as

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.980 
they say if you look at the cue ball as
a<00:01:34.220> clock<00:01:34.520> face<00:01:34.760> and<00:01:35.030> where<00:01:35.180> you<00:01:35.270> are<00:01:35.420> standing

through the cue ball otherwise it'll be

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.469 
through the cue ball otherwise it'll be
a<00:01:49.190> foul<00:01:49.430> and<00:01:49.580> the<00:01:49.670> people<00:01:49.880> will<00:01:49.970> come<00:01:50.000> back<00:01:50.119> and

arrive it goes in the opposite direction
I'm<00:02:29.440> not<00:02:29.620> straight<00:02:30.330> what's<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.450> proper<00:02:31.750> aim

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
I'm not straight what's the proper aim

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.789 
I'm not straight what's the proper aim
what's<00:02:32.799> the<00:02:32.890> proper<00:02:33.160> way<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:33.400> aim<00:02:33.760> with<00:02:34.209> spin

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
what's the proper way to aim with spin

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.119 
what's the proper way to aim with spin
now<00:02:35.799> yes<00:02:36.069> he<00:02:36.340> is<00:02:36.459> correct<00:02:36.910> when<00:02:37.209> you<00:02:37.239> do<00:02:38.129> pull

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
now yes he is correct when you do pull

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:40.979 
now yes he is correct when you do pull
up<00:02:39.220> their<00:02:39.400> safety<00:02:39.910> pot<00:02:40.060> left-hand<00:02:40.420> side<00:02:40.569> up<00:02:40.780> as

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
up their safety pot left-hand side up as

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.530 
up their safety pot left-hand side up as
I<00:02:41.230> am<00:02:41.379> from<00:02:41.709> my<00:02:42.069> view<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.910> cue<00:02:43.090> ball<00:02:43.269> will<00:02:43.360> go

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
I am from my view the cue ball will go

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.650 
I am from my view the cue ball will go
after<00:02:43.629> the<00:02:43.840> rise<00:02:44.019> maybe<00:02:44.500> because<00:02:44.739> you<00:02:44.860> sort<00:02:45.069> of

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
after the rise maybe because you sort of

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.089 
after the rise maybe because you sort of
Nicholas<00:02:46.660> a<00:02:46.810> sort<00:02:47.140> of<00:02:47.200> pushing<00:02:47.590> it<00:02:47.709> in<00:02:47.890> that

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
Nicholas a sort of pushing it in that

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.220 
Nicholas a sort of pushing it in that
direction<00:02:48.280> because<00:02:48.640> he<00:02:48.849> hit<00:02:49.030> in<00:02:49.209> that<00:02:49.840> edge<00:02:50.049> of

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
direction because he hit in that edge of

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.170 
direction because he hit in that edge of
it<00:02:50.379> you<00:02:50.769> sort<00:02:51.040> of<00:02:51.160> you're<00:02:51.579> not<00:02:51.700> aiming<00:02:51.879> at<00:02:52.120> the

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
it you sort of you're not aiming at the

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.509 
it you sort of you're not aiming at the
center<00:02:52.569> of<00:02:52.629> the<00:02:52.720> cue<00:02:52.959> ball<00:02:53.200> he<00:02:54.099> hits<00:02:54.310> in<00:02:54.430> the

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
center of the cue ball he hits in the

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.559 
center of the cue ball he hits in the
side<00:02:54.760> of<00:02:54.790> it<00:02:55.150> so<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:57.400> will<00:02:57.579> push<00:02:57.790> it<00:02:58.030> as<00:02:58.359> you<00:02:58.480> can

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
side of it so it will push it as you can

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.089 
side of it so it will push it as you can
see<00:02:58.750> over<00:02:58.840> there<00:02:58.900> it's<00:02:59.260> already<00:02:59.500> pushing<00:02:59.829> it

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
see over there it's already pushing it

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:01.830 
see over there it's already pushing it
in<00:03:00.250> that<00:03:00.670> direction<00:03:00.849> well<00:03:01.269> just<00:03:01.480> push<00:03:01.660> through

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
in that direction well just push through

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.559 
in that direction well just push through
whereas<00:03:02.709> if<00:03:02.890> I<00:03:02.980> aimed<00:03:03.250> into<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.150> cue<00:03:04.299> ball<00:03:04.450> I'd

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
whereas if I aimed into the cue ball I'd

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.720 
whereas if I aimed into the cue ball I'd
be<00:03:04.660> pushing<00:03:04.930> it<00:03:04.989> straight<00:03:05.400> even<00:03:06.400> though<00:03:06.549> some

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
be pushing it straight even though some

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.930 
be pushing it straight even though some
found<00:03:06.849> bird<00:03:07.239> off<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.720> right<00:03:07.870> there<00:03:08.019> and<00:03:08.940> so

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
found bird off to the right there and so

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.140 
found bird off to the right there and so
yeah<00:03:10.060> it<00:03:10.150> does<00:03:10.329> do<00:03:10.569> that<00:03:10.799> as<00:03:11.799> you<00:03:11.920> see<00:03:12.130> ever<00:03:12.849> so

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
yeah it does do that as you see ever so

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.190 
yeah it does do that as you see ever so
slightly<00:03:14.549> my<00:03:15.549> straight<00:03:16.450> shot<00:03:16.720> will<00:03:16.870> be<00:03:16.989> aiming

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
slightly my straight shot will be aiming

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.020 
slightly my straight shot will be aiming
there<00:03:17.440> you<00:03:17.889> see<00:03:18.069> ever<00:03:18.280> so<00:03:18.489> slightly<00:03:18.730> it<00:03:18.849> goes

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
there you see ever so slightly it goes

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.860 
there you see ever so slightly it goes
off<00:03:19.299> to<00:03:19.329> the<00:03:19.480> right<00:03:21.180> and<00:03:22.180> I<00:03:22.269> put<00:03:22.480> left<00:03:22.720> hand

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
off to the right and I put left hand

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.089 
off to the right and I put left hand
spin<00:03:23.200> on<00:03:23.260> it<00:03:24.389> now<00:03:25.389> of<00:03:25.900> course<00:03:26.109> this<00:03:26.380> increases

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
spin on it now of course this increases

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.940 
spin on it now of course this increases
and<00:03:27.419> how<00:03:28.419> much<00:03:28.599> she<00:03:28.810> goes<00:03:29.049> to<00:03:29.590> attend<00:03:29.859> a

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
and how much she goes to attend a

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.699 
and how much she goes to attend a
direction<00:03:30.669> when<00:03:31.540> there's<00:03:31.720> more<00:03:31.900> distance

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
direction when there's more distance

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.710 
direction when there's more distance
between<00:03:32.739> the<00:03:33.099> cue<00:03:33.280> ball<00:03:33.489> and<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:34.299> object<00:03:34.630> ball

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
between the cue ball and the object ball

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.330 
between the cue ball and the object ball
all<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.109> cushion<00:03:35.440> that<00:03:35.560> um<00:03:35.829> before<00:03:36.130> if<00:03:36.220> you

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
all the cushion that um before if you

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.099 
all the cushion that um before if you
know<00:03:36.489> already<00:03:36.819> that<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.299> fact<00:03:37.510> that<00:03:37.569> you<00:03:37.810> did

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
know already that the fact that you did

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:39.569 
know already that the fact that you did
the<00:03:38.230> left-hand<00:03:38.620> side<00:03:38.769> of<00:03:38.859> the<00:03:38.919> cue<00:03:39.130> ball<00:03:39.370> is

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
the left-hand side of the cue ball is

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.440 
the left-hand side of the cue ball is
going<00:03:39.790> off<00:03:39.880> to<00:03:39.910> the<00:03:40.090> right<00:03:40.269> you<00:03:40.540> don't<00:03:41.319> have<00:03:41.500> to

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
going off to the right you don't have to

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.170 
going off to the right you don't have to
move<00:03:43.450> you<00:03:44.049> have<00:03:44.079> to<00:03:44.290> change<00:03:44.709> your<00:03:44.919> aim<00:03:45.180> target

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
move you have to change your aim target

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.300 
move you have to change your aim target
ever<00:03:46.660> so<00:03:47.109> slightly<00:03:47.440> to<00:03:47.829> where<00:03:48.010> you<00:03:48.160> would

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
ever so slightly to where you would

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.589 
ever so slightly to where you would
normally<00:03:48.519> aim<00:03:49.019> so<00:03:50.019> for<00:03:50.290> example<00:03:50.739> I<00:03:51.510> want<00:03:52.510> to

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
normally aim so for example I want to

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.330 
normally aim so for example I want to
hit<00:03:52.720> the<00:03:52.810> center<00:03:53.200> of<00:03:53.260> this<00:03:53.380> yellow<00:03:53.650> ball<00:03:53.919> but

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
hit the center of this yellow ball but

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.220 
hit the center of this yellow ball but
if<00:03:54.430> I<00:03:54.489> boil<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:54.730> left-hand<00:03:55.180> side<00:03:55.419> on<00:03:55.599> it<00:03:55.750> I'm

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
if I boil the left-hand side on it I'm

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.360 
if I boil the left-hand side on it I'm
gonna<00:03:56.380> hit<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.620> right-hand<00:03:57.010> side<00:03:57.160> of<00:03:57.190> the

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
gonna hit the right-hand side of the

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.119 
gonna hit the right-hand side of the
yellow<00:03:57.489> only<00:03:58.000> very<00:03:58.150> slightly<00:03:58.389> though<00:03:58.980> as<00:03:59.980> you

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
yellow only very slightly though as you

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:06.480 
yellow only very slightly though as you
see<00:04:00.340> it<00:04:00.400> goes<00:04:00.549> off<00:04:00.700> to<00:04:00.819> the<00:04:00.879> right

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:06.490 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:12.570 

so<00:04:07.030> when<00:04:07.330> in<00:04:07.420> football<00:04:09.990> it's<00:04:10.990> straight<00:04:11.490> so<00:04:12.490> now

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
so when in football it's straight so now

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:13.800 
so when in football it's straight so now
what<00:04:12.760> I'm<00:04:12.820> gonna<00:04:12.910> do<00:04:13.090> is<00:04:13.210> I'm<00:04:13.330> gonna<00:04:13.450> try<00:04:13.750> and

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna try and

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.800 
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna try and
accommodate<00:04:14.080> the<00:04:14.530> the<00:04:15.250> spin<00:04:15.640> so<00:04:16.360> that<00:04:16.480> means<00:04:16.690> I

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
accommodate the the spin so that means I

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.260 
accommodate the the spin so that means I
aimed<00:04:17.080> straight<00:04:17.350> at<00:04:17.590> the<00:04:17.830> other<00:04:17.950> ball<00:04:18.160> so<00:04:18.790> what

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.270 
aimed straight at the other ball so what

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:20.850 
aimed straight at the other ball so what
I'm<00:04:19.330> gonna<00:04:19.420> do<00:04:19.570> is<00:04:19.630> I'm<00:04:19.750> gonna<00:04:19.840> put<00:04:20.530> left<00:04:20.680> on

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:20.860 
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put left on

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.620 
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put left on
some<00:04:21.070> silent<00:04:21.640> spit<00:04:21.880> on<00:04:22.000> but<00:04:22.180> I'm<00:04:22.240> also<00:04:22.390> gonna

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
some silent spit on but I'm also gonna

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.260 
some silent spit on but I'm also gonna
aim<00:04:22.930> slightly<00:04:23.380> away<00:04:24.010> from<00:04:24.040> the<00:04:24.730> yellow<00:04:25.030> ball

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
aim slightly away from the yellow ball

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.670 
aim slightly away from the yellow ball
I'm<00:04:25.420> good<00:04:25.630> names<00:04:25.810> obviously<00:04:26.050> to<00:04:26.350> the<00:04:26.440> left

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
I'm good names obviously to the left

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.290 
I'm good names obviously to the left
with<00:04:26.860> it<00:04:27.010> because<00:04:27.460> the<00:04:27.520> key<00:04:27.670> balls<00:04:27.880> gonna<00:04:28.120> go

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
with it because the key balls gonna go

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.400 
with it because the key balls gonna go
right<00:04:28.570> so<00:04:29.410> hopefully<00:04:29.950> when<00:04:30.460> I<00:04:30.490> take<00:04:30.730> this<00:04:30.850> now

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
right so hopefully when I take this now

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.780 
right so hopefully when I take this now
it<00:04:32.410> will<00:04:32.530> switch<00:04:32.710> and<00:04:33.220> just<00:04:33.310> do<00:04:33.520> what<00:04:33.670> it<00:04:33.760> just

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
it will switch and just do what it just

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.040 
it will switch and just do what it just
did<00:04:33.940> a<00:04:34.060> second<00:04:34.360> ago<00:04:36.270> so<00:04:37.270> it<00:04:37.330> hits<00:04:37.540> the<00:04:37.690> key<00:04:37.840> ball

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
did a second ago so it hits the key ball

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.550 
did a second ago so it hits the key ball
again<00:04:39.180> now<00:04:40.180> obviously<00:04:40.810> in<00:04:41.230> the<00:04:41.380> board

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
again now obviously in the board

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.380 
again now obviously in the board
distance<00:04:41.800> it's<00:04:42.190> much<00:04:42.340> more<00:04:42.490> difficult<00:04:42.700> to<00:04:43.240> get

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
distance it's much more difficult to get

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.020 
distance it's much more difficult to get
that<00:04:43.540> accuracy<00:04:44.140> so<00:04:44.860> it'll<00:04:45.340> just<00:04:45.400> basically

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
that accuracy so it'll just basically

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.140 
that accuracy so it'll just basically
take<00:04:46.330> a<00:04:46.570> lot<00:04:46.840> of<00:04:46.870> practice<00:04:47.140> to<00:04:47.530> do<00:04:47.650> it<00:04:48.150> I'm

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
take a lot of practice to do it I'm

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.230 
take a lot of practice to do it I'm
going<00:04:49.600> to<00:04:49.660> show<00:04:49.750> you<00:04:49.930> how<00:04:50.770> I<00:04:50.800> get<00:04:51.160> in<00:04:51.460> the<00:04:51.970> right

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
going to show you how I get in the right

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.800 
going to show you how I get in the right
angle<00:04:52.600> for<00:04:52.780> the<00:04:52.990> shot<00:04:53.640> so<00:04:54.640> how<00:04:55.300> is<00:04:55.450> it<00:04:55.630> I<00:04:55.750> know

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
angle for the shot so how is it I know

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.780 
angle for the shot so how is it I know
that<00:04:56.320> someone<00:04:56.620> like<00:04:56.800> yellow<00:04:57.040> ball<00:04:57.280> to<00:04:57.460> go<00:04:57.580> over

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
that someone like yellow ball to go over

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.360 
that someone like yellow ball to go over
there<00:04:57.970> all<00:04:58.480> the<00:04:59.320> way<00:04:59.440> I<00:04:59.470> won't<00:04:59.740> I<00:04:59.920> do<00:04:59.980> it<00:05:00.250> is

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
there all the way I won't I do it is

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.890 
there all the way I won't I do it is
you've<00:05:00.580> got<00:05:00.730> to<00:05:00.880> aim<00:05:00.910> the<00:05:01.480> more<00:05:03.450> left<00:05:04.450> you<00:05:04.690> have

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
you've got to aim the more left you have

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.650 
you've got to aim the more left you have
to<00:05:05.140> go<00:05:05.320> with<00:05:05.740> the<00:05:05.920> object<00:05:06.400> ball<00:05:06.610> to<00:05:06.880> the<00:05:07.060> top<00:05:07.270> to

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
to go with the object ball to the top to

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.750 
to go with the object ball to the top to
the<00:05:07.810> ending<00:05:08.320> target<00:05:09.070> I've<00:05:09.250> had<00:05:09.370> to<00:05:09.460> call<00:05:09.610> it

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
the ending target I've had to call it

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.220 
the ending target I've had to call it
and<00:05:09.910> the<00:05:10.840> more<00:05:11.080> to<00:05:12.040> the<00:05:12.130> right<00:05:12.370> of<00:05:12.670> the<00:05:13.450> object

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.230 
and the more to the right of the object

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:19.290 
and the more to the right of the object
ball<00:05:14.380> you've<00:05:14.680> got<00:05:14.860> to<00:05:15.040> go<00:05:15.340> for<00:05:15.960> so<00:05:17.520> here<00:05:18.520> is

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
ball you've got to go for so here is

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.180 
ball you've got to go for so here is
what<00:05:19.540> they<00:05:19.630> say<00:05:19.810> is<00:05:20.050> half<00:05:20.440> ball<00:05:21.420> so<00:05:23.100> what<00:05:24.100> it

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
what they say is half ball so what it

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.510 
what they say is half ball so what it
means<00:05:24.220> by<00:05:24.490> that<00:05:24.520> is<00:05:24.700> when<00:05:25.060> the<00:05:25.210> cue<00:05:25.450> ball<00:05:26.520> hits

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
means by that is when the cue ball hits

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.570 
means by that is when the cue ball hits
that<00:05:27.790> object<00:05:28.180> ball<00:05:28.420> it's<00:05:29.020> half<00:05:29.290> ball<00:05:29.650> so

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
that object ball it's half ball so

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.280 
that object ball it's half ball so
obviously<00:05:31.240> from<00:05:31.360> where<00:05:31.540> the<00:05:31.600> camera<00:05:31.810> view<00:05:32.140> is

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
obviously from where the camera view is

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.960 
obviously from where the camera view is
it<00:05:32.440> isn't<00:05:32.740> quite<00:05:32.980> half<00:05:33.160> ball<00:05:33.460> but<00:05:33.640> from<00:05:33.790> where

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
it isn't quite half ball but from where

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.970 
it isn't quite half ball but from where
I<00:05:34.000> was<00:05:34.300> it<00:05:34.690> where<00:05:35.080> I'm<00:05:35.200> standing<00:05:35.380> it<00:05:35.680> is<00:05:35.710> half

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:35.980 
I was it where I'm standing it is half

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:41.220 
I was it where I'm standing it is half
ball<00:05:36.340> so<00:05:37.270> I<00:05:37.600> just<00:05:38.230> bring<00:05:38.440> that<00:05:38.500> back<00:05:40.230> somewhere

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:41.230 
ball so I just bring that back somewhere

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.930 
ball so I just bring that back somewhere
wherever<00:05:41.440> it<00:05:41.590> was<00:05:41.680> around<00:05:41.860> there<00:05:42.130> if<00:05:42.550> I<00:05:42.640> am

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
wherever it was around there if I am

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.230 
wherever it was around there if I am
half<00:05:43.270> ball<00:05:43.570> so<00:05:43.720> it's<00:05:43.840> basically<00:05:44.200> this<00:05:44.440> edge

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
half ball so it's basically this edge

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.300 
half ball so it's basically this edge
because<00:05:46.240> I'm<00:05:46.360> aiming<00:05:46.630> to<00:05:46.660> the<00:05:46.950> left<00:05:47.950> it's<00:05:48.130> this

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
because I'm aiming to the left it's this

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.580 
because I'm aiming to the left it's this
edge<00:05:48.610> of<00:05:49.270> the<00:05:49.480> cue<00:05:49.720> ball<00:05:49.750> I'm<00:05:49.990> looking<00:05:50.290> at<00:05:50.410> so

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
edge of the cue ball I'm looking at so

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:55.190 
edge of the cue ball I'm looking at so
it's<00:05:50.740> half<00:05:50.950> ball

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.200 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.130 

so<00:05:56.200> obviously<00:05:56.830> with<00:05:57.190> the<00:05:57.280> other<00:05:57.370> way<00:05:57.550> around

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.140 
so obviously with the other way around

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.040 
so obviously with the other way around
if<00:05:59.140> it<00:05:59.320> was<00:05:59.410> aiming<00:05:59.650> to<00:05:59.680> the<00:05:59.800> right<00:06:00.540> so<00:06:01.540> here

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
if it was aiming to the right so here

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.190 
if it was aiming to the right so here
I'm<00:06:02.140> gonna<00:06:02.260> try<00:06:02.680> it<00:06:02.740> in<00:06:02.890> for<00:06:03.100> the<00:06:04.200> corner

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:05.200 
I'm gonna try it in for the corner

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.100 
I'm gonna try it in for the corner
pocket<00:06:05.490> and<00:06:06.490> I'm<00:06:06.700> using<00:06:06.910> this<00:06:07.510> time<00:06:07.720> the<00:06:07.870> right

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
pocket and I'm using this time the right

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.770 
pocket and I'm using this time the right
hand<00:06:08.410> side<00:06:08.650> of<00:06:08.980> the<00:06:09.280> cue<00:06:09.520> ball<00:06:09.550> so<00:06:10.180> again<00:06:10.630> it's

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:10.780 
hand side of the cue ball so again it's

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:18.500 
hand side of the cue ball so again it's
actually<00:06:11.170> about<00:06:11.620> half<00:06:11.980> ball<00:06:12.370> on<00:06:12.670> the<00:06:12.940> yellow
