the<00:01:04.580> I'm<00:01:05.580> assuming<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.540> antenna<00:01:06.869> for

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.050 
the I'm assuming this is the antenna for
the<00:01:07.110> 3g<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:09.290> also<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.409> sleep/wake<00:01:10.890> button<00:01:11.060> so

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
the 3g and also the sleep/wake button so

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.590 
the 3g and also the sleep/wake button so
this<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.450> pretty<00:01:12.600> much<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.840> for<00:01:13.580> the<00:01:14.600> outside

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
this is pretty much it for the outside

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.630 
this is pretty much it for the outside
of<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.840> case<00:01:16.080> this<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:17.009> what<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.280> looks<00:01:17.460> like

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
months now and I've decided to make a

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.280 
months now and I've decided to make a
little<00:03:26.290> video<00:03:26.410> on<00:03:26.770> and<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:28.450> the<00:03:28.870> material

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
little video on and the the material

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.080 
little video on and the the material
outside<00:03:29.440> is<00:03:30.100> actually<00:03:30.430> a<00:03:30.459> very<00:03:30.580> good<00:03:30.700> but<00:03:31.000> if

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
outside is actually a very good but if

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.840 
outside is actually a very good but if
you<00:03:31.270> have<00:03:31.390> sweaty<00:03:31.750> hands<00:03:32.050> sometimes<00:03:32.980> I<00:03:33.250> mean

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
your hands can get a bit sweaty due to

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.400 
your hands can get a bit sweaty due to
the<00:03:35.650> type<00:03:36.459> of<00:03:36.490> the<00:03:36.760> two<00:03:36.940> they<00:03:37.630> used<00:03:37.959> sorry

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
the type of the two they used sorry

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.120

about<00:03:38.620> that<00:03:38.650> but<00:03:40.170> yeah<00:03:41.170> otherwise<00:03:41.830> it's

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
about that but yeah otherwise it's

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
something but I found that if I just do

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.570 
something but I found that if I just do
it<00:04:18.520> correctly<00:04:18.880> this<00:04:19.780> will<00:04:19.989> work<00:04:20.020> as<00:04:20.380> well<00:04:20.590> so

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580
