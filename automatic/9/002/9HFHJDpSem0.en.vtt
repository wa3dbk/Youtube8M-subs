coding<00:00:12.719> so<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:14.040> subscriber<00:00:14.969> of<00:00:15.059> mine<00:00:15.330> asked<00:00:15.960> how

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
coding so a subscriber of mine asked how

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.220 
coding so a subscriber of mine asked how
can<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.609> make<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:18.060> Auto<00:00:18.630> keyboard<00:00:19.400> so<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:20.670> have

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
can you make a Auto keyboard so I have

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.900 
can you make a Auto keyboard so I have
looked<00:00:22.230> up<00:00:22.410> for<00:00:22.680> an<00:00:22.800> auto<00:00:23.039> keyboard<00:00:23.550> was

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
looked up for an auto keyboard was

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.019 
looked up for an auto keyboard was
because<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.390> had<00:00:24.660> really<00:00:25.170> no<00:00:25.560> idea<00:00:25.769> what<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.849> was

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
because I had really no idea what it was

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.050 
because I had really no idea what it was
and<00:00:27.349> I'm<00:00:28.349> going<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.710> show<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.250> basic<00:00:29.609> one

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
and I'm going to show you a basic one

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.420 
and I'm going to show you a basic one
and<00:00:30.439> I<00:00:31.439> think<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.130> can<00:00:33.590> make<00:00:34.590> an<00:00:34.710> advanced<00:00:35.250> one

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
and I think you can make an advanced one

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.030 
and I think you can make an advanced one
yourself<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.329> I'm<00:00:37.200> just<00:00:37.410> going<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.710> give<00:00:37.890> you

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
yourself and I'm just going to give you

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.650 
yourself and I'm just going to give you
the<00:00:38.370> basics<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.719> what<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.290> need<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.680> timer<00:00:41.070> a

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
the basics so what you need is a timer a

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.729 
the basics so what you need is a timer a
start<00:00:42.660> button<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:44.010> combo<00:00:44.399> box<00:00:45.379> the<00:00:46.379> combo

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
start button and a combo box the combo

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:55.510 
start button and a combo box the combo
box<00:00:47.030> we<00:00:48.030> are<00:00:48.059> going<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.710> make<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.600> drop<00:00:51.600> down

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.700 

style<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:57.480> drop<00:00:57.989> down<00:00:58.230> list<00:00:59.000> so<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.989> user

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
style to drop down list so that the user

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.109 
style to drop down list so that the user
can<00:01:02.160> only<00:01:02.670> choose<00:01:03.650> some<00:01:04.650> items<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.339> he<00:01:05.820> cannot

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
can only choose some items and he cannot

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.010 
can only choose some items and he cannot
fill<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.630> one<00:01:07.260> on<00:01:07.680> his<00:01:07.950> own<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:09.060> let's<00:01:09.450> go<00:01:09.960> to

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
fill in one on his own so let's go to

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.859 
fill in one on his own so let's go to
edit<00:01:10.290> items<00:01:10.590> I'm<00:01:11.040> only<00:01:11.670> going<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.150> show<00:01:12.540> you

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
edit items I'm only going to show you

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.179 
edit items I'm only going to show you
how<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.229> do<00:01:13.939> let's<00:01:14.939> say<00:01:15.240> 4<00:01:15.869> keys<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.680> I'm<00:01:16.890> going

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
how to do let's say 4 keys so I'm going

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.390 
how to do let's say 4 keys so I'm going
to<00:01:17.280> do<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:19.100> B<00:01:20.270> and<00:01:21.270> enter<00:01:21.840> Y<00:01:22.830> enter<00:01:23.189> because

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
to do a B and enter Y enter because

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.300 
to do a B and enter Y enter because
enter<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.479> special<00:01:24.960> one<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.350> just<00:01:26.100> like<00:01:26.280> a

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
enter is a special one and just like a

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.330 
enter is a special one and just like a
for<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.030> such<00:01:27.450> but<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.409> can<00:01:28.619> google<00:01:28.860> how<00:01:29.280> to

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
for and such but you can google how to

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.899 
for and such but you can google how to
do<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.650> go<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.710> I'm<00:01:32.280> going<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.670> show<00:01:32.850> you

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
do that and go to I'm going to show you

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.440 
do that and go to I'm going to show you
how<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.240> do<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.840> enter<00:01:34.350> one<00:01:35.180> so<00:01:36.180> um<00:01:38.450> let's

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
how to do the enter one so um let's

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.980 
how to do the enter one so um let's
double<00:01:39.840> click<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.350> start<00:01:40.680> button<00:01:44.720> let's<00:01:45.720> say

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
double click the start button let's say

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.219 
double click the start button let's say
timer<00:01:46.500> one<00:01:48.380> spot

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.359 

and<00:01:53.810> then<00:01:54.810> we<00:01:54.960> go<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.530> timer<00:01:55.799> also<00:01:56.100> the

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
and then we go to the timer also the

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.209 
and then we go to the timer also the
timer<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:56.939> now<00:01:57.119> set<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.479> an<00:01:57.990> interval<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:58.860> a

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
timer is now set to an interval of a

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.690 
timer is now set to an interval of a
thousand<00:02:00.320> that<00:02:01.320> means<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.829> it's<00:02:02.130> going<00:02:02.579> to

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
thousand that means that it's going to

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.429 
thousand that means that it's going to
type<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.539> letter<00:02:04.670> that's<00:02:05.670> or<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.509> key<00:02:06.719> that

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
type the letter that's or the key that

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.920 
type the letter that's or the key that
user<00:02:08.099> is<00:02:08.369> giving<00:02:08.729> here<00:02:11.120> is<00:02:12.120> going<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.540> be<00:02:12.660> typed

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
user is giving here is going to be typed

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.430 
user is giving here is going to be typed
once<00:02:13.560> every<00:02:13.920> second<00:02:14.340> so<00:02:14.780> you<00:02:15.780> can<00:02:15.989> change<00:02:16.290> that

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
once every second so you can change that

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.530 
once every second so you can change that
in<00:02:16.769> code<00:02:17.930> but<00:02:18.930> anyway<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.910> so<00:02:20.910> what<00:02:21.269> we<00:02:21.420> are

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
in code but anyway and so what we are

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.240 
in code but anyway and so what we are
going<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.810> do<00:02:21.989> here<00:02:22.200> is<00:02:22.410> do<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:22.950> case<00:02:25.040> don't<00:02:26.040> know

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
going to do here is do a case don't know

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.059 
going to do here is do a case don't know
not<00:02:26.519> a<00:02:26.580> case<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:30.260> computer<00:02:31.260> is<00:02:31.349> very<00:02:31.380> slow

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
not a case and computer is very slow

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:41.830 
not a case and computer is very slow
today<00:02:32.959> select<00:02:33.959> case<00:02:36.860> combo<00:02:37.860> box<00:02:39.110> combo<00:02:40.110> box<00:02:40.709> 1

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
today select case combo box combo box 1

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:52.839 
today select case combo box combo box 1
dot<00:02:42.840> texts<00:02:48.799> then<00:02:49.799> we<00:02:50.099> are<00:02:50.190> going<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.549> say<00:02:50.940> case

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
dot texts then we are going to say case

00:02:52.849 --> 00:03:04.690 
dot texts then we are going to say case
let's<00:02:53.849> say<00:02:57.260> that's<00:02:58.260> not<00:02:58.590> what<00:02:58.650> I<00:02:58.859> meant<00:02:59.010> at<00:02:59.370> all

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:20.960 

case<00:03:05.700> a<00:03:08.000> case<00:03:10.280> B<00:03:14.389> case<00:03:16.730> enter<00:03:19.280> you<00:03:20.280> can<00:03:20.310> also<00:03:20.609> do

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
case a case B case enter you can also do

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.830 
case a case B case enter you can also do
this<00:03:21.299> with<00:03:21.769> an<00:03:22.769> if<00:03:23.069> statement<00:03:23.430> but<00:03:24.150> I<00:03:24.180> think<00:03:24.630> a

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
this with an if statement but I think a

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.640 
this with an if statement but I think a
select<00:03:25.500> case<00:03:25.769> 1<00:03:26.069> is<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.370> better<00:03:27.060> here<00:03:27.650> and

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
select case 1 is a better here and

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.970 
select case 1 is a better here and
because<00:03:28.920> it's<00:03:29.100> I<00:03:29.720> don't<00:03:30.720> know<00:03:30.930> short<00:03:31.769> term

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
because it's I don't know short term

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.670 
because it's I don't know short term
maybe<00:03:32.959> so<00:03:34.040> let's<00:03:35.040> put<00:03:35.280> an<00:03:35.400> enter<00:03:35.760> everywhere

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
maybe so let's put an enter everywhere

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.750 
maybe so let's put an enter everywhere
and<00:03:37.760> then<00:03:38.760> just<00:03:39.090> do<00:03:40.049> the<00:03:40.079> send<00:03:40.799> key<00:03:41.040> statements
