00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
different is that there is no fan brush

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.640 
different is that there is no fan brush
in<00:03:07.420> this<00:03:07.570> brush<00:03:07.780> set<00:03:08.049> and<00:03:09.780> there<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:11.410> liner

in this brush set and there the liner

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.870 
in this brush set and there the liner
brush<00:03:12.100> I<00:03:12.510> think<00:03:13.510> it's<00:03:13.600> the<00:03:13.690> same<00:03:13.870> brushes<00:03:14.880> yeah

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
brush I think it's the same brushes yeah

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.509 
brush I think it's the same brushes yeah
well<00:03:16.060> that's<00:03:16.180> what<00:03:16.299> there<00:03:16.420> are<00:03:16.450> two<00:03:16.540> different

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
well that's what there are two different

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.120 
well that's what there are two different
there<00:03:18.519> are<00:03:18.549> two<00:03:18.850> small<00:03:19.299> flat<00:03:20.230> dome<00:03:20.470> brushes<00:03:20.950> as

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
there are two small flat dome brushes as

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.520 
there are two small flat dome brushes as
opposed<00:03:21.400> to<00:03:21.610> just<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.060> one<00:03:22.299> in<00:03:22.360> there<00:03:22.720> so<00:03:23.350> this

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
opposed to just the one in there so this

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.979 
opposed to just the one in there so this
one<00:03:23.650> doesn't<00:03:23.799> have<00:03:23.950> a<00:03:24.070> fan<00:03:25.060> brush<00:03:25.239> but<00:03:25.780> that

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
one doesn't have a fan brush but that

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.620 
one doesn't have a fan brush but that
one<00:03:26.140> doesn't<00:03:26.410> have<00:03:26.440> two<00:03:26.799> small<00:03:27.790> dome<00:03:28.120> brushes

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
one doesn't have two small dome brushes

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.810 
one doesn't have two small dome brushes
almost<00:03:29.230> $25<00:03:29.859> so<00:03:30.070> I<00:03:30.130> guess<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.430> 5<00:03:30.579> dollar

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
almost $25 so I guess the 5 dollar

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.430 
almost $25 so I guess the 5 dollar
difference<00:03:31.060> includes<00:03:31.570> the<00:03:31.750> names<00:03:31.959> and<00:03:32.290> the

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
difference includes the names and the

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.800 
difference includes the names and the
color<00:03:32.620> so<00:03:33.370> this<00:03:33.670> is<00:03:33.820> my<00:03:33.940> brush<00:03:34.209> set<00:03:34.480> and<00:03:34.660> it's

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:33.879 
the same way as the other palette which
might<00:05:32.659> get<00:05:32.779> a<00:05:32.839> little<00:05:33.019> confusing<00:05:33.529> because

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 
might get a little confusing because

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:35.949 
might get a little confusing because
most<00:05:34.759> companies<00:05:35.059> they<00:05:35.269> don't<00:05:35.569> name<00:05:35.779> their

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:35.959 
most companies they don't name their

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:37.749 
most companies they don't name their
palettes<00:05:36.379> so<00:05:36.529> I<00:05:36.949> guess<00:05:37.339> you<00:05:37.459> would<00:05:37.579> have<00:05:37.609> to

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 
palettes so I guess you would have to

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:39.309 
palettes so I guess you would have to
just<00:05:38.029> open<00:05:38.239> it<00:05:38.449> to<00:05:38.569> find<00:05:38.599> out<00:05:38.929> what<00:05:38.959> you<00:05:39.169> have

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:39.319 
just open it to find out what you have

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:42.849 
just open it to find out what you have
so<00:05:39.679> this<00:05:39.799> is<00:05:39.859> just<00:05:40.039> the<00:05:40.159> 88<00:05:40.609> matte<00:05:40.909> colors<00:05:41.859> just

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:42.859 
so this is just the 88 matte colors just

00:05:42.859 --> 00:05:44.409 
so this is just the 88 matte colors just
all<00:05:43.039> the<00:05:43.159> colors<00:05:43.459> in<00:05:43.549> the<00:05:43.609> color<00:05:43.789> spectrum<00:05:43.939> you

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:44.419 
all the colors in the color spectrum you

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:46.329 
all the colors in the color spectrum you
know<00:05:44.559> nothing<00:05:45.559> new<00:05:45.679> about<00:05:45.769> this<00:05:45.859> palette

00:05:46.329 --> 00:05:46.339 
know nothing new about this palette

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:47.649 
know nothing new about this palette
almost<00:05:46.819> every<00:05:46.999> company<00:05:47.299> has<00:05:47.329> the<00:05:47.479> same

00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:47.659 
almost every company has the same

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:50.979 
almost every company has the same
palette<00:05:48.049> um<00:05:48.679> I<00:05:49.159> haven't<00:05:49.999> tested<00:05:50.239> them<00:05:50.509> yet<00:05:50.749> I

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:50.989 
palette um I haven't tested them yet I

00:05:50.989 --> 00:05:54.759 
palette um I haven't tested them yet I
like<00:05:51.709> open<00:05:51.949> the<00:05:52.189> box<00:05:52.989> showed<00:05:53.989> Pauline<00:05:54.439> and

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:54.769 
like open the box showed Pauline and

00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:56.439 
like open the box showed Pauline and
then<00:05:54.919> decided<00:05:55.249> to<00:05:55.279> fill<00:05:55.519> so<00:05:55.939> I<00:05:55.969> haven't<00:05:56.359> tested

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:56.449 
then decided to fill so I haven't tested

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:58.389 
then decided to fill so I haven't tested
them<00:05:56.689> out<00:05:56.779> or<00:05:56.929> anything<00:05:57.169> yet<00:05:57.589> so<00:05:57.979> I<00:05:58.009> can't

00:05:58.389 --> 00:05:58.399 
them out or anything yet so I can't

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:00.999 
them out or anything yet so I can't
really<00:05:58.489> think<00:05:58.639> about<00:05:58.729> the<00:05:58.909> color<00:05:59.119> payoff<00:06:00.009> but

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:01.009 
really think about the color payoff but

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:02.349 
really think about the color payoff but
it<00:06:01.219> is<00:06:01.309> the<00:06:01.429> same<00:06:01.579> colors<00:06:01.879> like<00:06:01.999> I<00:06:02.089> said<00:06:02.269> that's

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:02.359 
it is the same colors like I said that's

00:06:02.359 --> 00:06:04.989 
it is the same colors like I said that's

companies<00:06:13.999> is<00:06:14.179> very<00:06:14.209> hard<00:06:14.539> to<00:06:14.659> get<00:06:14.779> a<00:06:14.809> red<00:06:15.079> so

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:15.289 
companies is very hard to get a red so

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:16.629 
companies is very hard to get a red so
let's<00:06:15.439> see<00:06:15.499> if<00:06:15.559> I<00:06:15.619> can<00:06:15.739> get<00:06:15.859> a<00:06:15.889> red<00:06:16.069> going<00:06:16.399> here

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639 
let's see if I can get a red going here

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:19.809 
let's see if I can get a red going here
they<00:06:17.269> haven't<00:06:17.599> read<00:06:17.689> in<00:06:17.989> here<00:06:18.319> but<00:06:18.729> this<00:06:19.729> is

00:06:22.059 --> 00:06:22.069 
probably can't see it because these

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:24.039 
probably can't see it because these
cameras<00:06:22.429> can't<00:06:22.669> focus<00:06:22.909> while<00:06:23.299> you're<00:06:23.569> filming
