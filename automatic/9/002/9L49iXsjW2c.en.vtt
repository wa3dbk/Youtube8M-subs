00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:14.849
 belong to a forsa study 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.949
 KÃ¶nigsberger klopse the most popular 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.080
 Recipes of German regional cuisine 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.300
 as he could conjure up on the table 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.199
 I'll show you this for ours today 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:37.290
 I take my clubs mixed hacker 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:39.380
 chopped capers coarsely cut 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.380
 parsley 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.760
 like the per or semmelbrÃ¶sel 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.620
 hunt the civilian I have before 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.800
 Siblings are better digestible 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:00.660
 and season with salt and 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.250
 Pepper quite classic whether you were with earlier 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.619
 chopped anchovies or chopped 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:13.619
 salted herring spice I'll stay today 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:16.370
 better with salt and pepper through 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:21.000
 to take coarse salt 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:23.210
 and then with your hands through properly 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.210
 glue 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.810
 so our meat shows is ready 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.509
 and we can not shape the klopse 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:39.289
 so big do the balls 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:41.179
 this only extends the cooking time of a klop 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.009
 now had about 100 grams that is 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:45.520
 I would knock two per person 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.520
 plan on 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.020
 enough klopse for everyone from ins 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.020
 cooking water with it 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.350
 so I have ever put on water 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.960
 cloves and laurel and for that 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.289
 special aroma I have a crisis 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.030
 prepared high portion of the sugar 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.380
 onion contain caramelized and 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:18.560
 gives a nice taste and a 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:20.390
 little color so the water is 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.630
 boiled up I turn on the 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.080
 smallest stage and lives now the clubs 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.080
 into the boiling water 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.250
 the clogs are in the water the colleagues 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.360
 take about ten to twelve minutes 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.560
 until they are done 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.450
 at the latest when they are at the 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.400
 water surface beautiful they are finished 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.850
 we cooked our sauce with enough time 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.850
 prepare 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:51.950
 We'll make our sauce first 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.950
 roux for this we need butter 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:03:04.870
 good piece 0 20 grams 1 tablespoon 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:06.340
 These more melt the butter so the 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.150
 do not let butter turn brown 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:15.370
 we want to give a light meal sweating 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:17.530
 now one and a half tablespoons flour to that 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.450
 stir well together 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.450
 Now it combines flour and butter 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:34.500
 find our big one after we beautiful 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:38.400
 Delete all the bother with white wine 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.400
 good shot milk 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:50.010
 Let's add a good shot of broth 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:52.940
 and again, of course, know me 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.940
 our capers 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.080
 all taste good with salt and 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.820
 Pepper for those who have no body 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.140
 I like a tip let her 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.760
 just out on the meat and gives 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.210
 She just in the sauce there she could then 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.880
 easily back out to offer the 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.420
 Loose is ready the knock we too 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.420
 they can get out 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.340
 directly in the sauce they stay that way 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.340
 nice and warm 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.439
 so now we can do our clubs 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.719
 Set up for me to fit in 

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:41.520
 best per potatoes and beetroot on 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:41.520
 I like to drink a cold beer
