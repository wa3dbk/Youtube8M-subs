should have to be a huge issue for a

should have to be a huge issue for a
long<00:01:50.909> time<00:01:51.240> I'll<00:01:51.509> have<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.840> say<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.700> yeah

dark pulse is still doing a decent mouth

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.859 
dark pulse is still doing a decent mouth
but<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.710> can't<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.159> KO<00:01:56.460> my<00:01:57.180> blaster<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:57.810> I

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
but it can't to a KO my blaster so I

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.109 
but it can't to a KO my blaster so I
felt<00:01:58.079> like<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.320> was<00:01:58.409> just<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.799> okay<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.670> go<00:01:59.939> for

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
felt like it was just a okay to go for

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.550 
felt like it was just a okay to go for
the<00:02:00.149> scald<00:02:00.479> right<00:02:00.689> there<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.079> then<00:02:01.500> he

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
the scald right there and then he

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.590 
the scald right there and then he
actually<00:02:01.799> ends<00:02:02.159> up<00:02:02.219> brayden<00:02:02.460> star<00:02:02.880> me<00:02:03.060> here<00:02:03.329> so

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
actually ends up brayden star me here so

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.209 
actually ends up brayden star me here so
he<00:02:03.840> can<00:02:03.960> go<00:02:04.110> for<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.350> sigh<00:02:04.500> schalke<00:02:04.890> if<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.040> want

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
he can go for a sigh schalke if you want

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.310 
he can go for a sigh schalke if you want
to<00:02:05.399> we<00:02:05.490> can<00:02:05.520> also<00:02:05.759> go<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.240> believe<00:02:06.990> there<00:02:07.140> are

rocks<00:02:07.619> on<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.890> side<00:02:08.099> so<00:02:08.250> we<00:02:08.340> could<00:02:08.489> also<00:02:08.610> go

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
rocks on the side so we could also go

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:09.350 
rocks on the side so we could also go
for

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
for

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.240

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
really hit me too hard so I'm not really

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.520 
really hit me too hard so I'm not really
afraid<00:02:20.820> of<00:02:21.030> it<00:02:21.210> he's<00:02:21.750> not<00:02:21.930> actually<00:02:22.140> going<00:02:22.440> to

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
afraid of it he's not actually going to

bring in his hip out on again just

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.140 
bring in his hip out on again just
because<00:02:25.140> I<00:02:25.530> can't<00:02:25.950> do<00:02:26.190> crap<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.700> him<00:02:26.850> with<00:02:27.030> this

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
because I can't do crap to him with this

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.810 
because I can't do crap to him with this
jirachi<00:02:27.510> I<00:02:28.380> can<00:02:28.740> maybe<00:02:28.890> try<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:29.310> Fletch<00:02:29.520> hacks

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
jirachi I can maybe try and Fletch hacks

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.900 
jirachi I can maybe try and Fletch hacks
but<00:02:30.180> it<00:02:30.540> just<00:02:30.690> take<00:02:31.620> too<00:02:31.770> much<00:02:31.890> time<00:02:32.190> not<00:02:32.580> very

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
but it just take too much time not very

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.330 
but it just take too much time not very
reliable<00:02:33.300> whatnot<00:02:34.020> ends<00:02:34.830> up<00:02:34.920> go<00:02:35.070> for<00:02:35.250> the

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
reliable whatnot ends up go for the

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.070 
reliable whatnot ends up go for the
slack<00:02:35.610> off<00:02:35.850> here<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:36.300> that's<00:02:36.420> actually<00:02:36.900> not

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
slack off here and that's actually not

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.080 
slack off here and that's actually not
going<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.380> be<00:02:37.440> too<00:02:37.709> good<00:02:37.890> for<00:02:38.130> me<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.459> am<00:02:38.790> able<00:02:38.970> to

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
gonna see here in a second I actually

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.449 
gonna see here in a second I actually
get<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.170> critical<00:02:43.680> hit<00:02:43.800> now<00:02:43.980> this<00:02:44.160> doesn't

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
get a critical hit now this doesn't

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.550 
get a critical hit now this doesn't
really<00:02:44.670> matter<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.360> think<00:02:45.840> one<00:02:46.050> of<00:02:46.080> them<00:02:46.350> I

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
really matter I think one of them I

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.370 
really matter I think one of them I
think<00:02:46.860> I<00:02:47.010> actually<00:02:47.459> scalded<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.330> hip<00:02:48.989> out<00:02:49.200> on

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
think I actually scalded the hip out on

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.080 
think I actually scalded the hip out on
before<00:02:49.830> and<00:02:50.100> it<00:02:50.220> got<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.370> critical<00:02:50.640> head<00:02:50.910> that

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
before and it got a critical head that

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.010 
before and it got a critical head that
one<00:02:51.270> might<00:02:51.420> have<00:02:51.450> been<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.660> little<00:02:51.780> bit

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
one might have been a little bit

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.300 
one might have been a little bit
influential<00:02:52.530> but<00:02:52.650> this<00:02:52.770> one<00:02:52.950> doesn't<00:02:53.100> really

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
influential but this one doesn't really

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.790 
influential but this one doesn't really
matter<00:02:53.600> at<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.750> point<00:02:55.110> I<00:02:55.320> thought<00:02:55.530> at<00:02:55.739> least

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
matter at the point I thought at least

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.990 
matter at the point I thought at least
because<00:02:56.070> I<00:02:56.190> thought<00:02:56.340> he's<00:02:56.520> just<00:02:56.700> gonna<00:02:56.820> let

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
because I thought he's just gonna let

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.340 
because I thought he's just gonna let
this<00:02:57.120> thing<00:02:57.300> die<00:02:57.510> so<00:02:57.780> it<00:02:58.020> would<00:02:58.140> have<00:02:58.230> been<00:02:58.290> a

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
this thing die so it would have been a

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.000 
this thing die so it would have been a
tuve<00:02:58.680> que<00:02:58.860> o<00:02:58.890> regardless<00:03:00.680> he<00:03:01.680> ends<00:03:01.830> up<00:03:01.890> getting

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
tuve que o regardless he ends up getting

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.130 
tuve que o regardless he ends up getting
all<00:03:02.250> is<00:03:02.370> HP<00:03:02.850> backup<00:03:03.180> anyway<00:03:03.300> so<00:03:03.510> again<00:03:03.840> it's

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
all is HP backup anyway so again it's

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.630 
all is HP backup anyway so again it's
really<00:03:04.410> not<00:03:04.560> that<00:03:04.620> big<00:03:04.890> of<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:05.070> deal<00:03:05.220> for<00:03:05.459> him

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
really not that big of a deal for him

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.390 
really not that big of a deal for him
but<00:03:05.900> he<00:03:06.900> hasn't<00:03:07.230> pulley<00:03:07.680> on<00:03:07.830> it<00:03:07.980> now<00:03:08.160> then

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
but he hasn't pulley on it now then

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.610 
but he hasn't pulley on it now then
pulling<00:03:08.700> out<00:03:08.880> his<00:03:08.970> burned<00:03:09.300> I<00:03:09.660> can't<00:03:10.320> really<00:03:10.440> do

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
pulling out his burned I can't really do

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.170 
pulling out his burned I can't really do
too<00:03:10.800> much<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:11.130> hit<00:03:11.280> but<00:03:11.430> he<00:03:11.580> can't<00:03:11.850> really<00:03:12.060> do

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
too much to hit but he can't really do

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.360 
too much to hit but he can't really do
too<00:03:12.360> much<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:12.660> me<00:03:12.780> so<00:03:13.380> I<00:03:13.410> figured<00:03:13.950> okay<00:03:14.340> let's

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
too much to me so I figured okay let's

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.280 
too much to me so I figured okay let's
just<00:03:14.790> go<00:03:14.910> for<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.120> rapid<00:03:15.299> spin<00:03:15.600> right<00:03:15.840> now<00:03:16.080> and

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
just go for the rapid spin right now and

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.990 
just go for the rapid spin right now and
then<00:03:16.739> I'll<00:03:16.860> switch<00:03:17.070> out<00:03:17.220> going<00:03:17.459> to<00:03:17.519> maneuver

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
then I'll switch out going to maneuver

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.840 
then I'll switch out going to maneuver

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
know you're probably gonna go for the

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.380 
know you're probably gonna go for the
ice<00:03:25.799> beam<00:03:26.040> so<00:03:26.370> I'm<00:03:26.549> gonna<00:03:26.670> go<00:03:26.850> into<00:03:26.970> my<00:03:27.090> Draghi

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
ice beam so I'm gonna go into my Draghi

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.840 
ice beam so I'm gonna go into my Draghi
here<00:03:28.290> so<00:03:28.470> that<00:03:28.620> way<00:03:28.769> i<00:03:28.799> can<00:03:28.920> easily<00:03:29.489> eat<00:03:29.670> that

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
here so that way i can easily eat that

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.580 
here so that way i can easily eat that
up<00:03:29.880> I<00:03:30.269> didn't<00:03:31.080> really<00:03:31.170> have<00:03:31.350> a<00:03:31.380> better

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
up I didn't really have a better

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.770 
up I didn't really have a better

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
switching to that either so I just again

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.539 
switching to that either so I just again
decided<00:03:34.170> to<00:03:34.440> go<00:03:34.560> into<00:03:34.709> jirachi<00:03:35.010> thought<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.459> be

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
us to what kind of set this thing is and

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.759 
us to what kind of set this thing is and
what<00:03:48.239> assume<00:03:48.510> it's<00:03:48.660> a<00:03:48.720> thin<00:03:49.470> tip<00:03:49.620> though

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
what assume it's a thin tip though

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.009 
what assume it's a thin tip though
because<00:03:49.920> i<00:03:50.130> do<00:03:50.190> not<00:03:50.400> see<00:03:50.580> left<00:03:50.820> over<00:03:51.090> so<00:03:51.360> i'm

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
because i do not see left over so i'm

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.479 
because i do not see left over so i'm
going<00:03:52.350> into<00:03:52.590> my<00:03:52.650> glass<00:03:52.799> toys<00:03:53.130> here<00:03:53.280> he's<00:03:53.370> gonna

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
going into my glass toys here he's gonna

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.699 
going into my glass toys here he's gonna
go<00:03:53.640> for<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:53.820> crunch<00:03:54.299> it<00:03:54.660> does<00:03:54.870> a<00:03:54.900> decent<00:03:55.320> mount

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709

of<00:03:55.830> damage<00:03:56.190> but<00:03:56.430> i<00:03:56.489> figured<00:03:56.880> okay<00:03:57.299> watch<00:03:57.480> till

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
of damage but i figured okay watch till

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:58.789 
of damage but i figured okay watch till
should<00:03:58.019> be<00:03:58.080> able<00:03:58.140> to<00:03:58.260> go<00:03:58.350> for<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:58.530> sculpt

Drain<00:05:35.240> I<00:05:35.360> have<00:05:35.720> instead<00:05:36.110> fields<00:05:36.440> which<00:05:36.650> I

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
Drain I have instead fields which I

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.050 
Drain I have instead fields which I
don't<00:05:37.070> know<00:05:37.280> I<00:05:37.310> just<00:05:37.370> felt<00:05:37.669> like<00:05:37.700> that<00:05:37.910> be<00:05:38.030> a

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
don't know I just felt like that be a

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.180 
don't know I just felt like that be a
better<00:05:38.300> move<00:05:39.050> on<00:05:39.229> him<00:05:39.410> so<00:05:39.560> that<00:05:39.590> way<00:05:39.890> i<00:05:40.130> can

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
better move on him so that way i can

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.490 
better move on him so that way i can
like<00:05:40.550> you<00:05:40.700> know<00:05:40.820> um<00:05:41.060> setup<00:05:41.900> i<00:05:42.020> can<00:05:42.169> see<00:05:42.290> a<00:05:42.320> point

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
like you know um setup i can see a point

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.990 
like you know um setup i can see a point
a<00:05:42.620> little<00:05:42.830> bit<00:05:42.919> better<00:05:43.070> with<00:05:43.310> like<00:05:43.520> switching

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
a little bit better with like switching

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.120 
a little bit better with like switching
and<00:05:44.120> stuff<00:05:44.360> so<00:05:44.690> anyways<00:05:45.530> he<00:05:45.770> ends<00:05:45.919> up<00:05:45.979> going

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
and stuff so anyways he ends up going

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.400 
and stuff so anyways he ends up going
into<00:05:46.280> his<00:05:46.520> high<00:05:46.610> drag<00:05:46.910> on<00:05:47.090> here<00:05:47.360> now<00:05:47.840> I<00:05:48.169> guess

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
into his high drag on here now I guess

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:49.840 
into his high drag on here now I guess
he<00:05:48.560> could<00:05:48.710> have<00:05:48.740> saved<00:05:48.979> it<00:05:49.100> for<00:05:49.280> later<00:05:49.430> but

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:49.850 
he could have saved it for later but

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.880 
he could have saved it for later but
this<00:05:50.450> is<00:05:50.570> what<00:05:50.720> he<00:05:50.810> actually<00:05:50.960> does<00:05:51.290> you<00:05:51.680> ain't

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:51.890 
this is what he actually does you ain't

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.969 
this is what he actually does you ain't
going<00:05:52.250> into<00:05:52.490> Beedrill<00:05:52.910> and<00:05:53.620> what<00:05:54.620> he<00:05:54.770> could

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:54.979 
going into Beedrill and what he could

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:57.550 
going into Beedrill and what he could
have<00:05:55.040> done<00:05:55.100> honestly<00:05:55.729> was<00:05:56.150> like<00:05:56.510> you<00:05:56.720> know<00:05:56.870> go

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
have done honestly was like you know go

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.490 
have done honestly was like you know go

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
for the Draco or let my thing kill him

switch out so he knew i was gonna switch

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:56.890 
switch out so he knew i was gonna switch
out<00:06:55.310> but<00:06:55.969> really<00:06:56.330> what<00:06:56.509> he<00:06:56.599> should<00:06:56.779> have<00:06:56.810> done

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:56.900
