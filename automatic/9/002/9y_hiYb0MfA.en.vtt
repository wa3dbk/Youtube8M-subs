bit of water and your fingertips that

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.080 
bit of water and your fingertips that
works<00:00:40.960> well<00:00:41.199> too<00:00:41.500> and<00:00:41.710> clean<00:00:42.489> the<00:00:42.610> toothbrush

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
works well too and clean the toothbrush

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.599 
works well too and clean the toothbrush
to<00:00:43.360> smooth<00:00:43.660> down<00:00:43.690> the<00:00:44.110> ends<00:00:44.469> if<00:00:44.800> you<00:00:45.280> wish<00:00:45.579> to

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:45.609 
to smooth down the ends if you wish to

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:48.479 
to smooth down the ends if you wish to
and<00:00:46.420> some<00:00:46.719> people<00:00:47.079> use<00:00:47.350> an<00:00:47.770> American<00:00:48.340> Girl

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
and some people use an American Girl

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.189 
and some people use an American Girl
doll<00:00:48.670> hairbrush<00:00:49.180> and<00:00:49.420> they<00:00:49.570> twist<00:00:49.809> through

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 
doll hairbrush and they twist through

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:51.330 
doll hairbrush and they twist through
the<00:00:50.410> hair<00:00:50.590> and<00:00:50.620> everything

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
the hair and everything

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.040 
the hair and everything
but<00:00:51.640> I<00:00:51.670> found<00:00:51.969> that<00:00:52.120> that<00:00:52.329> just<00:00:52.600> makes<00:00:52.809> it

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
but I found that that just makes it

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.740 
but I found that that just makes it
prettier<00:00:54.010> and<00:00:54.219> ends<00:00:54.850> get<00:00:55.030> all<00:00:55.120> messed<00:00:55.359> up

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
prettier and ends get all messed up

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.630 
prettier and ends get all messed up
and<00:00:55.840> also<00:00:56.530> doing<00:00:56.920> that<00:00:57.039> with<00:00:57.160> the<00:00:57.250> toothbrush

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
and also doing that with the toothbrush

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.189 
and also doing that with the toothbrush
doesn't<00:00:58.000> really<00:00:58.149> work<00:00:58.359> for<00:00:58.390> you<00:00:58.780> either<00:00:58.929> and

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
doesn't really work for you either and

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:00.360 
doesn't really work for you either and
just<00:00:59.260> use<00:00:59.500> the<00:00:59.620> toothbrush<00:00:59.949> to<00:01:00.129> smooth<00:01:00.340> down

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
just use the toothbrush to smooth down

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.000 
just use the toothbrush to smooth down
ends<00:01:00.940> but<00:01:01.510> if<00:01:01.629> that<00:01:01.750> works<00:01:01.989> for<00:01:02.289> you<00:01:02.379> then<00:01:02.980> go

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
ends but if that works for you then go

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.310 
ends but if that works for you then go
do<00:01:03.670> it<00:01:03.789> this<00:01:03.969> is<00:01:04.150> just<00:01:04.330> how<00:01:04.449> I<00:01:04.510> do<00:01:04.660> it<00:01:04.930> and<00:01:05.050> it's

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
do it this is just how I do it and it's

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.930 
do it this is just how I do it and it's
a<00:01:05.440> much<00:01:05.590> safer<00:01:05.830> method<00:01:06.370> to<00:01:06.520> keep<00:01:06.640> the<00:01:06.790> hair

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
a much safer method to keep the hair

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.520 
a much safer method to keep the hair
last<00:01:07.120> and<00:01:07.360> hotter<00:01:07.510> because<00:01:07.750> while<00:01:08.140> the<00:01:08.260> pieces

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
last and hotter because while the pieces

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.680 
last and hotter because while the pieces
don't<00:01:08.740> come<00:01:08.860> up<00:01:08.980> when<00:01:09.130> I<00:01:09.190> do<00:01:09.250> this<00:01:09.430> like<00:01:09.970> they

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
don't come up when I do this like they

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.420 
don't come up when I do this like they
would<00:01:10.900> when<00:01:11.200> you<00:01:11.470> would<00:01:11.680> go<00:01:12.100> through<00:01:12.340> with

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
would when you would go through with

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.700 
would when you would go through with
hair<00:01:12.910> brush<00:01:13.120> and<00:01:13.450> you<00:01:13.810> rip<00:01:13.990> out<00:01:14.080> all<00:01:14.290> the<00:01:14.410> ends

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
hair brush and you rip out all the ends

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.190 
hair brush and you rip out all the ends
so<00:01:14.740> this<00:01:15.550> is<00:01:15.700> how<00:01:15.820> I<00:01:15.880> do<00:01:16.030> it<00:01:16.300> so<00:01:16.480> first<00:01:16.930> you're

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.750 

this<00:01:59.370> should<00:02:00.440> stick<00:02:01.440> down<00:02:01.680> most<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.520> food

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
this should stick down most of the food

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.400 
this should stick down most of the food
and<00:02:02.910> as<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.420> can<00:02:03.570> see<00:02:03.720> I'm<00:02:03.840> kind<00:02:03.870> of<00:02:04.110> pulling

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
and as you can see I'm kind of pulling

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.500

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
down just the slightest bit and trying

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:14.600

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
to drop those loose ends then I can just

put<00:02:14.850> them<00:02:15.030> back<00:02:15.180> in<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:17.280> so<00:02:17.460> that<00:02:17.610> they<00:02:17.730> stay

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
put them back in and so that they stay

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.610 
put them back in and so that they stay
into<00:02:18.450> one<00:02:18.630> you<00:02:18.750> can<00:02:18.900> add<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.050> little<00:02:19.290> bit<00:02:19.410> of

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
into one you can add a little bit of

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.820 
into one you can add a little bit of
extra<00:02:19.980> water<00:02:22.130> help<00:02:23.660> smooth<00:02:24.660> them<00:02:24.930> down<00:02:24.960> you

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
just move on to the next girl and

00:02:27.270 --> 00:03:05.740 
just move on to the next girl and
continue<00:02:27.690> with<00:02:27.840> this<00:02:27.990> process

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.929 

if<00:03:06.260> you<00:03:06.349> get<00:03:06.530> to<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:06.799> top<00:03:07.040> here<00:03:07.370> and<00:03:07.400> there<00:03:07.790> are

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:07.939 
if you get to the top here and there are

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:11.110 
if you get to the top here and there are
some<00:03:08.239> kind<00:03:08.720> of<00:03:09.040> straight<00:03:10.040> pieces<00:03:10.370> sticking

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
some kind of straight pieces sticking

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.929 
some kind of straight pieces sticking
out<00:03:11.239> I<00:03:11.420> suggest<00:03:11.900> using<00:03:12.230> a<00:03:12.650> clean<00:03:13.189> toothbrush

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:13.939 
out I suggest using a clean toothbrush

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:16.030 
out I suggest using a clean toothbrush
and<00:03:14.360> you<00:03:14.780> can<00:03:14.930> just<00:03:15.110> use<00:03:15.260> it<00:03:15.290> to<00:03:15.470> lightly

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
and you can just use it to lightly

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.670 
and you can just use it to lightly
smooth<00:03:16.459> down<00:03:16.670> you<00:03:16.909> can<00:03:17.150> get<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:17.900> toothbrush<00:03:18.409> a

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
smooth down you can get the toothbrush a

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.809 
smooth down you can get the toothbrush a
little<00:03:19.010> wet

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
little wet

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.670 
little wet
knocking<00:03:20.360> dripping<00:03:20.689> wet<00:03:20.870> just<00:03:21.140> kind<00:03:21.349> of<00:03:21.439> damp

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
knocking dripping wet just kind of damp

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.339 
knocking dripping wet just kind of damp
and<00:03:22.040> it's<00:03:22.819> a<00:03:22.970> lot<00:03:23.120> safer<00:03:23.360> to<00:03:23.659> do<00:03:23.810> with<00:03:23.989> them<00:03:24.140> to

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
and it's a lot safer to do with them to

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.000 
and it's a lot safer to do with them to
spray<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.829> wink<00:03:25.040> which<00:03:25.700> could<00:03:26.890> loosen<00:03:27.890> the

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
spray the wink which could loosen the

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.500 
spray the wink which could loosen the
glue<00:03:28.129> and<00:03:28.310> make<00:03:28.430> it<00:03:28.549> fall<00:03:28.760> off<00:03:28.909> so<00:03:29.150> if<00:03:29.239> you<00:03:29.360> just

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
glue and make it fall off so if you just

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.210 
glue and make it fall off so if you just
have<00:03:29.690> a<00:03:29.720> bit<00:03:29.989> it<00:03:30.530> will<00:03:30.799> have<00:03:30.920> a<00:03:30.950> better<00:03:31.159> chance

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
have a bit it will have a better chance

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.830 
have a bit it will have a better chance
