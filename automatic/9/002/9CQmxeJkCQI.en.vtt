00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:17.210
 well we are the depth of the pri si 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.210
 I copy sailing with electric motors 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:26.610
 and as we see we have both engines in 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.610
 march in propulsion to the sea 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.970
 as we all know 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.910
 we have three ideals in the part 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.470
 lower for the management of the submarine 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.750
 depth management information of the 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:46.220
 depth in which we are 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.630
 management of direction and decision towards where 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.670
 what direction do we want to take 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.610
 management of the proportion or speed of 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.490
 submarine 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.750
 in the new portal to 24 flotilla a 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:03.750
 terror 3.01 we have two little ones when 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.430
 the new milestones here one port and another 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.409
 under starboard 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.689
 of the propulsion control dial 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:16.899
 in with which we can manage 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.899
 motors both electric and 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.890
 so let's order for the machines 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.280
 and as we see both machines are 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.280
 stops 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:34.610
 let's select only those from port 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.110
 note that it is not solved another no 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.140
 We are going to tell you not to put it on 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.530
 March 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.060
 as you see the port machine has been 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.750
 started up 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.750
 and we give him 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.270
 they separate 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.530
 the same thing we can do with the part 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.630
 starboard 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.020
 from the propulsion 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.610
 we can not pay 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:28.910
 we can also have 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:31.310
 different speeds according to what we want 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.640
 so we can tell the machine 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.600
 starboard that go 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.600
 at 4 knots 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.360
 and to the port machine that goes to 6 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.360
 knots 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:54.610
 how do you see root speed difference 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.460
 good morning and adequate to do this 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.320
 but 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.780
 in this way we can go managing 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.670
 this will stop only the machine that 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.680
 we have selected 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.330
 of love while that of scribes 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.410
 is still running because we have not given it 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.310
 the network to stop 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.310
 we stop everything 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:25.739
 both on the surface and submerged 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.739
 management of the engines is equal I repeat 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:33.020
 both in ocher color would work both 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.020
 engines at the same time 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:40.849
 and we stopped the two engines alavesas 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.819
 selecting the port-starboard steam 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:47.969
 we can say that separates us 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:50.790
 keep going or stop or not like that 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:53.909
 example we can tell you that both go 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.549
 to 2 and we can dedicate a moment 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:58.549
 determined that one of them stop 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.549
 we select 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.930
 and pÃ¡ramos and one of the machines has been 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.930
 stopped 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.199
 another of the new management that brings the 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.199
 mod of the 24 flotilla 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:26.940
 is the global way of managing 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.940
 navigation charts 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.169
 we open in him 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.889
 but of letters 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.889
 we deploy 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.009
 and as we see think of a series of his 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:43.139
 menus 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:43.139
 flag identification letter 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.960
 letter to know the revolutions I have 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.110
 what 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:55.530
 in this case merchant letter type day 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.210
 revolutions per minute this 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.430
 line up here 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.830
 and looking at the type of merchant and their 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.960
 revolutions we know at the speed that 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.480
 is going to do for example a limit to 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.150
 position 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:11.300
 so at 50 revolutions they will go to 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.800
 personally at 5 knots to 76 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:17.710
 revolutions we hear the 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.710
 hydrophone will go to 11 knots 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.200
 the same letter but for ships of 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.200
 war 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:29.529
 type of warships 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:33.789
 revolutions speeds 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:35.080
 a d of 56 revolutions per minute 5 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:38.800
 knots 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:41.430
 at 118 revolutions per minute it will go to 21 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.430
 12 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:54.160
 Route letter of the usual convoys 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:57.480
 where we are we will have more possibility 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.480
 to find a convoy 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.200
 the same letter but in sepia 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.380
 letter of technological developments 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.380
 during the war 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:21.370
 development of the submarines of the 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:24.090
 Torpedo candles art weapons 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:27.919
 radar hydrophone 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.919
 silence and so on 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.170
 letters of zeros and home 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.180
 for manual calculations 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:45.800
 recognition letters by the 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:47.150
 silhouette of a ship escorts where they 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.630
 indicates 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:53.240
 in the center the length of the ship the 

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:56.090
 height of your mast 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.630
 its set its weight and according to the city 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.630
 maximum 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:07.969
 different letters of different types of 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.969
 good of war or merchants 

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.130
 and merchants 

00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:15.309
 merchants 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:21.520
 something that is quite always be the 

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:24.979
 Same length mast height 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.960
 keel depth tonnage and 

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:29.860
 maxillary and maximum speed that 

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.860
 develops 

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:40.670
 help letters for example letters for 

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.720
 recognize the angle as we see it by 

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:44.960
 our newspaper this angle a 20 

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:49.720
 angle 

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.720
 85 from the same vessel 

00:07:55.009 --> 00:08:01.300
 letters of the state of the sea 

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:01.300
 according to the speed the wind 

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:06.919
 letter sea state as as 

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.919
 let's see 

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:11.900
 have a bed amara in storm
