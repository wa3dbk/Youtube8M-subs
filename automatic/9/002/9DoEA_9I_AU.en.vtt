spreads pinnacle have very close for

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.960

have slightly been drifting and what

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.049 
have slightly been drifting and what
we're<00:00:38.070> gonna<00:00:38.160> do<00:00:38.340> now<00:00:38.550> we<00:00:38.610> just<00:00:38.790> could<00:00:38.940> have<00:00:39.030> a

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
we're gonna do now we just could have a

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.670 
we're gonna do now we just could have a
look<00:00:39.180> at<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.420> odds<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:40.140> see<00:00:40.469> what<00:00:40.590> the

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
us a another idea gives another factor

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.490 
us a another idea gives another factor
in<00:00:51.360> where<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.809> prices<00:00:52.350> should<00:00:52.680> be<00:00:54.140> so<00:00:55.140> we<00:00:55.350> can

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
in where the prices should be so we can

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.459 
in where the prices should be so we can
see<00:00:55.710> here<00:00:55.980> just<00:00:56.010> bring<00:00:56.340> them<00:00:56.460> up<00:00:57.140> and<00:00:58.140> most<00:00:58.350> of

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
see here just bring them up and most of

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.709 
see here just bring them up and most of
them<00:00:58.590> have<00:00:58.680> PSV<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.190> lot<00:00:59.370> lower<00:00:59.670> than<00:01:00.030> Betfair

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
them have PSV a lot lower than Betfair

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.509 
them have PSV a lot lower than Betfair
at<00:01:01.460> 6.2<00:01:03.199> so<00:01:04.199> I've<00:01:04.530> got<00:01:04.680> enough<00:01:04.920> evidence<00:01:05.129> here

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
at 6.2 so I've got enough evidence here

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.830 
at 6.2 so I've got enough evidence here
that<00:01:06.000> suggests<00:01:06.720> with<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.470> DI<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:08.100> high<00:01:08.310> that

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
that suggests with the DI so high that

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.570 
that suggests with the DI so high that
PSV<00:01:09.840> are<00:01:09.960> going<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.140> come<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:13.310> okay<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.369> what

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
PSV are going to come in okay so what

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.950
