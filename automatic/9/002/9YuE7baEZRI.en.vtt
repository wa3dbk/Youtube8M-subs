me<00:00:35.640> we<00:00:35.820> can<00:00:36.240> talk<00:00:36.510> about<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.810> left<00:00:36.990> hook<00:00:37.170> but<00:00:37.440> I

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:37.740 
me we can talk about the left hook but I

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.890 
me we can talk about the left hook but I
was<00:00:37.950> just<00:00:38.130> saying<00:00:38.340> before<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.480> was<00:00:39.660> the

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
was just saying before that it was the

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.140 
was just saying before that it was the
for<00:00:40.260> me<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.680> body<00:00:40.920> shots<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.760> did<00:00:42.000> it

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
for me that the body shots that did it

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.420 
for me that the body shots that did it
for<00:00:42.300> Pacific<00:00:42.930> people<00:00:43.380> that<00:00:43.560> the<00:00:43.800> defense<00:00:44.160> down

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
for Pacific people that the defense down

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.990 
for Pacific people that the defense down
and<00:00:44.850> enabled<00:00:45.630> the<00:00:45.870> left<00:00:46.740> home<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.100> follow<00:00:47.340> and

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
and enabled the left home to follow and

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.810 
and enabled the left home to follow and
I<00:00:48.240> think<00:00:48.330> it<00:00:48.570> just<00:00:48.600> shows<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:49.380> despite<00:00:50.280> that

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
I think it just shows that despite that

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.570 
I think it just shows that despite that
the<00:00:51.060> time<00:00:51.330> off<00:00:51.540> although<00:00:51.990> the<00:00:52.170> injury<00:00:53.130> period

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.580 
the time off although the injury period

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.710 
the time off although the injury period
that<00:00:53.730> we've<00:00:53.850> had<00:00:54.590> I'll<00:00:55.590> make<00:00:55.740> already<00:00:56.250> is

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
that we've had I'll make already is

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.780 
that we've had I'll make already is
still<00:00:57.720> at<00:00:57.990> the<00:00:58.200> very<00:00:58.440> pinnacle<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.610> the<00:00:59.760> sport

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
still at the very pinnacle of the sport

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.230 
still at the very pinnacle of the sport
at<00:01:00.450> the<00:01:00.600> very<00:01:00.780> top<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.080> the<00:01:01.230> sport<00:01:01.560> I<00:01:01.830> think<00:01:02.490> the

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:03.240 
at the very top of the sport I think the

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.479 
at the very top of the sport I think the
performance<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:04.170> called<00:01:04.409> for<00:01:04.650> before<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.400> know

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
performance I called for before you know

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.990 
performance I called for before you know
I<00:01:05.519> said<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:06.030> weed<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.509> great<00:01:06.810> but<00:01:07.799> we<00:01:08.700> need<00:01:08.880> to

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
I said a weed is great but we need to

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.929 
I said a weed is great but we need to
impress<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.719> I<00:01:10.170> think<00:01:10.469> Michael<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.399> delivered

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
impress and I think Michael is delivered

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.999 
impress and I think Michael is delivered
on<00:01:12.479> both<00:01:12.750> counts<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.469> I<00:01:13.560> think<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.890> is

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
on both counts and I think that is

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.880 
on both counts and I think that is
something<00:01:14.609> that<00:01:14.929> the<00:01:15.929> people<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.320> Denmark<00:01:16.530> can

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
something that the people of Denmark can

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.830 
something that the people of Denmark can
be<00:01:16.950> very<00:01:17.159> proud<00:01:17.399> of<00:01:17.460> what<00:01:20.240> will<00:01:21.240> be<00:01:21.329> next<00:01:21.450> 20
