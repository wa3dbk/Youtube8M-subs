00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
as long as possible is that sort of a

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.220 
as long as possible is that sort of a
more<00:02:58.220> elegant<00:02:58.550> presentation<00:02:59.020> good<00:03:00.020> because

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
more elegant presentation good because

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.530 
more elegant presentation good because
what<00:03:00.470> I<00:03:00.620> was<00:03:00.740> saying<00:03:00.950> that<00:03:01.220> if<00:03:01.850> you<00:03:02.510> use

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
what I was saying that if you use

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.910 
what I was saying that if you use
all-purpose<00:03:02.960> flour<00:03:03.470> they'll<00:03:03.770> be<00:03:03.860> more

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
all-purpose flour they'll be more

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.650 
all-purpose flour they'll be more
stretchy<00:03:04.430> and<00:03:04.700> then<00:03:04.790> they'll<00:03:04.940> be<00:03:05.030> really<00:03:05.390> thin

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
stretchy and then they'll be really thin

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:12.700 
stretchy and then they'll be really thin
you<00:03:05.960> can<00:03:09.880> your<00:03:10.880> hands<00:03:11.150> are<00:03:11.270> kind<00:03:11.510> of<00:03:11.570> fell<00:03:11.780> drop

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
it right down on the cornmeal because

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.670 
it right down on the cornmeal because
that's<00:03:14.450> what<00:03:14.600> gives<00:03:14.720> it<00:03:14.810> that<00:03:14.870> nice<00:03:15.080> crunchy

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
that's what gives it that nice crunchy

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.280 
that's what gives it that nice crunchy

cocktails and you can just sort of toss
them<00:03:29.690> together<00:03:30.200> now<00:03:31.160> these<00:03:31.430> are<00:03:31.700> pretty<00:03:31.940> long

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
them together now these are pretty long

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.630 
them together now these are pretty long
if<00:03:32.630> you<00:03:32.660> had<00:03:33.050> an<00:03:33.500> oven<00:03:33.890> that<00:03:34.040> was<00:03:34.190> large<00:03:34.520> enough

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
if you had an oven that was large enough

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.120 
if you had an oven that was large enough
for<00:03:35.150> a<00:03:35.300> full<00:03:35.570> size<00:03:35.810> sheet<00:03:36.110> pan<00:03:36.350> these<00:03:36.800> might

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
for a full size sheet pan these might

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.790 
for a full size sheet pan these might
fit<00:03:37.160> but<00:03:37.730> we're<00:03:38.120> gonna<00:03:38.240> have<00:03:38.480> to<00:03:38.750> make<00:03:39.530> them<00:03:39.710> a

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
fit but we're gonna have to make them a

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.770 
fit but we're gonna have to make them a
little<00:03:39.950> smaller<00:03:40.280> so<00:03:40.880> you<00:03:40.940> see<00:03:41.150> how<00:03:41.270> stretch<00:03:41.600> it

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
little smaller so you see how stretch it

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.180 
little smaller so you see how stretch it
is<00:03:41.900> stellara<00:03:42.140> we<00:03:42.440> don't<00:03:42.620> want<00:03:42.740> to<00:03:42.830> pull<00:03:42.980> them

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
is stellara we don't want to pull them

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.860 
is stellara we don't want to pull them
longer<00:03:43.430> because<00:03:43.910> they<00:03:44.030> make<00:03:44.180> it<00:03:44.300> really<00:03:44.630> thin

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
longer because they make it really thin

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.230 
longer because they make it really thin
but<00:03:45.350> if<00:03:45.590> it's<00:03:45.950> too<00:03:46.040> long<00:03:46.370> for<00:03:46.430> example<00:03:47.090> this

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:47.240 
but if it's too long for example this

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.620 
but if it's too long for example this
one<00:03:47.300> we<00:03:48.020> can<00:03:48.230> see<00:03:48.970> it's<00:03:49.970> too<00:03:50.150> long<00:03:50.300> for<00:03:50.420> the

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
one we can see it's too long for the

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.770 
one we can see it's too long for the
sheet<00:03:51.100> just<00:03:52.100> stretch<00:03:52.670> it<00:03:52.700> out<00:03:52.970> and<00:03:53.330> slip<00:03:53.660> it

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
sheet just stretch it out and slip it

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.230 
sheet just stretch it out and slip it
off<00:03:53.870> right<00:03:54.670> excellent<00:03:55.670> and<00:03:55.790> actually<00:03:55.940> I'm

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
off right excellent and actually I'm

on<00:04:29.690> the<00:04:29.780> sheet<00:04:30.020> okay<00:04:30.440> and<00:04:30.880> what<00:04:31.880> I<00:04:31.910> do<00:04:32.030> is<00:04:32.150> I

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
on the sheet okay and what I do is I

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.510 
on the sheet okay and what I do is I
spray<00:04:32.720> them<00:04:32.960> or<00:04:33.200> use<00:04:33.350> a<00:04:33.380> little<00:04:33.710> brush<00:04:33.950> because

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
spray them or use a little brush because

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.790 
spray them or use a little brush because
that<00:04:34.910> way<00:04:35.120> the<00:04:35.480> salt<00:04:35.780> will<00:04:35.900> stick<00:04:36.440> to<00:04:36.470> it<00:04:36.770> and

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
that way the salt will stick to it and

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.850 
that way the salt will stick to it and
if<00:04:37.010> you<00:04:37.100> can<00:04:37.220> pass<00:04:37.370> me<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:37.730> coarse<00:04:37.970> salt

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
if you can pass me the coarse salt

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.260 
if you can pass me the coarse salt
that's<00:04:39.860> just<00:04:40.010> flour<00:04:40.310> increase<00:04:40.850> so<00:04:41.090> it's

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
that's just flour increase so it's

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.330
