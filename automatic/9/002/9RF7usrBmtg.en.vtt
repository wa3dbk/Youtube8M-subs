that one of the miter saws will go on as
well<00:00:07.319> as<00:00:07.500> material<00:00:08.130> storage<00:00:08.429> I<00:00:08.730> put<00:00:09.269> it<00:00:09.360> in<00:00:09.450> the

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
well as material storage I put it in the

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.120 
well as material storage I put it in the
trailer<00:00:09.929> and<00:00:10.219> it<00:00:11.219> fit<00:00:11.490> tight<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.980> side<00:00:13.980> of

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
trailer and it fit tight to the side of

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.939 
trailer and it fit tight to the side of
the<00:00:14.190> wall<00:00:14.370> all<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.730> way<00:00:14.820> up<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.330> ceiling

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:15.949 
the wall all the way up to the ceiling

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.760 
the wall all the way up to the ceiling
as<00:00:16.949> designed<00:00:17.609> but<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.570> decided<00:00:19.080> after<00:00:19.470> looking

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
as designed but I decided after looking

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.400 
as designed but I decided after looking
at<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.369> want<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.029> drop<00:00:21.539> that<00:00:21.600> down<00:00:22.140> and

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
at it that I want to drop that down and

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.330 
at it that I want to drop that down and
use<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.890> use<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.519> top<00:00:24.029> as<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.810> shelf<00:00:25.289> so<00:00:26.070> I'll

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
use the use the top as a shelf so I'll

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.300 
use the use the top as a shelf so I'll
install<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.539> then<00:00:28.439> after<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.220> get

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
install it and then after I get

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.110 
install it and then after I get
installed<00:00:29.760> I'll<00:00:29.939> put<00:00:30.289> some<00:00:31.759> plywood<00:00:32.759> strips

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
installed I'll put some plywood strips

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.490 
installed I'll put some plywood strips
around<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.630> edge<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.750> create<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.170> little<00:00:34.200> bit

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
around the edge to create a little bit

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.220 
around the edge to create a little bit
of<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.649> lip<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:36.180> have<00:00:36.420> some<00:00:36.630> things<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:36.930> can

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
of a lip and I have some things that can

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.319 
of a lip and I have some things that can
store<00:00:37.559> up<00:00:37.620> there<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.160> first<00:00:38.700> thing<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.030> need<00:00:39.210> to

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
store up there so first thing I need to

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.959 
store up there so first thing I need to
do<00:00:39.480> then<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:40.379> go<00:00:41.070> ahead<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.640> cut<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.629> down

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
do then is go ahead and cut this down

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.160 
do then is go ahead and cut this down
about<00:00:44.969> I'm<00:00:45.180> going<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.390> cut<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.600> down<00:00:45.690> about<00:00:45.870> 8

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
about I'm going to cut it down about 8

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.650 
about I'm going to cut it down about 8
inches<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.969> should<00:00:48.149> be<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.300> pretty<00:00:48.570> easy

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
inches and so it should be a pretty easy

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.799 
inches and so it should be a pretty easy
thing<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.620> do<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:49.890> have<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.660> two

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
thing to do I have the the the two

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.400 
thing to do I have the the the two
bottom<00:00:52.170> spreaders<00:00:52.730> installed<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.090> can<00:00:54.449> you

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
bottom spreaders installed so I can you

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.670 
bottom spreaders installed so I can you
know<00:00:55.440> unscrew<00:00:55.980> those<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:57.050> make<00:00:58.050> my<00:00:58.230> cut<00:00:58.440> and

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
know unscrew those and make my cut and

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.060 

this<00:01:03.570> would<00:01:03.690> be<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.810> quick<00:01:04.080> repair<00:01:04.500> all<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.800> need

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
this would be a quick repair all I need

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.100 
this would be a quick repair all I need
to<00:01:05.160> do<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.489> remove<00:01:05.880> those<00:01:06.150> bottom<00:01:06.570> spreaders

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
and then take the track with the TS 55

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.820 
and then take the track with the TS 55
and<00:01:11.880> just<00:01:12.030> cut<00:01:12.660> those<00:01:12.810> off<00:01:13.050> it's<00:01:13.380> real<00:01:13.620> quick

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
and just cut those off it's real quick

and easy and then just reattach the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.180 
and easy and then just reattach the
spreaders<00:01:17.910> at<00:01:18.120> the<00:01:18.300> new<00:01:18.720> location<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.470> then

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
spreaders at the new location and then

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:27.639 
spreaders at the new location and then
it'll<00:01:20.340> be<00:01:20.400> ready<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.900> go<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:22.050> the<00:01:22.140> trailer

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:29.840 

now<00:01:28.649> I'm<00:01:28.770> going<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.009> work<00:01:29.189> on<00:01:29.369> probably<00:01:29.759> the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
now I'm going to work on probably the

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.910 
now I'm going to work on probably the
most<00:01:30.030> complicated<00:01:30.450> cabinet<00:01:31.289> that<00:01:31.469> I<00:01:31.530> have<00:01:31.740> to

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
most complicated cabinet that I have to

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.910 
most complicated cabinet that I have to
build<00:01:32.070> for<00:01:32.399> the<00:01:32.549> trailer<00:01:32.820> which<00:01:33.179> is<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
build for the trailer which is the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.669 
build for the trailer which is the
butane<00:01:34.920> er<00:01:35.210> shelves<00:01:36.210> with<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.140> built-in

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
butane er shelves with the built-in

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.120 
butane er shelves with the built-in
level<00:01:38.479> storage<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.899> so<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.649> have<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.950> cut<00:01:41.100> a

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
level storage and so I have to cut a

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.429 
level storage and so I have to cut a
bunch<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.520> narrow<00:01:41.939> pieces<00:01:42.390> out<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.990> half-inch

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
bunch of narrow pieces out of half-inch

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.850 
bunch of narrow pieces out of half-inch
and<00:01:43.740> some<00:01:44.039> 3/4<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.880> do<00:01:45.479> some<00:01:45.689> assembly<00:01:46.259> here

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
and some 3/4 and do some assembly here

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.490 
and some 3/4 and do some assembly here
I'll<00:01:46.979> be<00:01:47.069> using<00:01:47.219> glue<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.119> some<00:01:48.990> finished

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
I'll be using glue and some finished

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.520 
I'll be using glue and some finished
nails<00:01:49.770> actually<00:01:50.340> some<00:01:50.969> pins<00:01:51.360> some<00:01:52.140> 18<00:01:52.500> gauge

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
nails actually some pins some 18 gauge

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.620 
nails actually some pins some 18 gauge
pins

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.420 

built<00:01:55.899> sort<00:01:56.079> of<00:01:56.170> just<00:01:56.320> an<00:01:56.439> L<00:01:56.649> the<00:01:56.979> front<00:01:57.280> edge

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
built sort of just an L the front edge

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.730 
built sort of just an L the front edge
is<00:01:57.700> what<00:01:57.939> keeps<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.539> butane<00:01:58.960> er<00:01:59.020> in<00:01:59.350> and<00:01:59.619> then

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
is what keeps the butane er in and then

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.440 
is what keeps the butane er in and then
of<00:01:59.890> course<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.280> back<00:02:00.430> edge<00:02:00.700> is<00:02:00.909> what<00:02:01.090> it<00:02:01.180> sits

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
of course the back edge is what it sits

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.680 
of course the back edge is what it sits
on<00:02:01.570> so<00:02:01.840> they're<00:02:01.990> different<00:02:02.380> widths

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
on so they're different widths

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.810 
on so they're different widths
I<00:02:04.750> have<00:02:04.900> to<00:02:05.110> build<00:02:05.320> up<00:02:05.470> I<00:02:05.770> think<00:02:05.950> I'm<00:02:06.250> gonna<00:02:06.400> use

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
I have to build up I think I'm gonna use

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.600 
I have to build up I think I'm gonna use
three<00:02:07.180> of<00:02:07.210> them<00:02:07.420> I<00:02:07.510> build<00:02:07.780> up<00:02:07.960> four<00:02:08.520> just<00:02:09.520> in

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
three of them I build up four just in

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.840 
three of them I build up four just in
case<00:02:09.820> I<00:02:09.940> want<00:02:10.119> to<00:02:10.150> add<00:02:10.210> an<00:02:10.510> extra<00:02:10.600> one<00:02:11.640> then<00:02:12.640> the

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
case I want to add an extra one then the

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.600 
case I want to add an extra one then the
sides<00:02:13.230> those<00:02:14.230> are<00:02:14.380> built<00:02:14.500> out<00:02:14.650> of<00:02:14.710> 3/4<00:02:15.400> and

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
sides those are built out of 3/4 and

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.000 
sides those are built out of 3/4 and
I'll<00:02:15.730> screw<00:02:16.150> those<00:02:16.330> in<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:16.960> then<00:02:16.990> I'll<00:02:17.740> use<00:02:17.980> a

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
I'll screw those in and then I'll use a

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.900 
I'll screw those in and then I'll use a
little<00:02:18.850> rip<00:02:19.390> of<00:02:19.630> plywood<00:02:20.350> as<00:02:20.980> once<00:02:21.580> I<00:02:21.700> figure

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
little rip of plywood as once I figure

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.610 
little rip of plywood as once I figure
out<00:02:22.030> exactly<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.480> spacing<00:02:23.080> I<00:02:23.200> made<00:02:23.380> a<00:02:23.410> little

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
out exactly the spacing I made a little

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.920 
out exactly the spacing I made a little
piece<00:02:23.800> of<00:02:23.920> plywood<00:02:24.160> that<00:02:25.060> would<00:02:25.720> keep

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
piece of plywood that would keep

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.230 
piece of plywood that would keep
everything<00:02:26.290> exactly<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.550> same<00:02:27.880> on<00:02:28.090> both

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
everything exactly the same on both

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.230 
everything exactly the same on both
sides

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
sides

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.850 
sides
and<00:02:30.330> then<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.810> pre<00:02:31.110> drilling<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:31.770> screwing

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
and then I pre drilling and screwing

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.740 
and then I pre drilling and screwing
those<00:02:32.340> in<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:32.760> then<00:02:32.850> flipping<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.270> over<00:02:33.420> and

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
those in and then flipping it over and

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.160 
those in and then flipping it over and
doing<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.290> same<00:02:34.500> thing<00:02:34.770> on<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.010> other<00:02:35.040> side

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.010 

then<00:02:38.709> I'll<00:02:38.860> be<00:02:39.330> putting<00:02:40.330> a<00:02:40.540> piece<00:02:40.810> of

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
then I'll be putting a piece of

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.830 
then I'll be putting a piece of
half-inch<00:02:41.590> on<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.880> back<00:02:43.090> which<00:02:43.420> I'll<00:02:43.599> have<00:02:43.660> to

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
half-inch on the back which I'll have to

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.770 
half-inch on the back which I'll have to
cut<00:02:44.080> once<00:02:44.890> I<00:02:45.069> get<00:02:45.280> this<00:02:45.880> put<00:02:46.150> together<00:02:46.270> and

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
cut once I get this put together and

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.020 
cut once I get this put together and
measured<00:02:47.560> I'll<00:02:47.739> know<00:02:47.920> exactly<00:02:48.340> what<00:02:48.580> size<00:02:48.610> to

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
measured I'll know exactly what size to

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.760 
measured I'll know exactly what size to
make<00:02:49.060> that<00:02:49.560> half-inch

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.740 

you

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
you

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.280 
you
again<00:02:56.350> the<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:57.400> TS<00:02:57.730> 55<00:02:58.360> of<00:02:58.570> that<00:02:58.690> track<00:02:58.990> makes

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
again the the TS 55 of that track makes

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.200 
again the the TS 55 of that track makes
quick<00:02:59.560> work<00:02:59.590> of<00:02:59.950> breaking<00:03:00.310> down<00:03:00.340> plywood<00:03:00.910> even

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
quick work of breaking down plywood even

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:09.910 
quick work of breaking down plywood even
for<00:03:01.390> a<00:03:01.420> single<00:03:02.230> cut<00:03:02.440> like<00:03:02.680> that

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.830 

so<00:03:10.430> I'll<00:03:10.520> do<00:03:10.700> my<00:03:10.850> layout<00:03:11.270> I'll<00:03:11.390> figure<00:03:11.690> out

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
so I'll do my layout I'll figure out

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.460 
so I'll do my layout I'll figure out
right<00:03:12.110> where<00:03:12.380> I<00:03:12.410> want<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.250> nails<00:03:14.320> to<00:03:15.320> go

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
right where I want the nails to go

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.760 
right where I want the nails to go
through<00:03:16.180> use<00:03:17.180> my<00:03:17.390> track<00:03:17.990> as<00:03:18.290> a<00:03:18.320> straightedge

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
through use my track as a straightedge

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:24.850 
through use my track as a straightedge
so<00:03:19.490> I've<00:03:19.610> got<00:03:19.790> some<00:03:20.000> nice<00:03:20.150> lines<00:03:20.750> good<00:03:21.260> layout

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.370 

putting<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:25.490> ugly<00:03:26.330> side<00:03:26.540> of<00:03:26.570> the<00:03:26.720> plywood<00:03:27.170> out

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
putting the ugly side of the plywood out

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.960 
putting the ugly side of the plywood out
because<00:03:27.860> that<00:03:28.040> would<00:03:28.130> be<00:03:28.220> buried

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.850 

depending<00:03:33.600> on<00:03:33.690> glue<00:03:33.990> for<00:03:34.260> most<00:03:34.440> of<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.650> hold

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
depending on glue for most of the hold

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.150 
depending on glue for most of the hold
and<00:03:35.100> then<00:03:35.220> using<00:03:35.520> the<00:03:35.640> same<00:03:35.820> 18<00:03:36.240> gauge<00:03:36.860> pens<00:03:37.860> to

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
and then using the same 18 gauge pens to

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.920 
and then using the same 18 gauge pens to
hold<00:03:40.580> the<00:03:40.760> back<00:03:40.940> on<00:03:41.210> and<00:03:41.510> keep<00:03:41.690> it<00:03:41.810> all

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
hold the back on and keep it all

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.260 
hold the back on and keep it all
together<00:03:42.500> and<00:03:43.010> with<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.430> layout<00:03:43.730> lines<00:03:44.030> I'm

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
together and with the layout lines I'm

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.530 
together and with the layout lines I'm
able<00:03:44.570> to<00:03:44.720> get<00:03:45.310> right<00:03:46.310> into<00:03:46.490> those<00:03:46.910> those<00:03:47.420> are

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
able to get right into those those are

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.990 
able to get right into those those are
only<00:03:47.660> happens<00:03:48.200> will<00:03:48.410> wide<00:03:48.950> shelf<00:03:49.370> so<00:03:49.700> I've<00:03:49.820> got

only happens will wide shelf so I've got
to<00:03:50.120> get<00:03:50.240> those<00:03:50.360> pins<00:03:50.750> right<00:03:51.020> on<00:03:51.460> now<00:03:52.460> I'm

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
to get those pins right on now I'm

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.310 
to get those pins right on now I'm
ripping<00:03:53.000> the<00:03:53.120> strip's<00:03:53.510> it'll<00:03:53.840> make<00:03:54.050> the

ripping the strip's it'll make the
little<00:03:54.680> shelves<00:03:55.070> for<00:03:55.550> the<00:03:55.960> the<00:03:56.960> levels<00:03:57.560> it's<00:03:58.040> a

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
little shelves for the the levels it's a

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.710 
little shelves for the the levels it's a
very<00:03:58.430> narrow<00:03:58.790> thing<00:03:58.940> again<00:03:59.450> I'm<00:03:59.570> using

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
very narrow thing again I'm using

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.190 
very narrow thing again I'm using
half-inch<00:04:00.410> save<00:04:01.160> a<00:04:01.190> little<00:04:01.370> space<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:02.810> bottom

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
half-inch save a little space the bottom

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.230 
half-inch save a little space the bottom
piece<00:04:03.710> will<00:04:04.280> be<00:04:04.460> the<00:04:04.490> one<00:04:04.760> and<00:04:04.880> only<00:04:04.910> piece<00:04:05.210> of

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
piece will be the one and only piece of

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.020 
piece will be the one and only piece of
3/4<00:04:05.900> there<00:04:06.080> I'll<00:04:06.200> be<00:04:06.400> screwing<00:04:07.400> through<00:04:07.730> that

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
3/4 there I'll be screwing through that

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.410 
3/4 there I'll be screwing through that
right<00:04:09.020> into<00:04:09.470> the<00:04:09.740> half<00:04:10.430> it's<00:04:10.730> plywood<00:04:11.030> and

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
right into the half it's plywood and

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.290 
right into the half it's plywood and
into<00:04:11.780> the<00:04:12.640> bases<00:04:13.640> the<00:04:13.790> other<00:04:13.940> of<00:04:14.180> the

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
into the bases the other of the

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:22.879 
into the bases the other of the
half-inch<00:04:14.660> base<00:04:14.870> the<00:04:15.140> other

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.149 

and<00:04:23.090> then<00:04:24.090> rather<00:04:24.629> than<00:04:24.810> laying<00:04:25.199> this<00:04:25.499> out<00:04:25.710> I'd

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:26.159 
and then rather than laying this out I'd

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:28.760 
and then rather than laying this out I'd
cut<00:04:26.370> some<00:04:26.580> strips<00:04:26.939> of<00:04:27.240> plywood<00:04:27.659> from<00:04:28.439> some<00:04:28.680> of

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
cut some strips of plywood from some of

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.369 
cut some strips of plywood from some of
the<00:04:28.860> scraps<00:04:29.189> this<00:04:29.879> is<00:04:30.060> a<00:04:30.090> spacer<00:04:30.719> so<00:04:31.020> I<00:04:31.050> could

00:04:31.369 --> 00:04:31.379 
the scraps this is a spacer so I could

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:34.670 
the scraps this is a spacer so I could
use<00:04:32.249> it<00:04:32.460> both<00:04:32.580> to<00:04:32.729> figure<00:04:32.969> out<00:04:33.090> where<00:04:33.419> to<00:04:33.680> drill

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
use it both to figure out where to drill

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.890 
use it both to figure out where to drill
the<00:04:34.800> holes<00:04:34.979> and<00:04:35.189> also<00:04:35.580> pull<00:04:36.210> it<00:04:36.360> tight<00:04:36.599> to<00:04:36.870> it

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
the holes and also pull it tight to it

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.159 
the holes and also pull it tight to it
and<00:04:37.199> get<00:04:37.319> a<00:04:37.349> nice<00:04:37.590> straight<00:04:38.240> piece<00:04:39.240> there<00:04:39.599> my

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
and get a nice straight piece there my

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.379 
and get a nice straight piece there my
first<00:04:40.469> attempt<00:04:40.919> here<00:04:41.069> was<00:04:41.249> to<00:04:41.490> put<00:04:41.729> it<00:04:42.029> on<00:04:42.150> and

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
first attempt here was to put it on and

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.350 
first attempt here was to put it on and
then<00:04:42.449> screw<00:04:42.779> through<00:04:42.990> the<00:04:43.020> back<00:04:43.639> and<00:04:44.639> then<00:04:45.330> I

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
then screw through the back and then I

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.129 
then screw through the back and then I
switched<00:04:46.139> up<00:04:46.439> and<00:04:47.330> put<00:04:48.330> screws<00:04:48.749> through<00:04:48.960> the

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
switched up and put screws through the

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.890 
switched up and put screws through the
front<00:04:49.550> of<00:04:50.550> course<00:04:51.270> it's<00:04:51.449> only<00:04:51.569> going<00:04:51.840> in

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
front of course it's only going in

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.860 
front of course it's only going in
half-inch<00:04:52.319> plywood<00:04:52.789> so<00:04:53.789> I<00:04:53.819> put<00:04:54.270> a<00:04:54.300> few<00:04:54.539> through

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
half-inch plywood so I put a few through

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.709 
half-inch plywood so I put a few through
the<00:04:55.020> front<00:04:55.319> to<00:04:55.469> get<00:04:55.590> it<00:04:55.879> good<00:04:56.879> and<00:04:57.029> stable<00:04:57.300> and

00:04:57.709 --> 00:04:57.719 
the front to get it good and stable and

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:01.459 
the front to get it good and stable and
then<00:04:58.909> after<00:04:59.909> I<00:04:59.939> got<00:05:00.210> all<00:05:00.509> of<00:05:00.810> the<00:05:00.900> pieces<00:05:01.139> on

00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:01.469 
then after I got all of the pieces on

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:04.119 
then after I got all of the pieces on
and<00:05:01.800> I<00:05:01.860> turned<00:05:02.129> it<00:05:02.250> around<00:05:02.340> and<00:05:02.789> was<00:05:03.629> able<00:05:03.810> to

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:04.129 
and I turned it around and was able to

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:07.820 
and I turned it around and was able to
put<00:05:05.129> screws<00:05:06.060> in<00:05:06.300> through<00:05:06.719> into<00:05:07.199> the<00:05:07.319> plywood

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
put screws in through into the plywood

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.390 
put screws in through into the plywood
so<00:05:08.099> between<00:05:08.759> the<00:05:09.000> glue<00:05:09.270> and<00:05:09.509> the<00:05:09.569> screws

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
so between the glue and the screws

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.210 
so between the glue and the screws
they're<00:05:11.400> going<00:05:11.580> to<00:05:11.639> be<00:05:11.819> pretty<00:05:12.419> stable

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.860 

and<00:05:15.340> then<00:05:15.910> I'm<00:05:16.000> putting<00:05:16.150> another<00:05:16.450> piece<00:05:16.720> of

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
and then I'm putting another piece of

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.570 
and then I'm putting another piece of
half-inch<00:05:17.050> on<00:05:17.500> create<00:05:17.860> kind<00:05:18.040> of<00:05:18.130> a<00:05:18.250> sandwich

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
half-inch on create kind of a sandwich

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.580
