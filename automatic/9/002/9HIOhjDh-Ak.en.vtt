00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.140
 hello good morning everyone in this video 

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:08.019
 I'm going to solve the 4x4 cube by four 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:11.070
 crazy type 1 but I'm going to take advantage for 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:13.600
 comment a couple of things first 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.000
 I want to quickly explain how I started 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.680
 with this addition of rubik's cube I already 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.780
 I had a Rubik's cube that my mother 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.300
 I had bought I do not know how many years 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.950
 five or six years for a Christmas and 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.750
 I had left it on the shelf and I did not 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.180
 I had bothered or to undo it 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.039
 It seemed like it was impossible and very 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.949
 complicated and this also I do not think that I 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.690
 like nothing I'm not going to do it and I had it 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:36.429
 for years and a good day a great friend 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.140
 friend we were here the two of me 

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:39.429
 room and told me hey why not 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.620
 undo that cube that you have there 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:43.899
 died of disgust and says good is worth it 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.850
 undoes undo it or undo it but 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:47.620
 you have to help me solve it I do not 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.289
 I want here to break my head now 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.660
 a lot and he told me, come on, we undo it 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:54.210
 if I help you 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.470
 and then we undid and I said come on 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.990
 To do it 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.070
 and he answered me no I do not think to help you 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.030
 Get a Life 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.640
 I'm going here and then nothing stayed 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.050
 with the bucket and I felt like 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.330
 solve it because it bothered me to have it 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.530
 undone and that night until 4 or 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.100
 5 in the morning until I got 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.540
 solve it do not stop it and the next day 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.510
 doctor in headed this is pretty 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.180
 interesting and past then it is not a 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:25.260
 week I bought the 4x4 rubik that I 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.090
 it seemed incredible then I did the first 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.250
 buy online that was ubc v 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.130
 six six by six I who bought it in 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.900
 the official page of youtube then 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.930
 I bought the mega ming cel 3 from pyramids 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.119
 for 36 jon and suddenly a few weeks 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.300
 afterwards he was already buying every Friday 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.670
 a cube on the internet and now it is not 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.640
 you bought several cubes a week or 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.200
 at least 11 a week and it's a 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.360
 hobby that there is no stop because we 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.860
 they continue to take cubes to the market very 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.869
 interesting if you feel like 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.060
 buy them and end up buying them 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.890
 falling temptation 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.990
 but anyway I really what 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.759
 I want to comment in this video is it 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.350
 well I want to take advantage to give you the 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.610
 thanks to all those who have 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.770
 seen in my videos to all 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.780
 supportive comments and reviews 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.340
 positive positive votes since I 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.340
 motivates to continue making videos 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.620
 it entertains me entertains and it is also 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.310
 that making videos serves a bit to 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.480
 let off steam because you're not going to 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.190
 when you have a collection of cubes 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.380
 each one with his things you fancy 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.489
 comment to someone but you're not going 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.750
 to explain to your family how 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.100
 they are the cubes because it does not have 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.370
 what is interesting to your friends because 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.200
 you're not going to explain 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.720
 All the details you see here 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.470
 I'm going to explain this cube not then you 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.180
 you record and upload it and that person who 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.220
 it interests you so look and see it 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.489
 then that motivates me to continue 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:55.209
 making videos and if nothing like youtube 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.790
 they present you statistics of the 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.069
 videos and there is a ranking of the 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.200
 countries in which they accumulate more 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.760
 reproductions of your videos so I'm going 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.519
 to take advantage to give a greeting to the 7 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.140
 countries with more reproductions of my 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.010
 videos 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:14.549
 in number 7 we have venezuela 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:18.689

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.730
 what I wanted to comment here I am 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.260
 finishing solving the cube I do not know if 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.140
 you have noticed but to swap 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.350
 two edges I'm doing the algorithm 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.870
 to flip an edge six times together 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.930
 with the algorithm of permuting two edges 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.610
 good a super long algorithm and but 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.930
 good that works is the one that found 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.370
 What can we do 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.110
 well nothing the video ends here I hope that 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.410
 you liked it and once again thanks to
