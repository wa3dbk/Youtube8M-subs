00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
Chris Voigt we knew it would be critical

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.070 
Chris Voigt we knew it would be critical
to<00:00:26.279> start<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.640> season<00:00:26.820> well<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.359> Tiger<00:00:27.930> those

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
to start the season well and Tiger those

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.930 
to start the season well and Tiger those
three<00:00:28.410> away<00:00:28.619> games<00:00:28.920> up<00:00:29.189> front<00:00:31.340> we<00:00:32.340> really<00:00:32.669> just

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
three away games up front we really just

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.850 
three away games up front we really just
focused<00:00:33.510> on<00:00:33.660> basics<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:36.710> accepted<00:00:37.710> their

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
focused on basics I accepted their

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.530 
focused on basics I accepted their
defense<00:00:38.340> because<00:00:38.730> we<00:00:38.820> knew<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.239> tech<00:00:39.510> and

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
defense because we knew the tech and

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.210 
defense because we knew the tech and
clear<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.110> side<00:00:40.350> would<00:00:40.559> be<00:00:40.739> enough

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.690 

I<00:00:47.200> guess<00:00:48.200> a<00:00:48.230> moment<00:00:48.740> that<00:00:48.950> was<00:00:49.100> critical<00:00:49.340> their

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
I guess a moment that was critical their

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.700 
I guess a moment that was critical their
season<00:00:50.150> was<00:00:50.330> the<00:00:50.540> New<00:00:50.870> Plymouth<00:00:51.170> game<00:00:51.410> against

the<00:00:51.830> Chiefs<00:00:52.130> I<00:00:53.290> was<00:00:54.290> almost<00:00:54.560> like<00:00:54.800> a<00:00:54.830> nothing

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
the Chiefs I was almost like a nothing
