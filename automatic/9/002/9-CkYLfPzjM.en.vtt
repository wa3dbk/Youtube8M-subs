 hello good today we are going to see you a system to export a profile 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:20.859
 from one team to another 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:22.560
 and so percent 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.310
 well, power 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.609
 foxconn jar 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.720
 a team yet to revoke existing wireless 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.620
 without having to enter the hand the passwords data platforms 7 70 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.120
 the system that the second semester 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.480
 it was basically based on creating a file 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.450
 with the existing network configuration 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.520
 where you store we see the other passwords 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.250
 we will keep on an ipom tendal 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.020
 removable device 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.650
 can once we have that file stored 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.720
 what we do this 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.250
 good to begin 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.250
 he will have it alpha to the team that we want will start the queen the mica 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.390
 and when executing said file 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.000
 directly that computer will be configured to be able to connect to the internet without 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.300
 have to take any step would be 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.300
 percent this is done in a very simple way 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.040
 in windows 7 we enter the control panel 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.080
 we do not direct to networks and the internet 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.220
 once inside here what are we going to do this 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.600
 lacks sense of state and 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.560
 and shared resources 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.300
 a moment stick as you see 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.300
 We have here to manage wireless networks 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.340
 we press inside 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.270
 and we see that we have a configuration 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.270
 in particular angel that mania of house 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.750
 we click on it 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.890
 Double click 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.310
 as you can see here we have linked what would be the data of the 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.040
 security settings type of the key to use 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.369
 Well, without connection what we will do is to look 

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:10.669
 this link 

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:14.199
 copy this profile in a flavus unit l 

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:18.749
 we press on him and as the x the fmi and the eu has been followed he fled with high 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:21.150
 once 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.540
 gem introduced the central within him of the team 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:27.919
 click on next 

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:28.819
 do not 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.780
 does not warn that the government is precisely the profile of the searches 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.559
 In the net 

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:36.899
 we can see what it is to be the mother of the artist as 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:39.659
 The fact that he has done is what made him wait 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.659
 in our will have air 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.979
 a file called zeta 

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:47.439
 snk 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:50.479
 this file is execute others result 

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:55.079
 once we have already saved it retires it will keep in and simply by not 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.059
 we should go 

00:02:57.059 --> 00:03:00.849
 to another team that will be the one that we want to start our renÃ© that in 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:02.139
 America 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:03.909
 and that run it 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:07.349
 once it runs excessive 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.519
 well you can wrong that the company the network will be configured though or 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.789
 magically without having to introduce any kind of doubt 

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:20.459
 since this file stores all that configuration that you do not see necessary for 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.249
 connect with the wireless network 

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:25.579
 Well, this may have been everything and I hope that it will serve you
