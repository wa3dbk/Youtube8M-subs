close<00:00:21.390> together<00:00:21.539> I'm<00:00:21.810> not<00:00:21.930> sure<00:00:22.080> when<00:00:22.199> I

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
close together I'm not sure when I

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.349 
close together I'm not sure when I
started<00:00:22.590> actually<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.220> can<00:00:23.340> tell<00:00:23.580> Hey<00:00:24.330> look

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359

started actually you can tell Hey look
at<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:25.400> and<00:00:26.400> so<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.939> he's<00:00:27.330> probably<00:00:27.449> gonna

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
at that and so the he's probably gonna

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.790 
at that and so the he's probably gonna
wait<00:00:27.810> for<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:27.990> speed<00:00:28.230> upgrade<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.590> start

we'll<00:01:27.240> see<00:01:27.390> if<00:01:27.420> he<00:01:27.540> managed<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.080> hold<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.290> off

we'll see if he managed to hold this off
I<00:01:28.590> think<00:01:28.770> he'll<00:01:28.860> be<00:01:28.950> able<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.159> with<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.369> decent

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
I think he'll be able to with a decent

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.770 
I think he'll be able to with a decent
of<00:01:29.790> micromanagement<00:01:30.240> shoving<00:01:30.659> those

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
of micromanagement shoving those

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.660 
of micromanagement shoving those
zerglings<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.290> way<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:32.040> try<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.340> protect

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
zerglings in the way to try to protect

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.999 
zerglings in the way to try to protect
those<00:01:32.790> some<00:01:33.000> colonies<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.930> huge<00:01:34.409> force<00:01:34.829> of

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
those some colonies and a huge force of

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.260 
those some colonies and a huge force of
zerglings<00:01:35.250> coming<00:01:35.610> out<00:01:35.700> across<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.970> middle

zerglings coming out across the middle

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.999 
zerglings coming out across the middle
now<00:01:36.360> looks<00:01:36.840> like<00:01:36.930> instead<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.350> going<00:01:37.650> for<00:01:37.860> blue

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009

be going for a drop try to get out of
his<00:03:29.760> base<00:03:29.910> going<00:03:30.090> to<00:03:30.150> supplement<00:03:30.570> with<00:03:30.900> his

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
his base going to supplement with his

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.420 
his base going to supplement with his
own<00:03:31.170> Dark<00:03:31.380> Templar<00:03:31.530> but<00:03:31.860> really<00:03:32.160> I<00:03:32.190> feel<00:03:32.250> like

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
own Dark Templar but really I feel like

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.590 
own Dark Templar but really I feel like
it's<00:03:32.580> a<00:03:32.640> matter<00:03:32.760> of<00:03:32.850> time<00:03:32.940> two<00:03:33.270> versus<00:03:33.570> one

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
it's a matter of time two versus one

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.420 
it's a matter of time two versus one
it's<00:03:33.870> just<00:03:33.930> so<00:03:34.080> difficult<00:03:34.350> Dark<00:03:35.310> Templar

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
it's just so difficult Dark Templar

actually gathering back up the middle

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.690 
actually gathering back up the middle
I'm<00:03:37.140> surprised<00:03:37.440> by<00:03:37.590> that<00:03:37.710> a<00:03:37.920> huge<00:03:38.460> amount<00:03:38.670> of

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
I'm surprised by that a huge amount of

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.370 
I'm surprised by that a huge amount of
dark<00:03:38.850> templar<00:03:39.180> weapons<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.840> upgrade<00:03:40.200> in<00:03:40.320> the

anything<00:04:01.080> in<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.380> meantime<00:04:01.440> and<00:04:01.860> there's<00:04:02.310> it

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
anything in the meantime and there's it

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.680 
anything in the meantime and there's it
my<00:04:02.790> guess<00:04:02.940> is<00:04:03.120> right<00:04:03.360> now<00:04:03.510> they're<00:04:03.660> just

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
my guess is right now they're just

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.060 
my guess is right now they're just
talking<00:04:03.930> it<00:04:04.230> out<00:04:04.320> like<00:04:04.590> how<00:04:04.710> do<00:04:04.770> you<00:04:04.830> want<00:04:04.980> to

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
talking it out like how do you want to

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.890 
talking it out like how do you want to
end<00:04:05.160> this<00:04:05.250> I'll<00:04:05.430> just<00:04:05.580> go<00:04:05.700> layer<00:04:05.910> go<00:04:06.540> massive

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
end this I'll just go layer go massive

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:07.970 
end this I'll just go layer go massive

these zerglings the dark template the

rest of the Dark Templar falling back
zergling<00:04:15.390> is<00:04:15.510> now<00:04:15.600> falling<00:04:15.780> back<00:04:16.049> and<00:04:16.950> that

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
zergling is now falling back and that

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.289 
zergling is now falling back and that
was<00:04:17.250> a<00:04:17.280> little<00:04:17.400> bit<00:04:17.580> of<00:04:17.670> lab<00:04:17.820> soon<00:04:18.000> realized

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
was a little bit of lab soon realized

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.729 
was a little bit of lab soon realized
that<00:04:18.480> I<00:04:18.510> guess<00:04:18.989> they<00:04:19.109> didn't<00:04:19.290> realize<00:04:19.500> didn't

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
that I guess they didn't realize didn't

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.349 
that I guess they didn't realize didn't
have<00:04:19.830> detectors<00:04:20.190> on<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:20.430> field<00:04:20.609> o<00:04:20.790> Lords

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
have detectors on the field o Lords

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.240 
have detectors on the field o Lords
slowly<00:04:21.660> pushing<00:04:22.080> out<00:04:22.200> and<00:04:22.919> that's<00:04:23.010> going<00:04:23.190> to

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
slowly pushing out and that's going to

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.980 
slowly pushing out and that's going to
be<00:04:23.340> hard<00:04:23.430> canon<00:04:24.030> going<00:04:24.210> down<00:04:24.360> so<00:04:24.540> now<00:04:24.690> why<00:04:24.930> it

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
be hard canon going down so now why it

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.420 
be hard canon going down so now why it
is<00:04:25.110> going<00:04:25.290> to<00:04:25.350> be<00:04:25.380> able<00:04:25.500> to<00:04:25.620> get<00:04:25.740> max<00:04:26.040> is<00:04:26.220> going

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
is going to be able to get max is going

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.379 
is going to be able to get max is going
to<00:04:26.490> be<00:04:26.550> able<00:04:26.640> to<00:04:26.760> get

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
secondary probably going to be able to

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.489 
secondary probably going to be able to
defend<00:04:30.360> it<00:04:30.479> with<00:04:30.539> this<00:04:30.659> massive<00:04:30.930> dragoons

00:04:31.489 --> 00:04:31.499 
defend it with this massive dragoons

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:33.170 
defend it with this massive dragoons

to get some observers out because

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:40.879 
to get some observers out because
obviously<00:05:39.839> you<00:05:40.110> can't<00:05:40.259> do<00:05:40.379> anything<00:05:40.409> without

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:40.889 
obviously you can't do anything without

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:42.140 
obviously you can't do anything without
observers<00:05:41.279> with<00:05:41.400> those<00:05:41.520> dark<00:05:41.729> templar<00:05:42.000> yeah

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
observers with those dark templar yeah

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.600 
observers with those dark templar yeah
observatory<00:05:43.050> out<00:05:43.229> without<00:05:43.949> the<00:05:44.129> dark<00:05:44.279> templar

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
observatory out without the dark templar

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:45.889 
observatory out without the dark templar
with<00:05:44.879> these<00:05:45.029> dark<00:05:45.210> cap<00:05:45.330> around<00:05:45.539> the<00:05:45.599> fields<00:05:45.839> is

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:45.899 
with these dark cap around the fields is

00:05:45.899 --> 00:05:47.719 
with these dark cap around the fields is
basically<00:05:46.229> sealed<00:05:46.409> in<00:05:46.620> honestly<00:05:47.009> I<00:05:47.189> would<00:05:47.639> go

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729 
basically sealed in honestly I would go

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:48.950 
basically sealed in honestly I would go
for<00:05:47.759> a<00:05:47.939> shuttle<00:05:48.120> because<00:05:48.300> you<00:05:48.509> need<00:05:48.659> to<00:05:48.689> do

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
for a shuttle because you need to do

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.559 
for a shuttle because you need to do
some<00:05:48.990> sort<00:05:49.409> of<00:05:49.439> economic<00:05:50.279> grass<00:05:50.520> but<00:05:50.849> that

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:51.569 
some sort of economic grass but that

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:52.760 
some sort of economic grass but that
probably<00:05:51.779> wouldn't<00:05:52.050> be<00:05:52.139> successful<00:05:52.560> either

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
probably wouldn't be successful either

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.429 
probably wouldn't be successful either
as<00:05:53.039> you<00:05:53.129> can<00:05:53.250> see<00:05:53.430> and<00:05:54.120> yet<00:05:54.300> another<00:05:54.870> just
