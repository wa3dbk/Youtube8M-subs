 try to accelerate turning and 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.750
 slow down a little more than usual 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.360
 feel the edge of loss of grip on wheels 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.780

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.680
 right and vice versa 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.480
 overdose thrust and lag 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.810
 with trajectory correction will lead to 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.000
 turn the car after 15 20 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.280
 repetitions of this fascinating exercise 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.830
 try shifting the steering to one 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.660
 the other way speed snake on 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.700

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.550
 so your head will form 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.380
 the strongest driving reflexes are about 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.390
 the end of classes when leaving with 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.940
