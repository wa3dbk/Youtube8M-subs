let's<00:00:06.000> see<00:00:06.180> how<00:00:06.330> the<00:00:06.390> jicks

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.000 
let's see how the jicks

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.810 
let's see how the jicks

feature of the 3ds max emitter could

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.000 
feature of the 3ds max emitter could
help<00:00:10.059> us<00:00:10.300> with<00:00:10.600> remembering<00:00:11.380> a<00:00:11.680> high

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.010 
help us with remembering a high

help us with remembering a high
resolution<00:00:12.280> single<00:00:13.180> frame<00:00:13.530> in<00:00:14.530> this<00:00:14.799> case<00:00:15.010> we

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
resolution single frame in this case we

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.330 
resolution single frame in this case we
have<00:00:15.309> a<00:00:15.340> car<00:00:15.610> that<00:00:15.639> was<00:00:16.000> rendered<00:00:16.420> at<00:00:16.740> 8k<00:00:17.740> in

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.340 
have a car that was rendered at 8k in

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.230 
have a car that was rendered at 8k in
v-ray<00:00:18.880> and<00:00:19.980> this<00:00:20.980> is<00:00:21.779> one<00:00:22.779> to<00:00:23.020> one<00:00:23.199> resolution

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
v-ray and this is one to one resolution

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.560 
v-ray and this is one to one resolution
so<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:26.439> whole<00:00:26.619> MH<00:00:26.980> took<00:00:27.279> 38<00:00:27.760> minutes<00:00:28.060> rent<00:00:28.390> in

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
so the whole MH took 38 minutes rent in

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.679 
so the whole MH took 38 minutes rent in
v-ray<00:00:28.779> 3<00:00:29.439> and<00:00:29.740> would<00:00:30.430> take<00:00:30.670> 44<00:00:31.210> minutes<00:00:31.449> in

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689

beer 82.4 on a single machine and even

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.670 
beer 82.4 on a single machine and even
if<00:00:36.790> you<00:00:36.910> would<00:00:37.090> split<00:00:37.449> it<00:00:37.480> in<00:00:37.780> two<00:00:37.809> regions<00:00:38.170> or

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
if you would split it in two regions or

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.950 
if you would split it in two regions or
tiles<00:00:39.399> and<00:00:39.640> send<00:00:39.850> it<00:00:40.059> through<00:00:40.390> the<00:00:40.780> network

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960

for<00:00:41.770> multiple<00:00:42.190> machines<00:00:42.550> to<00:00:42.670> render<00:00:43.000> it<00:00:43.120> would

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
for multiple machines to render it would

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.299 
for multiple machines to render it would
be<00:00:43.390> a<00:00:43.420> waste<00:00:43.600> of<00:00:43.809> resources<00:00:43.870> if<00:00:44.710> only<00:00:44.950> small

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:57.060 
using the single frame multi-region
rendering<00:00:52.829> we<00:00:53.829> could<00:00:54.840> delete<00:00:55.840> these<00:00:56.110> regions

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
rendering we could delete these regions

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.189 
rendering we could delete these regions
and<00:00:57.309> create<00:00:57.940> regions<00:00:58.449> on<00:00:58.600> before<00:00:59.020> the

rendering<00:01:02.590> let's<00:01:03.160> say<00:01:03.399> that<00:01:03.430> our<00:01:03.850> customer<00:01:04.479> is

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
rendering let's say that our customer is

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.690 
rendering let's say that our customer is
happy<00:01:04.930> with<00:01:05.289> the<00:01:05.500> look<00:01:05.860> of<00:01:06.160> the<00:01:06.310> car<00:01:06.550> in

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
happy with the look of the car in

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.150 
happy with the look of the car in
general<00:01:07.149> but<00:01:07.630> he<00:01:07.869> wants<00:01:08.289> the<00:01:08.470> mirrors<00:01:08.860> and<00:01:08.890> the

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
general but he wants the mirrors and the

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.330 
general but he wants the mirrors and the
door<00:01:09.520> handles<00:01:09.970> to<00:01:10.149> be<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:11.470> plastic<00:01:12.010> to

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
door handles to be in plastic to

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.820 
door handles to be in plastic to
visualize<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.450> lower<00:01:13.600> trim<00:01:13.990> of<00:01:14.200> the<00:01:14.260> honda

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
visualize the lower trim of the honda

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.050 
visualize the lower trim of the honda
cr-v<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:16.600> we<00:01:17.229> could<00:01:17.470> easily<00:01:17.890> select<00:01:18.369> the

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
cr-v so we could easily select the

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.510 
cr-v so we could easily select the
elements<00:01:19.570> that<00:01:19.810> have<00:01:20.650> to<00:01:20.860> change<00:01:21.130> the<00:01:21.159> color

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
elements that have to change the color

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.390 
elements that have to change the color
and<00:01:21.820> go<00:01:22.420> into<00:01:22.659> the<00:01:22.750> sign<00:01:23.020> from<00:01:23.350> the<00:01:23.409> mature

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
and go into the sign from the mature

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.310 
and go into the sign from the mature
editor<00:01:25.710> black<00:01:26.710> plastic<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:28.780> these<00:01:28.960> elements

editor black plastic to these elements

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.160 
editor black plastic to these elements
now<00:01:30.310> obviously<00:01:30.970> all<00:01:31.240> we<00:01:31.360> have<00:01:31.509> to<00:01:31.689> do<00:01:31.900> is

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
now obviously all we have to do is

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.010 
now obviously all we have to do is
create<00:01:32.590> regions<00:01:33.130> around<00:01:33.310> these<00:01:34.020> selected

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
create regions around these selected

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.660 
create regions around these selected
objects<00:01:35.829> use<00:01:36.189> the<00:01:36.520> scene<00:01:37.000> selection<00:01:37.509> and

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
objects use the scene selection and

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.020 
objects use the scene selection and
submit<00:01:39.670> for<00:01:40.299> rent<00:01:40.869> the<00:01:41.020> jobs<00:01:41.369> for<00:01:42.369> only<00:01:42.579> a

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
submit for rent the jobs for only a

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.120 
submit for rent the jobs for only a
small<00:01:43.450> fraction<00:01:43.479> as<00:01:44.170> you<00:01:44.380> can<00:01:44.530> see<00:01:44.710> it's<00:01:44.829> only

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
small fraction as you can see it's only

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.149 
small fraction as you can see it's only
0.4<00:01:46.000> percent<00:01:46.600> of<00:01:47.049> all<00:01:47.259> the<00:01:47.439> pixels<00:01:47.860> of<00:01:48.100> the

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
0.4 percent of all the pixels of the

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.460 
0.4 percent of all the pixels of the
image<00:01:48.310> that<00:01:48.640> have<00:01:48.790> to<00:01:48.939> be<00:01:48.970> rear-ended<00:01:49.470> this

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
image that have to be rear-ended this

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.429 
image that have to be rear-ended this
means<00:01:50.829> that<00:01:50.979> our<00:01:51.369> rent<00:01:51.610> the<00:01:51.729> time<00:01:51.939> will<00:01:52.149> be<00:01:52.570> all

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
means that our rent the time will be all

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.760 
means that our rent the time will be all
so<00:01:53.770> much<00:01:54.250> faster<00:01:54.820> it<00:01:54.970> if<00:01:55.240> we<00:01:55.450> have<00:01:55.869> many

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
so much faster it if we have many

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.910 
so much faster it if we have many
machines<00:01:57.250> on<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.579> network<00:01:57.960> we<00:01:58.960> can<00:01:59.229> get<00:01:59.590> four

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
machines on the network we can get four

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.429 
machines on the network we can get four
machines<00:02:00.250> to<00:02:00.549> work<00:02:00.729> on<00:02:00.970> these<00:02:01.149> regions<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:01.960> so

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
machines to work on these regions and so

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.330 
machines to work on these regions and so
finish<00:02:02.829> even<00:02:02.950> faster<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:05.380> we<00:02:05.409> have<00:02:05.770> to<00:02:05.950> do<00:02:06.130> now

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
finish even faster so we have to do now

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.850 
finish even faster so we have to do now
is<00:02:06.369> hit<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:07.119> submit<00:02:07.509> button<00:02:07.689> with<00:02:08.679> the

backup<00:02:26.030> in<00:02:26.390> a<00:02:26.510> subfolder<00:02:26.930> so<00:02:27.590> I<00:02:27.920> won't<00:02:28.730> lose

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
backup in a subfolder so I won't lose

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.660 
backup in a subfolder so I won't lose
the<00:02:29.209> original<00:02:29.600> rendering<00:02:30.020> but<00:02:30.680> I<00:02:31.130> want<00:02:31.459> to

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
the original rendering but I want to

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.730 
the original rendering but I want to
overwrite<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.569> existing<00:02:32.660> rendering<00:02:33.440> that<00:02:33.620> we

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
overwrite the existing rendering that we

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.920 
overwrite the existing rendering that we
just<00:02:33.950> looked<00:02:34.190> at<00:02:34.430> in<00:02:35.209> order<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:35.630> do<00:02:35.720> this

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
just looked at in order to do this

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.800 
just looked at in order to do this
instead<00:02:36.470> of<00:02:36.530> assembling<00:02:37.190> of<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:37.370> black<00:02:37.819> empty

instead of assembling of a black empty
background<00:02:39.350> we<00:02:40.040> will<00:02:40.220> say<00:02:40.720> compose<00:02:41.720> of<00:02:42.110> a

previous<00:02:42.950> output<00:02:43.400> image<00:02:43.580> this<00:02:44.209> will<00:02:44.420> take<00:02:44.450> the

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
previous output image this will take the

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.699 
previous output image this will take the

drops<00:03:24.739> and<00:03:25.360> the<00:03:26.360> assembly<00:03:27.200> job<00:03:27.410> and<00:03:28.030> so<00:03:29.030> now<00:03:29.299> we

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
drops and the assembly job and so now we

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.350 
drops and the assembly job and so now we
have<00:03:30.110> to<00:03:30.440> wait<00:03:30.470> for<00:03:31.280> the<00:03:31.310> image<00:03:32.120> to<00:03:32.269> be

have to wait for the image to be

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.000 
have to wait for the image to be
processed

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.699 

let's<00:03:35.970> take<00:03:36.239> a<00:03:36.269> look<00:03:36.599> at<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:37.409> deadline

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
let's take a look at the deadline

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.330 
let's take a look at the deadline
monitor<00:03:38.310> I<00:03:39.349> gave<00:03:40.349> it<00:03:40.500> a<00:03:40.590> little<00:03:40.680> bit<00:03:40.950> of<00:03:41.099> time

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
monitor I gave it a little bit of time

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.970 
monitor I gave it a little bit of time
to<00:03:41.670> finish<00:03:42.120> on<00:03:42.510> a<00:03:42.569> single<00:03:43.110> machine<00:03:43.230> and<00:03:43.680> you

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
to finish on a single machine and you

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.250 
to finish on a single machine and you
see<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:44.670> each<00:03:45.000> of<00:03:45.239> the<00:03:45.390> regions<00:03:45.540> took

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
see that each of the regions took

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.580 
see that each of the regions took
approximately<00:03:47.159> 10<00:03:47.340> seconds<00:03:47.819> or<00:03:48.060> less<00:03:48.590> to

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
approximately 10 seconds or less to

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.800 
approximately 10 seconds or less to
finish<00:03:49.920> obviously<00:03:50.579> 3ds<00:03:50.849> max<00:03:51.150> needed<00:03:51.540> about<00:03:51.780> a

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
finish obviously 3ds max needed about a

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.839 
finish obviously 3ds max needed about a
minute<00:03:52.140> to<00:03:52.170> start<00:03:52.769> but<00:03:53.069> then<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.430> individual

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
minute to start but then the individual

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.390 
minute to start but then the individual
tasks<00:03:54.390> of<00:03:54.599> this<00:03:54.870> job<00:03:55.170> were<00:03:55.379> processed<00:03:56.040> really

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
tasks of this job were processed really

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.920 
tasks of this job were processed really
quickly<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:57.090> then<00:03:58.069> the<00:03:59.209> dependent<00:04:00.209> draft<00:04:00.690> our

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
quickly and then the dependent draft our

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.960 
quickly and then the dependent draft our
assembly<00:04:01.409> job<00:04:01.650> took<00:04:01.980> another<00:04:02.250> minute<00:04:02.730> to

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
assembly job took another minute to

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.979 
assembly job took another minute to
assemble<00:04:03.810> those<00:04:04.049> pieces<00:04:04.470> over<00:04:05.099> the

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
assemble those pieces over the

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.479 
assemble those pieces over the
previously<00:04:06.989> rendered<00:04:07.319> image<00:04:07.590> you<00:04:08.190> have<00:04:08.370> to

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
previously rendered image you have to

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.789 
previously rendered image you have to
keep<00:04:08.640> in<00:04:08.790> mind<00:04:09.030> that<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.780> output<00:04:10.769> is

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
keep in mind that the output is

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.420 
keep in mind that the output is
approximately<00:04:11.760> hundred<00:04:12.060> megabytes<00:04:12.540> in<00:04:12.750> size

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
approximately hundred megabytes in size

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.789 
approximately hundred megabytes in size
so<00:04:14.430> reading<00:04:14.760> 100<00:04:15.209> megabytes<00:04:15.690> compositing<00:04:16.680> on

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
so reading 100 megabytes compositing on

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.979 
so reading 100 megabytes compositing on
top<00:04:17.010> and<00:04:17.160> then<00:04:17.280> writing<00:04:17.549> another<00:04:17.989> 100

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.879 
megabyte large open the excel file takes
a<00:04:22.919> little<00:04:23.160> bit<00:04:23.750> let's<00:04:24.750> take<00:04:24.990> a<00:04:25.020> look<00:04:25.320> at<00:04:25.620> the

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
a little bit let's take a look at the

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.790 
a little bit let's take a look at the
actual<00:04:26.580> result<00:04:27.060> will<00:04:27.750> have<00:04:27.930> to<00:04:28.110> close<00:04:28.380> the

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
actual result will have to close the

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.750 
actual result will have to close the
previous<00:04:29.520> image<00:04:30.260> since<00:04:31.260> it<00:04:31.590> has<00:04:31.800> exactly<00:04:32.580> the

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
previous image since it has exactly the

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.120 
previous image since it has exactly the
same<00:04:33.060> file<00:04:33.479> name<00:04:33.510> and<00:04:34.020> otherwise<00:04:34.650> max

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
same file name and otherwise max

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.379 
same file name and otherwise max
wouldn't<00:04:35.400> display<00:04:36.300> the<00:04:36.810> new<00:04:37.710> image<00:04:38.090> you<00:04:39.090> see

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
wouldn't display the new image you see

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:43.100 
wouldn't display the new image you see
that<00:04:39.599> we<00:04:39.810> didn't<00:04:40.460> instruct<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:41.880> submitter<00:04:42.750> to

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
that we didn't instruct the submitter to

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.640 
that we didn't instruct the submitter to
delete<00:04:43.860> the<00:04:44.160> house<00:04:44.639> so<00:04:45.120> we<00:04:45.270> actually<00:04:45.449> have<00:04:45.930> the

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
delete the house so we actually have the

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.240 
delete the house so we actually have the
individual<00:04:47.160> pieces<00:04:47.460> that<00:04:47.820> were<00:04:47.970> rendered<00:04:48.389> and

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
individual pieces that were rendered and

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.879 
individual pieces that were rendered and
we<00:04:50.250> can<00:04:50.630> preview<00:04:51.630> them<00:04:51.840> and<00:04:52.080> this<00:04:52.590> is<00:04:52.770> the

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
we can preview them and this is the

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:54.770 
we can preview them and this is the
final<00:04:53.280> image<00:04:53.370> that<00:04:53.729> was<00:04:53.880> overwritten<00:04:54.419> with

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
final image that was overwritten with

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.060 
final image that was overwritten with
the<00:04:55.260> new<00:04:55.470> composite<00:04:56.400> on<00:04:56.820> top<00:04:57.030> regions<00:04:58.070> this

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
the new composite on top regions this

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:09.100 
the new composite on top regions this
will<00:04:59.250> take<00:04:59.430> a<00:04:59.490> little<00:04:59.760> bit<00:05:00.000> to<00:05:00.210> open<00:05:05.270> okay

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.440 

and<00:05:10.110> then<00:05:10.440> we<00:05:10.620> wait<00:05:10.830> for<00:05:11.190> 3ds<00:05:11.490> max<00:05:11.790> to<00:05:12.030> actually

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
and then we wait for 3ds max to actually

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.750 
and then we wait for 3ds max to actually
load<00:05:12.690> those<00:05:13.430> approximately<00:05:14.430> hundred

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
load those approximately hundred

load those approximately hundred
megabytes<00:05:15.240> of<00:05:15.480> data<00:05:16.040> here<00:05:17.040> is<00:05:17.160> the<00:05:17.340> final

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
megabytes of data here is the final

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.940 
megabytes of data here is the final

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
update you can imagine that any time you

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.530 
update you can imagine that any time you
have<00:05:37.260> a<00:05:37.290> high<00:05:37.770> resolution<00:05:38.130> rendering<00:05:38.880> and<00:05:39.090> you

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
have a high resolution rendering and you

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.770 
have a high resolution rendering and you
have<00:05:39.720> to<00:05:39.900> rerender<00:05:40.230> a<00:05:40.590> few<00:05:41.220> changes<00:05:42.000> here<00:05:42.390> and

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
have to rerender a few changes here and

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.380 
have to rerender a few changes here and
there<00:05:42.870> within<00:05:43.260> the<00:05:43.500> image<00:05:43.590> you<00:05:43.980> could<00:05:44.520> use<00:05:44.850> the

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.390 
there within the image you could use the

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.930 
there within the image you could use the
single<00:05:46.290> frame<00:05:46.590> multi-region<00:05:47.370> jigsaw

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940
