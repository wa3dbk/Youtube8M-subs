00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.439 

everyone<00:00:01.020> my<00:00:01.410> karmani<00:00:01.859> with<00:00:02.100> m3/d<00:00:02.699> i<00:00:02.970> just

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
everyone my karmani with m3/d i just

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:04.550 
everyone my karmani with m3/d i just
wanted<00:00:03.629> to<00:00:03.689> show<00:00:03.899> you<00:00:03.990> something<00:00:04.319> really<00:00:04.440> cool

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
wanted to show you something really cool

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.240 
wanted to show you something really cool
today<00:00:04.980> we<00:00:05.670> got<00:00:05.790> snowed<00:00:06.299> out<00:00:06.980> so<00:00:07.980> you<00:00:08.069> can<00:00:08.220> see

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
today we got snowed out so you can see

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.730 
today we got snowed out so you can see
it's<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.390> pretty<00:00:09.780> cold<00:00:10.020> out<00:00:10.290> there

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
it's a pretty cold out there

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.040 
it's a pretty cold out there
so<00:00:11.280> I<00:00:11.340> thought<00:00:11.490> what<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.730> good<00:00:11.940> day<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.210> show

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.050 
so I thought what a good day to show

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.280 
so I thought what a good day to show
some<00:00:13.680> really<00:00:13.830> cool<00:00:14.600> effects<00:00:15.600> of<00:00:15.840> our<00:00:15.990> blue

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:16.290 
some really cool effects of our blue

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.200 
some really cool effects of our blue
chameleon<00:00:16.860> this<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.550> thermochromic

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
chameleon this is a thermochromic

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.840 
chameleon this is a thermochromic
filament<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:19.050> we<00:00:19.140> made<00:00:19.350> it's<00:00:19.590> got<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.520> filler

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
filament that we made it's got a filler

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.840 
filament that we made it's got a filler
and<00:00:21.150> it's<00:00:21.270> set<00:00:21.480> in<00:00:21.660> PLA<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.440> this<00:00:22.980> one<00:00:23.220> says<00:00:23.700> it

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
and it's set in PLA and this one says it

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.510 
and it's set in PLA and this one says it
changes<00:00:24.300> at<00:00:24.480> 15<00:00:24.900> degrees<00:00:25.230> centigrade<00:00:25.710> it's<00:00:26.400> a

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:26.520 
changes at 15 degrees centigrade it's a

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.540 
changes at 15 degrees centigrade it's a
plus<00:00:26.970> or<00:00:27.090> minus<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.630> couple<00:00:27.660> degrees<00:00:28.220> and<00:00:29.220> we

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
plus or minus a couple degrees and we

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.479 
plus or minus a couple degrees and we
printed<00:00:29.850> this<00:00:30.890> architecture<00:00:31.890> building<00:00:32.279> I

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
printed this architecture building I

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.580 
printed this architecture building I
think<00:00:32.700> it's<00:00:32.850> from<00:00:33.060> the<00:00:33.329> capital<00:00:33.900> in<00:00:34.050> Sim<00:00:34.380> City

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
think it's from the capital in Sim City

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.970 
think it's from the capital in Sim City
and<00:00:35.300> so<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.329> thought<00:00:36.540> what<00:00:36.720> a<00:00:36.750> cool<00:00:36.810> day<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.260> show

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
and so I thought what a cool day to show

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.100 
and so I thought what a cool day to show
you<00:00:38.040> how<00:00:38.310> this<00:00:38.520> stuff<00:00:38.820> reacts<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.690> temperature

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
you how this stuff reacts to temperature

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.650 
you how this stuff reacts to temperature
so<00:00:40.440> we're<00:00:41.370> going<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.610> throw<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.030> out<00:00:42.239> there

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
so we're going to throw that out there

00:00:42.660 --> 00:01:55.649 
so we're going to throw that out there
and<00:00:42.899> see<00:00:43.590> what<00:00:43.739> happens

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.599 

so<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:56.750> thermochromic<00:01:57.140> reacts<00:01:57.710> almost

00:01:58.599 --> 00:01:58.609 
so the thermochromic reacts almost

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:02.440 
so the thermochromic reacts almost
instantly<00:02:00.250> but<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.700> walls<00:02:01.909> are<00:02:02.000> pretty<00:02:02.210> thick

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
instantly but the walls are pretty thick

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.969 
instantly but the walls are pretty thick
so<00:02:02.569> it<00:02:02.659> takes<00:02:02.869> a<00:02:02.990> little<00:02:03.109> time<00:02:03.409> for<00:02:03.890> the

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
so it takes a little time for the

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.410 
so it takes a little time for the
temperature<00:02:04.369> to<00:02:04.460> change<00:02:05.860> and<00:02:07.090> that<00:02:08.090> besides

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
temperature to change and that besides

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.809 
temperature to change and that besides
being<00:02:08.690> cool<00:02:08.929> this<00:02:09.140> is<00:02:09.340> kind<00:02:10.340> of<00:02:10.369> useful<00:02:10.549> if

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
being cool this is kind of useful if

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.160 
being cool this is kind of useful if
you're<00:02:10.940> trying<00:02:10.970> to<00:02:11.209> monitor<00:02:11.569> a<00:02:11.599> temperature

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
you're trying to monitor a temperature

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.690 
you're trying to monitor a temperature
and<00:02:12.410> you<00:02:12.650> just<00:02:12.830> need<00:02:12.950> a<00:02:12.980> real<00:02:13.160> good<00:02:13.370> visual

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
and you just need a real good visual

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.380 
and you just need a real good visual
indicator<00:02:14.209> of<00:02:14.480> it<00:02:15.640> my<00:02:16.640> hands<00:02:16.879> might<00:02:17.120> be<00:02:17.239> too

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
indicator of it my hands might be too

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.160 
indicator of it my hands might be too
cold<00:02:17.629> too<00:02:19.390> it's<00:02:20.390> pretty<00:02:20.569> easy<00:02:20.720> to<00:02:20.870> warm<00:02:21.019> back

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
cold too it's pretty easy to warm back

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.130 
cold too it's pretty easy to warm back
up<00:02:21.670> it's<00:02:22.670> 15<00:02:23.030> centigrade<00:02:23.480> is<00:02:23.599> a<00:02:23.690> pretty<00:02:23.900> cool

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
up it's 15 centigrade is a pretty cool

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:36.130 
up it's 15 centigrade is a pretty cool
temperature<00:02:33.489> all<00:02:34.489> right<00:02:34.640> that's<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.150> wind

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
temperature all right that's the wind

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.039 
temperature all right that's the wind
got<00:02:36.379> a<00:02:37.120> blue<00:02:38.120> on<00:02:38.269> the<00:02:38.329> side<00:02:38.540> there<00:02:38.660> so<00:02:38.780> that's

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
got a blue on the side there so that's

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.650 
got a blue on the side there so that's
