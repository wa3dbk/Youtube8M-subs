00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
either my opinion goes to routers or the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.119 
either my opinion goes to routers or the
Clippers<00:02:08.149> and<00:02:09.229> then<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.590> way<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:10.739> put<00:02:10.979> the

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
Clippers and then the way I put the

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.920 
Clippers and then the way I put the
Raptors<00:02:11.849> or<00:02:12.030> ecliptic

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
Raptors or ecliptic

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.160 
Raptors or ecliptic
purrs<00:02:13.140> is<00:02:13.349> because<00:02:13.739> he<00:02:14.430> does<00:02:14.700> like<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.930> point

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
purrs is because he does like the point

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.780 
purrs is because he does like the point
come<00:02:16.319> from<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.590> rafters<00:02:16.829> and<00:02:17.310> he<00:02:17.489> was<00:02:17.609> like

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
come from the rafters and he was like

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.250 
come from the rafters and he was like
you<00:02:18.000> know<00:02:18.090> saying<00:02:18.329> how<00:02:18.450> good<00:02:18.689> years<00:02:18.959> and<00:02:19.109> stuff

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
you know saying how good years and stuff

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.069 
you know saying how good years and stuff
it<00:02:19.680> has<00:02:19.829> his<00:02:20.010> hometown<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.640> we're<00:02:20.790> not<00:02:20.969> so<00:02:21.180> if

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
it has his hometown and we're not so if

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.990 
it has his hometown and we're not so if
he<00:02:22.230> goes<00:02:22.409> to<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.620> Clippers<00:02:23.489> it<00:02:23.730> would<00:02:23.849> be<00:02:23.969> a

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
he goes to the Clippers it would be a

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.509 
he goes to the Clippers it would be a
three-way<00:02:24.659> deal<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:25.230> think<00:02:25.560> Blake<00:02:26.040> Griffin

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
three-way deal I think Blake Griffin

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.959 
three-way deal I think Blake Griffin
heading<00:02:26.849> to<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.150> balls<00:02:27.560> to<00:02:28.560> play<00:02:28.799> a<00:02:28.969> center

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:29.969 
heading to the balls to play a center

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:31.429 
heading to the balls to play a center
and<00:02:30.180> know<00:02:30.299> what<00:02:30.420> will<00:02:30.629> go<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.989> Clippers

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439 
and know what will go to the Clippers

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:32.809 
and know what will go to the Clippers
because<00:02:31.799> you<00:02:32.010> know<00:02:32.099> they<00:02:32.219> always<00:02:32.340> complaining

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
because you know they always complaining

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.899 
because you know they always complaining
that<00:02:33.650> Blake<00:02:34.650> Griffin<00:02:35.069> and<00:02:35.189> Dianna<00:02:35.459> Jordans

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
that Blake Griffin and Dianna Jordans

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:39.319 
that Blake Griffin and Dianna Jordans
are<00:02:36.030> just<00:02:36.510> like<00:02:37.609> dunkers<00:02:38.609> and<00:02:38.639> they<00:02:39.030> can't

are just like dunkers and they can't

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:40.910 
are just like dunkers and they can't
play<00:02:39.510> postman<00:02:39.959> so<00:02:40.139> they<00:02:40.319> need<00:02:40.500> somebody<00:02:40.829> like

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:46.439 
and then a lot of people are saying that

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:48.470 
and then a lot of people are saying that
Kyrie<00:02:47.099> Irving<00:02:47.519> wants<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:47.879> play<00:02:48.000> with<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.209> prompt

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
but I don't really believe that I think

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.039 
but I don't really believe that I think
the<00:02:50.489> trade<00:02:51.030> is<00:02:51.180> going<00:02:51.329> to<00:02:51.419> be<00:02:51.540> once<00:02:51.870> this

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
the trade is going to be once this

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.140 
the trade is going to be once this
happens<00:02:52.349> it's<00:02:52.859> going<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.099> be<00:02:53.220> covering<00:02:53.909> goes

to this the cleat of the LA Clippers and

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.909 
to this the cleat of the LA Clippers and
that's<00:02:57.450> going<00:02:57.659> to<00:02:57.750> be<00:02:57.870> a<00:02:57.900> much<00:02:58.290> better<00:02:58.349> teams

00:02:58.909 --> 00:02:58.919 
that's going to be a much better teams

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:00.979 
that's going to be a much better teams
everybody<00:02:59.489> knows<00:02:59.669> that<00:02:59.700> the<00:03:00.120> past<00:03:00.599> couple<00:03:00.840> of

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
everybody knows that the past couple of

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.809 
everybody knows that the past couple of
games<00:03:01.049> the<00:03:01.709> Clippers<00:03:02.040> have<00:03:02.099> been<00:03:02.459> scoring<00:03:02.790> a

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
games the Clippers have been scoring a

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.059 
games the Clippers have been scoring a
lot<00:03:02.849> more<00:03:03.150> without<00:03:03.389> Chris<00:03:03.840> Paul<00:03:04.079> no<00:03:04.620> doubt<00:03:04.889> is

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
lot more without Chris Paul no doubt is

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.140 
lot more without Chris Paul no doubt is
one<00:03:05.250> of<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.400> greatest<00:03:05.579> point<00:03:05.819> guard<00:03:06.090> but

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
one of the greatest point guard but

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.990 
one of the greatest point guard but
sometimes<00:03:06.750> you<00:03:06.900> just<00:03:06.959> don't<00:03:07.200> fit<00:03:07.530> in<00:03:07.799> that

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
sometimes you just don't fit in that

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.280 
sometimes you just don't fit in that
strategy<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.359> they<00:03:09.599> haven't<00:03:09.930> been<00:03:10.079> the<00:03:10.260> best

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
strategy and they haven't been the best

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.440 
strategy and they haven't been the best
team<00:03:10.590> even<00:03:11.219> with<00:03:11.400> Doc<00:03:11.609> Rivers<00:03:11.790> answer<00:03:12.209> coach

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
team even with Doc Rivers answer coach

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.500 
team even with Doc Rivers answer coach
so<00:03:13.049> then<00:03:13.349> for<00:03:13.799> the<00:03:13.889> Rockets<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:14.609> have<00:03:14.790> 0<00:03:15.060> Maha

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
so then for the Rockets you have 0 Maha

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.729 
so then for the Rockets you have 0 Maha
Zeke<00:03:15.900> it<00:03:16.620> will<00:03:16.739> be<00:03:16.859> treated<00:03:17.129> to<00:03:17.250> New<00:03:17.669> Orleans

Zeke it will be treated to New Orleans

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.689 
Zeke it will be treated to New Orleans

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
course the Pistons Josh Smith who should

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.780 
course the Pistons Josh Smith who should
have<00:03:24.419> signed<00:03:25.079> with<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.379> rockets<00:03:25.859> and<00:03:26.069> then

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
have signed with the rockets and then

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.309 
have signed with the rockets and then
he's<00:03:27.150> going<00:03:27.419> to<00:03:27.599> sign<00:03:27.750> with<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:27.959> Rockets

anywhere<00:03:30.269> with<00:03:30.329> the<00:03:30.479> Pistons<00:03:30.930> then<00:03:31.109> you<00:03:31.530> have
