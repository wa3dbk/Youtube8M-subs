well another plus point of this 1.6
liter<00:05:11.790> motor<00:05:11.970> is<00:05:12.090> the<00:05:12.150> fact<00:05:12.420> that's<00:05:12.570> a<00:05:12.690> very

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
liter motor is the fact that's a very

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.560 
liter motor is the fact that's a very
refined<00:05:13.260> very<00:05:13.710> quiet<00:05:14.070> motor<00:05:14.340> and<00:05:14.640> even<00:05:15.480> when

refined very quiet motor and even when
you<00:05:15.660> rev<00:05:15.810> it<00:05:15.930> hard

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
you rev it hard

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.560 
you rev it hard
it<00:05:16.500> remains<00:05:16.830> largely<00:05:17.430> quiet<00:05:17.880> inside<00:05:18.390> the

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
it remains largely quiet inside the

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.480 
it remains largely quiet inside the
cabin<00:05:18.840> making<00:05:18.990> this<00:05:19.530> car<00:05:19.770> one<00:05:20.190> of<00:05:20.220> the<00:05:20.310> better

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
cabin making this car one of the better

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.820 
cabin making this car one of the better
cars<00:05:20.730> for<00:05:21.180> those<00:05:21.300> long<00:05:21.480> distant<00:05:21.990> trips<00:05:22.200> well<00:05:22.800> a

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
cars for those long distant trips well a

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.010 
cars for those long distant trips well a
good<00:05:23.070> point<00:05:23.250> about<00:05:23.400> the<00:05:23.600> 1.6<00:05:24.600> liter<00:05:24.870> diesel

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
good point about the 1.6 liter diesel

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.650 
good point about the 1.6 liter diesel
engine<00:05:25.230> is<00:05:25.500> the<00:05:25.620> fact<00:05:25.860> that<00:05:25.920> it<00:05:26.070> comes<00:05:26.280> with<00:05:26.400> a

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
engine is the fact that it comes with a

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.150 
engine is the fact that it comes with a
six-speed<00:05:27.660> manual<00:05:27.690> gearbox<00:05:28.110> but<00:05:28.830> what<00:05:28.980> that

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
six-speed manual gearbox but what that

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.130 
six-speed manual gearbox but what that
extra<00:05:29.610> gear<00:05:29.790> does<00:05:30.060> is<00:05:30.300> gives<00:05:30.660> the<00:05:30.810> engine<00:05:31.080> a

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
extra gear does is gives the engine a

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.050 
extra gear does is gives the engine a
lot<00:05:31.230> of<00:05:31.350> flexibility<00:05:31.980> so<00:05:32.490> if<00:05:32.550> you<00:05:32.640> are<00:05:32.730> someone

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
lot of flexibility so if you are someone

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.060 
lot of flexibility so if you are someone
who<00:05:33.090> uses<00:05:33.330> the<00:05:33.750> your<00:05:34.290> car<00:05:34.470> only<00:05:34.620> high<00:05:34.800> very

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
who uses the your car only high very

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.970 
who uses the your car only high very
often<00:05:35.430> then<00:05:35.610> this<00:05:35.880> engine<00:05:36.330> will<00:05:36.900> deliver<00:05:37.230> very

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
often then this engine will deliver very

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.230 
often then this engine will deliver very
good<00:05:38.160> fuel<00:05:38.340> efficient<00:05:38.580> figures<00:05:38.880> all<00:05:39.000> you<00:05:39.120> to

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
good fuel efficient figures all you to

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.390 
good fuel efficient figures all you to
do<00:05:39.360> is<00:05:39.510> just<00:05:39.780> put<00:05:40.170> this<00:05:40.350> gear<00:05:40.560> in<00:05:40.680> 6pk<00:05:41.040> and<00:05:41.220> sit

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
do is just put this gear in 6pk and sit

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.130 
do is just put this gear in 6pk and sit
on<00:05:41.610> that<00:05:41.760> accelerator<00:05:42.150> pedal<00:05:42.480> and<00:05:42.630> you<00:05:43.020> will

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
on that accelerator pedal and you will

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.210 
on that accelerator pedal and you will
get<00:05:43.260> a<00:05:43.290> fuel<00:05:43.560> efficiency<00:05:43.830> figure<00:05:44.100> of

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
get a fuel efficiency figure of

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.000 
get a fuel efficiency figure of
something<00:05:44.550> around<00:05:44.790> 20<00:05:45.240> 2.7<00:05:46.050> kpl<00:05:46.710> from<00:05:46.890> the

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
something around 20 2.7 kpl from the

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.510 
something around 20 2.7 kpl from the
center

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520

well<00:05:47.850> the<00:05:48.000> s-cross<00:05:48.360> feels<00:05:48.810> very<00:05:49.080> similar<00:05:49.380> to

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
well the s-cross feels very similar to

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.350 
well the s-cross feels very similar to
the<00:05:49.740> Swift<00:05:50.010> in<00:05:50.160> terms<00:05:50.400> of<00:05:50.580> driving<00:05:50.820> dynamics

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
the Swift in terms of driving dynamics

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.820 
the Swift in terms of driving dynamics
and<00:05:51.540> what<00:05:51.630> that<00:05:51.810> means<00:05:52.050> is<00:05:52.230> that<00:05:52.260> the<00:05:52.530> stang

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
and what that means is that the stang

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.370 
and what that means is that the stang
wheel<00:05:53.040> is<00:05:53.220> very<00:05:53.250> feel<00:05:53.880> some<00:05:54.150> the<00:05:54.750> gearbox<00:05:55.200> is

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
wheel is very feel some the gearbox is

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.930 
wheel is very feel some the gearbox is
really<00:05:55.650> crisp<00:05:55.919> and<00:05:56.070> the<00:05:56.430> clutch<00:05:56.610> is<00:05:56.730> pretty

really crisp and the clutch is pretty
like<00:05:57.120> to<00:05:57.270> use<00:05:57.450> and<00:05:57.720> that<00:05:58.290> along<00:05:58.530> with<00:05:58.560> that

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
like to use and that along with that
