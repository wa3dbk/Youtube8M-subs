ability to change our course of

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.140 
ability to change our course of
something<00:01:08.250> came<00:01:08.400> up<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.700> figure<00:01:08.940> out<00:01:08.970> and

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.610 

any<00:02:03.020> point<00:02:03.409> you<00:02:03.680> should<00:02:03.710> be<00:02:03.979> able<00:02:04.070> to

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
any point you should be able to

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.240 
any point you should be able to
stop<00:02:05.420> say<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.480> go

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.150 

this<00:02:09.640> does<00:02:10.140> is<00:02:11.140> it<00:02:11.410> allows<00:02:11.440> you<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:11.950> just

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
this does is it allows you to just

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.600 
this does is it allows you to just
maintain<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.730> very<00:02:13.210> good<00:02:13.450> sense<00:02:13.720> of

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
maintain a very good sense of

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.040 
maintain a very good sense of
control<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.390> balance<00:02:15.570> at<00:02:16.020> any<00:02:16.230> time<00:02:16.500> they

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
control and balance at any time they

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.320 
control and balance at any time they
transfer<00:02:18.890> this<00:02:18.980> into<00:02:19.220> a<00:02:19.340> ploy<00:02:19.580> practice<00:02:20.030> or<00:02:20.240> at

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
transfer this into a ploy practice or at

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.840 
transfer this into a ploy practice or at
any<00:02:20.420> time<00:02:20.750> you<00:02:21.590> are<00:02:21.650> only<00:02:21.980> stepping<00:02:22.580> with<00:02:22.700> your

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
any time you are only stepping with your

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.980 
any time you are only stepping with your
boy<00:02:23.090> in<00:02:23.600> this<00:02:23.840> motion<00:02:24.260> so<00:02:24.860> you're<00:02:25.130> spinning

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
boy in this motion so you're spinning

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.990 
boy in this motion so you're spinning
when<00:02:27.170> you<00:02:27.260> put<00:02:27.440> out<00:02:27.560> to<00:02:27.830> take<00:02:28.010> a<00:02:28.040> step<00:02:28.370> but<00:02:28.910> you

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
when you put out to take a step but you

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.860 
when you put out to take a step but you
always<00:02:29.390> do<00:02:29.600> so<00:02:29.840> with<00:02:30.050> no<00:02:30.320> Rita

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
always do so with no Rita

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.770 
always do so with no Rita
we'll<00:02:32.049> make<00:02:32.950> it<00:02:33.010> slow<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:33.790> so<00:02:34.060> do<00:02:34.299> it<00:02:34.420> yourself

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
we'll make it slow and so do it yourself

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.880 
we'll make it slow and so do it yourself
for<00:02:34.930> a<00:02:34.959> while<00:02:34.989> it's<00:02:35.260> easier<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:35.620> an

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
for a while it's easier and an

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.229 
for a while it's easier and an
experiment<00:02:36.459> we're<00:02:36.549> doing<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.819> fastest

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
experiment we're doing the fastest

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.900 
experiment we're doing the fastest
single<00:02:37.540> changes
