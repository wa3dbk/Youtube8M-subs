alright<00:00:01.140> this<00:00:01.290> playlist<00:00:01.680> is<00:00:02.040> on<00:00:02.190> wave<00:00:02.490> optics

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
alright this playlist is on wave optics

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.630 
alright this playlist is on wave optics
and<00:00:03.270> diffraction<00:00:03.870> patterns<00:00:04.440> now<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.279> study

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
and diffraction patterns now the study

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.200 
and diffraction patterns now the study
of<00:00:05.700> light<00:00:06.029> is<00:00:06.240> called<00:00:06.450> optics<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:08.030> light<00:00:09.030> is

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
of light is called optics and light is

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.820 
of light is called optics and light is
one<00:00:09.360> of<00:00:09.420> those<00:00:09.510> higher<00:00:09.780> things<00:00:10.050> to<00:00:10.230> model<00:00:10.559> so

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
one of those higher things to model so

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.339 
one of those higher things to model so
what<00:00:11.010> we<00:00:11.130> do<00:00:11.309> is<00:00:11.340> we<00:00:11.700> have<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.480> few<00:00:12.780> models<00:00:13.139> which

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
what we do is we have a few models which

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.910 
what we do is we have a few models which
you<00:00:13.500> use<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:13.920> understand<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:15.120> light<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:16.440> have<00:00:16.890> a

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
you use to understand the light I have a

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.029 
you use to understand the light I have a
playlist<00:00:17.190> on<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.490> rabo<00:00:18.240> de<00:00:18.300> la<00:00:18.500> chas<00:00:19.500> we<00:00:19.680> model

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
playlist on the rabo de la chas we model

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.090 
playlist on the rabo de la chas we model
light<00:00:20.330> by<00:00:21.330> thinking<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.689> as<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:22.199> rails<00:00:22.769> like<00:00:23.070> a

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
light by thinking of as a rails like a

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.150 
light by thinking of as a rails like a
beam<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.670> photons<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:24.769> which<00:00:25.769> travel

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
beam of photons and which travel

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.560 
beam of photons and which travel
basically<00:00:26.519> in<00:00:26.609> straight<00:00:26.910> lines<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.390> know<00:00:27.420> if

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
basically in straight lines you know if

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.599 
basically in straight lines you know if
you<00:00:27.660> think<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.170> ray<00:00:28.410> as<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.800> know<00:00:28.949> something

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
you think of a ray as you know something

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:30.830 
you think of a ray as you know something
like<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.150> travels<00:00:30.420> in<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.539> straight<00:00:30.599> line

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
like this is travels in a straight line

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.260 
like this is travels in a straight line
and<00:00:31.140> we<00:00:31.199> can<00:00:31.349> model<00:00:31.619> different<00:00:32.399> things<00:00:32.669> like<00:00:33.000> a

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
and we can model different things like a

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.729 
and we can model different things like a
reflection<00:00:34.790> with<00:00:36.079> reflection<00:00:37.850> refraction

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
reflection with reflection refraction

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.750 
reflection with reflection refraction
and<00:00:41.780> understanding<00:00:42.780> things<00:00:42.960> like<00:00:43.110> lenses<00:00:43.760> on

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
and understanding things like lenses on

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.900 
and understanding things like lenses on
like<00:00:45.059> cameras<00:00:45.570> or<00:00:45.809> or<00:00:46.230> things<00:00:46.890> like<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.129> and

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
like cameras or or things like that and

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.490 
like cameras or or things like that and
we<00:00:48.059> for<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.510> we<00:00:48.660> use<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.309> array<00:00:50.309> model<00:00:51.500> but

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
we for that we use the array model but

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.600 
we for that we use the array model but
in<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:52.739> place<00:00:53.010> we're<00:00:53.280> going<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.430> be<00:00:53.520> dealing

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
in this place we're going to be dealing

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.099 
in this place we're going to be dealing
with<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.030> what's<00:00:54.480> called<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.750> wave<00:00:55.050> model

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
with the what's called the wave model

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.619 
with the what's called the wave model
now<00:00:58.109> we<00:00:58.170> use<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.920> wave<00:00:59.250> model<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.910> we<00:01:00.420> think

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
now we use the wave model and we think

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.770 
now we use the wave model and we think
of<00:01:00.719> light<00:01:00.960> as<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.199> wave<00:01:01.879> and<00:01:02.879> we<00:01:03.270> can<00:01:03.449> do<00:01:03.600> that

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
of light as a wave and we can do that

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.920 
of light as a wave and we can do that
because<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.170> will<00:01:04.350> light<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:05.280> an

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
because it will light is an

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:13.640 
because it will light is an
electromagnetic<00:01:06.930> wave<00:01:09.860> that<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:12.229> it<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.439> an

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
electromagnetic wave that is it is an

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.910 
electromagnetic wave that is it is an
oscillation<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.400> electromagnetic<00:01:15.180> field

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
oscillation of the electromagnetic field

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.450 
oscillation of the electromagnetic field
and<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.909> has<00:01:18.090> wave-like<00:01:18.560> properties<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.369> we

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
and so it has wave-like properties so we

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.670 
and so it has wave-like properties so we
can<00:01:20.580> just<00:01:20.670> think<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.119> as<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.330> wave<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:22.439> under

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
can just think of it as a wave is under

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.620 
can just think of it as a wave is under
certain<00:01:22.890> circumstances<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:24.030> behaves<00:01:24.390> just

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
certain circumstances it behaves just

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.539 
certain circumstances it behaves just
like<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.049> wave<00:01:25.350> just<00:01:26.250> like<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.460> water<00:01:27.000> wave<00:01:27.299> would

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
like a wave just like a water wave would

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.850 
like a wave just like a water wave would
would<00:01:29.549> behave<00:01:29.970> or<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.540> sound<00:01:31.320> wave<00:01:31.590> would

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
would behave or a sound wave would

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.480 
would behave or a sound wave would
behave<00:01:32.869> and<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.530> we<00:01:34.680> can<00:01:34.770> just<00:01:34.920> use<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.159> what

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
behave and so we can just use that what

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.190 
behave and so we can just use that what
we've<00:01:35.670> had<00:01:35.909> done<00:01:36.860> for<00:01:37.860> developing<00:01:38.520> waves<00:01:38.820> to

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
we've had done for developing waves to

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.300 
we've had done for developing waves to
basically<00:01:40.200> model<00:01:41.040> what<00:01:41.250> model<00:01:41.700> light<00:01:42.979> so<00:01:43.979> I

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
basically model what model light so I

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.210 
basically model what model light so I
have<00:01:44.399> approved<00:01:44.790> another<00:01:45.119> video<00:01:45.420> which<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:45.750> on

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
have approved another video which is on

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.210 
have approved another video which is on
you<00:01:47.220> know<00:01:47.340> wave<00:01:47.640> mechanics<00:01:48.799> which<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:50.009> just

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
you know wave mechanics which is just

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.340 
you know wave mechanics which is just
developed<00:01:50.790> waves<00:01:51.090> how<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.750> understand<00:01:52.229> and

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
developed waves how to understand and

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.319 
developed waves how to understand and
mathematically<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.189> sort<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.790> intuitively

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
mathematically and sort of intuitively

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.690 
mathematically and sort of intuitively
and<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:55.200> one<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.409> probably<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.890> precursor<00:01:56.430> to

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
and that one is probably a precursor to

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.340 
and that one is probably a precursor to
this<00:01:56.969> playlist<00:01:57.329> just<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.259> could

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
this playlist just so you could

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.380 
this playlist just so you could
understand<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.009> bit<00:01:59.100> more<00:01:59.280> because<00:02:00.030> in<00:02:00.270> that

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
understand it a bit more because in that

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.010 
understand it a bit more because in that
playlist<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.930> goes<00:02:01.079> over<00:02:01.350> things<00:02:01.860> like

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
playlist it goes over things like

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.569 
playlist it goes over things like
interference<00:02:04.020> pattern<00:02:04.350> between<00:02:04.950> two<00:02:05.340> waves

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
interference pattern between two waves

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.109 
interference pattern between two waves
and<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:05.939> goes<00:02:06.119> over<00:02:06.710> just<00:02:07.970> constructive<00:02:08.970> and

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
and it goes over just constructive and

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.760 
and it goes over just constructive and
destructive<00:02:09.289> interferences

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
destructive interferences

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.350 
destructive interferences
and<00:02:10.860> so<00:02:11.460> the<00:02:11.580> conditions<00:02:11.970> are<00:02:12.090> when<00:02:12.240> that

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
and so the conditions are when that

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.910 
and so the conditions are when that
occurs<00:02:12.690> so<00:02:12.960> they're<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.470> kind<00:02:13.680> of<00:02:13.740> things

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
occurs so they're the kind of things

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.160 
occurs so they're the kind of things
you'll<00:02:14.070> need<00:02:14.250> for<00:02:14.490> this<00:02:14.550> playlist<00:02:14.990> but<00:02:15.990> if<00:02:16.080> you

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
you'll need for this playlist but if you

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
of the common behaviors of waves is that

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.760 
of the common behaviors of waves is that
if<00:02:42.420> a<00:02:42.540> wave<00:02:42.750> is<00:02:42.900> passing<00:02:43.290> through<00:02:43.320> a<00:02:43.470> narrow

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
if a wave is passing through a narrow

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.490 
if a wave is passing through a narrow
slit<00:02:44.360> let's<00:02:45.360> say<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:45.660> know<00:02:45.990> something<00:02:46.350> like

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
slit let's say you know something like

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.350 
slit let's say you know something like
this<00:02:48.110> if<00:02:49.110> we<00:02:49.770> have<00:02:49.980> sort<00:02:50.220> of<00:02:50.340> narrow<00:02:50.550> slit<00:02:51.000> here

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
this if we have sort of narrow slit here

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.940 
this if we have sort of narrow slit here
and<00:02:52.790> we<00:02:53.790> have<00:02:53.820> sort<00:02:54.180> of<00:02:54.210> a<00:02:54.270> wavefront<00:02:54.810> which<00:02:55.800> is

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
and we have sort of a wavefront which is

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.580 
and we have sort of a wavefront which is
just<00:02:56.160> standard<00:02:58.850> straight<00:02:59.850> waves<00:03:00.200> each<00:03:01.200> like

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
just standard straight waves each like

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.870 
just standard straight waves each like
you<00:03:01.740> know<00:03:01.860> they'd<00:03:02.070> be<00:03:02.130> like<00:03:02.370> we're<00:03:02.580> one

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
you know they'd be like we're one

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.780 
you know they'd be like we're one

two-dimensional waves which is what

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.340 
two-dimensional waves which is what
we're<00:03:14.370> dealing<00:03:14.580> with<00:03:14.610> here<00:03:14.730> now<00:03:15.060> as<00:03:15.930> they<00:03:16.110> pass

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
we're dealing with here now as they pass

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.020 
we're dealing with here now as they pass
through<00:03:16.380> this<00:03:16.860> narrow<00:03:17.160> slit<00:03:17.610> they're<00:03:17.850> going

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
through this narrow slit they're going

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:25.700 
through this narrow slit they're going
to<00:03:18.120> do<00:03:18.780> something<00:03:18.959> like<00:03:19.110> this

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.320 

that<00:03:26.310> is<00:03:26.430> going<00:03:26.550> to<00:03:26.610> be<00:03:26.760> going<00:03:26.850> to<00:03:26.940> spread

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
that is going to be going to spread

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:33.380 
that is going to be going to spread
outwards<00:03:31.400> now<00:03:32.400> along<00:03:32.550> something<00:03:33.060> like<00:03:33.180> this

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
outwards now along something like this

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.960 
outwards now along something like this
and<00:03:33.710> as<00:03:34.710> I<00:03:34.830> go<00:03:34.980> outwards<00:03:35.370> are<00:03:35.460> going<00:03:35.580> to<00:03:35.640> spread

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
and as I go outwards are going to spread

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.200 
and as I go outwards are going to spread
further<00:03:36.300> and<00:03:36.540> further<00:03:36.690> our<00:03:37.080> words<00:03:38.060> now<00:03:39.060> this

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 
further and further our words now this

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:47.690 
further and further our words now this
behavior<00:03:39.930> is<00:03:40.260> called<00:03:41.100> diffraction

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.030 

and<00:03:48.030> is<00:03:48.390> a<00:03:48.420> very<00:03:48.690> common<00:03:48.989> or<00:03:49.200> behavior<00:03:49.800> for<00:03:49.980> a

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
and is a very common or behavior for a

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.400 
and is a very common or behavior for a
wave<00:03:50.310> so<00:03:50.670> if<00:03:51.450> you<00:03:51.660> see<00:03:51.900> this<00:03:52.019> sort<00:03:52.260> of<00:03:52.290> behavior

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
wave so if you see this sort of behavior

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.309 
wave so if you see this sort of behavior
occurring<00:03:53.310> it's<00:03:54.120> very<00:03:54.390> easy<00:03:54.599> to<00:03:54.750> tell<00:03:55.019> it<00:03:55.230> the

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
occurring it's very easy to tell it the

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.020 
occurring it's very easy to tell it the
thing<00:03:55.560> that<00:03:55.769> which<00:03:56.010> you<00:03:56.160> are<00:03:56.280> dealing<00:03:56.459> with<00:03:56.640> is

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
thing that which you are dealing with is

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.780 
thing that which you are dealing with is
a<00:03:57.060> wave<00:03:57.709> because<00:03:58.709> only<00:03:58.860> waves<00:03:59.250> do<00:03:59.489> this<00:03:59.640> sort

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
a wave because only waves do this sort

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.170 
a wave because only waves do this sort
of<00:03:59.849> diffraction<00:04:00.330> pattern<00:04:01.160> no<00:04:02.160> this<00:04:02.879> is<00:04:03.030> what

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
of diffraction pattern no this is what

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.640 
of diffraction pattern no this is what
occurs<00:04:03.480> sort<00:04:03.750> of<00:04:03.810> in<00:04:03.900> water<00:04:04.170> everything<00:04:04.410> this

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
occurs sort of in water everything this

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.460 
occurs sort of in water everything this
is<00:04:04.709> water<00:04:05.190> waves<00:04:05.489> or<00:04:05.760> wave<00:04:06.630> fronts<00:04:07.110> of<00:04:07.230> water

is water waves or wave fronts of water
they're<00:04:08.160> going<00:04:08.310> to<00:04:08.370> do<00:04:08.519> this<00:04:08.670> sort<00:04:08.849> of<00:04:08.940> thing

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
they're going to do this sort of thing

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.979 
they're going to do this sort of thing
have<00:04:09.840> this<00:04:09.959> sort<00:04:10.170> of<00:04:10.200> behavior<00:04:11.480> same<00:04:12.480> as<00:04:12.690> sound

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
have this sort of behavior same as sound

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:13.910 
have this sort of behavior same as sound
wave<00:04:13.170> is<00:04:13.200> going<00:04:13.410> to<00:04:13.500> have<00:04:13.590> this<00:04:13.680> sort<00:04:13.890> of

wave is going to have this sort of

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.640 
wave is going to have this sort of
behavior<00:04:14.480> and<00:04:15.480> in<00:04:15.660> this<00:04:15.780> case<00:04:16.019> light<00:04:16.380> waves

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.770 
behavior and in this case light waves
going<00:04:16.859> to<00:04:16.919> have<00:04:17.040> this<00:04:17.130> behavior<00:04:17.639> because<00:04:18.630> if

going to have this behavior because if
we<00:04:18.930> have<00:04:19.169> sort<00:04:19.440> of<00:04:19.470> a<00:04:19.910> single<00:04:20.910> slit<00:04:21.299> experiment

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
we have sort of a single slit experiment

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.560 
we have sort of a single slit experiment
in<00:04:23.580> this<00:04:23.669> case<00:04:23.940> you<00:04:24.090> know<00:04:24.210> it<00:04:24.330> might<00:04:24.479> look

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
in this case you know it might look

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.000 
in this case you know it might look
something<00:04:24.750> like<00:04:26.870> like<00:04:27.870> this<00:04:28.080> and<00:04:28.590> you<00:04:28.889> have

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
something like like this and you have

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.170 
something like like this and you have

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.540 
shine some light on the slip sort of
like<00:04:36.780> it's<00:04:36.930> coming<00:04:37.200> this<00:04:37.320> way<00:04:37.380> as<00:04:37.770> waves<00:04:38.250> you

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
like it's coming this way as waves you

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.810 
like it's coming this way as waves you
know<00:04:38.580> it<00:04:38.760> might<00:04:38.880> be<00:04:38.910> like<00:04:39.150> a<00:04:39.180> laser<00:04:39.510> beam<00:04:39.840> or

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
know it might be like a laser beam or

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.060 
know it might be like a laser beam or
some<00:04:41.820> other<00:04:41.970> sort<00:04:42.210> of<00:04:42.300> light<00:04:42.600> source<00:04:44.000> it<00:04:45.000> would

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
some other sort of light source it would

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.379 
some other sort of light source it would
basically<00:04:47.070> spread<00:04:47.639> out<00:04:47.820> as<00:04:48.000> it<00:04:48.180> passes

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
basically spread out as it passes

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.860 
basically spread out as it passes
through<00:04:48.570> the<00:04:48.780> slip<00:04:50.090> so<00:04:51.090> it<00:04:51.240> would<00:04:51.360> behave<00:04:51.660> so

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
through the slip so it would behave so

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.140 
through the slip so it would behave so
the<00:04:51.990> same<00:04:52.260> you<00:04:52.410> know<00:04:52.440> as<00:04:52.650> waves<00:04:53.060> sort<00:04:54.060> of

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
the same you know as waves sort of

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.180 
the same you know as waves sort of
spreading<00:04:54.450> outwards<00:04:54.930> and<00:04:55.110> you'd<00:04:55.770> get<00:04:55.919> sort<00:04:56.160> of

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
spreading outwards and you'd get sort of

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.700 
spreading outwards and you'd get sort of
a<00:04:56.310> diffraction<00:04:56.910> pattern<00:04:57.270> if<00:04:57.780> we<00:04:58.110> had<00:04:58.350> sort<00:04:58.680> of

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
a diffraction pattern if we had sort of

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:04.969 
a diffraction pattern if we had sort of
a<00:05:00.260> screen<00:05:01.260> behind<00:05:01.289> it<00:05:03.680> we<00:05:04.680> would<00:05:04.800> get<00:05:04.919> a

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
a screen behind it we would get a

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:06.500 
a screen behind it we would get a
partner<00:05:05.340> which<00:05:05.520> looks<00:05:05.729> like<00:05:05.820> this<00:05:05.940> where<00:05:06.389> we

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
partner which looks like this where we

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.710 
partner which looks like this where we
have<00:05:06.750> this<00:05:07.650> central<00:05:08.430> maximum<00:05:08.970> here<00:05:09.240> so

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
have this central maximum here so

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.200 
have this central maximum here so
basically<00:05:10.110> a<00:05:10.229> really<00:05:10.560> light<00:05:10.919> spot<00:05:11.880> where<00:05:12.120> the

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
basically a really light spot where the

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.760 
basically a really light spot where the
wave<00:05:12.389> is<00:05:12.570> spread<00:05:12.810> out<00:05:12.840> and<00:05:13.260> then<00:05:13.620> we'd<00:05:13.740> have

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
wave is spread out and then we'd have

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.659 
wave is spread out and then we'd have
sort<00:05:14.160> of<00:05:14.220> secondary<00:05:14.820> maximum<00:05:15.750> here<00:05:16.669> basically

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
sort of secondary maximum here basically

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:19.940 
sort of secondary maximum here basically
these<00:05:17.940> other<00:05:18.180> different<00:05:18.900> sort<00:05:19.410> of<00:05:19.500> light

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
these other different sort of light

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.520 
these other different sort of light
spots<00:05:20.539> where<00:05:21.539> this<00:05:21.660> light<00:05:21.900> rays<00:05:22.080> spread<00:05:22.410> out

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
spots where this light rays spread out

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:28.950 
spots where this light rays spread out
this<00:05:22.680> is<00:05:22.800> our<00:05:22.950> central<00:05:23.340> maxima<00:05:23.520> here<00:05:26.180> oops

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
this is our central maxima here oops

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:35.100 
this is our central maxima here oops
so<00:05:29.530> it's<00:05:29.620> a<00:05:29.710> central<00:05:31.169> maximum<00:05:33.930> and<00:05:34.930> he's

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
so it's a central maximum and he's

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.290 
so it's a central maximum and he's
basically<00:05:35.470> happens<00:05:36.009> because<00:05:36.190> of<00:05:36.400> this<00:05:36.550> sort

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
basically happens because of this sort

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.939 
basically happens because of this sort
of<00:05:37.389> diffraction<00:05:37.900> where<00:05:38.229> the<00:05:38.349> waves<00:05:38.530> spread

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:38.949 
of diffraction where the waves spread

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:40.589 
of diffraction where the waves spread
out<00:05:39.190> as<00:05:39.370> it<00:05:39.550> passes<00:05:39.729> through<00:05:39.970> this<00:05:40.240> double

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:40.599 
out as it passes through this double

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:43.050 
out as it passes through this double
slit<00:05:40.870> and<00:05:41.830> it<00:05:41.979> spreads<00:05:42.280> out<00:05:42.430> and<00:05:42.669> hits<00:05:42.940> the

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
slit and it spreads out and hits the

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.180 
slit and it spreads out and hits the
back<00:05:43.270> of<00:05:43.300> whatever<00:05:44.199> this<00:05:44.349> screen<00:05:44.800> is<00:05:44.979> and

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
back of whatever this screen is and

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.719 
back of whatever this screen is and
causes<00:05:45.880> this<00:05:46.000> maximum<00:05:47.130> central<00:05:48.130> maximum<00:05:48.550> of

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:48.729 
causes this maximum central maximum of

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:52.140 
causes this maximum central maximum of
sort<00:05:49.060> of<00:05:49.120> a<00:05:49.240> high<00:05:49.810> intensity<00:05:50.410> light<00:05:50.970> it<00:05:51.970> also

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
sort of a high intensity light it also

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.059 
sort of a high intensity light it also
has<00:05:52.419> these<00:05:52.539> secondary<00:05:53.050> maximum<00:05:53.380> you<00:05:53.919> know

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:54.069 
has these secondary maximum you know

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:57.600 
has these secondary maximum you know
here<00:05:54.400> and<00:05:54.759> here<00:05:55.710> here<00:05:56.710> and<00:05:56.740> here<00:05:56.889> and<00:05:57.130> also<00:05:57.460> has

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
here and here here and here and also has

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.990

dark<00:05:57.940> spots<00:05:58.270> in<00:05:58.479> between<00:05:58.930> them<00:05:59.759> which<00:06:00.759> where

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
dark spots in between them which where

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.350 
dark spots in between them which where
no<00:06:01.539> light<00:06:01.840> shines<00:06:02.430> and<00:06:03.430> in<00:06:03.669> the<00:06:03.759> next<00:06:03.970> video<00:06:04.180> or

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:05.979 
in this applies we won't understand why

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:07.770 
in this applies we won't understand why
we<00:06:06.160> get<00:06:06.280> these<00:06:06.400> light<00:06:06.729> spots<00:06:07.210> and<00:06:07.419> why<00:06:07.539> we<00:06:07.660> get

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780 
we get these light spots and why we get

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.480 
we get these light spots and why we get
these<00:06:07.870> dark<00:06:08.199> spots<00:06:08.440> and<00:06:08.770> we're<00:06:09.340> going<00:06:09.460> to

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
these dark spots and we're going to

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:10.610 
these dark spots and we're going to
develop<00:06:09.970> a<00:06:10.180> sort<00:06:10.330> of<00:06:10.419> mathematical

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
develop a sort of mathematical

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.719 
develop a sort of mathematical
relationship<00:06:11.620> to<00:06:11.770> sort<00:06:11.919> of<00:06:12.009> predict<00:06:12.430> where

these sort of light spots and dark spots

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.189 
these sort of light spots and dark spots
occur<00:06:14.889> and<00:06:15.099> to<00:06:15.699> understand<00:06:16.210> diffraction<00:06:16.900> of<00:06:17.050> a

occur and to understand diffraction of a
single<00:06:17.560> slit<00:06:17.830> in<00:06:17.949> this<00:06:18.099> case<00:06:18.310> you<00:06:18.460> have<00:06:18.490> your

single slit in this case you have your
single<00:06:19.120> slit<00:06:19.389> or<00:06:20.110> we<00:06:20.320> could<00:06:20.440> have<00:06:20.590> ones<00:06:20.860> that

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:21.009 
single slit or we could have ones that

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:22.770 
single slit or we could have ones that
have<00:06:21.130> double<00:06:21.639> slits<00:06:21.909> and<00:06:22.180> we<00:06:22.240> get<00:06:22.360> the<00:06:22.449> famous

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:22.780 
have double slits and we get the famous

in a double slit experiment which we're

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:26.640 
in a double slit experiment which we're
