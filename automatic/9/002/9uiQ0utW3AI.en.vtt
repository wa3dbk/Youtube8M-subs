00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.260
 about the common depression 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.400
 I want to be here today 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.590
 university hospital here in aachen 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.369
 inform and my contact person is 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.779
 professor frank schneider hello hello 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.400
 what types of depression are there then 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.320
 Actually, Professor Schneider is there 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.029
 a whole series of depression that 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.650
 important is actually the depressive 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.210
 mood of interest loss the 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.439
 drive control these are the ones 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.599
 common ground and then you can 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.710
 of course distinguish between 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.690
 depressions that sometimes appear 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.190
 then are gone or some 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.930
 Depression you come back again 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.910
 I notice you because one that 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.320
 temporary mood low maybe 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.120
 is to be taken seriously 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.350
 there is a good criterion about 14 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.520
 days so if you say that you 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.840
 within two weeks 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.940
 this bad mood these 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.829
 It has overcome depression 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.230
 actually no depression and what 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.690
 Form of therapy, there are therapies 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.530
 Saying are multi med or that 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.059
 means in German 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.770
 one has psychotherapy and 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.879
 pharmacotherapy and you have everything 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.910
 Otherwise, for example, belongs 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.589
 psychoeducation the patients and theirs 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.990
 Members of the profession should be experts for their 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.780
 own illnesses are to such an extent 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.820
 is a fear associated with example with 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.549
 a depression is closely related 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.470
 fear can come as a separate disease 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.009
 That is the most common disease in 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.930
 Germany 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.909
 then fear can be coupled together 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.740
 Both depression as a second disease 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.729
 and fear is of course something quite banal 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.380
 is a normal human 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.000
 feeling something completely independent of 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.860
 every depression can occur 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.229
 But fear is often with depressive ones 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.140
 moodiness coupled in which doctor 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.220
 the fear there as the most common, the 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.570
 most important is that she is 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.159
 just in the context of which the letter one 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.659
 depressive mindset 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.540
 do not withdraw themselves anymore 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.070
 trust others little trust 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.990
 do not even trust people anymore and 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.130
 so on and of course, they are afraid of that 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.259
 they are suffering from illnesses 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.610
 can not get away anymore because of it 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.259
 has a difficult time 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.210
 How can I be afraid in the handle 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.680
 that's actually relative 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.090
 easy if you use the techniques 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.799
 mastered and there are books tree 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.509
 psychotherapy psychosomatics for this 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.640
 it's these subjects we aachen here 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.780
 yes also operate by simply using 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.219
 Talk to the patient with the patient 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.820
 if he wants to speak 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.710
 that one the pharmacotherapy 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.450
 geared accordingly and of course 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.310
 also in the talk therapy with the 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.590
 Patients worked out what are the reasons 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.060
 for his fear and also tries him 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.130
 to provide behavioral rules 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.230
 with him we practice his fear 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.020
 can overcome if I run now 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.640
 I also had to be afraid 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.740
 that I could get a depression 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.050
 no not really so quick is yes 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.040
 what he singular and planes gave it 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.010
 not yet created as man 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.570
 So that's a little something 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.060
 newfangled in the industrial age 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.800
 Of course the flÃ¼ssest flight ans can 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.060
 They also overcome the topic well 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.590
 Depression again more accurate 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.360
 I would like to know as well 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.880
 is there really a burnout? 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.950
 syndrome So basically there is that 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.390
 and I and all listeners know that 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.130
 of course that one is done that 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.510
 maybe you have too much 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.250
 at the workplace in the family 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.320
 but then there is no disease then 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.120
 is not a depression but can be under 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.590
 circumstances a precursor of depression 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.630
 to this extent must be taken seriously and 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.040
 if you have such a feeling then should 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.180
 you go to the family doctor to annoy 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.989
 skin go to the psychiatrist and yourself 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.750
 seek advice 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.760
 Generally, there are also warning signals 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.320
 a depression only the early one 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.120
 Warning signs are actually the ones too 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.590
 main sign of depression just catch 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.450
 The creeping to the catch 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.280
 slowly this is the interest loss 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.739
 like drive malfunctions and the bad ones 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.060
 mood and that is the 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.290
 depression already pronounced 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.700
 of course, suicidality 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.110
 suicidal self 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.549
 thoughts belong to every serious one 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.680
 depression but also so-called 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:32.260
 vegetative sign mainspitz lighter 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.970
 you have libido loss you have others 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.340
 problems and what is quite common 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.549
 concentration attention 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.799
 memory disorders 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:42.100
 how can the environment then help if the 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.510
 family i get these signs 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.950
 would suggest using it first 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.390
 So talk to the patient about it 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.410
 his in a promising patient 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.180
 talk about it with him 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.310
 what is wrong with you you have 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.900
 somehow changed and then maybe 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.489
 also with the patient together with 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.290
 his patient together to a doctor 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.180
 go and get advice on none 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.459
 fall say you get together that will 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.110
 all right well that's stupid sayings 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.610
 that's what the real man is 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.140
 first drive into depression 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.340
 because he can then find more local 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.079
 and still trying to make it 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.280
 and the depression is not just 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.690
 useful but very serious 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.180
 Physical illnesses can then 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.420
 easy 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.130
 no longer the subject of fear in helping it 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.560
 because if I am afraid of anything 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.019
 that generally tackle so hard 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.490
 Violence and I put this fear 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.139
 it depends on whether they are among them 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.580
 suffer if they do not suffer 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.930
 then i would not like this circus 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.610
 but when they say they have done 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.919
 fluckst and want to fly because of that 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.389
 or want to fly anyway because 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.530
 They need it professionally or privately 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.300
 that's interesting then it actually is 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.370
 to overcome an easy they go 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.960
 to a psychotherapist and too 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.410
 a psychiatrist and learn how to do that 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.180
 do 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.259
 this is not witchcraft and then you can 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.770
 she could someday too 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:44.270
 fly 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.039
 but if she has any spider phobia 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.780
 Do you live somewhere in the high-rise 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:49.490
 basically there are no spiders and it 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.539
 it does not bother her then could 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.889
 let it stay so it comes 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:54.070
 Actually, what does it say? 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:56.479
 patient himself what is a goal 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.099
 thank you professor tailor you 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.410
 have helped a lot today 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:02.570
 and I definitely learned that 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:06.530
 fear can also trigger depression 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:09.400
 but no fluss very well that was it 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.400
 from today's visit
