00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.890
 Now we will show how to change 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:15.610
 mirror element two mirror samples 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:18.340
 this waterloo throws but dismounts 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.460
 mirror element without damaging it 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.490
 hard enough even to a man who 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.730
 in this case there is experience we will need 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.670
 here's a screwdriver and it's curved 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:36.039
 the position we derive extremely mirror 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:49.389
 element and you need to pry the latch which 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:57.670
 Now I will take a picture to the mirror 

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:59.499
 see here for the slits that are 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.260
 Here we are in the extreme position 

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:04.750
 scoops element and need to 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:09.870
 try in the reviews at least one two 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:13.390
 Latch lift we should 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:16.060
 recall here it turns ugu here this ear 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.690
 it will be possible to be seen and here it is 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.940
 ear 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:24.940
 a little bit to the right and now it will be due 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:29.740
 after year for connell no 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:32.260
 different in the heated rim 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.630
 mirror element here will be here 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.010
 there will be two additional contacts needed 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.450
 will just remove the connector 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:45.220
 There is nothing complicated about the installation 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:48.030
 too just enough just here 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.150
 we get cups 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:55.760
 and snap can be quite strong 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.760
 not afraid to crush many are afraid of the latch 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:06.800
 the whole replacement is just the same thing 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.800
 only by car
