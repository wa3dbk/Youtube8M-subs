00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.800
 we can see here icloud drive 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.960
 here update for applications 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.090
 can you get the information 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.280
 directly from the icloud the 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.380
 Camera application now shows us 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.130
 the number of days that can be left in 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.039
 a photo that is in the album 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.920
 that is, how much of that photo is missing 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.570
 go and allows the transfer of data from 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.270
 applications between our device 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.490
 connected to icloud or all that can be 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.770
 configure from here this is what 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.320
 I'm showing now this part is 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.759
 new also here below that we can 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.479
 preserve audio and video messages 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:07.170
 automatically you know that by 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.239
 default ios 8 erases those messages 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.970
 here you can activate it so that 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.340
 messages are automatically saved 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.650
 guys how can you see now if you can 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.390
 activate the code by voice but I do not 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.980
 lets do what we are going to receive what 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.650
 I can do here for you to go 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.400
 to look at the microphone here I can give you 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.730
 but it's not working well for me 22 2 2 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.890
 two 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.830
 Martian 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.220
 you can see that it is not working 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.920
 he asks me 222 222 and nothing and also here or 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.390
 be I suppose that is where I do not 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.569
 he has to ask but that's why he does not 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.000
 I like to show the beiras a lot in the 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.610
 ipad because they are not so optimized 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.150
 they are better optimized and work 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.850
 better already for what is the iphone but 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.320
 it's not very good running on the ipad 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.910
 other functions that we have is that 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:03.770
 we can make iphone calls by 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.660
 calls from the iphone by wifi to 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.000
 the users of you specifically mobile 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.340
 we can also activate and deactivate the 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.530
 quick time from the settings here what 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.500
 they have pockets already to finish the 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.420
 last function and the coolest of beira 3 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.970
 is that we can now call by wifi 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.620
 and we can call over the phone 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.080
 here I'll give you a demonstration : 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.060
 I'll call 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.010
 my cousin let's see here if I can 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.200
 do but the problem is that I do not have 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.290
 sign from here from the beige man 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.740
 where I live but here I can go to 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.600
 see and notice what I did calling through 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.480
 of the iphone since you are using the 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.490
 iphone connection to call it and this 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.770
 lady call in I'm on the iphone not 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.150
 we see no change and there it is 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.550
 calling but as I tell them I do not have 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.770
 good phone signal so that's 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:54.400
 one of the new functions that we have 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:57.010
 in the 8 will beira but I do not think it is 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.650
 working of the best but if someone 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.870
 he told me on twitter and here I am 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:06.220
 trying you see what it says calling 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:08.650
 through the iphone and the call goes 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.920
 from here the same as they showed in the 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.959
