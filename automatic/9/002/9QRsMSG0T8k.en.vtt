00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
town used to drive around tango I put

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.090 
town used to drive around tango I put
that<00:00:41.290> one<00:00:41.440> in

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
that one in

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.810 
that one in
I<00:00:42.960> obviously<00:00:44.039> keep<00:00:45.039> up<00:00:45.219> with<00:00:45.579> the<00:00:45.699> technology

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
I obviously keep up with the technology

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.590 
I obviously keep up with the technology
I'm<00:00:46.510> pretty<00:00:47.079> fascinated<00:00:48.010> by<00:00:48.129> it<00:00:48.190> and<00:00:48.460> and<00:00:48.760> it

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
I'm pretty fascinated by it and and it

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.899 
I'm pretty fascinated by it and and it
couldn't<00:00:49.870> resist<00:00:50.260> the<00:00:50.500> opportunity<00:00:50.620> to<00:00:51.399> get

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:51.909 
couldn't resist the opportunity to get

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:54.599 
couldn't resist the opportunity to get
frankly<00:00:52.480> the<00:00:52.570> economics<00:00:53.079> don't<00:00:53.859> work<00:00:54.399> out

00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:54.609 
frankly the economics don't work out

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:56.610 
frankly the economics don't work out
that<00:00:54.879> well<00:00:55.030> for<00:00:55.089> me<00:00:55.359> because<00:00:55.719> we<00:00:56.289> are<00:00:56.440> so

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
that well for me because we are so

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.469 
that well for me because we are so
conservative<00:00:57.010> with<00:00:57.309> our<00:00:57.430> energy<00:00:57.789> use<00:00:57.820> my

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:58.479 
conservative with our energy use my

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:59.910 
conservative with our energy use my
electric<00:00:59.019> bill<00:00:59.110> is<00:00:59.170> only<00:00:59.379> about<00:00:59.530> twenty<00:00:59.799> five

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
electric bill is only about twenty five

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.090 
electric bill is only about twenty five
dollars<00:01:00.250> a<00:01:00.280> month<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:01.449> it's<00:01:02.440> going<00:01:02.620> to<00:01:02.680> be<00:01:02.769> even

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
dollars a month so it's going to be even

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.649 
dollars a month so it's going to be even
with<00:01:03.489> the<00:01:03.610> subsidies<00:01:04.059> it's<00:01:04.299> going<00:01:04.420> to<00:01:04.479> take

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
with the subsidies it's going to take

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.109 
with the subsidies it's going to take
quite<00:01:04.899> a<00:01:04.960> while<00:01:05.049> for<00:01:05.440> me<00:01:05.710> to<00:01:05.830> get<00:01:05.950> payback<00:01:06.610> but

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
quite a while for me to get payback but

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.550 
quite a while for me to get payback but
I<00:01:07.440> for<00:01:08.440> me<00:01:08.590> as<00:01:08.860> a<00:01:08.890> lifelong<00:01:09.610> environmentalist

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
I for me as a lifelong environmentalist

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.749 
I for me as a lifelong environmentalist
knowing<00:01:11.560> that<00:01:11.740> I<00:01:11.860> am<00:01:12.039> putting<00:01:12.340> energy<00:01:12.549> into

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
knowing that I am putting energy into

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.940 
knowing that I am putting energy into
the<00:01:13.180> grid<00:01:13.390> instead<00:01:14.020> of<00:01:14.140> putting<00:01:14.409> pollution

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
the grid instead of putting pollution

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.950 
the grid instead of putting pollution
directly<00:01:15.789> into<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.179> air<00:01:16.300> from<00:01:16.509> some<00:01:16.750> power

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
directly into the air from some power

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.060 
directly into the air from some power
plant<00:01:17.289> is<00:01:17.830> very<00:01:18.190> satisfying

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
plant is very satisfying

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.920 
plant is very satisfying
even<00:01:20.520> though<00:01:20.610> money<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.030> tight<00:01:21.300> right<00:01:21.330> now<00:01:21.540> it

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
even though money is tight right now it

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.690 
even though money is tight right now it
just<00:01:21.960> was<00:01:22.320> an<00:01:22.409> opportunity<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.010> couldn't<00:01:23.340> pass

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
just was an opportunity I couldn't pass

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.940 
just was an opportunity I couldn't pass
up<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.110> these<00:01:25.200> are<00:01:25.260> all<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.560> panels

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
up so this is these are all the panels

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.080 
up so this is these are all the panels
mm-hmm<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:27.540> know<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:28.050> then<00:01:28.700> it<00:01:29.700> shows

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
mm-hmm and you know and then it shows

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.760 
mm-hmm and you know and then it shows
what<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.630> power<00:01:30.810> production<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.470> today's

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
what the power production is today's

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.969 
what the power production is today's
peak<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.340> far<00:01:32.610> 1.1<00:01:33.300> kilowatts<00:01:33.960> today's<00:01:34.560> energy

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
peak so far 1.1 kilowatts today's energy

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.480 
peak so far 1.1 kilowatts today's energy
this<00:01:35.460> month<00:01:35.729> energy<00:01:36.240> lifetime<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.860> yes<00:01:38.280> how

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
this month energy lifetime so yes how

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.930 
this month energy lifetime so yes how
often<00:01:38.790> do<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:38.940> check<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:40.190> some<00:01:41.190> days<00:01:41.369> lots<00:01:41.610> and

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
often do I check it some days lots and

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.760 
often do I check it some days lots and
basic<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.300> me<00:01:42.360> but<00:01:42.840> every<00:01:43.050> day<00:01:43.200> every<00:01:43.530> day<00:01:43.560> you

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
basic to me but every day every day you

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.280 
basic to me but every day every day you
might<00:01:43.979> take<00:01:44.280> days<00:01:44.820> days<00:01:45.479> go<00:01:45.690> by<00:01:45.720> forget<00:01:46.259> about

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
might take days days go by forget about

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.910 
might take days days go by forget about
it<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.950> then<00:01:47.640> oh<00:01:48.420> look<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.530> know<00:01:49.650> sometimes

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
it and then oh look you know sometimes

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.700 
it and then oh look you know sometimes
most<00:01:50.160> cloudy<00:01:50.729> I'll<00:01:51.000> be<00:01:51.119> curious<00:01:51.330> and<00:01:51.869> since<00:01:52.680> I

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
most cloudy I'll be curious and since I

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.590 
most cloudy I'll be curious and since I
was<00:01:52.830> really<00:01:52.979> sunny<00:01:53.220> out<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.759> know<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.210> it

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
was really sunny out you know so it

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.480 
was really sunny out you know so it
comes<00:01:55.080> and<00:01:55.259> goes<00:01:55.320> when<00:01:55.860> mug<00:01:56.479> definitely<00:01:58.490> front

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
comes and goes when mug definitely front
