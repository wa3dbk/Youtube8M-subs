00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
well some of the things that you need to

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.809 
well some of the things that you need to
think<00:02:15.680> about<00:02:15.799> if<00:02:16.129> you're<00:02:16.159> gonna<00:02:16.430> go<00:02:16.579> out<00:02:16.639> and

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
think about if you're gonna go out and

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.280 
think about if you're gonna go out and
buy<00:02:16.969> a<00:02:16.999> press<00:02:17.359> they<00:02:17.569> actually<00:02:17.900> are<00:02:18.019> fairly

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
buy a press they actually are fairly

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.830 
buy a press they actually are fairly
inexpensive<00:02:18.590> this<00:02:19.189> one<00:02:19.370> is<00:02:19.549> a<00:02:19.840> pneumatic

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
plasma cutter is kind of I would

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:09.100 
plasma cutter is kind of I would
classify<00:05:07.310> as<00:05:07.789> a<00:05:07.819> specialized<00:05:08.780> piece<00:05:09.080> of

classify as a specialized piece of

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.020 
classify as a specialized piece of
equipment<00:05:09.349> because<00:05:10.009> it's<00:05:10.190> not<00:05:10.370> absolutely

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
equipment because it's not absolutely

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.870

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
necessary but it boy it sure really

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.430 
necessary but it boy it sure really
speeds<00:05:14.180> up<00:05:14.330> the<00:05:14.419> process<00:05:14.870> when<00:05:15.050> you<00:05:15.169> have<00:05:15.289> to

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
speeds up the process when you have to

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.559 
speeds up the process when you have to

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
compressed air system and you plug it

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.029

into<00:05:20.990> the<00:05:21.139> wall<00:05:21.169> and<00:05:21.440> then<00:05:21.590> you<00:05:21.620> can<00:05:21.800> cut

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 
into the wall and then you can cut

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:23.320 
into the wall and then you can cut

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.830 
for your project a plasma cutter will do
that<00:05:36.770> very<00:05:37.069> very<00:05:37.280> well<00:05:37.400> a<00:05:37.849> plasma<00:05:38.509> cutter<00:05:38.630> can

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
that very very well a plasma cutter can

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.649 
that very very well a plasma cutter can
also<00:05:39.110> sometimes<00:05:40.090> substitute<00:05:41.090> other<00:05:41.300> tools

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:41.659 
also sometimes substitute other tools

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:43.899 
also sometimes substitute other tools
like<00:05:41.810> a<00:05:41.960> shear<00:05:42.349> if<00:05:42.800> you<00:05:42.949> use<00:05:43.130> a<00:05:43.159> guide<00:05:43.520> and<00:05:43.849> you

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:43.909 
like a shear if you use a guide and you

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:46.390 
like a shear if you use a guide and you
run<00:05:44.270> the<00:05:44.300> torch<00:05:44.690> right<00:05:45.169> along<00:05:45.500> the<00:05:45.680> guide<00:05:45.919> you

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
run the torch right along the guide you

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.059 
run the torch right along the guide you
can<00:05:46.580> cut<00:05:47.389> sheet<00:05:47.990> metal<00:05:48.289> very<00:05:48.529> very<00:05:48.800> quickly

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:49.069 
can cut sheet metal very very quickly

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:52.629 
can cut sheet metal very very quickly
with<00:05:49.340> almost<00:05:49.759> no<00:05:50.060> warpage<00:05:50.509> at<00:05:50.690> all<00:05:50.949> and<00:05:51.949> have

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 
with almost no warpage at all and have

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:54.129 
with almost no warpage at all and have
it<00:05:52.789> be<00:05:52.909> almost<00:05:53.360> as<00:05:53.479> good<00:05:53.599> an<00:05:53.750> edge<00:05:53.900> as<00:05:54.110> a

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:54.139 
it be almost as good an edge as a

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:56.680 
it be almost as good an edge as a
sheared<00:05:54.500> piece<00:05:54.740> of<00:05:54.889> sheet<00:05:55.069> metal<00:05:55.419> most<00:05:56.419> of<00:05:56.630> the

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
sheared piece of sheet metal most of the

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.230 
sheared piece of sheet metal most of the
time<00:05:56.870> plasma<00:05:57.409> we<00:05:57.830> use<00:05:58.039> it<00:05:58.250> to<00:05:58.430> cut<00:05:58.729> off<00:05:58.849> rusty

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
time plasma we use it to cut off rusty

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.709 
time plasma we use it to cut off rusty
bolts<00:06:00.430> shear<00:06:01.430> sheet<00:06:01.759> metal<00:06:02.090> with<00:06:02.270> it

00:06:02.709 --> 00:06:02.719 
bolts shear sheet metal with it

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:06.040 
bolts shear sheet metal with it
and<00:06:03.099> cut<00:06:04.099> out<00:06:04.250> rusty<00:06:04.699> sheet<00:06:05.300> metal<00:06:05.569> because<00:06:05.900> of

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
and cut out rusty sheet metal because of

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.889 
and cut out rusty sheet metal because of
the<00:06:06.139> speed<00:06:06.409> that<00:06:06.560> it<00:06:06.710> has
