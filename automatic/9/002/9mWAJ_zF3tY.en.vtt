every<00:01:55.680> color<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.100> could<00:01:56.280> think<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.790> plus<00:01:57.450> a

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
every color you could think of plus a

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.899 
every color you could think of plus a
special<00:01:57.990> series<00:01:58.770> which<00:01:59.369> is<00:01:59.640> a

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
special series which is a

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.810 
special series which is a
glow-in-the-dark<00:02:00.299> form<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:02.040> it's<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.759> looks

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
glow-in-the-dark form so it's it looks

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.660 
glow-in-the-dark form so it's it looks
about<00:02:03.240> white<00:02:03.540> or<00:02:03.810> clearish<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.680> if<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.460> hold

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
about white or clearish and if you hold

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.150 
about white or clearish and if you hold
it<00:02:05.790> in<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.030> light<00:02:06.259> then<00:02:07.259> when<00:02:07.799> it's<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.069> the

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
it in the light then when it's in the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.999 
it in the light then when it's in the
dark<00:02:08.280> it'll<00:02:08.700> glow<00:02:09.259> so<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.500> will<00:02:10.619> add<00:02:10.770> this

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
dark it'll glow so it will add this

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.450 
dark it'll glow so it will add this
glowing<00:02:11.280> effect

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
glowing effect

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:20.000 
glowing effect
so<00:02:14.510> this<00:02:15.510> case<00:02:16.230> was<00:02:16.680> about<00:02:17.180> 12<00:02:18.180> 99<00:02:18.600> or<00:02:19.080> 1499

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
so this case was about 12 99 or 1499

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.940 
so this case was about 12 99 or 1499
depending<00:02:20.610> on<00:02:20.700> where<00:02:20.820> you<00:02:20.970> get<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.950> the

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
depending on where you get it and the

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.240 
depending on where you get it and the
glow<00:02:23.160> in<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.340> dark<00:02:23.610> one<00:02:23.880> is<00:02:24.120> actually<00:02:25.250> 1799

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
glow in the dark one is actually 1799

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.820 
glow in the dark one is actually 1799
it's<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.670> little<00:02:26.910> bit<00:02:27.060> more<00:02:27.270> now<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.709> only

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
it's a little bit more now the only

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.970 
it's a little bit more now the only
problem<00:02:28.920> I've<00:02:29.430> had<00:02:29.459> with<00:02:29.760> this<00:02:29.940> case<00:02:30.270> um<00:02:30.980> it

problem I've had with this case um it
seems<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.520> get<00:02:32.610> stuck<00:02:32.940> in<00:02:33.060> your<00:02:33.090> pocket<00:02:33.600> but

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
seems to get stuck in your pocket but

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.780 
seems to get stuck in your pocket but
that's<00:02:33.990> just<00:02:34.170> because<00:02:34.380> it's<00:02:34.709> silicone<00:02:34.950> it

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
that's just because it's silicone it

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.580 
that's just because it's silicone it
picks<00:02:36.150> up<00:02:36.300> dust<00:02:36.570> a<00:02:36.690> little<00:02:36.720> easier<00:02:37.290> than

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
picks up dust a little easier than

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.949 
picks up dust a little easier than
something<00:02:37.950> like<00:02:38.340> this<00:02:38.940> Griffin<00:02:39.330> hard<00:02:39.720> shell

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
something like this Griffin hard shell

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.600 
something like this Griffin hard shell
case<00:02:39.990> wood<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:41.840> it<00:02:42.840> also<00:02:43.080> when<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:43.860> if<00:02:44.220> you're

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
case wood and it also when you if you're

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.449 
case wood and it also when you if you're
adjusting<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:45.900> or<00:02:46.140> moving<00:02:46.440> it<00:02:46.530> around<00:02:46.620> here<00:02:47.100> it

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
adjusting it or moving it around here it

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.990 
adjusting it or moving it around here it
could<00:02:48.090> tear<00:02:48.510> easily<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:49.530> it's<00:02:50.220> pretty<00:02:50.610> thick

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
could tear easily it it's pretty thick

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.870 
could tear easily it it's pretty thick
like<00:02:51.300> it's<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:52.110> good<00:02:52.320> quality<00:02:52.980> it<00:02:53.400> feels<00:02:53.640> nice

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
like it's a good quality it feels nice

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.530 
like it's a good quality it feels nice
but<00:02:54.270> um<00:02:55.130> right<00:02:56.130> up<00:02:56.340> here<00:02:56.670> I've<00:02:57.000> had<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.270> bit<00:02:57.480> of

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
but um right up here I've had a bit of

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.390 
but um right up here I've had a bit of
trouble<00:02:57.630> if<00:02:58.170> you<00:02:58.380> can<00:02:58.530> see<00:02:58.709> that<00:02:58.890> it's<00:02:59.070> ripped

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
trouble if you can see that it's ripped

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.850 
trouble if you can see that it's ripped
there<00:02:59.700> it<00:03:00.570> didn't<00:03:00.989> go<00:03:01.080> all<00:03:01.320> the<00:03:01.350> way<00:03:01.470> through

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
there it didn't go all the way through

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.380 
there it didn't go all the way through
but<00:03:01.890> I<00:03:02.130> just<00:03:02.220> move<00:03:02.550> this<00:03:02.730> around<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:03.209> bit<00:03:03.360> and

but I just move this around a bit and

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.500 
but I just move this around a bit and
it's<00:03:03.690> whore<00:03:03.930> right<00:03:04.440> there<00:03:04.709> so<00:03:05.580> that's<00:03:06.390> just

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
made a little earlier on my account so I

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.310 
made a little earlier on my account so I
like<00:04:11.549> this<00:04:11.760> kind<00:04:12.030> of<00:04:12.239> stuff<00:04:12.540> better<00:04:12.780> like<00:04:13.140> the

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
like this kind of stuff better like the

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.680 
like this kind of stuff better like the
hard<00:04:13.530> shell<00:04:13.769> cases<00:04:14.340> they<00:04:15.030> don't<00:04:15.180> get<00:04:15.299> stuck<00:04:15.570> in

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
hard shell cases they don't get stuck in

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.380 
hard shell cases they don't get stuck in
your<00:04:15.720> pocket<00:04:16.229> they<00:04:16.470> can't<00:04:16.739> tear<00:04:17.130> they<00:04:18.120> could

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
your pocket they can't tear they could

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.979 
your pocket they can't tear they could
always<00:04:18.660> crack<00:04:19.019> but<00:04:19.380> it's<00:04:19.680> unlikely<00:04:20.330> so<00:04:21.330> this

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
always crack but it's unlikely so this

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.270
