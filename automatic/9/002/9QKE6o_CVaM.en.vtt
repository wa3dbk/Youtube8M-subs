00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.969
 Hi people 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.009
 walking on your favorite bourgeois and 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:25.320
 site make came across an interesting thing 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:26.939
 she looks so rummaged deeper and this 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.949
 it turned out only the tip of the iceberg 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.230
 Online a lot of pictures on this topic 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.390
 forums dedicated to this knickknack video 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.870
 dull phone quality and other crap 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.969
 one but all the videos are not from Russia carefully 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.530
 and google did not discover the truth this is simplified 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.780
 pulsating air model 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.940
 there is no reactive 2 old 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.710
 fuel system not air intakes 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.270
 this engine can work even without 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.100
 diffuser really unstable 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.860
 the only thing to do is 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.500
 cool the fuel at the bottom of the combustion chamber 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.480
 what we need to build to build us 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.320
 need a glass jar 400 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.010
 milliliters with a jar lid of jam and 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.920
 Kiev 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:11.130
 tin can from condensed milk wire 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.939
 alcohol scissors compass moment 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.250
 pliers 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.080
 what we will drill or pierce 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.810
 the hole i have is the dremel you can 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.770
 I usually used to sew a piece of paper 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.009
 pencil actually everything to begin with 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.880
 cap need to make a hole diameter 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.880
 about 12 millimeters 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:37.320
 after that we need to roll the diffuser 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:41.990
 the diffuser is done this way first 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:45.980
 drawing a template the size of the template such 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.830
 the template is drawn with a compass from the middle 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:52.770
 near radius 6 half centimeters 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:55.110
 farther ten and a half after that 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.660
 from the resulting sector we measure 6 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.470
 centimeters 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:06.110
 here and cut off get this 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.110
 detail and apply and on the tin 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.459
 neatly bunin compass 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.220
 and cut out with scissors 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.710
 turn down understand 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.120
 turn down a millimeter from one of 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.120
 other edge in different directions 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.800
 the stronger they turned down the better now 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.800
 form a cone and 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.650
 probably one of the longest operations 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.280
 now we drill from four sides 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.280
 hole 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.720
 one 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:44.070
 do the same thing in the lid special 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:46.140
 Accuracy is not necessary just by eye now with 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.950
 using wire hang our cone 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.950
 under the hole 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:30.780
 we fix something like this 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.780
 now pour our jar of spirit 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:48.340
 u not much about millimeters 5 1 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.520
 shutting down 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.520
 go for the matches 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.790
 general experiment ambiguous 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:27.020
 calculations I did not find a glass jar at 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:28.940
 overheating breaks the main part 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.889
 there are absolutely no constructions 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:35.199
 of practical use but still people 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:35.199
 still do something for this type here as well 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.360
 Some perverts make even such 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.750
 thank you for your attention subscribe 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.240
 like 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.870
 the topic of the next issue is gauss gun up 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.870
 new meetings
