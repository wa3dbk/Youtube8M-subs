hey guys do here and today is just been

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.409 
hey guys do here and today is just been
doing<00:00:02.070> some<00:00:02.220> programming<00:00:02.700> I<00:00:02.939> wanted<00:00:03.179> to<00:00:03.240> show

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
doing some programming I wanted to show

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.070 
doing some programming I wanted to show
you<00:00:03.650> here's<00:00:04.650> my<00:00:04.740> program<00:00:05.100> that<00:00:06.000> I<00:00:06.089> wrote<00:00:06.270> it

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
you here's my program that I wrote it

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.960 
you here's my program that I wrote it
has<00:00:07.379> hard<00:00:07.740> coded<00:00:08.069> maps<00:00:08.280> it's<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.760> beginning

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
has hard coded maps it's the beginning

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.860 
has hard coded maps it's the beginning
of<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.240> game<00:00:09.800> anyway<00:00:10.910> this<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.240> how<00:00:12.840> I

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
of the game anyway this is how I

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.650 
of the game anyway this is how I
originally<00:00:13.200> did<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.769> map<00:00:14.059> and<00:00:15.059> you'll<00:00:15.480> see

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
originally did the map and you'll see

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.029 
originally did the map and you'll see
how<00:00:15.809> it<00:00:15.839> turns<00:00:16.109> out<00:00:16.350> in<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.500> minute

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
how it turns out in a minute

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.070 
how it turns out in a minute
each<00:00:17.340> letter<00:00:17.670> corresponds<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.660> color

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
each letter corresponds to a color

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.740 
each letter corresponds to a color
that's<00:00:19.410> going<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.710> be<00:00:19.830> on<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.100> screen<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.760> I

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
that's going to be on the screen and I

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.960 
that's going to be on the screen and I
completely<00:00:22.410> coated<00:00:22.710> this<00:00:23.010> by<00:00:23.250> myself

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.060 

let's<00:00:26.970> see<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:27.449> here<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:28.109> all<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.949> if

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
let's see so here is all the if

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.600 
let's see so here is all the if
statements<00:00:29.760> that<00:00:30.029> say<00:00:30.500> stuff<00:00:31.500> like<00:00:31.610> rocks

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
statements that say stuff like rocks

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.310 
statements that say stuff like rocks
dead<00:00:32.850> ahead<00:00:32.910> which<00:00:33.540> means<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:34.079> I'm<00:00:34.200> gonna

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
dead ahead which means that I'm gonna

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.830 
dead ahead which means that I'm gonna
add<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.980> list<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.430> rocks<00:00:35.790> up<00:00:36.180> here<00:00:36.630> and

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
add it to the list of rocks up here and

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.610 
add it to the list of rocks up here and
then<00:00:37.620> up<00:00:37.890> here<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.640> rocks<00:00:38.879> class<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.989> says

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
then up here in the rocks class it says

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.100 
then up here in the rocks class it says
I'm<00:00:41.129> going<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.750> basically<00:00:44.239> passin<00:00:45.239> entity<00:00:45.840> an

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
I'm going to basically passin entity an

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.580 
I'm going to basically passin entity an
entity<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.190> sprite<00:00:47.969> generator<00:00:48.899> so

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
entity is a sprite generator so

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.090 
entity is a sprite generator so
basically<00:00:50.160> then<00:00:50.730> down<00:00:51.000> here<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.870> have<00:00:52.530> my

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
basically then down here I have my

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.479 
basically then down here I have my
entities<00:00:53.840> plural<00:00:54.840> equals<00:00:55.260> pie<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.770> sprite

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
entities plural equals pie and sprite

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.680 
entities plural equals pie and sprite
group

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
group

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.260 
group
so<00:00:57.960> if<00:00:58.469> I<00:00:58.680> have<00:00:58.829> entities<00:00:59.129> that's<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.820> group<00:01:00.059> of

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
so if I have entities that's a group of

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.330 
so if I have entities that's a group of
sprite<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.870> have<00:01:01.020> entity<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.129> a

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
sprite and I have entity that is a

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.579 
sprite and I have entity that is a
sprite<00:01:02.760> so<00:01:03.480> I'll<00:01:03.570> run<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.170> show<00:01:04.559> you

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
sprite so I'll run this and show you

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.640 
sprite so I'll run this and show you
guys<00:01:04.710> how<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:05.189> works<00:01:05.369> but<00:01:08.960> so<00:01:09.960> here's<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.470> map

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
guys how it works but so here's the map

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.730 
guys how it works but so here's the map
after<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.220> finished<00:01:11.400> loading<00:01:12.200> and<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.560> will

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
after it's finished loading and it will

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.039 
after it's finished loading and it will
give<00:01:13.950> me<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.159> list<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.880> all<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.509> things<00:01:15.720> from

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
give me a list of all of the things from

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.039 
give me a list of all of the things from
left<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.380> right<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.890> what<00:01:17.130> they<00:01:17.310> are<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:18.049> by

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
left to right and what they are and by

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.940 
left to right and what they are and by
the<00:01:19.110> way<00:01:19.229> I'm<00:01:19.350> programming<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:19.920> Python<00:01:20.360> so

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
the way I'm programming in Python so

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.890 
the way I'm programming in Python so
this<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.310> map<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.909> see<00:01:24.090> there's<00:01:24.390> paths

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
this is the map you see there's paths

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.770 
this is the map you see there's paths
here<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:26.040> lead<00:01:26.250> up<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.850> couple<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.330> markets

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
here that lead up to a couple of markets

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.609 
here that lead up to a couple of markets
here<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:30.020> little<00:01:31.020> house<00:01:31.170> here<00:01:31.470> the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
here and this is a little house here the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:32.899 
here and this is a little house here the
only<00:01:31.770> thing<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.070> haven't<00:01:32.369> done<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.610> add<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
only thing I haven't done is add the

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.210 
only thing I haven't done is add the
roofs<00:01:33.150> which<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:33.990> may<00:01:34.170> do<00:01:34.350> real<00:01:34.530> quick<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.070> show

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
roofs which I may do real quick and show

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.429 
roofs which I may do real quick and show
you<00:01:35.250> guys<00:01:35.400> how<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.759> go<00:01:36.000> about<00:01:36.030> doing<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:37.409> I

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
you guys how I go about doing that so I

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.370 
you guys how I go about doing that so I
find<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.979> good<00:01:38.159> color<00:01:38.579> for<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.970> roofs<00:01:39.380> let's

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
find a good color for the roofs let's

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.460 
find a good color for the roofs let's
just<00:01:40.560> go<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.799> dark<00:01:41.130> green<00:01:41.490> something<00:01:42.090> like<00:01:42.210> this

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
just go a dark green something like this

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:50.539 
just go a dark green something like this
and<00:01:43.470> then<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.740> look<00:01:44.100> at<00:01:44.250> these<00:01:44.399> values<00:01:44.909> here<00:01:49.549> I'm

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
and then I look at these values here I'm

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.670 
and then I look at these values here I'm
gonna<00:01:50.700> bring<00:01:50.970> back<00:01:51.270> up<00:01:51.479> my<00:01:51.659> Python<00:01:52.320> I'm<00:01:52.560> gonna

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
gonna bring back up my Python I'm gonna

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.980 
gonna bring back up my Python I'm gonna
close<00:01:53.220> this<00:01:54.020> and<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:56.159> bring<00:01:56.369> up<00:01:56.520> my<00:01:56.640> code

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.490 

how<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.020> do<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:02.689> basically<00:02:03.689> where<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.259> says

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
how I do it is basically where it says

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.029 
how I do it is basically where it says
roofs<00:02:05.100> here<00:02:06.950> and<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.640> little<00:02:08.759> bit<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.060> code<00:02:09.270> and

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
roofs here and a little bit of code and

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.280 
roofs here and a little bit of code and
I'm<00:02:11.039> gonna<00:02:11.280> say<00:02:11.550> if<00:02:11.819> our

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
I'm gonna say if our

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.040 
I'm gonna say if our
oof<00:02:14.750> are<00:02:15.750> equals<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:17.430> I'm<00:02:17.670> saying<00:02:17.970> that<00:02:18.239> art<00:02:18.660> is

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
oof are equals so I'm saying that art is

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.460 
oof are equals so I'm saying that art is
a<00:02:19.080> new<00:02:19.349> attribute<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.819> class<00:02:21.150> roof<00:02:21.599> with

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
just like I want them to be so now I can

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.349 
just like I want them to be so now I can
see<00:03:58.470> it's<00:03:58.650> exactly<00:03:58.739> that<00:03:59.099> color<00:03:59.459> but<00:03:59.849> the<00:04:00.120> cool

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
see it's exactly that color but the cool

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.009 
see it's exactly that color but the cool
thing<00:04:00.389> is<00:04:00.780> if<00:04:01.200> I<00:04:01.440> wanted<00:04:01.680> to<00:04:01.799> change<00:04:02.099> the<00:04:02.370> map

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
thing is if I wanted to change the map

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.539 
thing is if I wanted to change the map
or<00:04:04.019> make<00:04:04.290> another<00:04:04.560> map<00:04:04.799> I<00:04:05.010> could<00:04:05.160> just<00:04:05.340> copy

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
or make another map I could just copy

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:10.550 
or make another map I could just copy
paste<00:04:05.940> this<00:04:06.239> and<00:04:06.569> then<00:04:09.169> add<00:04:10.169> a<00:04:10.200> couple<00:04:10.290> things

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
paste this and then add a couple things

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.170 
paste this and then add a couple things
in<00:04:10.950> there<00:04:11.209> Noren<00:04:12.209> and<00:04:12.299> again<00:04:13.519> and<00:04:14.519> as<00:04:14.819> you<00:04:14.940> can

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
in there Noren and again and as you can

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.000 
in there Noren and again and as you can
see<00:04:15.239> it<00:04:15.720> would<00:04:15.810> change<00:04:16.169> them<00:04:16.440> to<00:04:16.650> whatever<00:04:16.919> I

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
see it would change them to whatever I

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.550 
see it would change them to whatever I
did<00:04:17.130> and<00:04:17.519> hashtag<00:04:17.940> corresponds<00:04:18.450> to<00:04:18.539> a<00:04:18.660> rock<00:04:18.870> so

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
did and hashtag corresponds to a rock so

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.420 
did and hashtag corresponds to a rock so
it<00:04:19.620> is<00:04:19.739> now<00:04:19.859> a<00:04:19.889> rock<00:04:20.190> right<00:04:20.669> there<00:04:22.220> so<00:04:23.220> nobody

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
it is now a rock right there so nobody

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.159 
it is now a rock right there so nobody
