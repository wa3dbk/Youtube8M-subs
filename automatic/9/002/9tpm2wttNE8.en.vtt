00:00:01.269 --> 00:00:02.660
 friends 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.110
 is that on TV this TV image is counted 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:11.019
 It is a mistake to want the rest here. 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.969
 that's what we want 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:18.969
 I toto of kantar 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.739
 currently score 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:25.529
 I think it's fair 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.939
 the problem as I already said 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.819
 is the suspect fell 11 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:32.929
 there is the customer who has 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.170
 it stays in the stretch gently and so 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.970
 such usually 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.780
 the cannon 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.270
 marquinhos 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.270
 if you observe chaos in the corporate sector 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.380
 He also used it in the little room. 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.730
 the red channel is also with the 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.930
 they are both designing good image part of it by the media skype is 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.060
 Christian in the same place so all of them however by the mayor is that kakÃ¡ them 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.770
 They are 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.700
 fleischer slowly with busy which facilitated his debut 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.890
 is that I am the typical portrait but in the middle of the year 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.180
 already the customer 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.450
 the commander is possible and I think no son fields obey the image 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.450
 it is in this trapezoidal format 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.320
 is what is getting green in addition to credit and image collection until 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.750
 now the matches nothing which can increase according to both things 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.080
 the goalless click here 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.260
 what most shocks private eight in total 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.560
 and ney miner is also part 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.000
 it's patrik 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.310
 I ask colleagues. 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.380
 How could you lose? 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.380
 for anyone who solves a problem 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.310
 the problem 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.170
 in green color 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.189
 if by chance it may have been some technical way it may have moved 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:11.630
 Reflector that calls me a traitor gives - she axes Brazil what I 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.290
 I think it's ford here down here down the canyon that goes to 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.840
 20% where the virtual card passes today has defined that something that can 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.429
 do it here miguel paludo the iva or digital invest here is not sin 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:32.389
 it stands to reason that he wanted me to fight resolving this problem 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:34.799
 13 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.579
 and the very vital in political office the image that is requested is very good 

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:44.180
 but so much pain for the inconvenience to assert the factor house the head of the plate 

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:45.419
 good office card 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:47.340

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.709
