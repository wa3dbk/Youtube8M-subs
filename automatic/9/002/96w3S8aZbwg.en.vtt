one<00:01:37.979> from<00:01:38.220> t-mobile<00:01:39.110> in<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.560> Box<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:41.450> showed

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
one from t-mobile in the Box I showed

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.270 
one from t-mobile in the Box I showed
you<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:43.290> other<00:01:43.439> things<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.829> were<00:01:43.979> in<00:01:44.040> the

you the other things that were in the
box<00:01:45.020> again<00:01:46.020> 4G<00:01:46.860> speeds<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:48.030> think<00:01:48.240> that

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
box again 4G speeds and I think that

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.480 
box again 4G speeds and I think that
they're<00:01:48.630> just<00:01:48.659> coming<00:01:49.170> up<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:50.100> network

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
they're just coming up and the network

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.609 
they're just coming up and the network
but<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.200> LG<00:01:52.380> VL<00:01:53.369> 600<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:55.079> other

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
but this is the LG VL 600 the other

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.330

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
desktop so let me shut this down and VZ

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:22.090 
desktop so let me shut this down and VZ
this<00:02:15.660> VZ<00:02:16.080> manager<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:18.740> it<00:02:19.740> is<00:02:20.640> really<00:02:21.510> handy

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
this VZ manager and it is really handy

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.290 
this VZ manager and it is really handy
to<00:02:23.100> install<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:25.069> then<00:02:26.069> you<00:02:26.220> have<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.670> the

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
to install and then you have the the

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.010 
to install and then you have the the
readout<00:02:27.810> on<00:02:28.140> your<00:02:28.410> information<00:02:29.040> so<00:02:29.660> I<00:02:30.660> think

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
readout on your information so I think

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.280 
readout on your information so I think
you<00:02:31.230> can<00:02:31.350> see<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:31.620> right<00:02:31.739> there<00:02:31.819> Verizon<00:02:33.290> it's
