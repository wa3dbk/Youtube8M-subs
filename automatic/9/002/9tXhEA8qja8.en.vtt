00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.300
 ah 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:59.000
 erwin is enabled 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.000
 first if you do not come 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.310
 this is going to stick candles that plays 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.790
 dangerous 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.720
 do not go mouth to see to see 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.720
 VelÃ¡zquez center 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.060
 that's key and it's coming 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:26.859
 see clear here do not throw it at you not the 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.500
 run here he does not take it faced the 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:32.369
 archer if he does not have the channel is by 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.369
 on the line that does not 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.620
 of spicy and follows the spicy 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.630
 just spicy in some mess 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.710
 now the novel novel does not stop 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.370
 liquidate or veil faced the goalkeeper 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.370
 milano 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.830
 we are with 15 better now than party 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.570
 incredible is not hard at first do not 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.490
 we found the turn missing 20 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.720
 minutes the first time we did not start to 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.520
 take the second time I think we did 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.200
 great match and we were able to go around the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.300
 principle we are wrong in what you 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.310
 they become strong in the brand because of that 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.750
 I tell you we felt bad out there in the 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.030
 court played us a dirty trick where 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.010
 we wanted to press and we went through 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.280
 long we could not do well but it's 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.290
 well we do not talk we relocated and it 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.120
 saw the Belgrano who comes 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.440
 doing a long time ago and we can give 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.290
 return a very hard result when 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.370
 they arrived at the locker room at halftime 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.260
 you thought I was going to finish 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.870
 this way the truth that no but 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.050
 we had the illusion because once we 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.310
 we made the draw the match was opened 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.740
 well we left very convinced that 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.270
 we could achieve the victory thanks to 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.400
 god was given on the first play the 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.959
 second time lengthen the difference 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.959
 then it became a little easier
