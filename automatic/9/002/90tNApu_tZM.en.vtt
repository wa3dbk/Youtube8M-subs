00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.519
 now come approx 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.540
 exceptionally on Monday morning in 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.540
 play hannover 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:18.710
 so I'll give the inside right 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.699
 word hanover is a difficult away game 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.279
 So read somewhere but never 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.050
 have gained is time to change the 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.840
 It is clear that he is clean heavy task 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.340
 will insist we want everything there 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.650
 for doing that we have at least one point 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.210
 take home 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.370
 It is important to score now 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.950
 have a very good starting situation 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.540
 it will also be decisive how many 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.129
 We will also score in the next two 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.200
 Play until Christmas 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.910
 With this we lay the starting position for 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.590
 the way back bavaria munich the 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.870
 game is ticked that have 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.820
 worked up I think that we on the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.520
 first 60 minutes can build the 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.590
 we have analyzed that we of course 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.370
 no four goals in ten minutes 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.280
 allowed to get 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.020
 But that's also Bavaria Munich 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.270
 owed and therefore we were 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.850
 optimistic after Hannover we have the 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.380
 last games before bavaria with him good 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.040
 also looked abroad twice 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.420
 won in stuttgart and cologne and 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.920
 accordingly, we go there go now 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.900
 I think the team knows what it is 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.270
 is the output position 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.070
 set for the second half 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.110
 and there we are challenged by 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:27.030
 karl-hermann little hurt with jan 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:29.220
 ginger calls bracker still crib 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.630
 or is slightly ill 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.270
 but we are looking into the 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.710
 can rise airman has Sascha Molders 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.450
 jump joint problems paul verhaegh or 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.009
 We have to get hit on our knees 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.280
 can look like today can train room 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.159
 but confident and otherwise 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.610
 I think I do not forget anybody else 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.049
 everything is fit the long-term injured 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.060
 No , you have to wait and see who 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.840
 see it is treated like him 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.350
 can train 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.509
 it is clear that the time is short of 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.460
 Saturday on duty say hard training 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.210
 to wait and see how we use it 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.210
 can then 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:18.640
 we will train now and then 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:20.050
 after hannover they fly no 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.230
 see problems in physical terms 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.989
 at the team from english weeks 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.670
 has to cope as well 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.370
 since what changed there are still 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.770
 somehow reflections to rotate 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.900
 to give other players a chance 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.750
 There is always the consideration of course 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.590
 to find the best position 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.239
 In general, I think that the 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.040
 English weeks from the physical 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.110
 state it can be 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.760
 an English week now and I have 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.489
 the answer or the answer given on 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.900
 the question ministers look and have 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.640
 also said that Bayern Munich over the 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.620
 makes a whole half year and then have to 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.330
 once a week 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.930
 that's all three days to go 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.319
 play 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.330
 I do not see no problem from there 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.370
 the fitness ago but of course 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.940
 We also wonder if we will eventually 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:15.720
 a two positions as always 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:18.280
 know tobi know because know 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.130
 alone condition has the game go 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.370
 with very running intensive you are broken 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.420
 otherwise it is completely normal 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.269
 basically the second day is always 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.739
 relatively heavy but often one 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.760
 head thing 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.290
 Of course you can live it one 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.989
 tired is that you do not feel that way 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.700
 Feels good but if you know that tomorrow 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.079
 The lawn must burn again then goes 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.370
 It's natural to do it differently today 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.870
 Even a training is always better 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.920
 purely the legs become again 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.370
 a little more can you come back in 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.390
 the rhythm 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.060
 I think the team is looking forward 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.260
 that tomorrow will continue immediately because then 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.709
 the defeat of bayer is not so 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.540
 deep inside 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.980
 who now checked off and look forward 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.810
 tomorrow the game coach said 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.209
 We have I think three games since a 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.489
 point last year significantly more separate 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.049
 At that time, unfortunately, a little bit down 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.109
 but that needs to be changed tomorrow 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:04.660
 believe what is really really good there 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.980
 to do everything against it and we 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.130
 definitely want to take more than 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.140
 in recent years you are against 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.269
 Munich pretty early in the first 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.070
 on the opponent on it with quarter of an hour 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.639
 So really gone chance 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.469
 enemy 16er 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.969
 normally then the second is 

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:23.319
 half the time still can lay those 

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:25.159
 it tasted grains this time 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:27.259
 but we have it in all the others 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:28.039
 play home well done and in front 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:31.879
 gone on it 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:33.289
 I think the way was not 

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:36.650
 but blame the quality of the opponent 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:38.389
 was guilty that then palms is also off 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.979
 uses that possibly the room a bit 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:41.599
 the others will grow bigger 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.370
 teams are harder to do this 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:45.529
 small details to exploit and 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.080
 Bavaria Munich has this quality and 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:50.090
 the double beat was of course 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.509
 neck break within three minutes 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.189
 because the standard situation then in the 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:57.229
 post and in between 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:59.599
 We both walk alone 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:01.189
 newer to that was no offside and it 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:03.050
 are the little things or on 

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:05.360
 have come together within three 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.759
 minutes three unfortunate situations 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.949
 plus that of the in-house post hit 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:12.500
 von robben also jumping out 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:13.819
 but that is the missing thing 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.039
 necessary luck that you against bavaria 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:18.919
 still needs to score then 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:25.759
 otherwise it caught in three minutes 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:27.620
 and therefore also happy now normal 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:28.729
 Continued training or training 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.400
 it was a bit more up now 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:33.169
 Regeneration does not do it that way 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.279
 a lot of walking was done in training 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:35.419
 normal as you would in an English 

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:37.879
 week I believe that the 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:39.830
 Regeneration is the most important thing and that 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:42.469
 is a focus on simple sets 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:45.500
 that the team tomorrow at 20 o'clock 

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:47.029
 is again fit and accordingly 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.949
 we also trained then we will 

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:51.310
 I still train today 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:51.310
 absolutely normal 

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:56.089
 Tobias Saam said Hanover is one 

00:05:55.279 --> 00:06:01.039
 good opponent 

00:05:56.089 --> 00:06:02.300
 what makes mister strong in the last 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:04.550
 I think they had six games 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.409
 a bit after the train ride three games 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.449
 then won three games and lost 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:10.039
 played at the weekend 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:11.719
 Offensively they certainly have theirs 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:12.800
 qualities with lars stindl 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:15.259
 I think that's back for a long time 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:18.020
 injured was the scepter in itself 

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:19.279
 we have to really break it 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.719
 be warned but we will be back 

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:21.589
 People stay with the trainer 

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:24.319
 we always as good as possible 

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:25.909
 try to implement that they are beatable 

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:27.919
 it is that we know that as well 

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:29.300
 Last year proved that we are at home 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:31.789
 she really partly then to the 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.409
 We have been warned against the wall 

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:34.759
 the quality of hanover but we 

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:36.139
 you can still join her 

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:37.819
 Confident to know the mirrors 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:39.919
 are also a team abroad 

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:41.599
 you have to beat first and that will 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:42.919
 he thinks i'm planning his we are 

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:45.020
 chosen there still a few points 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:46.999
 up to a functions and the on 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.650
 In the morning, a few points means 

00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:49.569
 two victories for the fca fans on 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.669
 Christmas tree 

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:53.930
 that would of course be the dream 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:55.279
 we want to play in both 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.770
 if there are of course six points 

00:06:55.279 --> 00:07:06.710
 then we are satisfied the 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:08.210
 window to ask question to tobi werner 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:11.180
 We are now in the mood 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:13.249
 team prevails because after the game 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.899
 against bavaria rather the pride that 

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:17.060
 you really really good for 60 minutes 

00:07:14.899 --> 00:07:19.159
 could keep up or rather the 

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:21.099
 pain over the four goals in the 

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:23.149
 short time 

00:07:21.099 --> 00:07:24.259
 I'm actually up so much once 

00:07:23.149 --> 00:07:25.490
 bayern take the game out 

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:26.749
 certainly have against the world's best 

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.089
 Team 60 minutes well kept 

00:07:26.749 --> 00:07:29.990
 But the mood after the game was 

00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:32.120
 a bit disappointing want 

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.919
 us just more calculated that 

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.999
 Of course, the 15 minutes was not like that 

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:35.959
 planned that not everything is there 

00:07:34.999 --> 00:07:38.270
 I think I did it right 

00:07:35.959 --> 00:07:40.939
 but it is also clear tomorrow 

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:42.469
 it goes on and we tomorrow the heads 

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:45.889
 again focused very differently 

00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:48.680
 after hannover you have to do something
