the<00:00:08.309> TM<00:00:09.059> 26<00:00:09.630> by<00:00:10.230> night<00:00:10.559> core<00:00:10.830> it's<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:12.030> rate<00:00:12.300> of

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
the TM 26 by night core it's a rate of

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.410 
the TM 26 by night core it's a rate of
that<00:00:12.510> thirty<00:00:12.840> five<00:00:13.080> hundred<00:00:13.110> lumens<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.550> I'm

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
that thirty five hundred lumens and I'm

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.679 
that thirty five hundred lumens and I'm
gonna<00:00:15.599> be<00:00:15.750> comparing<00:00:16.259> it<00:00:16.409> with<00:00:16.739> the<00:00:17.630> Maglite

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:18.689 
gonna be comparing it with the Maglite

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.229 
gonna be comparing it with the Maglite
just<00:00:19.169> regular<00:00:19.470> mag<00:00:19.649> light<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.220> both<00:00:20.939> are

00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:21.239 
just regular mag light and both are

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:24.079 
just regular mag light and both are
fully<00:00:21.960> charged<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.679> the<00:00:23.249> mag<00:00:23.429> light<00:00:23.609> does

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:24.089 
fully charged and the mag light does

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:28.880 
fully charged and the mag light does
have<00:00:24.359> fresh<00:00:24.659> batteries<00:00:25.699> so<00:00:26.699> let's<00:00:27.089> go<00:00:27.890> let's

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
have fresh batteries so let's go let's

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:39.829 
have fresh batteries so let's go let's
go<00:00:29.069> test<00:00:29.309> them<00:00:29.489> out<00:00:37.519> so<00:00:38.519> here<00:00:38.730> we<00:00:38.940> are<00:00:38.969> at<00:00:39.420> three

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:39.839 
go test them out so here we are at three

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:42.169 
go test them out so here we are at three
lumens<00:00:40.320> I'm<00:00:41.219> just<00:00:41.429> gonna<00:00:41.579> go<00:00:41.789> ahead<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.059> leave

00:00:42.169 --> 00:00:42.179 
lumens I'm just gonna go ahead and leave

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:50.810 
lumens I'm just gonna go ahead and leave
this<00:00:42.300> on<00:00:44.420> and<00:00:46.039> here<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.579> mag<00:00:48.329> light<00:00:49.820> and

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
this on and here is the mag light and

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.160 
this on and here is the mag light and
again<00:00:51.719> we're<00:00:52.249> testing<00:00:53.249> it<00:00:53.780> like<00:00:54.780> that

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
again we're testing it like that

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.889 
again we're testing it like that

and<00:02:14.810> these<00:02:15.680> these<00:02:16.459> trees<00:02:16.760> that<00:02:17.709> there's<00:02:18.709> an

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
and these these trees that there's an

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.780 
and these these trees that there's an
amazing<00:02:19.400> job<00:02:19.550> of<00:02:19.610> lighting<00:02:19.940> everything<00:02:20.690> up

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
amazing job of lighting everything up

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:30.820 
amazing job of lighting everything up
and<00:02:22.790> now<00:02:22.880> here<00:02:23.150> it<00:02:23.240> is<00:02:23.300> that<00:02:23.540> 3,500<00:02:24.440> lumens<00:02:29.830> and

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
and now here it is that 3,500 lumens and

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.699 
and now here it is that 3,500 lumens and
as<00:02:31.400> you<00:02:31.550> can<00:02:31.700> tell<00:02:31.880> like<00:02:32.150> it<00:02:32.450> doesn't<00:02:33.110> the

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
as you can tell like it doesn't the

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.100 
as you can tell like it doesn't the
throw<00:02:33.980> is<00:02:34.130> not<00:02:34.160> super<00:02:34.910> far<00:02:35.380> but<00:02:37.000> it<00:02:38.000> does<00:02:38.209> work

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
throw is not super far but it does work

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.400 
throw is not super far but it does work
as<00:02:39.290> a<00:02:39.319> floodlight<00:02:39.680> a<00:02:41.020> lot<00:02:42.020> better<00:02:42.260> in

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
as a floodlight a lot better in

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.770 
as a floodlight a lot better in
spotlight<00:02:42.980> so<00:02:43.520> you'd<00:02:44.150> probably<00:02:44.270> need<00:02:44.660> this

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
spotlight so you'd probably need this

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.009 
spotlight so you'd probably need this
for<00:02:45.050> indoor<00:02:45.470> use<00:02:45.670> not<00:02:46.670> so<00:02:46.910> much<00:02:47.060> for<00:02:47.300> outdoor

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
for indoor use not so much for outdoor

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:55.050 
for indoor use not so much for outdoor
use

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.900 

or<00:02:55.630> no<00:02:55.780> I'm<00:02:55.870> sorry<00:02:56.220> it's<00:02:57.220> actually<00:02:57.400> better<00:02:57.760> for

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
or no I'm sorry it's actually better for

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.470 
or no I'm sorry it's actually better for
outdoor<00:02:58.540> use<00:02:59.310> you<00:03:00.310> could<00:03:00.490> use<00:03:00.700> it<00:03:00.880> for<00:03:00.910> indoor

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
outdoor use you could use it for indoor

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.280
