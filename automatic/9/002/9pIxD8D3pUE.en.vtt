00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.799
 slow motion camera camera what was your 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.510
 Favorite food on your trip through the 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.860
 guinness is really very good this 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.759
 question is a little and left so 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.920
 I have to do these more often 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.599
 programs everything I had dad and cream 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.039
 aerial but there were like some pancakes from 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.690
 potatoes that were incredible and 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.200
 obviously the national drink the black 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.240
 balm 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.490
 some tip for photos where there is little light 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.350
 a lot of movement and you can not use flash 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.900
 apart from bursting the iso obviously 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.910
 pop the ready and if they are photos of 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.220
 objects in movement obviously be 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.830
 very well stopped and follow the movement 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.600
 with your camera which obviously if it is 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.489
 a movement in one direction is going to 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.840
 stay in the person frozen and that 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.380
 will do the sweep effect and if they are 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.570
 movements like this inside the good guy 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.090
 be a little more but another that that does not 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.100
 it occurs to me when you go to the 810 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.870
 I would love it because I tried it and I 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.030
 he liked very much for the moment the 800 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.430
 it seems to me that nothing is missing if I 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.720
 there will be enough money to sell the 800 and 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.610
 I'll put some more money and I'll 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.380
 I would buy the 810 calculation that will arrive 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.180
 the moment in which tell me about side 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.280
 I have a separate money will save 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.200
 to make the change at the moment no no 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.490
 nothing is missing my camera and I like it 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.259
 a lot how it was so I'm going to continue 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.729
 with that or know a photographer who 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.170
 is dedicated to school recordings or 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.479
 you can give advice on that if 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.860
 I know a guy who came to class makes 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.300
 a lot and he told me he was doing that guy 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.040
 of work my recommendation is that you are 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.050
 very organized enough to do 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.970
 many forms to make sure that 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.080
 I have charged everyone well that all 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.360
 have had their copies 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.490
 and have received their copies and contain 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.320
 the photos of a single school to know 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.750
 what is a lot of students so my 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.480
 advice would prioritize the organization 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.160
 in being very neat hello a question I 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.390
 I have a nikon camera of 60 just 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.460
 I'm starting, it's recommended the 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.530
 Any camera camera to start is 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.910
 recommended if you have a camera use the 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.530
 think of all the people who do not have 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.180
 access a camera in which you have is 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.770
 better than what all those people have 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.450
 that you have nothing obviously you are going to have 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.250
 that improve in the future 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.020
 you are going to feel that you are going to need 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.380
 but to start any camera is 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.090
 well or the lupi says what this is new 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.560
 your cute photos thanks as you do for 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.750
 to see also on facebook what is 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.550
 a trick there is no trick is a 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.130
 series of steps that I always follow and 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.800
 they always work for me I leave here a 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.660
 video about that where I explain 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.950
 all the steps that I follow to record 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.330
 my photos for web and the truth is that 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.370
 it always works I teach it to everyone 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.020
 my students and it turns out if you continue 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.730
 those steps to be well in the photo are 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.290
 they will see very well on facebook but 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.120
 ask when this is the course in 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.500
 santiago de chile I'm talking to 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.480
 santiago people has not yet materialized 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.770
 but I have santiago in my list of 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.440
 places I have to go to visit 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.850
 so I hope it's soon 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.490
 hello how do you know if someone the photogenic 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.500
 at first sight you are a tall barrack 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.820
 I think it's an expression 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.650
 Colombian that I'm going to have to go to 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.540
 colombia so that they teach me how to know 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.400
 if someone is photogenic at a glance 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.320
 it is impossible to know why there are people who 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.880
 It is very ugly and they look great in photos and 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.410
 people who are very cute and go wrong in 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.960
 photos the only thing you can do is 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.820
 ask them and take pictures and 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.710
 experience non-photographic question 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.510
 what are your statistics / program 2 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.220
 these are mine and that made me 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.500
 when the statistics mine are 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.110
 you do a lot of watching the games 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.160
 but the highest numbers were left 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.360
 the truth that for a while what 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.920
 I was playing a lot 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.140
 felipe ask what countries you would like 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.000
 know I'm missing a lot of countries of 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.550
 my list of incredible places that 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.190
 I want to know if or if it is greece and 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.870
 Egypt for its history obviously and 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.270
 then I need to know all 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.860
 Latin America and strange places like I do not know 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.750
 Iceland that calls me very much for 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.230
 some reason for santana isolated from 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.580
 world 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.260
 I like trips come to places 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.300
 unexpected where to buy the chain 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.130
 rings and bracelets of camarita I go to this 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.110
 capital to look for them in serious these 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.510
 unfortunately I did not buy them here 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.920
 argentina so 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.780
 they brought them from outside were a 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.430
 work gift a beautiful gift I do not know 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.260
 how to get them here these people who 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.790
 Resell means that somehow 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.530
 want to retract the country but you're going to have 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.510
 I look very good because I can not 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.799
 indicate a place or a store where 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.909
 You can go to buy them in Buenos Aires 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.099
 a manual goal 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:53.690
 efe 1.8 helps have better eye for 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.610
 focus or it's worth improving the eye 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.840
 it will simply be an automatic this is 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.950
 something in which such some photographers 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.079
 purists will not agree 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.700
 with me but having bought a 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.989
 manual goal says it's in this 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.209
 moment recording the video I have to 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.829
 clarify that the new cameras the beds 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.420
 are designed to play with 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:10.129
 autofocus therefore do not have help from 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.440
 approach as they had the old cameras 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:14.209
 who had the split image or in the 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.220
 digit of that micro prisms that was put 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.690
 more rugged smoother we do not have any 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.609
 Focus Assist and screens 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.260
 approach in general if we do not have that 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.270
 Focus sensitive help is very difficult 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.949
 focus an image in a little square like that 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.630
 little little manual on the objectives 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.949
 I recommend this video and it's going to be 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.289
 much easier to focus on light view 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:31.639
 that by the seen and in the rest of the 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:33.470
 cases already has its automatic goal 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:35.449
 others if you have a goal with focus 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.919
 automatic I recommend that you trust in the 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.180
 automatic focus calibrate your camera not 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.470
 has nothing wrong with taking out with focus 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.150
 automatic 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.620
 that is the last question for the day of 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.060
 today if they want me to respond to their 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.460
 ask in the next ping pong 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:50.060
 send me the question on twitter with the 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.890
 hashtag l the pp the photo ping pong 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.810
 that is the best way for it to be 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.240
 find your questions better said is 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.530
 the only way and so we can have a 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.330
 question management program 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.950
 some of today's cortices were very 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.670
 interesting and I thank you very much for your
