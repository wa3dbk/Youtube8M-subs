00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 immobile that has caused excitement among 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.500
 the great public is without a doubt the galaxy 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.490
 s 4 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.769
 let's talk about him 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.870
 main differences are the 5 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:12.789
 inches of screen is bigger brings 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.589
 a better camera better connectivity with 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:16.779
 other devices and especially that is 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:18.580
 faster and all these better 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:21.279
 benefits in the same size as the 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.890
 Galaxy S3 in the same weight even weighs 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.140
 3 grams less is 130 grams in what 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.599
 this galaxy is 4 and 7 with 9 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.769
 millimeters thick which is very 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.519
 very good for a phone these 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:35.350
 regarding design features for 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:37.210
 as you see the button to the bottom with its 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.159
 two typical android buttons the part 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.260
 superior with the front camera and 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:42.970
 sensors have gotten this band 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.470
 metal that gives a touch of quality 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.570
 The keypad, for example, is also 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.909
 metal the upper connector area of the 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.799
 helmets microphone noise reduction the 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:52.960
 infrared port to be able to handle the 

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:55.479
 remote TV on the other side we have 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.010
 the power button down the connector 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:58.570
 of cargo that we also do 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.239
 hdmi functions and if we buy the 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.250
 adapter the microphone and the part 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.869
 back then it brings us the speaker with a 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.850
 slit very thank also that 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.860
 excels from the rest of the design so that 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.560
 we can support it on the table and speaker 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.969
 continue to hear the flash and the 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.450
 camera that protrudes a tad of the 

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:15.490
 Case 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.960
 certainly does not bother all this 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.399
 regarding the design regarding 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.439
 hardware features that the 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:23.140
 phone as they are four cores to one 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.820
 with 9 2 gigas of ram gorilla that the three 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.649
 that covers the entire phone to avoid 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.149
 the scratches the internal memory that brings 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.369
 is a minimum of 16 gigs, although there 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.530
 higher capacity versions and it's 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.119
 expandable by micro sd the lid the 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.270
 we can remove the battery is removable 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.909
 of 2600 milliamps which is 25 per 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.159
 a hundred more than the ls 3 so 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.110
 we should have a longer duration 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.880
 of battery, even though the 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.200
 screen is larger than the 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.560
 connectivity as everything you can 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.479
 imagine nfc gps wifi direct lte that is 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.390
 the famous network this 4g with greater 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.789
 bluetooth speed 4.0 lm hl that 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.349
 we commented for the hdmi and the led 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.899
 infrared to handle TV by 

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:03.520
 cite only some examples the 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.860
 screen, of course it is 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.349
 spectacular both in resolution and in 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.090
 quality is a full hd super amoled in 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.709
 the pixel density is somewhat less than 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.750
 the competition for example the htc one 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.269
 but the human eye does not appreciate it so 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.560
 so do not think you 're going to see images 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.209
 and letters with low quality or a lot 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.090
 less the opposite the sharpness is 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.180
 surprising 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.739
 and the size yes it is true that it is 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.569
 something big on the screen to reach 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.819
 the upper zone with the finger but good 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.780
 if you handle it with both hands you do not go 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.120
 to have any problem in that the 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.370
 screen is of these dimensions and 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.160
 also to highlight in this section that 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.120
 We can use it with gloves respect 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.319
 to the camera as it has 13 megapixels 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.580
 It has such curious features 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.650
 like this that we see right now that 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.230
 we can use the front camera and 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.269
 back at the same time the adjustments have 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.640
 put very much in the style of the galaxy camera 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:57.330
 so very easy to use, all very simple 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:00.650
 use and record in full hd of course 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.060
 in terms of the quality of the photos 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.440
 let's say that in low the university does not 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.840
 reaches the quality of the competition 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.190
 like the lumia 9 20 or the htc one but 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.750
 has the advantage that having 13 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.270
 megapixels we will be able to do more 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.660
 zoom and since the photo itself is more 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.930
 big 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.240
 regarding the software as it brings android 4 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.470
 2 2 the latest version of android there 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.420
 right now in the market with more 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.980
 widgets and with several customizations 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.320
 from samsung like for example the bar 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.320
 typical superior with several accesses 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.970
 direct or the settings menu that I finish 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.110
 to show a moment ago that he's coming 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.450
 also a little different than what it is 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.190
 android with some sections up here 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.810
 so we can access in a way 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.600
 more comfortable to the main functions 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.400
 of the device the keyboard for example 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.080
 it's the swift keith that brings us 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.360
 defect that allows us to drag 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.070
 by the screen 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.930
 Well with more things to highlight the 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.570
 software the smart scroll for example if 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.700
 we are on a web page and we have the 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.580
 phone watching us as we are able 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.840
 of sliding the scroll and tilting the 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.360
 phone now does not work because 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.400
 We have the camera in front or details 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.480
 like the smart pause that what you 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.760
 allows is that while you're 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.740
 watching a video if you turn your head 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.360
 because you are no longer looking at the phone 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.830
 Well, it automatically pauses you too 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.140
 it's a very cool and very 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.810
 practice as we said the command to 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.280
 distance to use it as a command 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.769
 distance for any television there 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.599
 only a samsung television 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.250
 and other curious features to 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:26.620
 stand out as for example the group play 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.050
 that allows us to play a song 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.060
 on this phone and send it to others 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.970
 galaxy s 4 so they expose at once and 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.099
 use it as if they were 5 or 6 10 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.870
 or the galaxy s 4 that we have as 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:40.030
 speakers, yes, ideal for a party 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.919
 at home imagine all this makes the 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.960
 galaxy is 4 not only have some 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.729
 high performance at hardware level but 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.500
 also many details at the software level 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.180
 that facilitate our day to day and 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.199
 surely in other videos the 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.199
 we will show step by step
