00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
am really really happy the way that the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.380 
am really really happy the way that the
shoe<00:00:35.250> turned<00:00:35.579> out<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:36.840> did<00:00:37.680> decide<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.460> not<00:00:39.120> to

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
shoe turned out I did decide so not to

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.619 
shoe turned out I did decide so not to
fill<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.840> whole<00:00:40.020> shoe<00:00:40.350> with<00:00:40.530> mirrors

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
fill the whole shoe with mirrors

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.330 
fill the whole shoe with mirrors
originally<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:42.660> was<00:00:43.020> going<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.620> fill<00:00:44.129> the

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
originally I was going to fill the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.790 
originally I was going to fill the
entire<00:00:44.670> shoe<00:00:45.000> with<00:00:45.120> mirrors<00:00:45.570> but<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.410> decided

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
entire shoe with mirrors but I decided

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.619 
entire shoe with mirrors but I decided
it<00:00:46.980> would<00:00:47.070> be<00:00:47.129> too<00:00:47.579> expensive<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:48.420> do<00:00:48.600> that

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
it would be too expensive to do that

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.990 
it would be too expensive to do that
because<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.680> would<00:00:49.770> take<00:00:49.920> too<00:00:49.980> many<00:00:50.640> mirrors

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
because it would take too many mirrors

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.660 
because it would take too many mirrors
to<00:00:51.390> fill<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.809> entire<00:00:51.870> shoe<00:00:52.559> plus<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.190> have<00:00:53.460> to

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
to fill this entire shoe plus I have to

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.020 
to fill this entire shoe plus I have to
finish<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.180> other<00:00:54.539> shoe<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:56.129> what<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.640> decided

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
finish the other shoe so what I decided

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.599 
finish the other shoe so what I decided
to<00:00:57.149> do<00:00:57.390> was<00:00:57.570> use<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.199> mirrors<00:00:58.949> along<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.399> top

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
to do was use the mirrors along the top

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.849 
to do was use the mirrors along the top

double stack the mirrors because when

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.499 
double stack the mirrors because when

unswayed part of the shoe here which

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.690 
unswayed part of the shoe here which
this<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.630> original<00:01:25.140> shoe<00:01:25.710> which<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.520> has

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
this is the original shoe which it has

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.819 
this is the original shoe which it has
suede<00:01:27.090> here<00:01:27.570> when<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.049> place<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.320> mirrors

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
suede here when you place the mirrors

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.700 
suede here when you place the mirrors
along<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.340> suede<00:01:30.180> part<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:31.049> have<00:01:31.290> spaces

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
along this suede part you have spaces

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.359 
along this suede part you have spaces
that<00:01:32.189> looks<00:01:32.549> similar<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:34.920> what<00:01:35.340> I

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
that looks similar to this and so what I

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.969 
that looks similar to this and so what I
did<00:01:35.490> was<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:36.000> covered<00:01:36.540> those<00:01:36.990> faces<00:01:37.710> with

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
did was I covered those faces with

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.969 
did was I covered those faces with
another<00:01:38.369> mirror<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.869> gave<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.650> shoe

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
another mirror and so it gave the shoe

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.520 
another mirror and so it gave the shoe
this<00:01:41.280> beautiful<00:01:42.119> effect<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:43.020> see<00:01:43.229> here

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
this beautiful effect that you see here

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.219 
this beautiful effect that you see here
which<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.220> call<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.579> stacking<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.509> that's

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
which is I call it stacking and that's

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.020 
which is I call it stacking and that's
what<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.409> did<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.860> give<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.250> mosaic<00:01:47.700> effect

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
what I did to give it this mosaic effect

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.899

button here that I really didn't use but

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.620 
button here that I really didn't use but
when<00:02:56.160> you<00:02:56.250> turn<00:02:56.489> this<00:02:56.700> on<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:56.970> have<00:02:57.330> to<00:02:57.510> be

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
when you turn this on you have to be

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.330 
when you turn this on you have to be
really<00:02:57.930> careful<00:02:58.170> because<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.830> tip<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.220> the

really careful because the tip of the

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.820 
really careful because the tip of the
stone<00:02:59.580> Center<00:03:00.000> gets<00:03:00.209> really<00:03:00.600> hot<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.080> you<00:03:01.590> use

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
stone Center gets really hot and you use

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.790 
stone Center gets really hot and you use
the<00:03:02.040> tip<00:03:02.250> of<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.519> stone<00:03:02.760> setter<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.510> touch<00:03:04.200> on

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
the tip of the stone setter to touch on

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.490 
the tip of the stone setter to touch on
to<00:03:05.069> the<00:03:05.250> rhinestone<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.209> then<00:03:06.780> once<00:03:07.140> you<00:03:07.319> pick

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
to the rhinestone and then once you pick

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.650 
to the rhinestone and then once you pick
the<00:03:07.650> rhinestone<00:03:08.250> up<00:03:08.550> with<00:03:08.790> it<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.239> apply<00:03:09.600> it

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
the rhinestone up with it you apply it

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.860 
the rhinestone up with it you apply it
to<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.560> shoe<00:03:10.800> and<00:03:11.010> this<00:03:11.610> basically<00:03:12.390> makes<00:03:12.660> it

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
to the shoe and this basically makes it

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.890 
to the shoe and this basically makes it
easier<00:03:13.350> to<00:03:13.790> complete<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:15.090> job<00:03:15.360> like<00:03:15.630> this

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
easier to complete a job like this

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.830 
easier to complete a job like this
because<00:03:16.739> um<00:03:17.100> it<00:03:17.519> just<00:03:17.579> is<00:03:17.970> really<00:03:18.269> tedious<00:03:18.510> to

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
because um it just is really tedious to

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.140 
because um it just is really tedious to
try<00:03:19.019> to<00:03:19.079> pick<00:03:19.380> up<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.829> rhinestones<00:03:20.790> with<00:03:21.000> your

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150

try to pick up the rhinestones with your
fingers<00:03:21.630> and<00:03:21.870> you<00:03:21.930> get<00:03:22.140> glue<00:03:22.320> all<00:03:22.470> over<00:03:22.500> your

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
fingers and you get glue all over your

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.670 
fingers and you get glue all over your
finger<00:03:23.280> so<00:03:23.459> to<00:03:23.519> use<00:03:23.850> a<00:03:24.060> rhinestone<00:03:24.480> setter<00:03:25.320> or

a<00:03:25.739> stone<00:03:26.310> setter<00:03:26.989> which<00:03:27.989> is<00:03:28.110> what<00:03:28.290> this<00:03:28.440> is

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
a stone setter which is what this is

project<00:03:32.190> like<00:03:32.850> this<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:33.870> next<00:03:34.079> thing<00:03:34.380> that<00:03:34.410> I

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
project like this the next thing that I

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:41.680 
project like this the next thing that I
used<00:03:35.010> was<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:36.739> Gary's<00:03:38.660> gems<00:03:39.660> in<00:03:39.930> a<00:03:40.019> box<00:03:40.290> and

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
used was the Gary's gems in a box and

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
work at one spot at a time and what I

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.010 
work at one spot at a time and what I
did<00:05:25.190> was<00:05:25.430> say<00:05:25.910> for<00:05:26.120> instance<00:05:26.510> if<00:05:26.630> I<00:05:26.720> was<00:05:26.840> gonna

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020

do<00:05:27.230> this<00:05:27.380> portion<00:05:28.010> of<00:05:28.340> the<00:05:28.580> shoe<00:05:28.820> I<00:05:29.090> will<00:05:29.510> place

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
do this portion of the shoe I will place

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.490 
do this portion of the shoe I will place
the<00:05:30.020> glue<00:05:30.260> and<00:05:30.800> I<00:05:30.950> would<00:05:31.100> use<00:05:31.400> a<00:05:31.930> old<00:05:32.930> makeup

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
the glue and I would use a old makeup

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.130 
the glue and I would use a old makeup
brush<00:05:33.770> as<00:05:34.580> you<00:05:34.790> can<00:05:34.970> see<00:05:35.120> it<00:05:35.270> still<00:05:35.510> has<00:05:35.540> glue

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 
brush as you can see it still has glue

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.130 
brush as you can see it still has glue
on<00:05:36.830> it<00:05:36.860> but<00:05:37.430> you<00:05:37.550> can<00:05:38.060> use<00:05:38.240> like<00:05:38.450> an<00:05:38.630> old<00:05:38.870> makeup

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.140 
on it but you can use like an old makeup

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.400 
on it but you can use like an old makeup
brush<00:05:39.620> and<00:05:40.610> you<00:05:41.330> would<00:05:41.480> just<00:05:41.720> move<00:05:41.990> the<00:05:42.200> glue

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
brush and you would just move the glue

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.080 
brush and you would just move the glue
out<00:05:42.440> really<00:05:42.950> smoothly<00:05:43.280> so<00:05:43.700> you<00:05:43.760> don't<00:05:43.970> have

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
out really smoothly so you don't have

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.610 
out really smoothly so you don't have
big<00:05:44.390> globs<00:05:44.690> of<00:05:44.870> glue<00:05:45.080> everywhere

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
big globs of glue everywhere
