I don't see any graphic settings here so
let's<00:00:25.390> see<00:00:26.519> how<00:00:27.519> this<00:00:27.730> game<00:00:28.000> looks<00:00:28.239> like<00:00:28.480> on

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
let's see how this game looks like on

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:52.320 
let's see how this game looks like on
Sonic's<00:00:29.109> policy

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.330 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.690 

it's<00:00:52.810> nice<00:00:52.990> to<00:00:53.320> see<00:00:53.350> that<00:00:53.560> that<00:00:54.220> loading<00:00:54.580> was

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:54.700 
it's nice to see that that loading was

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:08.780 
it's nice to see that that loading was
finished<00:00:55.060> before<00:00:55.560> the<00:00:56.560> dialogue<00:00:56.950> from<00:00:57.250> later

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.900 

yeah<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.510> can<00:01:09.870> see<00:01:10.050> the<00:01:10.230> start<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.160> a<00:01:11.250> tectonic

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 
yeah I can see the start of a tectonic

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.300 
yeah I can see the start of a tectonic
max<00:01:13.370> so<00:01:14.630> the<00:01:15.630> fire<00:01:15.870> end<00:01:16.230> those<00:01:16.740> camera<00:01:17.190> off

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
max so the fire end those camera off

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.850 
max so the fire end those camera off
layers

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:49.880 

very<00:01:21.860> nice

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.070 

the<00:01:50.890> game<00:01:51.070> is<00:01:51.250> running<00:01:51.400> smooth<00:01:51.790> and<00:01:52.150> as<00:01:52.930> you

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
the game is running smooth and as you

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.730 
the game is running smooth and as you
can<00:01:53.230> see<00:01:53.290> the<00:01:53.590> picture<00:01:53.980> are<00:01:54.430> at<00:01:54.730> max<00:01:55.470> set<00:01:56.470> last

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
can see the picture are at max set last

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:04.860 
can see the picture are at max set last
was<00:01:57.160> having<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:58.410> the<00:01:59.410> dew<00:01:59.590> drops<00:02:02.160> and<00:02:03.870> the

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
was having the the dew drops and the

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:11.640 
was having the the dew drops and the
fire<00:02:05.110> is<00:02:06.840> outside<00:02:07.840> on<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.320> building<00:02:09.869> so<00:02:10.869> it<00:02:11.530> is

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
fire is outside on the building so it is

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.350 
fire is outside on the building so it is
running<00:02:11.980> in<00:02:12.100> full<00:02:12.310> effects<00:02:12.760> there<00:02:13.120> is<00:02:13.150> no

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
running in full effects there is no

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:24.190 
running in full effects there is no
doubt

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:32.140 

then<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.469> falling<00:02:25.799> objects<00:02:26.250> are<00:02:26.370> there<00:02:30.680> and

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
then the falling objects are there and

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.300 
then the falling objects are there and
the<00:02:33.150> fog<00:02:33.359> of<00:02:33.510> war<00:02:33.569> is<00:02:34.079> also<00:02:34.319> the<00:02:34.620> hassle<00:02:34.799> it's

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
the fog of war is also the hassle it's

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.610 
the fog of war is also the hassle it's
full<00:02:35.730> effects<00:02:38.450> for<00:02:39.450> graphic<00:02:39.870> scenes<00:02:40.230> this

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
full effects for graphic scenes this

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.699 
full effects for graphic scenes this
very<00:02:41.159> blurriness<00:02:42.030> because<00:02:42.359> of<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.689> depth<00:02:43.560> of

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
very blurriness because of the depth of

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.300 
very blurriness because of the depth of
here<00:02:45.079> rather<00:02:46.079> I<00:02:46.170> should<00:02:46.290> say<00:02:46.500> depth<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:47.099> field

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
here rather I should say depth of field

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.240 
here rather I should say depth of field
not<00:02:47.549> the<00:02:47.760> father

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.800 

and<00:02:53.250> it's<00:02:53.400> as<00:02:53.700> you<00:02:53.849> can<00:02:54.000> see<00:02:54.150> but<00:02:54.389> buttery

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
and it's as you can see but buttery

00:02:54.810 --> 00:04:31.579 
and it's as you can see but buttery
smooth<00:02:55.109> hair

00:04:31.579 --> 00:04:31.589 

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:34.819 

the<00:04:32.099> good<00:04:32.279> thing<00:04:32.519> about<00:04:32.549> this<00:04:33.359> device<00:04:34.349> is<00:04:34.799> that

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:34.829 
the good thing about this device is that

00:04:34.829 --> 00:04:38.509 
the good thing about this device is that
it<00:04:35.339> doesn't<00:04:35.579> run<00:04:35.909> too<00:04:36.149> hard<00:04:37.219> probably<00:04:38.219> they

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:38.519 
it doesn't run too hard probably they

00:04:38.519 --> 00:04:43.909 
it doesn't run too hard probably they
have<00:04:38.639> managed<00:04:38.999> the<00:04:39.889> the<00:04:40.889> thermal<00:04:42.139> the<00:04:43.139> heat<00:04:43.589> I

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
have managed the the thermal the heat I

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.159 
have managed the the thermal the heat I
mean<00:04:44.459> this<00:04:44.999> probably<00:04:45.389> they<00:04:45.539> have<00:04:45.659> managed<00:04:45.989> it

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
mean this probably they have managed it

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:53.089 
mean this probably they have managed it
properly<00:04:47.159> in<00:04:47.369> s<00:04:47.579> 800<00:04:48.299> or<00:04:51.289> or<00:04:52.289> they<00:04:52.889> have

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.099 
properly in s 800 or or they have

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:56.419 
properly in s 800 or or they have
actually<00:04:54.049> it's<00:04:55.049> probably<00:04:55.739> because<00:04:56.189> of<00:04:56.219> the

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:56.429 
actually it's probably because of the

00:04:56.429 --> 00:05:01.639 
actually it's probably because of the
size<00:04:56.669> I'm<00:04:57.209> not<00:04:57.479> so<00:04:57.689> sure<00:04:58.939> but<00:04:59.939> it's<00:05:00.469> not<00:05:01.469> only

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:01.649 
size I'm not so sure but it's not only

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:03.259 
size I'm not so sure but it's not only
that<00:05:01.799> things<00:05:02.189> are<00:05:02.369> running<00:05:02.639> but<00:05:02.849> it's<00:05:03.059> smooth

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:03.269 
that things are running but it's smooth

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:07.939 
that things are running but it's smooth
but<00:05:04.039> the<00:05:05.039> heat<00:05:05.999> is<00:05:06.029> produced<00:05:06.719> less<00:05:07.199> course

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
but the heat is produced less course

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:11.709 
but the heat is produced less course
it's<00:05:08.669> it<00:05:09.119> has<00:05:09.179> been<00:05:09.509> decimated<00:05:09.809> properly

00:05:11.709 --> 00:05:11.719 
it's it has been decimated properly

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:21.959 
it's it has been decimated properly
either<00:05:12.719> one<00:05:12.869> of<00:05:12.899> these

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:21.969 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:24.269 

as<00:05:22.629> you<00:05:22.779> can<00:05:22.899> see<00:05:23.110> it's<00:05:23.499> running<00:05:23.739> very<00:05:24.069> very

00:05:24.269 --> 00:05:24.279 
as you can see it's running very very

00:05:24.279 --> 00:06:51.330 
as you can see it's running very very
smooth

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:51.340
