shaming<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.940> because<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.450> find<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.020> so

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
shaming is because I find it is so

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.650 
shaming is because I find it is so
prevalent<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.340> raw<00:00:41.520> food<00:00:41.760> community<00:00:42.000> it

comments<00:01:08.729> for<00:01:08.850> people<00:01:09.150> online<00:01:09.479> because<00:01:09.689> that

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
comments for people online because that

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.380 
comments for people online because that
is<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.470> nature<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.770> YouTube<00:01:11.280> but<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.030> think

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
is the nature of YouTube but I think

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.240 
is the nature of YouTube but I think
people<00:01:12.510> forget<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.350> those<00:01:13.770> who<00:01:13.979> create

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
people forget that those who create

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.460 
people forget that those who create
YouTube<00:01:14.520> videos<00:01:14.790> are<00:01:15.060> people<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.689> people<00:01:16.200> with

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
YouTube videos are people to people with

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.679 
YouTube videos are people to people with
feelings<00:01:17.040> people<00:01:17.549> who<00:01:17.759> want<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.030> help<00:01:18.210> others

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
feelings people who want to help others

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.469 
feelings people who want to help others
so<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.290> think<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:20.070> comes<00:01:20.220> down<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.490> if<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.360> don't

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
so I think it comes down to if you don't

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.270 
so I think it comes down to if you don't
have<00:01:21.689> anything<00:01:21.900> nice<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.200> say<00:01:22.380> sometimes<00:01:23.009> it's

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
have anything nice to say sometimes it's

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.280 
have anything nice to say sometimes it's
better<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.700> not<00:01:23.850> say<00:01:24.090> anything<00:01:24.420> at<00:01:24.570> all<00:01:24.689> but<00:01:25.259> I

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
better to not say anything at all but I

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.530 
better to not say anything at all but I
find<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.740> people<00:01:25.920> who<00:01:26.490> say<00:01:26.820> nasty<00:01:27.119> things

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
find that people who say nasty things

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.590 
find that people who say nasty things
about<00:01:27.720> my<00:01:28.110> body<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.310> their<00:01:29.729> issue<00:01:29.759> coming

something nice to them and all I'm

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.970 
something nice to them and all I'm
thinking<00:02:51.269> is<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:51.840> maybe<00:02:52.260> in<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.500> raw<00:02:52.739> food

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
thinking is that maybe in the raw food

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.949 
thinking is that maybe in the raw food
community<00:02:53.010> we<00:02:53.640> should<00:02:53.670> stop<00:02:54.239> being<00:02:54.480> so

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
community we should stop being so

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.020 
community we should stop being so
critical<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:55.709> so<00:02:55.920> judgmental<00:02:56.550> of<00:02:56.670> people

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
critical and so judgmental of people

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.640 
critical and so judgmental of people
that<00:02:57.180> we<00:02:57.269> don't<00:02:57.420> even<00:02:57.630> know<00:02:57.959> because<00:02:58.440> you

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
that we don't even know because you

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.620 
that we don't even know because you
never<00:02:58.980> ever<00:02:59.310> know<00:02:59.459> what<00:03:00.120> they're<00:03:00.300> dealing

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
never ever know what they're dealing

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.720 
never ever know what they're dealing
with<00:03:00.660> there<00:03:01.560> are<00:03:01.680> so<00:03:01.830> many<00:03:01.950> ways<00:03:02.160> of<00:03:02.489> providing

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
with there are so many ways of providing

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.850 
with there are so many ways of providing
constructive<00:03:03.450> criticism<00:03:03.989> and<00:03:04.140> I<00:03:04.440> really

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
constructive criticism and I really

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.440 
constructive criticism and I really
don't<00:03:05.010> think<00:03:05.160> that<00:03:05.370> fat<00:03:05.610> shaming<00:03:05.880> is<00:03:06.090> one<00:03:06.330> of

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
don't think that fat shaming is one of

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.690 
don't think that fat shaming is one of
them<00:03:06.570> I<00:03:06.750> think<00:03:07.230> instead<00:03:07.890> maybe<00:03:08.160> we<00:03:08.400> could<00:03:08.519> try

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
them I think instead maybe we could try

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.460 
them I think instead maybe we could try
to<00:03:08.730> encourage<00:03:09.450> others<00:03:09.780> who<00:03:10.019> are<00:03:10.110> trying<00:03:10.320> to

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
to encourage others who are trying to

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.170 
to encourage others who are trying to
get<00:03:10.590> healthy<00:03:10.950> no<00:03:11.370> matter<00:03:11.549> where<00:03:11.820> they're<00:03:12.000> at

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
get healthy no matter where they're at

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.420 
feel if someone said something like that
to<00:03:36.000> you<00:03:36.180> but<00:03:36.750> either<00:03:36.900> way<00:03:37.049> we<00:03:37.200> all<00:03:37.680> have<00:03:38.100> our

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
dealing with especially as women because

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.080 
dealing with especially as women because
there<00:03:42.959> is<00:03:43.079> so<00:03:43.440> much<00:03:43.860> pressure<00:03:44.280> placed<00:03:44.700> on<00:03:44.940> us

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
there is so much pressure placed on us

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.270 
there is so much pressure placed on us
in<00:03:45.269> society<00:03:45.870> just<00:03:46.500> because<00:03:46.799> someone<00:03:47.160> doesn't

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
in society just because someone doesn't

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.180 
in society just because someone doesn't

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
own health journey and it's really

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.340 
own health journey and it's really
important<00:03:56.370> I<00:03:56.489> think<00:03:56.610> to<00:03:57.329> respect<00:03:57.750> that<00:03:57.840> and<00:03:58.170> if

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
important I think to respect that and if

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.930 
important I think to respect that and if
you<00:03:58.650> can't<00:03:58.920> respect<00:03:59.070> it<00:03:59.400> then<00:03:59.549> at<00:03:59.640> least<00:03:59.730> go

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
you can't respect it then at least go

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.520 
you can't respect it then at least go
somewhere<00:04:00.420> else<00:04:00.630> where<00:04:00.900> you<00:04:00.989> can<00:04:01.170> respect

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
somewhere else where you can respect

shaming separates us all as women when I
feel<00:04:07.109> we<00:04:07.290> should<00:04:07.320> be<00:04:07.650> banding<00:04:08.190> together<00:04:08.370> and

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
feel we should be banding together and

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.390 
feel we should be banding together and
supporting<00:04:09.420> one<00:04:09.570> another<00:04:09.600> in<00:04:10.170> our<00:04:10.709> bodies<00:04:11.130> and
