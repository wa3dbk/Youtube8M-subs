00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
step-by-step what you need to build what

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:12.709 
step-by-step what you need to build what
materials<00:00:11.969> you<00:00:12.030> need<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:12.360> stuff<00:00:12.509> like<00:00:12.660> that

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
materials you need and stuff like that

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.600 
materials you need and stuff like that
but<00:00:13.139> there's<00:00:13.620> going<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.860> be<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:13.950> link<00:00:14.219> going

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
it will be in the description box or the

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.640 
it will be in the description box or the
yeah<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.180> description<00:00:18.630> box<00:00:18.779> below<00:00:18.900> so<00:00:19.320> you

guys<00:00:19.800> can<00:00:20.010> see<00:00:20.279> every<00:00:20.760> step<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.180> need<00:00:21.390> to

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
guys can see every step that you need to

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.120 
guys can see every step that you need to
do<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.810> get<00:00:22.439> through<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:22.650> i<00:00:22.680> didn't<00:00:22.859> want<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.039> do

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
do to get through it i didn't want to do

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.349 
do to get through it i didn't want to do
a<00:00:23.160> step-by-step<00:00:23.580> because<00:00:23.939> i<00:00:23.970> would<00:00:24.119> take<00:00:24.210> like

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
a step-by-step because i would take like

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.179 
a step-by-step because i would take like
three<00:00:24.689> hours<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:25.320> i<00:00:25.410> have<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.650> make<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:25.859> parts

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
three hours and i have to make it parts

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.740 
three hours and i have to make it parts
of<00:00:26.279> videos<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.789> just<00:00:27.029> beat<00:00:27.180> or<00:00:27.300> obligated

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
of videos and it just beat or obligated

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.269 
of videos and it just beat or obligated
so<00:00:28.320> i<00:00:28.410> thought<00:00:28.529> i'd<00:00:28.650> go<00:00:28.769> ahead<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.099> just

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
so i thought i'd go ahead and just

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.040 
so i thought i'd go ahead and just
compile<00:00:29.670> like<00:00:29.939> 60<00:00:30.300> minutes<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.660> footage<00:00:30.840> and

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
compile like 60 minutes of footage and

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.659 
compile like 60 minutes of footage and
then<00:00:31.170> speed<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.439> up<00:00:31.590> like<00:00:31.800> eight<00:00:32.040> times<00:00:32.279> and

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
then speed it up like eight times and

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.130 
then speed it up like eight times and
then<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.239> only<00:00:33.360> ends<00:00:33.570> up<00:00:33.630> being<00:00:33.780> like<00:00:33.870> six

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
then it only ends up being like six

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.330 
then it only ends up being like six
minutes<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.440> footage<00:00:34.620> so<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.070> works<00:00:35.219> out

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
minutes of footage so it works out

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.850 
minutes of footage so it works out
pretty<00:00:35.460> well<00:00:35.610> so<00:00:36.290> let's<00:00:37.290> go<00:00:37.410> into<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.649> video

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
pretty well so let's go into the video

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.069 
pretty well so let's go into the video
now<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:39.149> link<00:00:39.450> that's<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:39.989> the

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
now so that link that's in the

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.990 
now so that link that's in the
description<00:00:40.610> basically<00:00:41.610> i<00:00:41.640> just<00:00:41.670> followed

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
description basically i just followed

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.930 
description basically i just followed
that<00:00:42.239> step<00:00:42.510> by<00:00:42.660> step<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.370> actually<00:00:44.370> what<00:00:44.910> i

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
that step by step and actually what i

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.970 
that step by step and actually what i
did<00:00:45.180> wrong<00:00:45.210> with<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.899> whole<00:00:46.050> thing<00:00:46.230> was<00:00:46.410> the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
did wrong with the whole thing was the

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.740 
did wrong with the whole thing was the
list<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.430> materials<00:00:47.640> in<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.149> beginning<00:00:48.300> I

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
list of materials in the beginning I

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.439 
list of materials in the beginning I
didn't<00:00:49.350> buy<00:00:49.649> right<00:00:50.250> then<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.610> actually<00:00:50.789> kind<00:00:51.420> of

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
didn't buy right then I actually kind of

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.029 
didn't buy right then I actually kind of
just<00:00:51.600> waited<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.140> bought<00:00:52.320> them<00:00:52.500> as<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.710> needed

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
just waited and bought them as I needed

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.860 
just waited and bought them as I needed
them<00:00:53.160> which<00:00:53.610> made<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.940> kind<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.210> tough<00:00:54.570> for<00:00:54.809> me

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
them which made it kind of tough for me

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.540 
them which made it kind of tough for me
because<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.170> couldn't<00:00:55.530> farm<00:00:55.980> for<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.340> most

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
because I couldn't farm for the most

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.119 
because I couldn't farm for the most
cheap<00:00:56.870> price<00:00:57.870> if<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.469> wanted<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.829> rush<00:00:58.980> through

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
cheap price if I wanted to rush through

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.130 
cheap price if I wanted to rush through
this<00:00:59.219> like<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.489> did<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.910> actually<00:01:00.390> had<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.719> go<00:01:00.930> and

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
this like I did I actually had to go and

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.630 
this like I did I actually had to go and
mine<00:01:01.320> from<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.590> most<00:01:01.739> expensive<00:01:02.070> price<00:01:02.399> or

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
mine from the most expensive price or

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.160 
mine from the most expensive price or
had<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.910> try<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.180> get<00:01:03.390> somebody<00:01:03.539> killed<00:01:03.870> right

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
had to try to get somebody killed right

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.719 
had to try to get somebody killed right
away<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.920> kind<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.129> made<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.339> tough<00:01:05.489> it's<00:01:05.670> a

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
away and I kind of made it tough it's a

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.370 
away and I kind of made it tough it's a
lot<00:01:05.880> easier<00:01:05.909> if<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.299> just<00:01:06.330> wait<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.960> get<00:01:07.229> all

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
lot easier if you just wait and get all

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.469 
lot easier if you just wait and get all
the<00:01:07.470> materials<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.159> need<00:01:08.400> so<00:01:08.640> i<00:01:08.909> may

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
the materials that you need so i may

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.240 
the materials that you need so i may
feel<00:01:09.720> cheap<00:01:10.020> actually<00:01:10.470> doing<00:01:10.740> engineering<00:01:11.070> in

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
feel cheap actually doing engineering in

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.440 
feel cheap actually doing engineering in
the<00:01:11.310> beginning<00:01:11.460> because<00:01:11.820> you're<00:01:12.119> just<00:01:12.299> buying

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
the beginning because you're just buying

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.940 
the beginning because you're just buying
like<00:01:12.630> stones<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.260> stuff<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.590> that's<00:01:13.740> not

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
like stones and stuff and that's not

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.370 
like stones and stuff and that's not
very<00:01:14.130> much<00:01:14.340> money<00:01:14.369> maybe<00:01:14.790> like<00:01:15.000> 1k<00:01:15.450> i<00:01:15.689> just<00:01:16.290> to

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
very much money maybe like 1k i just to

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.990 
very much money maybe like 1k i just to
get<00:01:16.500> up<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.680> like<00:01:16.770> 100<00:01:17.340> but<00:01:17.729> then<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:17.939> gets

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
get up to like 100 but then it gets

now we're post @ % on the right side of

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.470 
now we're post @ % on the right side of
like<00:02:51.340> if<00:02:51.460> it's<00:02:51.580> a<00:02:51.610> hundred<00:02:51.760> percent<00:02:52.030> it'd<00:02:52.360> be

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
like if it's a hundred percent it'd be

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.940 
like if it's a hundred percent it'd be
like<00:02:52.600> the<00:02:52.780> normal<00:02:53.170> price<00:02:53.350> or<00:02:53.680> if<00:02:53.770> it's<00:02:53.890> like

like the normal price or if it's like
sixty<00:02:54.460> percent<00:02:54.610> that<00:02:54.850> means<00:02:54.970> it's<00:02:55.120> really

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
sixty percent that means it's really

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.570 
sixty percent that means it's really
cheap<00:02:55.660> it's<00:02:56.260> almost<00:02:56.380> half<00:02:56.770> with<00:02:57.100> Roman<00:02:57.370> price

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
cheap it's almost half with Roman price

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.360 
cheap it's almost half with Roman price
or<00:02:58.210> if<00:02:58.390> it's<00:02:58.600> like<00:02:58.830> if<00:02:59.830> it's<00:02:59.980> like<00:03:00.100> two<00:03:00.280> hundred

or if it's like if it's like two hundred

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.980 
or if it's like if it's like two hundred
percent<00:03:00.730> you<00:03:00.820> know<00:03:00.850> it's<00:03:01.030> way<00:03:01.180> overpriced<00:03:01.420> and

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
of copper bolts but to build copper

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.500 
of copper bolts but to build copper
bolts<00:03:41.500> you<00:03:42.040> need<00:03:42.310> like<00:03:42.640> three<00:03:43.240> different

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
bolts you need like three different

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.640 
bolts you need like three different
types<00:03:43.630> of<00:03:43.720> materials<00:03:44.170> and<00:03:44.260> you<00:03:44.500> have<00:03:44.620> like

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
types of materials and you have like

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.170 
types of materials and you have like
some<00:03:45.040> tube<00:03:45.280> right<00:03:45.490> there<00:03:45.640> so<00:03:45.790> you<00:03:45.850> need<00:03:46.060> like

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
some tube right there so you need like

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.280 
some tube right there so you need like
three<00:03:46.420> different<00:03:46.570> types<00:03:46.780> of<00:03:46.840> material<00:03:47.230> to

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
three different types of material to

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.140 
three different types of material to
build<00:03:47.470> that<00:03:47.770> so<00:03:48.370> it<00:03:48.520> gets<00:03:48.580> really<00:03:48.910> confusing

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
build that so it gets really confusing

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.550 
build that so it gets really confusing
if<00:03:49.570> you<00:03:49.630> don't<00:03:49.780> get<00:03:49.870> all<00:03:49.959> the<00:03:50.050> materials<00:03:50.470> in

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
if you don't get all the materials in

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.830 
if you don't get all the materials in
the<00:03:50.620> beginning<00:03:50.940> just<00:03:51.940> really<00:03:52.630> really

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
the beginning just really really

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.440 
the beginning just really really
confusing<00:03:53.470> so<00:03:53.709> you<00:03:54.640> can<00:03:54.760> see<00:03:54.910> here<00:03:55.120> just<00:03:55.300> going

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
confusing so you can see here just going

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.910 
confusing so you can see here just going
back<00:03:55.660> to<00:03:55.720> the<00:03:55.900> auction<00:03:56.020> house<00:03:56.380> getting<00:03:56.620> a<00:03:56.680> lot

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
more of the mats and really I thought in

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.080 
more of the mats and really I thought in
the<00:04:00.040> beginning<00:04:00.130> it<00:04:00.400> cost<00:04:00.580> like<00:04:00.700> four<00:04:00.970> or<00:04:01.060> five

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
the beginning it cost like four or five

level because it's not really grinding I

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.120

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
you have to go and grind all the low

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.240 
you have to go and grind all the low
level<00:04:45.020> areas<00:04:45.560> and<00:04:45.650> then<00:04:45.770> move<00:04:45.920> up<00:04:46.070> to<00:04:46.220> the

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
level areas and then move up to the

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.740 
level areas and then move up to the
higher<00:04:46.490> level<00:04:46.820> areas<00:04:47.150> and<00:04:47.240> it<00:04:47.330> takes<00:04:47.480> up<00:04:47.600> like

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
higher level areas and it takes up like

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.440 
higher level areas and it takes up like
a<00:04:47.810> few<00:04:48.050> hours<00:04:48.080> for<00:04:49.010> this<00:04:49.250> shakes<00:04:50.030> like<00:04:50.180> an<00:04:50.300> hour

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
a few hours for this shakes like an hour

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:51.610 
a few hours for this shakes like an hour
and<00:04:50.630> a<00:04:50.660> half<00:04:50.840> if<00:04:51.020> you<00:04:51.080> already<00:04:51.170> have<00:04:51.350> the<00:04:51.380> match

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
and a half if you already have the match

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.740 
and a half if you already have the match
it<00:04:51.890> just<00:04:52.040> takes<00:04:52.190> the<00:04:52.280> time<00:04:52.520> to<00:04:52.550> click<00:04:53.090> create

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
it just takes the time to click create

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.860 
it just takes the time to click create
and<00:04:53.990> that<00:04:54.500> takes<00:04:54.650> like<00:04:55.060> 10<00:04:56.060> seconds<00:04:56.540> to<00:04:56.750> 30

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
and that takes like 10 seconds to 30

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.060 
and that takes like 10 seconds to 30
seconds<00:04:57.290> depending<00:04:57.410> on<00:04:57.800> what<00:04:57.950> you're

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
seconds depending on what you're

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.380 
seconds depending on what you're
building<00:04:58.160> something<00:04:58.550> things<00:04:59.120> like<00:04:59.270> I'm

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
building something things like I'm

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.550 
building something things like I'm
minute<00:04:59.600> and<00:04:59.690> a<00:04:59.750> half<00:04:59.780> for<00:05:00.080> like<00:05:00.170> if<00:05:00.380> you're

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
minute and a half for like if you're

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.690 
minute and a half for like if you're
building<00:05:00.710> a<00:05:00.890> gun<00:05:01.130> or<00:05:01.310> something<00:05:01.340> like<00:05:01.610> that

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
building a gun or something like that

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:07.390 
building a gun or something like that
but<00:05:03.220> yeah<00:05:04.390> also<00:05:05.390> the<00:05:06.020> yeah<00:05:06.530> the<00:05:06.680> tide<00:05:07.070> wreck<00:05:07.280> it

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
but yeah also the yeah the tide wreck it

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.830 
but yeah also the yeah the tide wreck it
pretty<00:05:07.460> easy<00:05:07.730> just<00:05:07.910> because<00:05:08.180> all<00:05:08.330> of<00:05:08.360> that<00:05:08.600> but

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
pretty easy just because all of that but

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.960 
pretty easy just because all of that but
also<00:05:09.050> it's<00:05:09.440> probably<00:05:10.100> the<00:05:10.460> most<00:05:10.610> expensive

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
also it's probably the most expensive

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.580 
also it's probably the most expensive
like<00:05:11.450> I've<00:05:11.570> said<00:05:11.600> a<00:05:11.750> million<00:05:11.900> times<00:05:11.990> just<00:05:12.260> the

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
like I've said a million times just the

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.000 
like I've said a million times just the
most<00:05:12.800> expensive<00:05:13.960> the<00:05:14.960> profession<00:05:15.530> into<00:05:15.620> level

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
most expensive the profession into level

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.890 
most expensive the profession into level
because<00:05:16.580> you<00:05:16.730> can't<00:05:16.970> actually<00:05:17.240> have<00:05:17.690> one

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
because you can't actually have one

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.150 
because you can't actually have one
profession<00:05:18.500> like<00:05:18.650> if<00:05:18.770> you<00:05:18.890> were<00:05:18.980> doing

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
profession like if you were doing

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.250 
profession like if you were doing
leatherworking<00:05:19.700> or<00:05:20.300> leather<00:05:20.630> yeah<00:05:21.080> i<00:05:21.110> think

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
leatherworking or leather yeah i think

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.540 
leatherworking or leather yeah i think
it's<00:05:21.410> leatherworking<00:05:21.800> you<00:05:22.250> wouldn't

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
it's leatherworking you wouldn't

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.520 
it's leatherworking you wouldn't
actually<00:05:22.700> it<00:05:23.270> like<00:05:23.690> it<00:05:23.810> would<00:05:23.960> be<00:05:24.050> hard<00:05:24.320> if<00:05:24.440> you

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
actually it like it would be hard if you

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.320 
actually it like it would be hard if you
were<00:05:24.650> like<00:05:24.800> mining<00:05:25.400> and<00:05:25.580> leatherworking<00:05:26.030> but

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
were like mining and leatherworking but

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.350 
were like mining and leatherworking but
if<00:05:26.420> you<00:05:26.480> had<00:05:26.570> skinning<00:05:27.880> really<00:05:28.880> easy<00:05:29.030> and<00:05:29.300> that

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
if you had skinning really easy and that

why<00:05:45.620> I<00:05:45.650> started<00:05:45.950> doing<00:05:46.160> engineering<00:05:46.550> so<00:05:46.730> I

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
why I started doing engineering so I

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.310 
why I started doing engineering so I
really<00:05:47.000> wanted<00:05:47.180> the<00:05:47.270> speed<00:05:47.480> boats<00:05:47.660> so<00:05:48.110> I<00:05:48.170> could

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
really wanted the speed boats so I could

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.960 
really wanted the speed boats so I could
mess<00:05:48.470> with<00:05:48.500> drugs<00:05:48.710> and<00:05:49.100> stuff<00:05:49.280> and<00:05:49.490> then<00:05:49.640> blow

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970 
mess with drugs and stuff and then blow

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:51.910 
mess with drugs and stuff and then blow
up<00:05:50.180> and<00:05:50.360> all<00:05:50.480> that<00:05:50.600> fun<00:05:50.750> stuff<00:05:50.810> and<00:05:51.230> here<00:05:51.830> you

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:51.920 
up and all that fun stuff and here you

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.530 
up and all that fun stuff and here you
can<00:05:51.980> see<00:05:52.160> I'm<00:05:52.250> almost<00:05:52.670> there<00:05:52.880> and<00:05:53.270> I<00:05:53.330> actually

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:53.540 
can see I'm almost there and I actually

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.360 
can see I'm almost there and I actually
had<00:05:54.020> to<00:05:54.140> cut<00:05:54.380> a<00:05:54.410> few<00:05:54.680> times<00:05:54.890> there<00:05:55.070> because<00:05:55.340> I

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
had to cut a few times there because I

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.190 
had to cut a few times there because I
didn't<00:05:55.700> have<00:05:55.820> enough<00:05:56.540> money<00:05:56.780> to<00:05:57.020> buy<00:05:57.140> the

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.200 
didn't have enough money to buy the

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.570 
didn't have enough money to buy the
match<00:05:57.470> and<00:05:57.620> you<00:05:57.710> can<00:05:57.830> see<00:05:57.950> my<00:05:57.980> money<00:05:58.280> is<00:05:58.370> like

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
match and you can see my money is like

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.030 
match and you can see my money is like
300<00:05:59.210> right<00:05:59.330> now<00:05:59.480> and<00:05:59.570> I'm<00:05:59.660> like<00:05:59.810> oh<00:06:00.050> I'll<00:06:00.920> just

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:01.040 
300 right now and I'm like oh I'll just

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.530 
300 right now and I'm like oh I'll just
buy<00:06:01.310> all<00:06:01.490> this<00:06:01.640> stuff<00:06:01.700> and<00:06:02.120> it<00:06:02.180> would<00:06:02.420> really

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:02.540 
buy all this stuff and it would really

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.150 
buy all this stuff and it would really
cheap<00:06:02.870> actually<00:06:03.350> it<00:06:03.410> was<00:06:03.470> like<00:06:03.620> twenty<00:06:03.950> nine

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
cheap actually it was like twenty nine

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.800 
cheap actually it was like twenty nine
percent<00:06:04.700> of<00:06:04.880> its<00:06:05.030> normal<00:06:05.180> price<00:06:05.540> which<00:06:05.780> is

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
percent of its normal price which is

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.500 
percent of its normal price which is
ridiculous<00:06:06.590> I<00:06:06.710> bottle<00:06:07.040> like<00:06:07.280> all<00:06:07.430> of<00:06:07.610> them<00:06:07.730> and

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:08.510 
ridiculous I bottle like all of them and

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:09.850 
ridiculous I bottle like all of them and
then<00:06:08.630> I<00:06:08.690> had<00:06:08.780> open<00:06:09.320> all<00:06:09.470> which<00:06:09.620> you<00:06:09.740> can<00:06:09.830> see

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
then I had open all which you can see

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.230 
then I had open all which you can see
right<00:06:09.950> there<00:06:10.190> and<00:06:10.340> it<00:06:10.610> just<00:06:10.820> zips<00:06:11.060> right

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
right there and it just zips right

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.740 
right there and it just zips right
through<00:06:11.450> them<00:06:11.590> which<00:06:12.590> is<00:06:12.740> awesome<00:06:12.890> so

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
through them which is awesome so

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.000 
through them which is awesome so
definitely<00:06:14.750> the<00:06:15.050> ending<00:06:15.410> is<00:06:15.590> the<00:06:15.800> most

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.010 
definitely the ending is the most

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.250 
definitely the ending is the most
expensive<00:06:16.220> costing<00:06:16.940> a<00:06:17.060> ton<00:06:17.240> of<00:06:17.270> money<00:06:17.450> and<00:06:17.720> you

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260 
expensive costing a ton of money and you

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260 
expensive costing a ton of money and you
can<00:06:18.380> see<00:06:18.560> here<00:06:19.400> I<00:06:19.610> don't<00:06:19.880> know<00:06:19.970> I'm<00:06:20.090> doing

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.270 
can see here I don't know I'm doing

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.200 
can see here I don't know I'm doing
there<00:06:20.390> we<00:06:20.480> go<00:06:20.570> okay<00:06:20.870> so<00:06:20.930> back<00:06:21.830> to<00:06:22.010> this<00:06:22.210> another

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
there we go okay so back to this another

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.460 
there we go okay so back to this another
thing<00:06:23.420> that's<00:06:23.540> really<00:06:23.600> frustrating<00:06:23.990> is<00:06:24.350> the

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470 
thing that's really frustrating is the

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.070 
thing that's really frustrating is the
volatile<00:06:24.920> Earth's<00:06:25.220> and<00:06:25.730> airs<00:06:26.240> and<00:06:26.660> waters<00:06:26.960> and

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 
volatile Earth's and airs and waters and

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.630 
volatile Earth's and airs and waters and
whatnot<00:06:27.320> those<00:06:27.560> took<00:06:27.800> a<00:06:27.830> long<00:06:28.070> time<00:06:28.100> to<00:06:28.310> get

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:28.640 
whatnot those took a long time to get

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.610 
whatnot those took a long time to get
because<00:06:29.300> they<00:06:29.630> weren't<00:06:29.810> in<00:06:30.020> my<00:06:30.050> auction<00:06:30.500> house

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:30.620 
because they weren't in my auction house

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.870 
because they weren't in my auction house
and<00:06:30.950> I<00:06:31.010> don't<00:06:31.190> know<00:06:31.250> if<00:06:31.340> how<00:06:31.460> they<00:06:31.610> are<00:06:31.700> for

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 
and I don't know if how they are for

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.580 
and I don't know if how they are for
your<00:06:32.030> server<00:06:32.330> but<00:06:32.630> for<00:06:32.780> my<00:06:32.930> service<00:06:33.320> and<00:06:33.500> so

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
your server but for my service and so

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.230 
your server but for my service and so
the<00:06:33.680> lower<00:06:33.830> populated<00:06:34.460> one<00:06:34.610> it's<00:06:35.090> definitely

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240 
the lower populated one it's definitely

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.630 
the lower populated one it's definitely
way<00:06:35.570> tougher<00:06:35.990> so<00:06:36.440> anyways<00:06:36.710> I<00:06:36.830> just<00:06:37.010> hit<00:06:37.130> 525

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:37.640 
way tougher so anyways I just hit 525

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.190 
way tougher so anyways I just hit 525
