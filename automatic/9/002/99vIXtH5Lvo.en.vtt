weapon will duplicate and you can rely

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.940 
weapon will duplicate and you can rely
more<00:01:07.979> times<00:01:08.340> if<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.880> want<00:01:09.229> or<00:01:10.229> they<00:01:10.380> stayed

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
more times if you want or they stayed

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.800 
more times if you want or they stayed
with<00:01:11.130> locating<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:12.270> can<00:01:12.420> pick<00:01:12.570> them<00:01:12.720> up

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
with locating and you can pick them up

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.560 
with locating and you can pick them up
it<00:01:13.229> also<00:01:13.439> works<00:01:13.890> actually<00:01:14.189> with<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.729> reworking

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
it also works actually with a reworking

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.410 
it also works actually with a reworking
like<00:01:16.049> that<00:01:16.320> probably<00:01:17.280> they<00:01:17.670> will<00:01:17.700> float<00:01:18.240> away

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
like that probably they will float away

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.370 
like that probably they will float away
sometimes<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.860> hard<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.400> pick<00:01:20.670> them<00:01:20.820> up

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.940 

eventually<00:01:24.369> they<00:01:24.549> will<00:01:24.700> fall<00:01:25.119> on<00:01:25.299> your<00:01:25.509> boat
