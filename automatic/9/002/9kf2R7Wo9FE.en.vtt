00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.920
 ah 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.970
 Welcome to the iberostar paradise hotel 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.290
 sea ​​and beach here in mexico 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.540
 my name is juan jose on vila and 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.090
 I have the honor and pleasure of directing 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.610
 this hotel which is located 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.410
 in the middle of the mayan riviera since 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.769
 we started with this project we have 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.120
 Adopted best practices 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:54.050
 sustainable with our collaborators 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.260
 and also with our guests 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.300
 we forge a learning culture 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.460
 ecological in the same way with our 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.489
 collaborators and our guests who 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.489
 it helps us to be a better company 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.489
 sustainable 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.130
 in the course of this certification 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.370
 we have learned to improve some of 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.890
 so our environmental practices 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:36.550
 internal and I would like to mention them 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.790
 some of them first with him 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.920
 with regard to the energy issue we have 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.560
 been working with all the change of the 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.760
 lighting system with we have passed 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.920
 of dichroic lights density lights 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.050
 strong power to handle all the 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.960
 system of lights with LEDs which 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.090
 its cold and light of very low consumption 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.350
 also what we are doing at the level 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.350
 of energy is in the low seasons 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.460
 we concentrate our buildings 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.679
 blocking in that way some of 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.630
 them thus reducing the areas 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.130
 lighting and conditioning 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.620
 also taking advantage of giving them a 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.990
 maintenance in this case because this we 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.910
 It also helps to not be wasting money 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.540
 somehow the energy that is not 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.980
 also necessary in terms of water 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.230
 We are very happy to have a 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.550
 water collection system 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.080
 residual 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.580
 if we go to our industrial area 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.470
 since it's a very resort area 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.030
 great and what we do is carry everything 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.800
 that residual water of all 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.010
 rooms of all our areas of 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.580
 service which we passed to our 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.770
 old water plant and we handle it 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.260
 to do the entire irrigation system of 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.440
 The entire resort included our field of 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.660
 Golf 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.870
 another one of the interesting areas is 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.730
 our transport vehicular area 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.320
 which 80 percent of it 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.790
 we drive with cars that go with battery 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.670
 thus reducing gas emissions 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.200
 for gasoline gasoline combustion and we 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.120
 we handle with transportation of guests 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.340
 transport of luggage and transport 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.820
 internal with this with this means of 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:17.150
 carts per battery also gives us 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.370
 very glad that we were able to start a 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.740
 awareness campaign with our 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:25.040
 collaborators starting from the base of 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:28.280
 recycling of all types of material 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.880
 we have been learning to separate the 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:35.150
 glass the glass the cardboard the paper the 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:38.690
 plastic what is aluminum and so on 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:41.330
 including also waste so 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.930
 toxicity that arise from the maintenance of 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.430
 this type of resorts 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.700
 We do this from the rooms 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.079
 already from the guest and from the maid 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.689
 that between the rooms because 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:54.549
 we are doing that separation all are 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:56.200
 They gather all the areas in the bars in 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.750
 the kitchens in stores in the 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.930
 warehouses everything is separated waste and 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:05.349
 it is taken to a central nation from which 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.840
 of them is distributed outside the hotel to 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.720
 the different companies that collect 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.290
 this waste 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.720
 we also love the way we 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.420
 we have been able to help our 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.630
 collaborator and especially for a subject 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:24.750
 social 'around what is the 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.270
 cleanings of the beaches both in the area 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:31.170
 of our hotels in the local area and 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:33.420
 also in the area of ​​the environment of 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.630
 population of the municipality so that 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:40.860
 as an example, we encourage cleaning in 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:43.020
 beaches of the city on other beaches 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.900
 environments not only our where 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.880
 we involve the families of our 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.330
 collaborators making this an event 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:54.330
 So social and we want this to be 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:57.110
 help to create that awareness of help 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:00.780
 with the environment of responsibility 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:03.270
 also in this hotel of 812 rooms 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.390
 here as I was telling you in the middle of the 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:10.820
 riviera maya is a hotel within 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:14.200
 this resort has the most wildlife 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.730
 flora in terms of extension therefore 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.700
 since its construction 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:22.310
 now 13 years since we are involved 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.620
 a lot in keeping all the parts 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.960
 natural in the same way that 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.540
 originally they were adapting also 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.520
 Well, keeping the mangroves 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:34.910
 maintaining the entire cenote area that 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.740
 we were discovering and in this 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:40.490
 case then also with the issue of 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.770
 fauna is a hotel which we have 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.330
 a great diversity of native fauna and 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.100
 some of them also because 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.340
 we keep in our areas of 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:53.090
 natural protection as they are flamingos 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:56.750
 Native wildlife are swans, macaws, 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:59.360
 the four of you see that it's free and 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:02.060
 various animals has been a pleasure 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.430
 share with you this time and not 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.950
 have been able to know a little more and
