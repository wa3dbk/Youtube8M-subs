00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.829
 and ferrari joined this 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.639
 the sound of this engine takes over the city 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.639
 from siena in italy 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.620
 ferrari california now has this your 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.620
 side of the name 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.270
 after 25 years the turbo returns to 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.510
 street cars full of brand 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.510
 vitality 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.270
 California even set up a motor 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.969
 completely different in this version of the 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.710
 biturbo engine are two turns on the side 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.840
 and here in the car 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.980
 Can you see these animals? 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.079
 watch here 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.110
 if you just gave a ring you will 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.720
 know the efficiency of the tube from 0 to 100% 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.030
 one hundred percent means everything is full 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.530
 ready to work on the engine and 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.879
 you give another touch you see the 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.159
 pressure and bar né 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.690
 how much pressure is putting on and that without 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.970
 the so-called turbo leg 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.289
 that is the delay of the response of the 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.289
 throttle was triggered 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.150
 turbo engines once or 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.490
 accelerated and after a certain time 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.620
 Did you feel that lock that 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.570
 celebration in the car and if not 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.970
 they placed a smaller turbine like this. 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.620
 She fills this tube faster here. 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.100
 ready to work almost 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.100
 immediately 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.270
 f 40 marked the farewell of the tube in the 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.760
 ferrari street cars in the 80's 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.870
 when the turbo is also used in the 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.050
 formula 1 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:48.950
 if at that time the goal was power 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:51.410
 today everything has another mission too 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.479
 development of this engine came here 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.070
 along with the development of engines 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.590
 Formula 1 turbos 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.970
 an atheist is the performance leader of 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.990
 ferrari will explain a little to us 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.119
 of that kilo engine 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.920
 the only reason for cuiabá amon in 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.509
 product by technology we translate the 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.970
 turbo in California to have more 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.729
 horses consumption reduction and above all 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.709
 greater autonomy to join and consume a 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.510
 super current I do not lie for autonomy 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.370
 they put the tube a little more 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.370
 down the center of gravity 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:25.220
 the engine and also to improve the 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:27.920
 dynamics of the gases that are going to 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.840
 cloudy california has half-liter v8 engine 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.890
 smaller than the aspirated version of the 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:37.519
 entry with 49% more touch consumes about 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:40.880
 15% less fuel by 15% more than 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:44.150
 autonomy emits 20% less pollutants and 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.459
 still has 70 more horses 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.290
 to achieve this result the motor is 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.739
 smaller and has a corner with more marches. 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.739
 long 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.190
 one thing they worked very hard for 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.100
 in this engine was the sound quality they 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.290
 practically imitate the sound of the 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.480
 then hoisted what was done here 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.560
 these pipes here are from the exhaust 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:11.130
 they managed to keep the distance right 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:14.190
 is the size of them equal to each 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.550
 shirt then what happens there is size 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:27.120
 him and everyone else make the sound 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:29.280
 much like aspiring our side is 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.320
 always raucous 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.810
 This one doing a good job here . 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.390
 he did not lose his identity 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.950
 the engine in but in the background gives 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.950
 to realize that motor of the world 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.319
 ae 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.830
 today this car in all situations of the 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.410
 sun in the rain on the city on the highway that 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.600
 ceiling that opened the fashion 14 seconds and 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.640
 freed from a good pain sequinho 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.560
 but now it's gone for nothing now 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.570
 is in the reserve we walked over 300 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.870
 kilometers and O left a taste of 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.870
 I want more 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.660
 i
