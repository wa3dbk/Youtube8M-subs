00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.600 
you know her training has not gone the
way<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.390> would<00:01:48.690> have<00:01:48.810> chosen<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.710> know<00:01:49.860> the

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
way I would have chosen you know the

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.210 
way I would have chosen you know the
last<00:01:51.350> you<00:01:52.350> know<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.590> last<00:01:52.740> couple<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:53.160> weeks

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
last you know the last couple of weeks

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.190 
last you know the last couple of weeks
but<00:01:53.700> well<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.119> think<00:01:54.300> you<00:01:54.600> were<00:01:54.720> talking<00:01:54.930> about

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
but well I think you were talking about

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.170 
but well I think you were talking about
it<00:01:55.440> last<00:01:55.619> video<00:01:56.040> in<00:01:56.220> the<00:01:56.310> commentary<00:01:56.820> maybe<00:01:57.060> it

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
it last video in the commentary maybe it

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.910 
it last video in the commentary maybe it
wasn't<00:01:57.330> all<00:01:57.570> Macaulay<00:01:57.960> but<00:01:58.229> you're<00:01:58.350> right<00:01:58.560> she

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
wasn't all Macaulay but you're right she

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.400 
wasn't all Macaulay but you're right she
just<00:01:58.950> got<00:01:59.250> out<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.640> rhythm<00:01:59.910> she<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:01.380> know

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
just got out of that rhythm she you know

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.590 
just got out of that rhythm she you know
she<00:02:01.680> messed<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.729> know<00:02:02.820> changed<00:02:03.420> some<00:02:03.570> things

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
she messed you know changed some things

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.200 
she messed you know changed some things
in<00:02:03.869> her<00:02:03.930> technique<00:02:04.440> and<00:02:04.740> just<00:02:04.770> kind<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.210> lost

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
in her technique and just kind of lost

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.060 
in her technique and just kind of lost
that<00:02:06.360> rhythm<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.170> think<00:02:07.470> that<00:02:07.710> hopefully

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
that rhythm and I think that hopefully

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.590 
that rhythm and I think that hopefully
it's<00:02:08.399> starting<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.729> click<00:02:08.940> again<00:02:09.240> and<00:02:09.450> she's

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
it's starting to click again and she's

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.850 
it's starting to click again and she's
gonna<00:02:09.720> throw<00:02:09.929> some<00:02:10.170> good<00:02:10.320> weight<00:02:10.470> up<00:02:10.619> at<00:02:10.740> the

a<00:06:21.550> week<00:06:22.330> or<00:06:22.479> two<00:06:22.599> ago<00:06:22.720> so<00:06:23.380> I<00:06:23.410> mean<00:06:23.590> I<00:06:23.620> think<00:06:23.710> I

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:24.069 
a week or two ago so I mean I think I

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:27.059 
a week or two ago so I mean I think I
think<00:06:24.099> that<00:06:24.370> everybody's<00:06:25.050> squats<00:06:26.050> are<00:06:26.349> higher

00:06:27.059 --> 00:06:27.069 
think that everybody's squats are higher

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:28.890
