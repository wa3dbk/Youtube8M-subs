northern part of the US I have water
temperatures<00:01:53.430> in<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.700> low<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.000> mid<00:01:54.180> 70s<00:01:54.509> that

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
temperatures in the low to mid 70s that

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.810 
temperatures in the low to mid 70s that
really<00:01:55.439> creep<00:01:55.710> up<00:01:55.920> quite<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.219> bit<00:01:56.460> during<00:01:56.640> the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
really creep up quite a bit during the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.300 
really creep up quite a bit during the
day<00:01:56.850> I'm<00:01:57.240> fishing<00:01:57.869> on<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.140> very<00:01:58.469> stained<00:01:58.890> body

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
day I'm fishing on a very stained body

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.550 
day I'm fishing on a very stained body
of<00:01:59.520> water<00:01:59.759> that<00:02:00.060> develops<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.899> significant

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
of water that develops a significant

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.410 
of water that develops a significant
algae<00:02:01.950> bloom<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.460> algae<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:02.969> really

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
algae bloom and that algae is really

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.020 
algae bloom and that algae is really
starting<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.810> come<00:02:03.899> on<00:02:04.170> strong<00:02:04.729> now<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:05.790> might

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
starting to come on strong now you might

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.490 
starting to come on strong now you might
think<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.329> those<00:02:06.540> water<00:02:06.840> conditions<00:02:07.350> would

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
think that those water conditions would

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.010 
think that those water conditions would
drive<00:02:07.770> all<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.340> quality<00:02:08.789> panfish<00:02:09.239> deep<00:02:09.539> but

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
drive all the quality panfish deep but

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.290 
drive all the quality panfish deep but
that's<00:02:10.200> certainly<00:02:10.440> not<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.830> case<00:02:11.150> today<00:02:12.150> I'm

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
that's certainly not the case today I'm

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.850 
that's certainly not the case today I'm
