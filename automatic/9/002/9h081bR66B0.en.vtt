00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 the staff are warmly welcome until then 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.600
 to see ministers and we have 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.730
 continued to violin lessons with the 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.860
 wind song song which is the number 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.860
 suzuki three 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.320
 She is very small but she has some 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.690
 niggles but until some points are 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.760
 a bit difficult to work in that 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.250
 john d was left arc that is 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.050
 important to pay attention 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.980
 I'll play there quickly for you guys. 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:46.170
 have a notion 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:50.190
 And look, we get to work and 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.930
 she repeats is I did it faster 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.910
 What are you going to do? What are you going to do? 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.160
 spend with the piano but the ideal is that 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.620
 You do not worry about speed anymore. 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.350
 that you do well and well articulated well 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.480
 pretty 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.400
 this song she's going to have some like me 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.380
 I spoke for some alternations of 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.390
 strings that you problematic as per 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:15.299
 example, science is always a problem and 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.220
 some programs only resumed because 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.350
 What happens sometimes we do not take away 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.950
 the arc to resume down 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.330
 only some people instruments like 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.060
 the programs with that then we will 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.130
 work it so that music as 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.890
 music as if it were known line of 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:36.820
 there if I do not want to see or be there 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.659
 turn back, that is 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:45.970
 if one two three and wakes up neither underneath 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:47.320
 I can want is that your little stalin 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.869
 once each note 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:54.160
 and then we repeat the movie four times 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:56.380
 and then comes the aft there family does fact 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.100
 to have gone because we got bigger then 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.340
 it would be his first on the court me 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:09.100
 third on the rope there and then back to 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:13.750
 sleeping with a third party will do it again 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.550
 the first is what happens has two 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.280
 options to execute this stretch 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:22.980
 can place the third finger at the same 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.980
 time on the two strings doing the fifth 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:32.260
 energy saving 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.209
 now you can too if you have a 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.340
 finger and if you even have the 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.080
 or little one so if you have a lot of 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.480
 difficulty of doing the fifth you can 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:45.340
 simply play the same tub on 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:48.100
 finger of the rope lapa in the middle this way 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.750
 I even recommend it to anyone who has this year. 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.850
 do this so as not to complicate 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.010
 very much the one who wants to test and 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.410
 maybe the company would do fifth 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.900
 Can I do the farm that is you? 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.000
 lay the finger on both strings but nothing 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.760
 to break the finger like that again 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.250
 model has to stay with his head. 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.000
 on top of things like that 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:16.870
 normal nothing dignifies lying finger 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:22.540
 Okay, so everything stays on the marquinha vai 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:24.310
 13 310 and then it's important that you 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.920
 keep the first finger stuck in this 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.269
 transaction and because it will also repeat itself 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.269
 in the end it becomes easy 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:40.310
 and then you go back there like that 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.310
 that we did on the last song back 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.140
 How's that? We do it once. 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:52.920
 when I am and three times the retreat the 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:56.330
 third on the account there repeats the king 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:59.580
 will do it again three times too 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:04.080
 makes the dollar repeat farms and businesses 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:08.190
 There, too , he makes a tiny little fish. 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:13.910
 from there it is there second of 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.910
 the baby and then repeat it again 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.320
 and here I said that you will have this 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.989
 take back money that will be a little 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.940
 problem that is simply going to 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.910
 stop the bow and continue note of 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:31.410
 new will repeat to this session 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:34.110
 that is, you will make two 2000 notes and 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.320
 you will separate them with an arc number 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.919
 in the same direction 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.919
 it would be more or less like this 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.800
 Why is it not worth it here? 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.500
 Resume the floor is to be 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:57.180
 removing and then reinserting the 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:09.070
 people just to make this censorship and 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:10.690
 continuing to stand the difference 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.720
 It will be the second time instead of you. 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:21.250
 do the repeat you will simply 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:22.600
 do there the staff is that the music is fine 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.100
 simple 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.620
 I just ask that you take too much 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.600
 care and pay more attention to this 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.330
 stretch 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.210
 Whenever it's a problem, people feel 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.430
 good here in the right hand and in the hand 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.760
 left also presence in finalizing 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:42.100
 I'm not beautiful, she showed me a quickie. 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:45.130
 even but do not need not worry 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:48.310
 both with speed but which is a 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:51.100
 I'm very handsome 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:54.280
 enough attention from the planes of arches to 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:57.280
 to follow you will see the accompaniment 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:00.010
 piano for you to give a trained 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.230
 Always memorize I recommend this, you 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:05.140
 play decorum and contain for example 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:06.460
 To give that pass there for you. 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.600
 can pay attention to what you 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.280
 is doing here 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:14.410
 in the video description will never let 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:21.300
 to download the score and do not 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:21.300
 enjoy the tips and until the next 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:32.280
 Wow
