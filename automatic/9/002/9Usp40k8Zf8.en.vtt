00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
the box and this is by a hollow I think

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.219 
the box and this is by a hollow I think
it's<00:02:00.849> pronounced<00:02:01.179> and<00:02:01.450> these<00:02:01.929> are<00:02:02.079> the

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
it's pronounced and these are the

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.499 
it's pronounced and these are the
revival<00:02:02.679> bath<00:02:02.859> salts<00:02:03.310> in<00:02:03.429> the<00:02:03.700> sense<00:02:03.969> mandarin
