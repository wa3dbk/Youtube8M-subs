 their castle it happened in the era of heroes 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.950
 lannister were kings off a cliff on 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.280
 over thousands of years causing envy 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.109
 all other noble families 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.210
 but we have lost royal power 

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:22.219
 when in westeros at the head of his army 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.409
 intruded eigon targaryen 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:28.490

 60,000 people met with troops 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.859
 Targaryen in open battle history 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.990
 says that 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:47.539
 eigon released three of his dragons 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.060
 slept 4 thousand warriors 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:53.689
 instead of a battle since known as 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.899
 fiery field king merne that day 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:02:00.409
 burned alive and it stopped the race 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:02.840
 gardeners from the space by comparing 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:06.139
 Targaryenâ€™s threat and 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.229
 the opportunities they open Lauren wisely 

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:12.200
 I gave up and later helped Eyegon 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.410
 conquer the remaining westeros 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.720
 from then to the present lannistery 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.019
 referred to as lords of the western lands and 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.860
 Western custodians titles that 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.879
 belong to us since those times however not 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.830
 are mistaken 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:32.840
 bad luck and not royal mercy 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:34.970
 brought our home to prosperity in our 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.890
 stories were times when we were considered 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:42.290
 weak lazy and pompous my father 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.540
 titos lannister their unsuccessful 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.150
 investments almost led our house to 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.760
 ruined and allowed open sneers 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.250
 over yourself in the yard 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.700
 when our vassals reyna from castamer 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.090
 dared to rebel against us they learned 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.940
 how dangerous to tease a lion 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.780
 I am Tywin lannister himself led the troops on 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.930
 Castamere 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.880
 to end the rebellion their fate 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.680
 became an example for all who dare 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.200
 doubt our strength 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.440
 about the Reins of Castamere even laid down 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.180
 beautiful song 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.819
 it is a pity that none of the districts survived 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.430
 to hear it today 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:26.019
 the golden lion of the lannister is honored and 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:32.389
 dread in all seven kingdoms 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:34.670
 our motto hear my roar but there is 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:36.889
 another saying to remember 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.500
 those who deal with the album from the cliff 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:41.829
 casterly lannister always pay their 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.829
 debts
