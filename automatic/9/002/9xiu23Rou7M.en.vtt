looks like it comes with a laser cell

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.279 
looks like it comes with a laser cell
not<00:00:20.340> sure<00:00:20.640> if<00:00:20.760> this<00:00:20.939> was<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.180> deal<00:00:21.449> that<00:00:21.720> came

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.299 
slick it's got this kind of like almost
transparent<00:00:39.989> kind<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.440> finish<00:00:40.800> or<00:00:40.980> something

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
transparent kind of finish or something

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.279 
transparent kind of finish or something
on<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.579> case<00:00:41.760> itself<00:00:42.149> just<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:42.989> beginning

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
on the case itself just the beginning

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:55.819 
on the case itself just the beginning
look<00:00:46.289> at<00:00:46.410> this<00:00:46.559> laser<00:00:47.430> cell<00:00:47.850> here<00:00:54.739> kind<00:00:55.739> of

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
look at this laser cell here kind of

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.350 
look at this laser cell here kind of
smaller<00:00:56.190> than<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.550> thought<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.910> would<00:00:57.030> be<00:00:57.149> for

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
smaller than I thought it would be for

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.619 
smaller than I thought it would be for
all<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.660> hoopla<00:00:58.649> surrounding<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:59.340> cuz<00:00:59.570> if<00:01:00.570> you

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
all the hoopla surrounding it cuz if you

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.930 
all the hoopla surrounding it cuz if you
were<00:01:00.870> looking<00:01:00.989> at<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.320> Amazon<00:01:01.739> stuff<00:01:02.070> they

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
were looking at the Amazon stuff they

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.289 
were looking at the Amazon stuff they
originally<00:01:03.539> had<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.719> $20<00:01:04.290> off<00:01:04.409> there's<00:01:05.299> $20

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
originally had a $20 off there's $20

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.000 
originally had a $20 off there's $20
credit<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.080> then<00:01:07.380> they<00:01:07.470> removed<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:07.890> from

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
credit and then they removed that from

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.770 
credit and then they removed that from
the<00:01:08.280> pre-order<00:01:08.670> bonus<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.180> then<00:01:09.270> replaced<00:01:09.600> it

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
the pre-order bonus and then replaced it

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.560 
the pre-order bonus and then replaced it
with<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.290> laser<00:01:11.040> cell<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:12.090> when<00:01:12.299> they<00:01:12.390> did

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
with the laser cell so when they did

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.960 
with the laser cell so when they did
that<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.810> was<00:01:13.049> assuming<00:01:13.530> oh<00:01:13.740> well<00:01:14.250> it'll

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
that I was assuming oh well it'll

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.300 
that I was assuming oh well it'll
probably<00:01:15.299> be<00:01:15.509> like<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.900> really<00:01:16.170> big<00:01:16.439> thing<00:01:16.770> but

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
probably be like a really big thing but

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.840 
probably be like a really big thing but
it's<00:01:17.520> really<00:01:18.210> small<00:01:18.420> it's<00:01:18.930> about<00:01:19.670> maybe<00:01:20.670> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
it's really small it's about maybe the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.330 
it's really small it's about maybe the
size<00:01:21.090> like<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.479> little<00:01:21.990> bit<00:01:22.170> bigger<00:01:22.409> than<00:01:22.710> half

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
size like a little bit bigger than half

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.999 
size like a little bit bigger than half
