hey<00:00:00.780> guys<00:00:01.020> because<00:00:01.380> the<00:00:01.530> macbook<00:00:01.860> pro<00:00:01.890> retina

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:02.570 
hey guys because the macbook pro retina

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.510 
hey guys because the macbook pro retina
13-inch<00:00:03.570> is<00:00:03.840> probably<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.740> come<00:00:04.890> out<00:00:05.009> none<00:00:05.250> in

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
13-inch is probably to come out none in

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.039 
13-inch is probably to come out none in
a<00:00:05.609> few<00:00:05.790> months<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:06.150> second<00:00:06.450> version<00:00:06.600> at<00:00:06.839> least

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
a few months the second version at least

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.589 
a few months the second version at least
I<00:00:07.259> decided<00:00:07.859> to<00:00:08.010> make<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.160> review<00:00:08.550> about<00:00:08.760> things

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
I decided to make a review about things

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.959 
I decided to make a review about things
that<00:00:09.719> will<00:00:09.990> stick<00:00:10.290> around<00:00:10.320> like<00:00:10.860> screen<00:00:11.429> and

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
that will stick around like screen and

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.740 
that will stick around like screen and
speakers<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.990> how<00:00:13.920> silent<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.460> fan<00:00:14.639> is<00:00:14.849> so

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
speakers and how silent the fan is so

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.630 
speakers and how silent the fan is so
with<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.320> further<00:00:16.500> ado<00:00:16.800> let's<00:00:17.250> get<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:17.490> started

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
with a further ado let's get it started

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.640 
with a further ado let's get it started
let's<00:00:18.210> talk<00:00:18.359> about<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.630> fan<00:00:18.930> because<00:00:19.439> it's

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
let's talk about the fan because it's

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.400 
let's talk about the fan because it's
extremely<00:00:20.550> silent<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.150> do<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.750> lot<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.140> video

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
extremely silent I do a lot of video

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.019 
extremely silent I do a lot of video
editing<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.010> lot<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.279> processing<00:00:23.880> on<00:00:23.970> my

Pro<00:00:44.070> bug<00:00:44.640> me<00:00:45.000> because<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.780> can<00:00:46.050> hear<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.410> hard

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
Pro bug me because I can hear the hard

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.799 
Pro bug me because I can hear the hard
drive<00:00:46.860> spin<00:00:47.309> it's<00:00:47.520> this<00:00:47.670> super<00:00:48.270> high<00:00:48.420> pitched

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
drive spin it's this super high pitched

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.420 
drive spin it's this super high pitched
noise<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.739> can<00:00:49.950> hear<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.100> don't<00:00:50.280> know<00:00:50.370> if

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
noise that I can hear I don't know if

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.010 
noise that I can hear I don't know if
you<00:00:50.489> guys<00:00:50.579> can<00:00:50.670> hear<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.090> but<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.570> really

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
you guys can hear it but it really

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.459 
you guys can hear it but it really
bugged<00:00:52.320> me<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.620> all<00:00:53.610> those<00:00:54.059> tiny<00:00:54.690> noises<00:00:55.260> are

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
bugged me and all those tiny noises are

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.020 
bugged me and all those tiny noises are
gone<00:00:55.860> from<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.579> retina<00:00:57.059> 13<00:00:58.670> next<00:00:59.670> up<00:00:59.820> is<00:00:59.969> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
gone from the retina 13 next up is the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.700 
gone from the retina 13 next up is the
small<00:01:00.629> footprint<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:02.180> why<00:01:03.180> get<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.899> retina<00:01:04.379> 13

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
small footprint so why get the retina 13

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.980 
small footprint so why get the retina 13
verses<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.400> macbook<00:01:05.790> air<00:01:06.000> for<00:01:06.330> example<00:01:06.750> well

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
verses the macbook air for example well

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.050 
verses the macbook air for example well
the<00:01:07.439> footprint<00:01:07.979> really<00:01:08.549> mattered<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.939> me

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
the footprint really mattered to me

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.210 
the footprint really mattered to me
because<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.540> take<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.200> thing<00:01:10.439> everywhere<00:01:11.159> I

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
because I take this thing everywhere I

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.010 
because I take this thing everywhere I
go<00:01:11.310> on<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.610> bus<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.450> know<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.689> type

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
go on the bus and I you you know I type

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.039 
go on the bus and I you you know I type
on<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.790> and<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.240> smaller<00:01:15.630> footprint

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
on it and and so a smaller footprint

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.230 
on it and and so a smaller footprint
really<00:01:16.290> does<00:01:16.439> matter<00:01:16.619> now<00:01:16.950> how<00:01:17.729> much<00:01:17.909> smaller

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
really does matter now how much smaller

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.520 
really does matter now how much smaller
is<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.659> well<00:01:18.869> it's<00:01:18.900> not<00:01:19.110> really<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.470> much

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
is it well it's not really that much

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.490 
is it well it's not really that much
smaller<00:01:19.890> but<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:21.150> smaller<00:01:21.810> than<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
smaller but it is smaller than the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.770 
smaller but it is smaller than the
macbook<00:01:22.920> air<00:01:23.159> 13<00:01:23.820> that's<00:01:24.030> something<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.299> think

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
macbook air 13 that's something to think

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.080 
macbook air 13 that's something to think
about<00:01:25.020> if<00:01:25.320> you've<00:01:25.439> got<00:01:25.619> me<00:01:25.920> know<00:01:26.040> small<00:01:26.400> lab

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
about if you've got me know small lab

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.350 
about if you've got me know small lab
space<00:01:27.570> like<00:01:28.110> on<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.590> bus<00:01:29.000> it's<00:01:30.000> also<00:01:30.150> very

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
space like on the bus it's also very

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.170 
space like on the bus it's also very
light<00:01:31.009> i'm<00:01:32.009> pretty<00:01:32.430> sure<00:01:32.640> it's<00:01:32.790> heavier<00:01:33.119> than

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
light i'm pretty sure it's heavier than

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.620 
light i'm pretty sure it's heavier than
the<00:01:33.540> macbook<00:01:34.140> air<00:01:34.350> 13<00:01:35.220> but<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.420> weight

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
the macbook air 13 but the weight

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.260 
the macbook air 13 but the weight
difference<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:38.040> little<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.759> really<00:01:38.790> is

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
difference is so little it really is

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.690 
difference is so little it really is
think<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.140> this<00:01:40.200> way<00:01:40.320> if<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:41.220> really<00:01:41.520> cared

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
think of it this way if you really cared

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.370 
think of it this way if you really cared
about<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:42.030> way<00:01:42.210> dif<00:01:42.689> look<00:01:42.840> into<00:01:43.290> your

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
about that way dif look into your

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.859 
about that way dif look into your
backpack<00:01:43.619> or<00:01:44.159> your<00:01:44.220> satchel<00:01:44.670> or<00:01:45.000> whatever<00:01:45.720> you

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
backpack or your satchel or whatever you

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.469 
backpack or your satchel or whatever you
use<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.200> carry<00:01:46.439> your<00:01:46.590> macbook<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.280> think<00:01:48.270> of

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
use to carry your macbook and think of

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.389 
use to carry your macbook and think of
something<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.200> can<00:01:49.350> get<00:01:49.470> rid<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.770> to

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
something that you can get rid of to

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.490 
something that you can get rid of to
kind<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:50.880> even<00:01:51.149> out<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.540> weight<00:01:51.720> for<00:01:52.079> example

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
kind of even out the weight for example

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.100 
kind of even out the weight for example
stop<00:01:53.310> carrying<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.880> extra<00:01:54.360> extension<00:01:54.689> cord

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
stop carrying that extra extension cord

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.649 
stop carrying that extra extension cord
for<00:01:55.320> your<00:01:55.409> charger<00:01:55.770> yeah<00:01:56.310> that's<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:57.090> know<00:01:57.299> if

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
for your charger yeah that's you know if

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:58.880 
for your charger yeah that's you know if
you<00:01:57.780> want<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:57.990> save<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.170> space<00:01:58.229> get<00:01:58.710> rid<00:01:58.829> of

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
you want to save you space get rid of

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.300 
you want to save you space get rid of
that<00:01:59.450> third<00:02:00.450> thing<00:02:00.630> when<00:02:00.719> i<00:02:00.750> talk<00:02:00.930> about<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.320> um

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
that third thing when i talk about is um

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.280 
that third thing when i talk about is um
space<00:02:03.500> 256<00:02:04.500> gigabytes<00:02:04.920> versus<00:02:05.360> 128<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.630> had

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
space 256 gigabytes versus 128 I had

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.070 
space 256 gigabytes versus 128 I had
this<00:02:07.890> 13<00:02:08.340> inch<00:02:08.489> pro<00:02:08.700> at<00:02:08.849> 128<00:02:09.569> because<00:02:09.899> i

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
this 13 inch pro at 128 because i

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.710 
this 13 inch pro at 128 because i
thought<00:02:10.530> i<00:02:10.739> could<00:02:11.009> probably<00:02:11.190> get<00:02:11.370> away

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
thought i could probably get away

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.290 
thought i could probably get away
it<00:02:11.810> because<00:02:12.740> I<00:02:12.950> do<00:02:13.310> a<00:02:13.430> lot<00:02:13.580> of<00:02:13.640> transferring

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
it because I do a lot of transferring

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.970 
it because I do a lot of transferring
from<00:02:14.450> my<00:02:14.630> laptop<00:02:14.810> to<00:02:15.290> my<00:02:15.320> external<00:02:15.710> hard

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
from my laptop to my external hard

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.470 
from my laptop to my external hard
drives<00:02:16.340> that<00:02:16.490> I've<00:02:16.670> reviewed<00:02:16.970> before<00:02:17.530> but<00:02:19.480> 256

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
drives that I've reviewed before but 256

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.960 
drives that I've reviewed before but 256
is<00:02:20.750> so<00:02:21.740> much<00:02:22.070> better<00:02:22.280> there's<00:02:22.640> there's

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
is so much better there's there's

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.760 
is so much better there's there's
something<00:02:23.510> about<00:02:23.600> that<00:02:23.690> 128<00:02:24.290> that's<00:02:24.530> just<00:02:24.650> a

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
something about that 128 that's just a

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.920 
something about that 128 that's just a
little<00:02:25.040> bit<00:02:25.280> too<00:02:25.460> small<00:02:26.180> for<00:02:26.570> me<00:02:26.660> there's<00:02:26.810> not

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
little bit too small for me there's not

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.360 
little bit too small for me there's not
enough<00:02:27.110> breathing<00:02:27.440> room<00:02:27.620> especially<00:02:27.920> when

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
enough breathing room especially when

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.620 
enough breathing room especially when
you're<00:02:28.490> doing<00:02:28.700> video<00:02:28.940> editing<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:29.420> you<00:02:29.480> have

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
you're doing video editing and you have

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.140 
you're doing video editing and you have
to<00:02:29.720> transcode<00:02:30.290> all<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:31.340> old<00:02:31.730> immediately

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
to transcode all the old immediately

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.480 
to transcode all the old immediately
that<00:02:32.360> you<00:02:32.600> have<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:33.050> doing<00:02:33.860> that<00:02:33.980> really

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
that you have and doing that really

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.180 
that you have and doing that really
takes<00:02:34.640> up<00:02:34.850> a<00:02:34.970> lot<00:02:35.240> of<00:02:35.270> space<00:02:35.630> so<00:02:36.380> you<00:02:36.830> really

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
takes up a lot of space so you really

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.280 
takes up a lot of space so you really
want<00:02:37.430> to<00:02:37.670> 56<00:02:38.540> I<00:02:38.630> would<00:02:38.780> suggest<00:02:38.900> that<00:02:39.110> you<00:02:39.230> get

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
want to 56 I would suggest that you get

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.710 
want to 56 I would suggest that you get
to<00:02:39.350> 56<00:02:39.890> if<00:02:40.070> you<00:02:40.220> have<00:02:40.340> a<00:02:40.370> lot<00:02:40.520> of<00:02:40.550> media<00:02:40.850> and<00:02:41.210> you

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
to 56 if you have a lot of media and you

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.380 
to 56 if you have a lot of media and you
do<00:02:41.810> a<00:02:41.840> lot<00:02:42.140> of<00:02:42.580> processing<00:02:43.580> editing<00:02:44.000> things

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
do a lot of processing editing things

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.230 
do a lot of processing editing things
like<00:02:44.510> that<00:02:44.630> on<00:02:44.900> your<00:02:45.410> macbook<00:02:45.560> pro<00:02:46.240> fourth

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
like that on your macbook pro fourth

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.930 
like that on your macbook pro fourth
thing<00:02:47.570> is<00:02:47.950> screen<00:02:48.950> lag<00:02:49.220> I<00:02:49.490> looked<00:02:49.760> at<00:02:49.850> reviews

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
thing is screen lag I looked at reviews

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.699 
thing is screen lag I looked at reviews
before<00:02:50.360> i<00:02:50.510> bought<00:02:50.720> this<00:02:50.930> macbook<00:02:51.290> pro<00:02:51.500> and<00:02:51.680> i

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
before i bought this macbook pro and i

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.290 
before i bought this macbook pro and i
was<00:02:51.860> worried<00:02:52.160> about<00:02:52.220> screen<00:02:52.790> lag<00:02:52.970> but<00:02:53.150> what

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
was worried about screen lag but what

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.090 
was worried about screen lag but what
I'm<00:02:53.390> talking<00:02:53.630> about<00:02:53.690> is<00:02:53.810> when<00:02:54.470> you're<00:02:54.830> on<00:02:55.070> a

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
I'm talking about is when you're on a

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.890 
I'm talking about is when you're on a
site<00:02:55.340> like<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.670> verge<00:02:55.910> for<00:02:56.360> example<00:02:56.720> and<00:02:56.870> you

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
site like the verge for example and you

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.810 
site like the verge for example and you
scroll<00:02:57.200> up<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:57.470> down<00:02:57.560> a<00:02:57.980> lot<00:02:58.580> of<00:02:58.640> people

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
scroll up and down a lot of people

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.910 
scroll up and down a lot of people
notice<00:02:59.209> this<00:02:59.360> lag<00:02:59.660> and<00:02:59.990> there's<00:03:00.410> videos<00:03:00.740> out

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
notice this lag and there's videos out

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.150 
notice this lag and there's videos out
there<00:03:00.950> about<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.850> screen<00:03:02.120> light<00:03:02.270> and<00:03:02.740> I<00:03:03.740> read

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
there about the screen light and I read

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.250 
there about the screen light and I read
a<00:03:04.190> review<00:03:04.370> i<00:03:04.580> think<00:03:04.820> it<00:03:04.910> was<00:03:04.970> a<00:03:05.030> non<00:03:05.390> tax<00:03:05.780> review

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
a review i think it was a non tax review

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.320 
a review i think it was a non tax review
and<00:03:06.590> he<00:03:07.280> talked<00:03:07.490> about<00:03:07.550> the<00:03:07.760> screen<00:03:08.030> lag<00:03:08.180> and

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
and he talked about the screen lag and

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.220 
and he talked about the screen lag and
yes<00:03:08.570> it<00:03:08.780> is<00:03:08.900> very<00:03:08.959> noticeable<00:03:09.709> on<00:03:09.860> his<00:03:10.340> end<00:03:10.550> and

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
yes it is very noticeable on his end and

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.810 
yes it is very noticeable on his end and
um<00:03:12.230> he<00:03:13.130> says<00:03:13.400> that<00:03:13.700> greater<00:03:14.270> cpu<00:03:14.810> power<00:03:15.020> really

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
um he says that greater cpu power really

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.710 
um he says that greater cpu power really
improve<00:03:16.820> this<00:03:17.420> lag<00:03:18.410> so<00:03:19.340> if<00:03:19.670> you<00:03:19.970> really<00:03:20.390> really

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
improve this lag so if you really really

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.380 
improve this lag so if you really really
really<00:03:20.840> bothered<00:03:21.410> by<00:03:21.530> a<00:03:21.560> check<00:03:22.010> of<00:03:22.190> the

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
really bothered by a check of the

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.420 
really bothered by a check of the
higher-end<00:03:23.390> macbook<00:03:24.050> pro<00:03:24.260> retina<00:03:24.290> 13<00:03:25.040> because

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
higher-end macbook pro retina 13 because

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.470 
higher-end macbook pro retina 13 because
that<00:03:25.760> has<00:03:25.910> better<00:03:26.570> cpu<00:03:26.870> on<00:03:27.790> my<00:03:28.790> aunt<00:03:29.030> oh<00:03:29.209> I

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
that has better cpu on my aunt oh I

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.150 
that has better cpu on my aunt oh I
don't<00:03:30.230> notice<00:03:30.860> the<00:03:31.519> lag<00:03:31.730> not<00:03:32.300> at<00:03:32.450> all<00:03:33.160> maybe

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
don't notice the lag not at all maybe

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.410 
don't notice the lag not at all maybe
because<00:03:34.340> I<00:03:34.489> don't<00:03:34.640> care<00:03:34.790> like<00:03:35.000> right<00:03:35.150> now<00:03:35.269> I'm

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
stuff but when it comes to glare this

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.970 
stuff but when it comes to glare this
thing<00:04:45.220> is<00:04:45.490> pretty<00:04:46.450> good<00:04:46.690> I<00:04:46.900> mean<00:04:47.080> you<00:04:47.830> will

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
thing is pretty good I mean you will

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.590 
thing is pretty good I mean you will
still<00:04:48.520> see<00:04:48.550> glare<00:04:49.030> like<00:04:49.060> right<00:04:49.360> now<00:04:49.480> I'm

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
still see glare like right now I'm

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.840 
still see glare like right now I'm
looking<00:04:49.930> at<00:04:50.260> a<00:04:50.320> reflection<00:04:50.860> of<00:04:50.920> myself<00:04:51.100> on<00:04:51.550> the

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
looking at a reflection of myself on the

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.520 
looking at a reflection of myself on the
screen<00:04:52.150> and<00:04:52.240> that's<00:04:52.390> probably<00:04:52.660> because<00:04:52.810> this

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
screen and that's probably because this

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.190 
screen and that's probably because this
sun<00:04:54.100> is<00:04:54.220> pretty<00:04:54.430> bright<00:04:54.610> right<00:04:54.790> now<00:04:54.910> but<00:04:55.750> it

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
sun is pretty bright right now but it

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.470 
sun is pretty bright right now but it
really<00:04:56.920> really<00:04:57.250> really<00:04:57.460> helps<00:04:57.790> so<00:04:58.150> if<00:04:58.390> you

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
really really really helps so if you

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.060 
really really really helps so if you
were<00:04:58.600> bothered<00:04:58.960> by<00:04:59.110> the<00:04:59.170> glare<00:04:59.380> on<00:04:59.440> the<00:04:59.620> normal

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
were bothered by the glare on the normal

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.780 
were bothered by the glare on the normal
13<00:05:00.430> pro<00:05:01.270> it's<00:05:01.980> extremely<00:05:02.980> improved<00:05:03.310> when<00:05:03.640> it

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
13 pro it's extremely improved when it

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.930 
13 pro it's extremely improved when it
comes<00:05:03.940> to<00:05:04.120> the<00:05:04.510> retina<00:05:04.840> version<00:05:05.320> and<00:05:05.610> I<00:05:06.610> think

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
comes to the retina version and I think

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.440 
comes to the retina version and I think
the<00:05:07.030> last<00:05:07.180> thing<00:05:07.390> is<00:05:07.690> performance<00:05:09.120> cpu<00:05:10.120> and

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
the last thing is performance cpu and

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.440 
the last thing is performance cpu and
GPU<00:05:10.480> is<00:05:11.050> it<00:05:11.380> really<00:05:11.860> good<00:05:12.010> enough<00:05:12.250> in<00:05:13.000> my<00:05:13.390> case

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
GPU is it really good enough in my case

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.680 
GPU is it really good enough in my case
it<00:05:13.930> is<00:05:14.110> because<00:05:15.070> ninety<00:05:15.880> percent<00:05:16.120> of<00:05:16.390> the<00:05:16.510> time

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
it is because ninety percent of the time

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.340 
it is because ninety percent of the time
i'm<00:05:17.050> not<00:05:17.530> doing<00:05:18.130> any<00:05:18.430> super<00:05:19.270> cpu<00:05:20.170> or<00:05:20.200> GPU

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
i'm not doing any super cpu or GPU

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.560 
i'm not doing any super cpu or GPU
intensive<00:05:21.160> stuff<00:05:21.370> like<00:05:21.550> gaming<00:05:21.790> or<00:05:22.150> editing

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570

you're just doing that you really don't

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.840 
you're just doing that you really don't
need<00:05:32.290> all<00:05:32.530> that<00:05:32.710> extra<00:05:32.950> punch<00:05:33.460> all<00:05:33.670> that

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
need all that extra punch all that

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.320 
need all that extra punch all that
horsepower<00:05:34.330> behind<00:05:35.200> your<00:05:35.440> computer<00:05:35.910> now<00:05:36.910> it

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
horsepower behind your computer now it

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.630 
horsepower behind your computer now it
would<00:05:37.930> be<00:05:38.170> nice<00:05:38.470> to<00:05:38.890> have<00:05:39.070> a<00:05:39.480> discrete<00:05:40.480> um<00:05:41.640> GPU

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
would be nice to have a discrete um GPU

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.620 
would be nice to have a discrete um GPU
on<00:05:42.910> the<00:05:43.570> 13<00:05:44.200> row<00:05:45.160> because<00:05:45.730> i<00:05:46.000> really<00:05:46.390> miss<00:05:46.600> that

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
on the 13 row because i really miss that

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.290 
on the 13 row because i really miss that
discrete<00:05:47.200> GPU<00:05:47.560> on<00:05:47.710> the<00:05:47.830> 15<00:05:48.220> pro<00:05:48.430> especially

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
discrete GPU on the 15 pro especially

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.380 
discrete GPU on the 15 pro especially
when<00:05:49.570> you're<00:05:49.840> exporting<00:05:50.320> video<00:05:50.560> in<00:05:50.920> final<00:05:51.250> cut

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.390 
when you're exporting video in final cut

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:56.700 
when you're exporting video in final cut
um<00:05:52.650> yeah<00:05:53.650> so<00:05:53.920> should<00:05:54.550> you<00:05:54.700> wait<00:05:55.200> for<00:05:56.200> haswell

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
um yeah so should you wait for haswell

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.440 
um yeah so should you wait for haswell
because<00:05:57.370> right<00:05:57.520> now<00:05:57.550> what<00:05:57.790> I'm<00:05:57.850> reviewing<00:05:58.030> is

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.450 
because right now what I'm reviewing is

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:03.290 
because right now what I'm reviewing is
the<00:05:58.810> what<00:05:59.740> ever<00:05:59.890> before<00:06:00.280> as<00:06:00.430> well<00:06:00.670> um<00:06:01.200> well

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
the what ever before as well um well

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.570 
the what ever before as well um well
yeah<00:06:04.300> i<00:06:04.540> think<00:06:05.020> so<00:06:05.380> i<00:06:05.560> think<00:06:05.620> i<00:06:06.070> think<00:06:06.280> you

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
yeah i think so i think i think you

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.580 
yeah i think so i think i think you
should<00:06:06.820> wait<00:06:06.970> if<00:06:07.150> you<00:06:07.330> plan<00:06:07.660> to<00:06:07.690> buy<00:06:08.050> a<00:06:08.320> macbook

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
should wait if you plan to buy a macbook

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.350 
should wait if you plan to buy a macbook
brand-new<00:06:09.490> and<00:06:09.670> you're<00:06:09.760> listening<00:06:10.000> to<00:06:10.270> this

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
brand-new and you're listening to this

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.720 
brand-new and you're listening to this
video<00:06:10.510> right<00:06:11.200> now<00:06:11.260> and<00:06:11.650> it's<00:06:11.770> May<00:06:12.040> something<00:06:12.520> I

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:12.730 
video right now and it's May something I

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:16.220 
video right now and it's May something I
suggest<00:06:13.630> you<00:06:13.690> wait<00:06:14.400> because<00:06:15.400> Haswell<00:06:15.940> has

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:16.230 
suggest you wait because Haswell has

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.810 
suggest you wait because Haswell has
most<00:06:17.230> likely<00:06:17.350> as<00:06:17.890> just<00:06:18.100> a<00:06:18.190> tiny<00:06:18.460> bit<00:06:18.580> better

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:18.820 
most likely as just a tiny bit better

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.380 
most likely as just a tiny bit better
cpu<00:06:19.600> performance<00:06:20.050> but<00:06:20.620> what<00:06:21.580> really<00:06:21.910> kicks<00:06:22.270> it

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:22.390 
cpu performance but what really kicks it

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.570 
cpu performance but what really kicks it
is<00:06:22.480> that<00:06:22.630> GPU<00:06:23.140> performance<00:06:23.440> which<00:06:23.860> which<00:06:24.400> will

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 
is that GPU performance which which will

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.430 
is that GPU performance which which will
really<00:06:24.940> help<00:06:25.240> you<00:06:25.420> when<00:06:25.570> it<00:06:25.600> comes<00:06:25.810> to<00:06:26.020> well

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 
really help you when it comes to well

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.610 
really help you when it comes to well
you<00:06:27.190> know<00:06:27.220> gaming<00:06:27.940> and<00:06:28.780> editing<00:06:29.320> and<00:06:29.470> things

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:29.620 
you know gaming and editing and things

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.850 
you know gaming and editing and things
like<00:06:29.710> that<00:06:30.180> also<00:06:31.180> battery<00:06:32.050> life<00:06:32.230> will<00:06:32.440> be<00:06:32.530> much

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:32.860 
like that also battery life will be much

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.320 
like that also battery life will be much
improved<00:06:33.100> at<00:06:33.520> least<00:06:33.760> you<00:06:34.330> know<00:06:34.420> what

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.330 
improved at least you know what

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.040 
improved at least you know what
intel<00:06:35.689> says<00:06:35.720> about<00:06:36.620> their<00:06:36.800> chips<00:06:37.180> ah<00:06:38.180> but<00:06:38.960> we

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
intel says about their chips ah but we

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.589 
intel says about their chips ah but we
thought<00:06:39.139> said<00:06:39.319> battery<00:06:39.710> right<00:06:39.889> now<00:06:39.949> is

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:40.599 
thought said battery right now is

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:43.689 
thought said battery right now is
stellar<00:06:41.599> it's<00:06:42.050> it's<00:06:42.530> good<00:06:42.770> right<00:06:43.159> now<00:06:43.280> with

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:43.699 
stellar it's it's good right now with

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:45.820 
stellar it's it's good right now with
the<00:06:44.030> current<00:06:44.210> macbook<00:06:44.479> pro<00:06:44.780> retina<00:06:44.810> 13<00:06:45.379> so<00:06:45.560> i

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:45.830 
the current macbook pro retina 13 so i

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.369 
the current macbook pro retina 13 so i
say<00:06:46.430> wait<00:06:46.819> for<00:06:47.060> the<00:06:47.120> Haswell<00:06:47.449> version<00:06:47.840> unless

00:06:48.369 --> 00:06:48.379 
say wait for the Haswell version unless

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:51.129 
say wait for the Haswell version unless
you're<00:06:48.590> gonna<00:06:48.680> get<00:06:48.889> a<00:06:49.099> refurbed<00:06:49.900> macbook<00:06:50.900> pro

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:51.139 
you're gonna get a refurbed macbook pro

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:52.990 
you're gonna get a refurbed macbook pro
because<00:06:51.590> if<00:06:51.800> the<00:06:52.099> Haswell<00:06:52.430> version<00:06:52.699> comes<00:06:52.879> out

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.000 
because if the Haswell version comes out

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.339 
because if the Haswell version comes out
it'll<00:06:53.240> take<00:06:53.479> a<00:06:53.509> couple<00:06:53.599> of<00:06:54.139> months<00:06:54.199> maybe

00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:54.349 
it'll take a couple of months maybe

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:56.800 
it'll take a couple of months maybe
three<00:06:54.830> for<00:06:55.490> the<00:06:55.699> refurb<00:06:56.000> urgent<00:06:56.360> version<00:06:56.719> to
