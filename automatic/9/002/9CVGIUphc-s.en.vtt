this<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.869> one<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.200> main<00:01:07.409> reasons<00:01:07.950> why<00:01:08.430> so

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
this is one of the main reasons why so

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.280 
this is one of the main reasons why so
many<00:01:08.909> shoulder<00:01:09.540> injuries<00:01:09.960> have<00:01:10.229> been

many shoulder injuries have been

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.330 
many shoulder injuries have been
associated<00:01:11.189> with<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.700> bench<00:01:11.909> press<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:16.340> much

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
associated with the bench press a much

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.730 
associated with the bench press a much
safer<00:01:17.610> method<00:01:18.210> for<00:01:18.390> your<00:01:18.479> shoulders<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.259> to

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
safer method for your shoulders is to

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.440 
safer method for your shoulders is to
make<00:01:19.950> sure<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.880> keep<00:01:21.090> your<00:01:21.270> elbows

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
make sure that you keep your elbows

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.590 
make sure that you keep your elbows
tucked<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.229> more<00:01:22.470> towards<00:01:22.830> your<00:01:22.950> sides<00:01:23.600> be

tucked in more towards your sides be

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.840 
tucked in more towards your sides be
sure<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.380> your<00:01:25.590> upper<00:01:25.920> arms<00:01:26.280> don't<00:01:26.549> form

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
sure that your upper arms don't form

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.030 
sure that your upper arms don't form
more<00:01:27.060> than<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.299> 45<00:01:27.750> degree<00:01:28.140> angle<00:01:28.350> with<00:01:28.770> your

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.990 

not<00:01:40.500> only<00:01:40.680> will<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.010> reduce<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.700> stress

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
not only will this reduce the stress

not only will this reduce the stress
place<00:01:42.270> on<00:01:42.450> your<00:01:42.600> shoulder<00:01:42.990> joint<00:01:43.260> but<00:01:43.800> it<00:01:43.890> will

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
place on your shoulder joint but it will

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.160 
place on your shoulder joint but it will
also<00:01:44.190> increase<00:01:44.550> the<00:01:45.060> amount<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.330> upper<00:01:45.780> chest

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
also increase the amount of upper chest

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.860 
also increase the amount of upper chest
muscle<00:01:47.010> fibers<00:01:47.400> that<00:01:47.580> you<00:01:47.790> use<00:01:47.970> this<00:01:48.660> will

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
muscle fibers that you use this will

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.080 
muscle fibers that you use this will
help<00:01:49.050> you<00:01:49.170> develop<00:01:49.440> a<00:01:49.680> bigger<00:01:49.920> chest<00:01:50.310> right<00:01:50.940> in
