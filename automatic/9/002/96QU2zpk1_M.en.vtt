00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.720 
so the gameplay is super smooth thanks
to<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.210> awesome<00:00:54.750> display<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.219> nocturnal

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
to the awesome display and the nocturnal

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:08.750 
to the awesome display and the nocturnal
transit<00:01:06.350> as<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.530> may<00:01:07.680> have<00:01:07.710> Bradley<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
transit as you may have Bradley the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.700 
transit as you may have Bradley the
screen<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.090> also<00:01:09.720> super<00:01:09.930> sensitive<00:01:10.409> which

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
screen is also super sensitive which

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.490 
screen is also super sensitive which
means<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.610> will<00:01:11.970> work<00:01:12.000> with<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:13.140> finger

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
means that it will work with the finger

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.999 
means that it will work with the finger
as<00:01:14.400> usual<00:01:14.939> but<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.780> also<00:01:15.930> works<00:01:16.350> with<00:01:16.619> clothes

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
as usual but it also works with clothes

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.859 
as usual but it also works with clothes
on<00:01:18.740> which<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.920> another<00:01:20.369> innovation<00:01:20.820> I'm<00:01:21.689> up

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
on which is another innovation I'm up

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.240 
on which is another innovation I'm up
here

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:39.270 

I<00:01:30.300> can<00:01:31.300> also<00:01:31.450> change<00:01:31.720> the<00:01:31.900> control<00:01:32.380> thing<00:01:38.280> to

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
I can also change the control thing to

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.370 
I can also change the control thing to
use<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:39.670> accelerometer<00:01:41.250> instead<00:01:42.250> of<00:01:42.280> the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
use the accelerometer instead of the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:52.980 
use the accelerometer instead of the
touch<00:01:44.380> screen<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:51.250> also<00:01:51.430> calibrate<00:01:52.390> it<00:01:52.420> by

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
touch screen and also calibrate it by

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.880 
touch screen and also calibrate it by
holding<00:01:53.200> its<00:01:53.560> initial<00:01:54.430> position<00:01:55.890> while

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
holding its initial position while

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:16.310 
holding its initial position while
posing

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.710 

all<00:02:17.320> in<00:02:17.560> all<00:02:17.680> I<00:02:17.950> think<00:02:18.460> that<00:02:18.880> collection<00:02:19.540> also

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
all in all I think that collection also

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.530 
all in all I think that collection also
runs<00:02:20.110> great<00:02:20.440> on<00:02:20.850> Windows<00:02:21.850> Phone<00:02:22.030> 8<00:02:22.210> and

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
runs great on Windows Phone 8 and

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.540 
runs great on Windows Phone 8 and
especially<00:02:22.870> and<00:02:23.830> I'm<00:02:23.920> not<00:02:24.070> yelled<00:02:24.310> at<00:02:24.400> me<00:02:24.520> a

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
especially and I'm not yelled at me a

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.210 
especially and I'm not yelled at me a
