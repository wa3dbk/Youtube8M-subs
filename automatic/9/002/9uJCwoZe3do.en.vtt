in<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:44.010> siege<00:00:44.340> tanks<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:44.969> marines<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.379> this

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
in the siege tanks and marines so this

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.139

siege shanked marine army we should

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.760 
siege shanked marine army we should
probably<00:00:48.329> see<00:00:48.570> some<00:00:48.750> Thor's<00:00:49.079> as<00:00:49.289> well<00:00:49.530> in

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770
