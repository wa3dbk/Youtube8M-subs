how<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.560> tanks<00:02:36.950> work<00:02:37.160> it's<00:02:37.370> kind<00:02:37.580> of<00:02:37.640> streams

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
how the tanks work it's kind of streams

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.130 
how the tanks work it's kind of streams
they<00:02:38.060> don't<00:02:38.209> include<00:02:38.360> any<00:02:38.690> commas<00:02:39.110> or

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
they don't include any commas or

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.960 
they don't include any commas or
anything<00:02:39.500> what<00:02:40.040> they<00:02:40.160> do<00:02:40.220> is<00:02:40.520> they<00:02:40.610> tell<00:02:40.850> you

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
anything what they do is they tell you

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.630 
anything what they do is they tell you
what<00:02:41.150> each<00:02:41.270> tank<00:02:41.510> includes<00:02:42.020> so<00:02:42.740> for<00:02:43.610> instance

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
what each tank includes so for instance

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.160 
what each tank includes so for instance
let's<00:02:44.180> talk<00:02:44.360> about<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:45.550> pans<00:02:46.550> or<00:02:46.790> three<00:02:47.120> so<00:02:47.989> it

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
let's talk about the pans or three so it

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.040 
let's talk about the pans or three so it
here's<00:02:48.770> how<00:02:48.890> you<00:02:48.950> make<00:02:49.070> a<00:02:49.280> panzer<00:02:49.730> three<00:02:50.090> you

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
here's how you make a panzer three you

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.540 
here's how you make a panzer three you
get<00:02:51.170> a<00:02:51.200> trench<00:02:51.560> marker<00:02:52.040> from<00:02:52.250> combat

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
get a trench marker from combat

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.760 
get a trench marker from combat
commander<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:53.690> you<00:02:53.840> stack<00:02:54.110> underneath<00:02:54.560> that

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
commander and you stack underneath that

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.520 
commander and you stack underneath that
a<00:02:55.070> leader<00:02:55.670> which<00:02:56.030> is<00:02:56.180> a<00:02:56.209> nine<00:02:56.540> morale<00:02:57.260> leader

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
a leader which is a nine morale leader

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.400 
a leader which is a nine morale leader
with<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.370> one<00:02:58.550> command<00:02:58.940> radius<00:02:59.360> with<00:03:00.110> a<00:03:00.140> light

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
with the one command radius with a light

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.380 
with the one command radius with a light
machine<00:03:00.770> gun<00:03:00.980> a<00:03:01.190> weapon<00:03:01.880> team<00:03:02.090> a<00:03:02.120> heavy

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
machine gun a weapon team a heavy

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.300 
machine gun a weapon team a heavy
machine<00:03:02.810> gun<00:03:03.020> another<00:03:03.560> weapon<00:03:03.770> team<00:03:04.100> in<00:03:04.250> a

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
machine gun another weapon team in a

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.570 
machine gun another weapon team in a
meaty

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
meaty

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.720 
meaty
order<00:03:05.000> then<00:03:05.570> assigns<00:03:06.110> amelie<00:03:06.650> value<00:03:07.100> malaya

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
order then assigns amelie value malaya

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.030 
order then assigns amelie value malaya
value<00:03:08.150> having<00:03:08.660> good<00:03:08.900> points<00:03:09.290> it's<00:03:09.410> worth<00:03:09.590> and

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
value having good points it's worth and

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.570 
value having good points it's worth and
so<00:03:10.600> you<00:03:11.600> just<00:03:11.750> big<00:03:11.900> stack<00:03:12.230> with<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.100> trench<00:03:13.370> on

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
so you just big stack with the trench on

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.130 
so you just big stack with the trench on
top<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.060> Treach<00:03:14.270> represents<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:14.900> tank

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
top and the Treach represents the tank

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.500 
top and the Treach represents the tank
so<00:03:15.740> I'm<00:03:16.220> assuming<00:03:16.430> I'm<00:03:16.880> hoping<00:03:17.150> in<00:03:17.270> the<00:03:17.360> future

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
so I'm assuming I'm hoping in the future

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.540 
so I'm assuming I'm hoping in the future
they'll<00:03:17.870> release<00:03:18.140> some<00:03:18.410> counters<00:03:18.860> maybe<00:03:19.220> that

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
they'll release some counters maybe that

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.660 
they'll release some counters maybe that
we<00:03:19.700> can<00:03:19.850> use<00:03:19.880> instead<00:03:20.360> of<00:03:20.510> a<00:03:20.930> trench<00:03:21.650> and<00:03:22.010> i<00:03:22.430> saw

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
we can use instead of a trench and i saw

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.520 
we can use instead of a trench and i saw
on<00:03:22.880> constant<00:03:23.480> world<00:03:23.660> some<00:03:24.020> guys<00:03:24.200> have<00:03:24.350> already

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
on constant world some guys have already

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.280 
on constant world some guys have already
designed<00:03:24.800> some<00:03:25.280> but<00:03:25.880> i'm<00:03:26.210> thinking<00:03:26.930> this

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
designed some but i'm thinking this

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.410 
designed some but i'm thinking this
it'll<00:03:27.500> be<00:03:27.620> out<00:03:27.710> soon<00:03:28.010> and<00:03:28.370> it<00:03:28.940> just<00:03:28.970> shows<00:03:29.300> you

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
it'll be out soon and it just shows you

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.200 
it'll be out soon and it just shows you
the<00:03:29.480> rules<00:03:29.630> so<00:03:29.960> the<00:03:30.680> mortar<00:03:31.580> represents<00:03:32.090> the

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
the rules so the mortar represents the

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.540 
the rules so the mortar represents the
main<00:03:32.420> gun<00:03:32.690> and<00:03:32.990> it<00:03:33.710> says<00:03:33.860> in<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.070> back<00:03:34.250> here

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
main gun and it says in the back here

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.180 
main gun and it says in the back here
that<00:03:35.140> there's<00:03:36.140> no<00:03:36.290> minimum<00:03:36.470> range<00:03:36.860> with<00:03:37.160> a

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
that there's no minimum range with a

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.620 
that there's no minimum range with a
typically<00:03:37.550> mortars<00:03:37.970> of<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:38.150> minimum<00:03:38.450> range

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
typically mortars of the minimum range

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.530 
typically mortars of the minimum range
and<00:03:39.470> it<00:03:40.340> shows<00:03:40.580> you<00:03:40.760> to<00:03:40.940> fire<00:03:41.120> the<00:03:41.270> machine

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
and it shows you to fire the machine

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.330 
and it shows you to fire the machine
guns<00:03:41.810> and<00:03:42.080> what<00:03:42.530> happens<00:03:42.860> if<00:03:42.950> you<00:03:43.070> go<00:03:43.190> in<00:03:43.280> the

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
guns and what happens if you go in the

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.390 
guns and what happens if you go in the
same<00:03:43.520> texts<00:03:43.910> as<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:44.480> tank<00:03:45.160> how<00:03:46.160> to<00:03:46.220> eliminate

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
same texts as the tank how to eliminate

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.120 
same texts as the tank how to eliminate
the<00:03:46.790> tank<00:03:47.260> through<00:03:48.260> events<00:03:48.740> and<00:03:48.890> different

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
the tank through events and different

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.680 
the tank through events and different
things<00:03:49.160> so<00:03:50.150> that's<00:03:50.630> how<00:03:50.810> the<00:03:50.840> tanks<00:03:51.230> were

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
things so that's how the tanks were

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.710 
things so that's how the tanks were
pretty<00:03:53.690> pretty<00:03:54.050> uninteresting<00:03:54.470> I<00:03:55.660> can't<00:03:56.660> wait

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
pretty pretty uninteresting I can't wait

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.140 
pretty pretty uninteresting I can't wait
to<00:03:56.810> give<00:03:57.020> this<00:03:57.050> a<00:03:57.230> try<00:03:57.970> probably<00:03:58.970> be<00:03:59.030> dead

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
to give this a try probably be dead

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.210 
to give this a try probably be dead
tonight<00:03:59.330> with<00:03:59.570> the<00:03:59.660> way<00:03:59.810> just<00:04:00.680> to<00:04:00.800> see<00:04:00.950> how<00:04:01.070> it

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
tonight with the way just to see how it

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.770 
tonight with the way just to see how it
works<00:04:01.370> out<00:04:01.610> so<00:04:02.300> there<00:04:03.020> you<00:04:03.110> go<00:04:03.170> that's<00:04:03.560> some

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
works out so there you go that's some

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.480 
works out so there you go that's some
battle<00:04:05.780> pack<00:04:05.959> number<00:04:06.200> 5<00:04:06.590> follow<00:04:07.070> the<00:04:07.310> west

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
battle pack number 5 follow the west

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.550 
battle pack number 5 follow the west
with<00:04:07.670> combat<00:04:07.970> commander<00:04:08.450> and<00:04:08.660> they're

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
with combat commander and they're

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.620 
with combat commander and they're
interesting<00:04:10.010> tanks<00:04:10.310> so<00:04:10.970> this<00:04:11.120> will<00:04:11.209> be<00:04:11.330> early

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
interesting tanks so this will be early

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.820 
interesting tanks so this will be early
war

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.890 

you
