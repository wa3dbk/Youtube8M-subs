00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 Hello hello to your animal for schmidts 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.040
 cat and rat tv tonight in the 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.670
 Watergate on the way with a receipt much 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.670
 fun 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:38.489
 hello nice good evening again 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.559
 hailstone can now have done quite well 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.010
 is still early in the evening there should be 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.559
 be still fresh what you have new 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.210
 compilation goes on number 13 what 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:54.360
 what can we expect a choice of 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.840
 songs that I think are great and for this 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.100
 compilation was relevant enough 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.489
 the final result is yes, but each compilation 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.229
 Nobody makes you look for who 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.159
 which is for which circumstance and here 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.430
 Of course I have a little bit of that 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.140
 sound from board is also ajar and 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.540
 Well , I made a choice 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.830
 on partial tracks known to me 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.960
 have sent them now, so to speak 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.400
 even before women are a few things 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.740
 to have them in the quasi very much now 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.150
 are current and a few classics the 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.369
 I really liked the one I dug up 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.740
 have from my record collection 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.360
 yes and then so you do 40 50 tracks 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.470
 and then look what fits together and 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.210
 mixes and makes and howls desperately 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.159
 again great desperate hoyle shows 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.479
 his friends when the joy howl 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.750
 Do it again if the friends 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.340
 Gladness then you say it done but 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.079
 it is also so from the outside 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.780
 I had the word it goes one piece 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:49.040
 far too built up I would say because 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.040
 that's the word for you 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.729
 that's a good question what is 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.320
 continued roddick is for me that 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.759
 window outside except because 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.259
 you can see it that way when he's called 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.359
 berliner dj feel in berlin underground 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.679
 locations played sometime halt 

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:03.140
 decided that potter is one 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:04.609
 international location and with one 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.319
 residence here one also leaves one 

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:07.399
 bit the anagram falls that is 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:08.780
 So you are a bit apart 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.450
 ghosn no longer replayed like that 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.780
 Much is here doing his 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.250
 event presents itself here and 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.780
 This also makes it outside the city 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.430
 So that's natural 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.299
 Also a good business card in the club 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.950
 to be president 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:23.690
 that means you can say it's my goal 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.930
 to the world and now just with the cdu 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:32.209
 pure and where is of course all the more so 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:35.360
 and not very happy the study is 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.900
 philosophy still goes along bassist 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.950
 it about each other 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.510
 oh well there is philosophy 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.459
 art theory that has of course with music 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.840
 it was nice I found quite interesting 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.099
 many things have nothing to do with it 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.049
 but in the end it was one too 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.459
 The result is that I have noticed 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.720
 that now always when you're always in 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.040
 then this nightlife is also 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.730
 always talking about the same things 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.139
 So and I'm totally interested 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.120
 my head in different directions 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:00.319
 and that was why it was his 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.420
 Study still very cool 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.700
 We know sitting between good times 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.680
 show writes ten years on by 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.239
 my very first legal party 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.170
 has written a very first legal 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:16.310
 father i think for me unforgettable 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.660
 because it was so special to me about it 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.340
 just have come to me 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.410
 vigorously until ten o'clock in the morning until the 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.290
 really in the cellar of my wg 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.669
 yes that was a feast of the door 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.380
 if you should go with the water 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:28.760
 Hundred water and nothing seen that 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:34.310
 the man from the police was because of me 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:35.630
 pressed the cake hand as it is 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.579
 It's still like that today 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.349
 gradually the raven still further to 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.730
 is trading or that one somewhere 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.019
 a little bit routine 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.060
 So I can remember the last one 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.379
 times when I became so called afterhour 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.780
 was gone in Zurich 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:48.799
 I did not find any more after that 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.409
 I walked alone through the city 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.700
 mobile phone from small change are four 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:54.230
 drunk hours the city has run 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.700
 I had the time around four hours 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.080
 sometimes as a reflection and in proportion 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.549
 continue to set 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.840
 and now I am actually like that 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.580
 then go to the hotel especially since one 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.140
 yes earlier you have to go in the weekend 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.459
 had now partly 34 or 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.860
 so that will be a pretty exhausting one 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.150
 have to sleep in between otherwise get it 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.110
 I can get my work 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.780
 Do not do more than during the week 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.489
 the music making and the weekend 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.160
 hang up so much force on 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.479
 It is a long time for me so there is 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.430
 weak moments where i am in berlin then 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.690
 again, where one thinks for a moment 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.669
 one does but please do it then 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.160
 I go my hour or soy 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.570
 is a pity sometimes you know you meet 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.770
 always and everywhere people too 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.630
 meanwhile in other cities has in 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.880
 Germany is back and we know 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.250
 partially no longer alcohol 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.210
 or so and then you have to always 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.410
 Excuse me because these are the people 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.880
 they always go away and they want it 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.370
 you see yourself and that's funny and come 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.530
 and in the constant fight but then home 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.240
 and in the long run that is totally nice 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.099
 and we like it and you have it 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.570
 These great thoughts still to the 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:49.490
 earlier time that we for example you 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.120
 then say that was just great to be so 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.830
 do not forget either 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.710
 but then you have to let go of it 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:05:00.580
 So at some point it does not look any more 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:00.580
 cool so that does not know 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.670
 you play in my club in may 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:18.920
 freiburg in schmitten's cat is part of 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:21.840
 An almost world tour can be said and 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.970
 what remains is the album play through 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.380
 let it come to you how will it be 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.210
 his you mean the compilation 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.430
 through rudel with you simply from the beginning 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.410
 to the back cinema so I have to say 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.060
 that after doing the compilation 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.410
 you have the titles on it first 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.800
 not so much anymore 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:39.810
 can hear and nonsense so the mix 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.030
 is synonymous designed so that it is not extreme 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:45.030
 you could play in the club now but 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:47.370
 Nevertheless , it is also mix the listen 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.390
 also is so i would reverse the mix 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.430
 it's just not in the club right now 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.350
 So I play it that way 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.700
 that he represents is what 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.050
 But in the club he can pass 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.970
 compressed to 60 minutes 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.000
 Of course this does not work in the club 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.020
 if you have the whole night so yes 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.130
 I do not play games like that 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.180
 I do not know anything else yet 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.560
 do not make me so extreme 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.570
 I am therefore on my side 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.040
 I look at the people I mean 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.510
 schmitz cat was there I know 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.670
 can do something dangerous now 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:14.740
 not and 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.880
 Looking totally ahead of it bought in 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.630
 really a super horny load with great 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:21.520
 can make cool romantic series so rather 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.800
 the area is completely musical 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.170
 interesting the people are very open 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.210
 I am very happy for Tobi 

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.800
 thank you very much i am looking forward to the night 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:35.470
 I think it will be very exciting very 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:38.590
 I think it's a lot better today 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:40.680
 We are definitely in may and up 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.680
 soon
