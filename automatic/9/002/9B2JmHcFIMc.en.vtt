00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.490
 Interest in real-time popular search terms ranking on portal sites 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.809
 You'll be seeing it. 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:16.160
 It was revealed. It is an epochal reporter. Of this market 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.850
 Search terms on portal sites such as new systems 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.630
 The higher the ranking, the more people who know and click 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.529
 What happened 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.400
 Non-core and operating profit 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.250
 It is an exaggeration to say that it is fair trade in real time and 20 ingredients all over the world 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.259
 It can not be 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.500
 Once you get to the real-time search ranking, 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.159
 I have intensive interest and it is bigger than big 

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:38.920
 You can lift your feet in width. 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.920
 Do you have people manipulating your query? 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.780
 An email from a business 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.820
 It says online marketing proposal, but it's actually kissy 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.410
 I would like to give the name of the business I wanted 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.820
 I made a direct call. 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.890
 da 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.890
 b 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.360
 Real-time query of industry revitalization 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.420
 ranking 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.920
 I was in the top position. 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.820
 It's gone. 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.440
 Volleyball 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.400
 No matter what the competition is 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.530
 The public retention rate is Daekyung Machinery. In the past, 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.010
 Raise the name of a favorite entertainer such as fan club 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.000
 for 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.040
 There was a story like this when I search collectively. 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.150
 It seems to be better diplomatic way. we 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.680
 In this case, 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.940
 It's done through a kind of hacking that infects 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.560
 I was there. 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.360
 After infecting a large number of computers, infected computers 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.460
 It's a way to steer a man who was searching for a word. 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.150
 Even though Kangwon National University continues to search for specific words, 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.500
 Because it is programmed not to appear, 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.880
 The owner can see if his computer is being manipulated 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.830
 There is not 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.450
 The query manipulation program goes down from the Internet 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.450
 It's open again and hidden in the program. 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.340
 Four love stories 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.839
 I was expecting to play. 

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:11.919
 left. he is 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:14.919
 If you want to reflect well from the past hundreds of thousands 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.479
 Millions. 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:20.479
 The line grows bigger. 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.349
 Han 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:29.109
 What measures are there? 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:33.329
 ucc video is a good indicator of netizen's present 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:33.660
 That's it. 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.940
 If it is manipulated in this way, the reliability of the portal will decrease 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.940
 I can not help it. 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:42.919
 The fact that popular search terms 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:45.919
 There are many issues in our country 

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:49.459
 Data centers are at the current level of technology. 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.459
 They say it's hard to get hold of these operations. 

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:55.899
 With some completion 

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:58.339
 However, it is a situation that is always opposed. For this 

00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:01.339
 Your thoughts 

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:04.389
 You can take responsibility for it. 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:06.259
 You have to report and have a lot of people 

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:09.619
 The impact of real-time queries and portals has grown. Yu Jae-sung 

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:10.669
 reporter 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:13.649
 Responsible for filtering inaccurate information as influential 

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:15.209
 Attitudes are also instruments. 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.499
 You care.
