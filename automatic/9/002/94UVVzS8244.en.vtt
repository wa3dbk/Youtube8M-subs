how white the tea is that's because they

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.370 
how white the tea is that's because they
put<00:01:20.330> cream<00:01:20.840> in<00:01:20.869> it<00:01:22.330> so<00:01:23.330> I<00:01:23.420> throw<00:01:23.570> it<00:01:23.630> up<00:01:23.720> I'll

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.529 

I<00:01:52.679> guess<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.609> guess<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:54.000> probably<00:01:54.090> look<00:01:54.329> little

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
darker in the picture but probably could

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.459
