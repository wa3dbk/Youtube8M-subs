00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.110 
right now his heads by the net right now

right there and now his heads over the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.189 
right there and now his heads over the
net<00:00:58.129> this<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.370> think<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.760> this<00:00:59.879> maximum<00:01:00.510> height

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
net this I think is this maximum height

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.380 
net this I think is this maximum height
as<00:01:01.470> a<00:01:01.580> jumper<00:01:02.580> and<00:01:02.820> now<00:01:03.780> watch<00:01:04.580> home<00:01:05.580> he's

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390
