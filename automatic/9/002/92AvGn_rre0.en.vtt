clone if you guys can see it and then

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.730 
clone if you guys can see it and then
the<00:01:32.460> ends<00:01:35.869> mmm<00:01:37.250> it<00:01:38.250> should<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.090> little<00:01:39.390> bit

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
the ends mmm it should it a little bit

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.870

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
it's not all the wavelengths but it's

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.440 
it's not all the wavelengths but it's
fine<00:01:47.189> because<00:01:47.520> eventually<00:01:47.880> i<00:01:48.090> think<00:01:48.270> i<00:01:48.329> was

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450
