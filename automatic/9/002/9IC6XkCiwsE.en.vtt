so<00:00:45.960> firstly<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.500> have<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.860> original<00:00:47.370> image<00:00:47.610> and

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
so firstly I have a original image and

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.889 
so firstly I have a original image and
then<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.390> will<00:00:48.899> go<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.260> decimal<00:00:49.620> layer<00:00:50.899> so

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
then I will go to a decimal layer so

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.740 
then I will go to a decimal layer so
here<00:00:52.469> my<00:00:52.649> main<00:00:53.160> aim<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.520> reduce<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
here my main aim is to reduce the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.020 
here my main aim is to reduce the
saturation<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.350> put<00:00:55.770> some<00:00:56.160> contrast<00:00:56.760> and

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
saturation and put some contrast and

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.010 
saturation and put some contrast and
special<00:00:57.539> blue<00:00:58.379> shade<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.890> image<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.640> that

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
special blue shade to the image and that

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.569 
special blue shade to the image and that
will<00:01:01.020> give<00:01:01.379> me<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.710> fashion<00:01:02.309> style

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
will give me the fashion style

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.560 
will give me the fashion style
photography<00:01:04.309> then<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.549> will<00:01:05.729> merge<00:01:05.970> two<00:01:06.960> layers

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
photography then I will merge two layers

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.050 
photography then I will merge two layers
then<00:01:09.570> send<00:01:09.900> set<00:01:10.590> its<00:01:10.740> blend<00:01:10.979> mode<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.189> hard

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
then send set its blend mode to hard

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.550 
then send set its blend mode to hard
light<00:01:12.890> then<00:01:14.330> filter<00:01:15.330> then<00:01:15.570> high<00:01:15.750> pass<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.350> is

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
light then filter then high pass it is

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.289 
light then filter then high pass it is
because<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.520> want<00:01:17.820> some<00:01:18.210> more<00:01:19.020> sharpening

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
so that I am using this high pass and

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.510 
so that I am using this high pass and
then<00:01:25.020> after<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.470> color<00:01:25.799> balance<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.280> want

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
then after that color balance I want

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.300 
then after that color balance I want
blue<00:01:26.759> shade<00:01:27.030> for<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.590> will<00:01:28.920> go<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.159> a

see the difference this is before and
this<00:02:32.650> is<00:02:32.709> after<00:02:32.950> now<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:34.180> final<00:02:34.540> step<00:02:34.690> is<00:02:34.930> I

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
this is after now the final step is I
