00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:08.870 
today about the pentatonic scale which

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.160 
today about the pentatonic scale which
is<00:00:08.900> a<00:00:09.020> great<00:00:09.320> tool<00:00:09.650> for<00:00:10.510> improving<00:00:11.510> over<00:00:12.139> a

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:22.759 
B flat E flat and F pretty much a one

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:26.019 
B flat E flat and F pretty much a one
four<00:00:23.029> five<00:00:23.269> and<00:00:23.810> over<00:00:24.619> this<00:00:24.890> song<00:00:25.759> I'm<00:00:25.910> gonna

four five and over this song I'm gonna
use<00:00:26.119> the<00:00:26.269> pentatonic<00:00:26.689> scale<00:00:27.339> this<00:00:28.339> is<00:00:28.519> the

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
use the pentatonic scale this is the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.650 
use the pentatonic scale this is the
major<00:00:28.820> scale<00:00:29.259> in<00:00:30.579> b-flat<00:00:31.579> which<00:00:31.970> you<00:00:32.509> could

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
major scale in b-flat which you could

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.000 
major scale in b-flat which you could
pretty<00:00:32.810> much<00:00:32.870> use<00:00:33.020> this<00:00:33.320> whole<00:00:33.560> thing<00:00:33.800> over

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
pretty much use this whole thing over

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.229 
pretty much use this whole thing over
this<00:00:34.130> whole<00:00:34.340> song<00:00:34.550> but<00:00:34.700> if<00:00:34.790> you<00:00:34.850> want<00:00:35.000> to<00:00:35.060> sound

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
this whole song but if you want to sound

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.080 
this whole song but if you want to sound
better<00:00:35.420> take<00:00:36.320> out<00:00:36.530> this<00:00:37.160> one<00:00:37.399> and<00:00:37.550> that<00:00:38.030> one

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
better take out this one and that one

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.910 
better take out this one and that one
and<00:00:38.270> just<00:00:38.570> use<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:38.840> pentatonic<00:00:39.410> scale<00:00:39.620> which

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
and just use the pentatonic scale which

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.060 
and just use the pentatonic scale which
is<00:00:40.129> an<00:00:40.969> atomic<00:00:41.449> means<00:00:41.629> a<00:00:41.750> five<00:00:41.960> note<00:00:42.199> scale<00:00:42.260> and

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
is an atomic means a five note scale and

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.459 
is an atomic means a five note scale and
it<00:00:43.670> means<00:00:44.000> the<00:00:44.149> first<00:00:44.359> second<00:00:44.809> third<00:00:45.019> fifth

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
it means the first second third fifth

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:47.560 
it means the first second third fifth
sixth<00:00:45.980> and<00:00:46.190> then<00:00:46.309> the<00:00:46.489> wine<00:00:47.180> or<00:00:47.300> the<00:00:47.329> eighth

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
sixth and then the wine or the eighth

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.560 
sixth and then the wine or the eighth
that's<00:00:48.050> the<00:00:48.199> first<00:00:48.559> second<00:00:49.280> third<00:00:49.570> fifth

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
that's the first second third fifth

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.020 
that's the first second third fifth
sixth<00:00:51.410> and<00:00:51.500> first<00:00:52.070> or<00:00:52.309> eighth<00:00:52.579> it's<00:00:52.789> the<00:00:52.850> same

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
sixth and first or eighth it's the same

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.580 
sixth and first or eighth it's the same
thing<00:00:53.269> and<00:00:53.660> so<00:00:53.929> what<00:00:54.109> that<00:00:54.140> sounds<00:00:54.559> like

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
thing and so what that sounds like

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.319 
thing and so what that sounds like
because<00:00:54.890> this<00:00:55.100> is<00:00:55.280> the<00:00:55.429> b-flat<00:00:55.699> pentatonic

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
because this is the b-flat pentatonic

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:04.009 
because this is the b-flat pentatonic
scale<00:01:00.129> this<00:01:01.129> is<00:01:01.339> the<00:01:01.489> major<00:01:01.640> scale

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
scale this is the major scale

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.420 
scale this is the major scale
I've<00:01:05.019> taken<00:01:05.290> out<00:01:05.500> those<00:01:05.710> two<00:01:05.920> that<00:01:06.100> I<00:01:06.160> said

I've taken out those two that I said

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.420 
I've taken out those two that I said
here's<00:01:06.640> the<00:01:06.760> pentatonic<00:01:07.180> scale<00:01:07.510> again<00:01:07.979> flat<00:01:08.979> C

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
here's the pentatonic scale again flat C

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.680 
here's the pentatonic scale again flat C

back and play that again only I'll use

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.600 
back and play that again only I'll use
these<00:02:57.660> kinds<00:02:58.140> of<00:02:58.230> notes

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:04:21.840 

there's<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.820> b-flat<00:03:03.060> kind<00:03:03.390> of<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.720> scale

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.980 

so<00:04:22.850> you<00:04:22.940> can<00:04:23.150> tell<00:04:23.330> I<00:04:23.360> use<00:04:23.540> a<00:04:23.570> lot<00:04:23.840> of

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
so you can tell I use a lot of

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.409 
so you can tell I use a lot of
repetition<00:04:24.460> and<00:04:25.460> once<00:04:25.639> I<00:04:25.760> find<00:04:25.910> the<00:04:26.090> pattern

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
repetition and once I find the pattern

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:32.650 
repetition and once I find the pattern
of<00:04:26.600> notes<00:04:26.840> I<00:04:26.990> can<00:04:27.050> use<00:04:27.260> that<00:04:27.440> you<00:04:31.389> just<00:04:32.389> playing

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
of notes I can use that you just playing

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.330 
of notes I can use that you just playing
those<00:04:32.900> notes<00:04:32.930> and<00:04:33.380> that<00:04:33.530> makes<00:04:33.949> you<00:04:34.070> sound

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
those notes and that makes you sound

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.550 
those notes and that makes you sound
like<00:04:34.550> you<00:04:34.910> can<00:04:35.240> play<00:04:35.419> a<00:04:35.449> lot<00:04:35.690> of<00:04:35.810> faster<00:04:36.410> things

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
like you can play a lot of faster things

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.629 
like you can play a lot of faster things
but<00:04:36.770> really<00:04:36.949> you're<00:04:37.070> just<00:04:37.100> playing<00:04:37.400> a<00:04:37.490> pattern

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
but really you're just playing a pattern

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:43.750 
but really you're just playing a pattern
of<00:04:37.970> pentatonic<00:04:38.780> notes<00:04:41.650> and<00:04:42.650> you<00:04:42.710> can<00:04:42.830> play<00:04:43.010> you

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
of pentatonic notes and you can play you

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.909 
of pentatonic notes and you can play you
can<00:04:43.820> play<00:04:43.910> chords<00:04:44.510> well<00:04:45.169> you<00:04:45.320> can<00:04:45.440> use<00:04:45.560> chords

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
can play chords well you can use chords

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.379 
can play chords well you can use chords
a<00:04:48.310> lot<00:04:49.310> of<00:04:49.430> harmonies<00:04:49.850> there<00:04:50.000> as<00:04:50.090> long<00:04:50.180> as<00:04:50.240> I

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
a lot of harmonies there as long as I

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.060 
a lot of harmonies there as long as I
use<00:04:50.600> those<00:04:50.840> pentatonic<00:04:51.440> notes<00:04:51.620> which<00:04:51.889> are

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
use those pentatonic notes which are

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.990 
use those pentatonic notes which are
basically<00:04:52.340> these<00:04:53.289> I'm<00:04:54.289> okay

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
basically these I'm okay

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.520 
basically these I'm okay
now<00:04:56.000> some<00:04:56.270> fit<00:04:56.539> better<00:04:56.720> with<00:04:56.870> others<00:04:57.260> but<00:04:57.500> you

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
now some fit better with others but you

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.129 
now some fit better with others but you
can<00:04:57.949> get<00:04:58.100> the<00:04:58.190> hang<00:04:58.310> of<00:04:58.400> that<00:04:58.900> so<00:04:59.900> that's

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
can get the hang of that so that's

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.639 
can get the hang of that so that's
what's<00:05:00.770> the<00:05:00.919> pentatonic<00:05:01.430> scale
