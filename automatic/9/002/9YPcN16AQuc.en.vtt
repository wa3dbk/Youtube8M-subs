Optimus Prime without using hyperbole

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.340 
Optimus Prime without using hyperbole
but<00:00:10.710> I<00:00:11.670> really<00:00:11.880> don't<00:00:12.030> think<00:00:12.090> I<00:00:12.330> can<00:00:14.929> it's<00:00:15.929> of

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
but I really don't think I can it's of

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.970 
but I really don't think I can it's of
course<00:00:16.619> Optimus<00:00:17.520> Prime<00:00:17.820> we've<00:00:18.420> had<00:00:18.980> Abba

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
course Optimus Prime we've had Abba

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.529 
course Optimus Prime we've had Abba
trillion<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.970> them<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:22.609> somehow<00:00:23.609> they're<00:00:24.359> all

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
trillion of them and somehow they're all

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.870 
trillion of them and somehow they're all
sort<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.560> sad<00:00:25.939> distillation<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.210> the

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
sort of a sad distillation of the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.389 
sort of a sad distillation of the
original<00:00:29.880> Optimus<00:00:30.720> Prime<00:00:31.160> of<00:00:32.160> course

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
original Optimus Prime of course

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.180 
original Optimus Prime of course
occasionally<00:00:33.030> they'll<00:00:33.420> change<00:00:33.660> things<00:00:33.960> up

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
occasionally they'll change things up

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.180 
occasionally they'll change things up
but<00:00:35.190> they're<00:00:35.730> all<00:00:35.880> pretty<00:00:36.239> derivative<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.500> G<00:00:38.040> 1

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
but they're all pretty derivative of G 1

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.270 
but they're all pretty derivative of G 1
prime<00:00:38.460> this<00:00:39.090> one<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.450> too<00:00:39.920> but<00:00:40.920> that's<00:00:41.040> what<00:00:41.219> I

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
prime this one is too but that's what I

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.020 
prime this one is too but that's what I
love<00:00:41.489> about<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.879> because<00:00:42.629> it's<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:42.960> darn<00:00:43.200> cute

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
love about it because it's so darn cute
