00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:07.880 

okay<00:00:02.280> this<00:00:02.490> is<00:00:02.730> a<00:00:04.549> weedeater<00:00:05.549> engine<00:00:06.799> but<00:00:07.799> I

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
okay this is a weedeater engine but I

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.720 
okay this is a weedeater engine but I
tore<00:00:08.189> down<00:00:08.990> as<00:00:09.990> it<00:00:10.230> as<00:00:10.530> a<00:00:10.559> test<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:11.309> try<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.420> get

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
tore down as it as a test to try and get

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.849 
tore down as it as a test to try and get
steam<00:00:14.730> engine<00:00:15.120> it's<00:00:16.109> running<00:00:16.410> on<00:00:16.470> compressed

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
steam engine it's running on compressed

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:25.070 
steam engine it's running on compressed
air<00:00:18.230> was<00:00:19.230> trying<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.770> come<00:00:20.310> up<00:00:20.460> with<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:24.080> timing

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
air was trying to come up with a timing

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.630 
air was trying to come up with a timing
mechanism<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:28.189> haven't<00:00:29.189> been<00:00:29.279> able<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.519> get

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
mechanism I haven't been able to get

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.930 
mechanism I haven't been able to get
that<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:30.390> work<00:00:30.890> but<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.009> in<00:00:32.369> doing<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.910> I

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
that to work but in in doing that I

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.299 
that to work but in in doing that I
found<00:00:33.390> out<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.690> will<00:00:33.750> run<00:00:33.989> continuously<00:00:34.469> with

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
found out it will run continuously with

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.139 
found out it will run continuously with
just<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.149> straight<00:00:36.680> feed<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.890> air<00:00:38.100> because<00:00:38.879> of

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
just a straight feed of air because of

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.959 
just a straight feed of air because of
the<00:00:39.239> momentum<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.930> flywheel<00:00:40.640> it'll<00:00:41.640> still

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
the momentum of the flywheel it'll still

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.850 
the momentum of the flywheel it'll still
run<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.809> was<00:00:42.930> just<00:00:42.960> going<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.290> show<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.590> that

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
run so I was just going to show you that

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.299 
run so I was just going to show you that
and<00:00:44.450> I'll<00:00:45.450> make<00:00:46.260> another<00:00:46.289> video<00:00:46.710> when<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.160> get

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
and I'll make another video when I get

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.190 
and I'll make another video when I get
the<00:00:47.399> timing<00:00:47.670> done<00:00:48.000> because<00:00:48.329> I'm<00:00:48.510> sure<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.809> it

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
the timing done because I'm sure that it

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.350 
the timing done because I'm sure that it
would<00:00:49.320> be<00:00:49.469> much<00:00:49.649> more<00:00:49.920> efficient<00:00:51.110> with<00:00:53.360> with

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
would be much more efficient with with

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.020 
would be much more efficient with with
it<00:00:54.539> times<00:00:54.809> properly<00:00:56.360> so<00:00:57.379> my<00:00:58.379> my<00:00:59.030> air

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
it times properly so my my air

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.889 
it times properly so my my air
compressor<00:01:00.239> doesn't<00:01:01.050> hold<00:01:01.379> much<00:01:01.770> air<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.329> I'm

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
compressor doesn't hold much air and I'm

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.060 
compressor doesn't hold much air and I'm
not<00:01:04.049> going<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.260> turn<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:04.680> because<00:01:04.830> it's

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
not going to turn it on because it's

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.210 
not going to turn it on because it's
really<00:01:05.129> loud<00:01:05.549> but<00:01:05.909> right<00:01:06.210> now<00:01:06.360> it's<00:01:06.510> got<00:01:06.630> about

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
really loud but right now it's got about

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:14.390 
really loud but right now it's got about
9<00:01:08.840> psi<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:10.740> built<00:01:11.220> up<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:12.560> this<00:01:13.560> will<00:01:13.799> run<00:01:14.220> it

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
9 psi it built up and this will run it

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.929 
9 psi it built up and this will run it
down<00:01:14.610> all<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.970> way<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.119> about<00:01:15.680> 5<00:01:16.680> psi<00:01:17.460> before

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
down all the way to about 5 psi before

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.570 
down all the way to about 5 psi before
it<00:01:18.030> actually<00:01:18.150> stops<00:01:18.689> running<00:01:19.280> so<00:01:20.280> I'm<00:01:20.430> just

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
it actually stops running so I'm just

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.469 
it actually stops running so I'm just
going<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.820> run<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.090> down<00:01:21.119> let<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.600> see<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.930> and

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
going to run it down let you see it and

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.730 
going to run it down let you see it and
set<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:25.670> set<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.790> position<00:01:27.170> of<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.409> physics

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
set the set the position of the physics

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:36.340 
set the set the position of the physics
of<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.130> piston

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:02:21.860 

okay<00:01:38.180> well<00:01:39.180> here<00:01:39.390> we<00:01:39.479> go<00:01:39.509> a<00:02:20.420> little<00:02:21.420> run<00:02:21.660> pretty

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
okay well here we go a little run pretty

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.030 
okay well here we go a little run pretty
good<00:02:22.049> on<00:02:22.250> very<00:02:23.250> small<00:02:23.750> amount<00:02:24.750> of<00:02:24.840> psi<00:02:25.380> and

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
good on very small amount of psi and

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.289 
good on very small amount of psi and
I'll<00:02:29.040> make<00:02:29.280> another<00:02:29.310> video<00:02:29.730> when<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.030> get<00:02:30.209> it

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
I'll make another video when I get it

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.220 
I'll make another video when I get it
timed<00:02:30.569> see<00:02:31.230> if<00:02:31.290> it's<00:02:31.470> more<00:02:31.739> efficient
