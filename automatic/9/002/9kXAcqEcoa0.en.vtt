00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
so you can't swear what's the best way

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.290 
so you can't swear what's the best way
to<00:03:38.350> see<00:03:38.920> this<00:03:39.160> whole<00:03:39.370> thing<00:03:39.400> what<00:03:40.090> do<00:03:40.150> you<00:03:40.209> have

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
to walk the whole thing and usually it

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.040 
to walk the whole thing and usually it
takes<00:03:42.700> about<00:03:42.819> three<00:03:43.510> or<00:03:43.600> four<00:03:43.780> hours

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
takes about three or four hours

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.500 
takes about three or four hours
depending<00:03:44.200> on<00:03:44.530> how<00:03:44.590> fast<00:03:44.980> do<00:03:45.940> you<00:03:46.030> end<00:03:46.300> there's
