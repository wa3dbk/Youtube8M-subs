00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
beer there's this got these distant

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.300 
beer there's this got these distant
hints<00:03:14.049> of<00:03:15.180> distant<00:03:16.180> hints<00:03:16.450> of<00:03:16.540> that<00:03:16.720> smoke<00:03:17.310> the

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
hints of distant hints of that smoke the

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.050 
hints of distant hints of that smoke the
slight<00:03:18.730> salinity<00:03:20.610> but<00:03:21.610> then<00:03:21.700> it's<00:03:21.820> got<00:03:21.970> this

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
slight salinity but then it's got this

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.180 
slight salinity but then it's got this
great<00:03:22.329> kind<00:03:22.750> of<00:03:22.870> Apple<00:03:23.260> fruitiness<00:03:23.739> running

whiskey gee I won't go through a few
bottles<00:03:51.510> right<00:03:52.510> now<00:03:52.630> that's<00:03:52.780> quite<00:03:52.900> a<00:03:52.930> lot

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
bottles right now that's quite a lot

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.880 
bottles right now that's quite a lot
they've<00:03:53.230> kind<00:03:53.440> of<00:03:53.470> the<00:03:53.590> interplay<00:03:53.860> between

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
they've kind of the interplay between

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.740 
they've kind of the interplay between
the<00:03:54.280> sweetness<00:03:54.670> in<00:03:54.760> this<00:03:54.880> one<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.360> strength

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
the sweetness in this one the strength

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.720 
the sweetness in this one the strength
the<00:03:55.990> punch<00:03:56.230> to<00:03:56.560> it<00:03:56.590> and<00:03:56.770> then<00:03:57.280> it's<00:03:57.430> got<00:03:57.580> that

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
the punch to it and then it's got that

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.830 
the punch to it and then it's got that
depth<00:03:58.120> that<00:03:58.330> complexity<00:03:58.870> of<00:04:00.270> the<00:04:01.270> smoky

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
depth that complexity of the smoky

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.330 
depth that complexity of the smoky
earthiness<00:04:02.290> in<00:04:02.590> there<00:04:02.800> which<00:04:02.980> is<00:04:03.070> just

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
earthiness in there which is just

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.490 
earthiness in there which is just
fantastic<00:04:06.660> as<00:04:07.660> for<00:04:07.840> the<00:04:07.900> similarities

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
fantastic as for the similarities

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.320 
fantastic as for the similarities
between<00:04:08.530> the<00:04:08.890> two<00:04:09.130> you<00:04:09.550> definitely<00:04:09.760> get<00:04:10.060> the

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
between the two you definitely get the

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.140 
between the two you definitely get the
hints<00:04:10.690> of<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:10.870> smokiness<00:04:11.260> and<00:04:11.880> which<00:04:12.880> it<00:04:13.000> gets

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
hints of the smokiness and which it gets
