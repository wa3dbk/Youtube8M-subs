00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040
 very welcome my name is neighbor I am 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.020
 academic coordinator of wine institute 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.730
 I wanted to welcome you and in this 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.340
 meeting let's start talking about what 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.259
 what is the tasting technique the idea 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.389
 is that you learn about wines and 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.279
 once you know how to enjoy this product that 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.279
 what makes us to this province so 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.869
 important the first step to have in 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.449
 realize that later they will be able to go 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.760
 seeing in each of the plates is 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.849
 observe the wine if we have 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.059
 we have a drink and we bow in front 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.250
 of our towards 45 degrees we will be able to 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.809
 observe the colors this is the first 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.550
 wine step then I take my glass and 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.110
 I lean in front of me to be able 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.200
 observe all colors 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.809
 the idea is to know where to look in a 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.690
 so that I can discover what it is that 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.780
 you are telling me once that this step 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.239
 help I did it is very important and it is and 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.070
 this must be taken into account that the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.079
 time to read the wines you have to do it 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.570
 with intensity you have to look for something 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.820
 then what I will first do 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.360
 is to smell the wine without moving the glass 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.360
 this way 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.710
 once I fly I begin to perceive 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.140
 these aromas that I will be giving to 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.799
 came those aromas are going to come from 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.990
 different fruits of different families and 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.729
 once you can discover van 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.920
 to realize or are going to have 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.439
 clues to which wines we are talking about 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.240
 then I turn the cup to go 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.429
 releasing more intensely those 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.899
 aromas and begin to discover others 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:35.939
 types of aromas that are much more 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:40.250
 intense and that come from other families 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.250
 smell so I need to get back to 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.690
 remember that at this stage it is very 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.300
 difficult to perceive intensively and 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.310
 in a controlled manner all these aromas 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.700
 then we need a certain degree of 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.100
 concentration do not worry about feeling 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.860
 lot of aromas but by feeling 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.680
 in quality is to be able to perceive that 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.890
 smell identify it and be able to communicate it 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.140
 and the last step that is the most fun 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.690
 of all the ones we like the most is to try 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.450
 the wine now we need 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.150
 absorb a good drink of wine dunk 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.460
 all our oral cavity in such a way 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.850
 that that wine on paper and leave us 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:25.850
 perceive those flavors that aromas you that 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:29.590
 that complexity in the mouth to then be able to 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.590
 describe it completely 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.810
 depending on the type of wine you are going 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.480
 to find different attributes in the 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.090
 gustatory part if we are talking about 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.099
 a red wine, let's feel dry, let's go 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.319
 to feel alcohol if we are talking 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.440
 of a white we will feel much more 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.239
 freshness more acidity you have to see what it is 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.190
 what one wants to communicate in a way 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.670
 so to get much simpler to the 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:01.459
 consumer then let's remember the three 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.099
 steps of the tasting if or if they have 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:07.190
 to be consecutively that is 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:09.530
 I first observed after flight and by 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.110
 last drink the idea is that one through 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:16.150
 of all these steps helps your own 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.150
 brain to discover this product 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.780
 and I invite you in the next meeting in 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.459
 where each of the steps we are going to 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.379
 start to expand so for the 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.590
 next encounter we will see more 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:33.970
 detail what is the olfactory analysis and 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.970
 gustatory analysis
