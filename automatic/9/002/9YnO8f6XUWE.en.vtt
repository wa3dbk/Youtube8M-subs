00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.740
 why 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.630
 good morning we installed 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.090
 alarms and accessories for motorcycles in the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.470
 city of medellin and nearby places 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.930
 today we are installing an alarm 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:43.050
 silent departure in a 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:47.010
 and there none 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.850
 and we are going to simulate that the alarm is 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.710
 they stole 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.780
 then he has control and they can 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.340
 selling the motorcycle usually has the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.090
 remote control that is delivered 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.090
 with the alarm 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.290
 in front of love 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.629
 Lamata works normally suppose 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.880
 that they took her and he stays with the 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.960
 control and we 're going to go very 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.780
 perfect let's go with the key can 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.750
 be with everything 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.820
 We were simulating a robbery 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.770
 let's see when the bike will be 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.770
 will turn off as reaction to the motorcycle 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.470
 the motorcycle should normally 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:33.270
 already here does not feel control you know that the 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.270
 condor walked away and waits 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.159
 30 seconds approximately 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.080
 to pay 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.430
 yes 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.689
 explained the prince 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:17.830
 m 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.830
 you can get away and thief with your motorcycle 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.290
 it's already turned off 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.800

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.640
 learn it to see if it comes back and turns on 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.640

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.470
 I'm going to go down 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.340
 As you can see , the motorcycle does not turn on 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.410
 this would be what happens to a thief if 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.800
 take a motor and do not take the 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.800
