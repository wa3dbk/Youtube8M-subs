there<00:00:42.960> are<00:00:43.079> many<00:00:43.350> different<00:00:43.710> techniques<00:00:44.100> that

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
there are many different techniques that

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.369 
there are many different techniques that
you<00:00:44.399> can<00:00:44.610> use<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:45.450> play<00:00:45.660> really<00:00:45.840> fast

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
you can use to play really fast

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.799 
you can use to play really fast
each<00:00:47.010> one<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.280> them<00:00:47.460> takes<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.149> lot<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.600> lot<00:00:48.690> of

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
each one of them takes a lot of a lot of

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.150 
each one of them takes a lot of a lot of
practice<00:00:49.260> first<00:00:50.219> one<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.670> single<00:00:51.210> stroke

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.069 

which<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.390> every<00:00:57.390> time<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.629> hit<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.840> stick

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
which is every time you hit the stick

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.660 
which is every time you hit the stick
it's<00:00:58.559> alternating<00:00:58.980> one<00:00:59.670> hit<00:00:59.940> each<00:01:00.410> okay

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
it's alternating one hit each okay

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.189 
it's alternating one hit each okay
second<00:01:02.670> technique<00:01:03.090> it's<00:01:03.539> called<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.899> double

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
second technique it's called the double

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:12.500 
second technique it's called the double
stroke<00:01:10.189> technique<00:01:11.189> it's<00:01:11.820> way<00:01:12.060> more<00:01:12.090> popular

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
stroke technique it's way more popular

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.030 
stroke technique it's way more popular
in<00:01:13.140> my<00:01:13.350> opinion<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.210> it<00:01:15.210> also<00:01:15.740> allows<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.950> to

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
in my opinion and it also allows you to

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.730 
in my opinion and it also allows you to
play<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.189> lot<00:01:17.400> faster<00:01:19.850> start<00:01:20.850> out<00:01:21.030> like<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.420> I

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
play a lot faster start out like that I

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.499 
play a lot faster start out like that I
recommend<00:01:22.740> playing<00:01:22.920> nice<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.490> slow<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.479> you

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
recommend playing nice and slow so you

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.570 
recommend playing nice and slow so you
can<00:01:24.750> get<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.990> feel<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.500> what<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> double<00:01:26.369> stroke

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
can get the feel of what a double stroke

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:35.810 
can get the feel of what a double stroke
roll<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:33.290> so<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.860> can<00:01:34.890> build<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.340> faster

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
roll is so that you can build a faster

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:57.010 
roll is so that you can build a faster
faster<00:01:41.750> faster<00:01:42.750> faster

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.420 

another<00:01:58.020> kind<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.350> role<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.799> called<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.220> power

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
another kind of role is called the power

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.779 
another kind of role is called the power
gentle<00:01:59.820> diddle<00:02:00.140> which<00:02:01.140> much<00:02:02.070> better<00:02:02.310> explain

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
gentle diddle which much better explain

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.520 
gentle diddle which much better explain
where<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.030> show<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:06.200> now<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.500> a

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
where I show it to you now this is a

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:14.509 
where I show it to you now this is a
very<00:02:07.740> advanced<00:02:08.310> type<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.640> role<00:02:13.519> basically

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
very advanced type of role basically

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.009 
very advanced type of role basically
what<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.819> do<00:02:14.940> is<00:02:15.060> you<00:02:15.150> take<00:02:15.330> two<00:02:15.510> single

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
what you do is you take two single

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:21.140 
what you do is you take two single
strokes<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:18.120> then<00:02:18.269> two<00:02:18.480> double<00:02:18.630> strokes<00:02:20.150> two

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
strokes and then two double strokes two

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.910 
strokes and then two double strokes two
single<00:02:21.510> strokes<00:02:21.750> then<00:02:21.989> two<00:02:22.200> other<00:02:22.380> strokes

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.770 

then<00:02:25.920> work<00:02:26.220> your<00:02:26.370> way<00:02:26.430> up<00:02:26.549> faster<00:02:27.150> faster<00:02:27.569> just

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
then work your way up faster faster just

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:42.460 
then work your way up faster faster just
like<00:02:28.019> with<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.350> double<00:02:28.680> stroke

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.470 

my<00:02:43.470> next<00:02:43.769> title<00:02:44.099> role<00:02:44.280> is<00:02:44.760> kind<00:02:45.150> of<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.330> same

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
my next title role is kind of the same

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.089 
my next title role is kind of the same
thing<00:02:45.780> so<00:02:45.810> just<00:02:46.080> a<00:02:46.349> little<00:02:46.620> bit<00:02:46.709> different

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
thing so just a little bit different

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.640 
thing so just a little bit different
it's<00:02:47.550> called<00:02:47.819> the<00:02:48.000> paradiddle<00:02:48.629> paradiddle<00:02:48.900> is

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
it's called the paradiddle paradiddle is

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.979 
it's called the paradiddle paradiddle is
very<00:02:49.920> simple<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:50.910> do<00:02:51.090> two<00:02:51.300> single<00:02:51.599> strokes

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
very simple you do two single strokes

00:02:51.989 --> 00:03:00.759 
very simple you do two single strokes
plus<00:02:52.379> one<00:02:52.709> double<00:02:53.040> stroke<00:02:53.280> which<00:02:54.090> means<00:02:54.769> this

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.720 

now<00:03:01.769> with<00:03:01.980> this<00:03:02.160> role

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
now with this role

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:14.470 
now with this role
you'll<00:03:03.150> be<00:03:03.269> alternating<00:03:03.720> your<00:03:04.319> double<00:03:04.650> hits

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.750 

so<00:03:15.480> after<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:16.530> get<00:03:16.650> that<00:03:16.829> down<00:03:17.069> you<00:03:17.370> speed<00:03:17.610> it

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
so after you get that down you speed it

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:32.900 
so after you get that down you speed it
up<00:03:31.099> now<00:03:32.099> I'm<00:03:32.220> going<00:03:32.370> to<00:03:32.430> show<00:03:32.549> you<00:03:32.579> a<00:03:32.730> little

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
up now I'm going to show you a little

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.030 
up now I'm going to show you a little
technique<00:03:33.180> that<00:03:33.530> involves<00:03:34.530> playing<00:03:34.769> very

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
technique that involves playing very

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.520 
technique that involves playing very
