00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.960 
both both disciplines now
I<00:02:04.560> really<00:02:05.560> think<00:02:05.740> there's<00:02:06.009> that<00:02:06.520> there<00:02:06.759> needs

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
I really think there's that there needs

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.609 
I really think there's that there needs
to<00:02:07.180> be<00:02:07.210> more<00:02:07.330> of<00:02:07.540> an<00:02:07.659> interface<00:02:08.050> between<00:02:08.080> the

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
to be more of an interface between the

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.529 
to be more of an interface between the
two<00:02:09.310> endeavors<00:02:09.789> I<00:02:10.000> agree<00:02:10.390> because

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
two endeavors I agree because

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.150 
two endeavors I agree because
bodybuilders<00:02:11.290> are<00:02:11.470> basically<00:02:11.890> just

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
bodybuilders are basically just

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.040 
bodybuilders are basically just
concerned<00:02:12.550> about<00:02:12.700> building<00:02:13.510> their<00:02:13.660> muscles

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
concerned about building their muscles

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.890 
concerned about building their muscles
and<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:15.640> know<00:02:15.730> people<00:02:15.970> that<00:02:16.239> do<00:02:16.390> yoga<00:02:16.720> really

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
and you know people that do yoga really

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.589 
and you know people that do yoga really
should<00:02:17.530> start<00:02:18.040> paying<00:02:18.819> more<00:02:19.090> attention<00:02:19.480> at

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
should start paying more attention at

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.050 
should start paying more attention at
the<00:02:20.050> musculature<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:20.800> do<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.370> little<00:02:21.550> work<00:02:21.790> for

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
the musculature and do a little work for

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.630 
the musculature and do a little work for
the<00:02:22.300> for<00:02:22.989> the<00:02:23.020> you<00:02:23.530> know<00:02:23.620> resistance<00:02:24.550> training

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
the for the you know resistance training

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.420 
the for the you know resistance training
in<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.209> skeletal<00:02:26.110> muscle<00:02:26.440> yeah<00:02:26.620> I<00:02:26.860> think<00:02:27.190> the

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
in the skeletal muscle yeah I think the

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.280 
in the skeletal muscle yeah I think the
combination<00:02:27.640> I<00:02:28.120> think<00:02:28.360> anything<00:02:29.110> that's

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
combination I think anything that's

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.630 
combination I think anything that's
successful<00:02:30.510> relies<00:02:31.510> on<00:02:31.840> other<00:02:32.380> areas<00:02:33.100> it's

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
successful relies on other areas it's

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.280 
successful relies on other areas it's
not<00:02:33.849> just<00:02:34.090> one<00:02:34.330> thing<00:02:34.360> that's<00:02:34.780> going<00:02:34.989> to<00:02:35.019> do<00:02:35.200> it

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
not just one thing that's going to do it

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.440 
not just one thing that's going to do it
for<00:02:35.319> you<00:02:35.620> now<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:36.099> more<00:02:36.310> different<00:02:36.700> areas<00:02:37.239> you

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
for you now the more different areas you

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.900 
for you now the more different areas you
can<00:02:37.630> integrate<00:02:38.500> into<00:02:38.950> your<00:02:38.980> practice<00:02:39.310> the

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
can integrate into your practice the

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.120 
can integrate into your practice the
