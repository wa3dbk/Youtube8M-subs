00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:26.619
 not hi everyone's gone for 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:30.000
 a new news session you love 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:32.320
 it's serious news is not it so in 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.120
 continuation of my previous news for 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.449
 those who looked at it and who noticed 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.010
 a today we are in May since 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:41.140
 a few days which means that I have 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.300
 officially finished but court the 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.550
 last week to be exact 1 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.899
 I did not have time to update the 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.070
 chain because there had been that I was 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:49.110
 I take care of the last little details 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.129
 with regard to 1 and 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.440
 the internship that I need to validate 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.410
 my year but good now I'm at 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:00.250
 100% unavailable for the channel finally 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.120
 in parentheses we will say at 70% the 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.710
 time that I have an official answer 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.859
 for the internship I need good 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.859
 tracks 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.010
 1 let's go for the little details 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.540
 happened since the last time 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.570
 so bad news for those who 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.970
 have not noticed it yet 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.979
 youtube goes again gracefully we're going 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.830
 say pull out one of my videos 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.899
 the episode of these people saying that the sound 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.080
 was no longer correct because the 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:31.860
 music from my credits is invited and 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.600
 copyright blah blah blah blah blah so 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.000
 I did the same treatment as for 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.500
 episode 5 I put a nice message 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.539
 tried to delete that bousille they 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.399
 are and I put the episode link one 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.890
 downloading 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.390
 hooray and see how much it's spread 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.679
 as and when in all my 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.520
 videos so I think I'm going 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:53.600
 officially take out what I wanted 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.590
 not go out ie state of siege 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.030
 girl version ie and without 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.850
 complex to say without a break between 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.020
 episodes directly like that a file 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.460
 an hour and a half I know more 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.060
 exactly 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.170
 except that I will make a slight 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.399
 change for all music 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.979
 who have taken note of copyright for 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.769
 never let me in between 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.110
 parentheses shit for music 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:16.200
 swatch is this because we're going to say that 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.489
 it makes me a little bad for those who 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.900
 want to watch the old episodes and 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.940
 especially for people who do not have 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.160
 seen the episodes that their group a little 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.239
 because they are either downloaded yes where 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.840
 they do not want to be shit 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:30.390
 what if not for those who 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:36.150
 interest we will say for all those who 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:37.500
 it interests episode 3 normally if 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.630
 all this blow if everything is pinning well 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.250
 in parentheses I would say late May 1 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.070
 as I said so out but 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.359
 unfortunately some of the ones like I 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.040
 said I was busy and some of 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.209
 team members who make voices sound 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.940
 gone on vacation from the blow to recover 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.170
 their voices it's a bit complicated 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.459
 what you have to tell you is that 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.720
 it's the last 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.570
 this is the final stretch takes 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.260
 just that I get the sails and honey 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.120
 are already made 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.410
 I have a very small part of those 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.300
 from soran 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.440
 for the moment I have that it's 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.990
 for that it is not so advanced but 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.180
 it'll be very, very fast when I 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.850
 I can take care of it the most 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.270
 quickly possible this is his colony if 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.070
 we are our new I'm still going 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.060
 once now that I'm 100% 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.350
 at home that I need more 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.570
 move my pc tried to broadcast 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.460
 all videos judged late 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.730
 be the pgm and parts of high as well 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.730
 right now 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.660
 so I do not know how franÃ§ois 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.300
 vinet in any case are in our stuff I 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.260
 will finally be able to get out 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.660
 besides it will surely be the video that 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.650
 will arrive just after this one I do not know 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.540
 not with our collections maybe a 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.100
 hour of interval where it's the first 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.430
 official episode of the dull studios 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.050
 ya turned operational with the voices is 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.670
 mounted I just need it 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.900
 just that I send it so there is like 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.890
 I linked with my crappy connection this 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.360
 would be for the moment I'm re 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.880
 many drool I do not care I have the 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.990
 law 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.490
 and here I think it's all for 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.580
 news if you have questions 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.900
 as usual in the comments 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.980
 do not hesitate i answer i there 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.450
 will answer anyway if I'm on 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.860
 this one i'm on youtube right now 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.600
 there an end to yes it is true a certain 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.920
 that they had asked questions about this 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.650
 we can help you for the series 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.730
 I had already answered a faq there 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.810
 on it I have nothing against the fact of 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.000
 help out except that for 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.560
 the moment we do not need so much 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.720
 but it is possible that at a time or 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.890
 another I end up asking for help 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.420
 people of the chain so that the series 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.530
 advance faster but it will be that it will be 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.930
 for later it's not a project 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.250
 official we'll see when I'll have 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.290
 finished when I'm done climbing 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.820
 episode 3 is the priority there 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.730
 for us is to release episode 3 before 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.490
 end of the small hairs the day of the end 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.390
 May with you to fuck good go 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:50.040
 good luck to be left 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.040
 continue to follow us and thank you all
