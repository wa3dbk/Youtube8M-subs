00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:37.940
 be the very first time here today 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.340
 I'm really curious how that will be 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.700
 the instruction takes detlef not as 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.950
 a trabi in execution panama green 1989 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.829

 old and 14,000 ddr mark cost the 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.020
 At the time, after 25 years, they were on the tax 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.940
 a plan knows which expert 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.420
 stumbling blocks hopefully and the same 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.520
 waiting 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.530
 the circuit that's the big one 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.699
 Of course , the brake has to be different 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.460
 get used to it that they are not like that 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:12.210
 grab like a modern vehicle 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:16.520
 So find down 12 back in a3 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.520

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:29.750
 the trabant the unknown being or 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.750
 so in the ddr you make people small 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:02:02.000
 You can kick a little clutch 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:02:02.000
 absolutely need and just say 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.600
 to look something nice slowly comes 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.600
 that the clutch and 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.920
 Well then the test drive can go 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.970
 and gradually become friends their 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.590

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.590
 air-cooled two-stroke engine 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:36.380
 it's a very different driving experience as well 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.990
 a lot of authentic atmosphere because you 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:43.170
 Of course everything shows you notice the 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.360
 street noticed the camp where you notice 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.750
 in the traffic 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.420
 and is 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.270
 we have a lot of handwork so that 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.700
 turn the braking for it right there 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.220
 you have to do it right with the whole body 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.730
 can install 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.099
 you have to be focused 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.189
 no wonder then passive 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.230
