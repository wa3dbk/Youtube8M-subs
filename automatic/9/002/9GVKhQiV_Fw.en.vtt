00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:10.460
 Then I will explain the sending band. 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.870
 First of all, the sending band is that you are out 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:17.139
 In any case 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.139
 Anyway, the purpose is to advance the runner 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.820
 The attitude is 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:28.430
 Try swinging the higher ball back to the center 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.539
 From that state 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.800
 Spread your hands and hands 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:38.149
 First of all 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:42.420
 Place it high on the highest point of the zone 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:49.030
 Close your eyes as much as possible 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:53.789
 Most of the bunt will be successful if is this in front of the pitcher without changing the angle 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.789
 Instead of hitting the core, if you hit it first 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:05.000
 The ball will roll naturally if you hold it lightly 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:09.820
 If this is applied to the core, the pitcher will be said to be a strong version for sweet 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.820
 It will be out in the second in this 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:17.350
 Without putting your head in the highest place 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:19.990
 Keep your eyes close while lying down 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.120
 This is the attitude of the band 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.170
 Well then get it done 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:30.220
 The important thing in the band is that you only have a striped mouth 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.930
 The ball is that you miss the bat and miss it 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.260
 Let's get it done 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.260
 Yes 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.340
 OK 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:48.100
 Widen the interval of time riding me during a little more butter and grasshoppers and body but investigation 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.380
 Jaguar 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.380
 Hey, since you have not done the ball 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.990
 ok summer festival
