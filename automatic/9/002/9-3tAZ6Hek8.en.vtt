today<00:00:00.630> we're<00:00:00.810> talking<00:00:00.960> about<00:00:01.319> what<00:00:01.620> makes

below freezing that new layer of water

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.139 
below freezing that new layer of water
freezes<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.390> then<00:00:58.190> it'll<00:00:59.190> fall<00:00:59.550> back<00:00:59.910> into

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149

freezes and then it'll fall back into
the<00:01:00.359> downdraft<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:01.109> get<00:01:01.199> another<00:01:01.590> layer<00:01:01.890> of

the downdraft to get another layer of

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
water and get caught back in the updraft

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.109 
water and get caught back in the updraft
take<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.650> back<00:01:04.830> up<00:01:05.070> below<00:01:05.369> freezing<00:01:05.640> that

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
take it back up below freezing that

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.359 
take it back up below freezing that
layer<00:01:06.360> will<00:01:06.630> freeze<00:01:06.930> -<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.680> essentially<00:01:08.100> what

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
layer will freeze - so essentially what

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.719 
layer will freeze - so essentially what
you<00:01:08.549> have<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.270> continuous<00:01:10.140> cycle<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.830> going

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
you have is a continuous cycle of going

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.330 
you have is a continuous cycle of going
up<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.180> down<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.540> updrafts<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.229> downdrafts

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
up and down the updrafts and downdrafts

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.490 
up and down the updrafts and downdrafts
where<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.430> gets<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.700> layer<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.180> water<00:01:15.500> freezes

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
where it gets a layer of water freezes

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.460 
where it gets a layer of water freezes
then<00:01:17.340> Falls<00:01:17.970> gets<00:01:18.360> another<00:01:18.720> layer<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.259> water

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
then Falls gets another layer of water

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.260 
then Falls gets another layer of water
goes<00:01:20.070> back<00:01:20.310> into<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.580> top<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.060> storm

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
goes back into the top of the storm

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.969 
goes back into the top of the storm
freezes<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.140> ball<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.560> ice<00:01:22.710> just

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
freezes so that ball of ice just

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.679 
freezes so that ball of ice just
continues<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.549> grow<00:01:23.820> now<00:01:24.330> eventually
