00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:04.400
 Albstadt Betzler historically tranquil peaceful anyway you want that 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.790
 my do not give it in the middle of this seemingly pouring out 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.660
 Wesel Wieses my hometown come to me there are percent Weser this 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.139
 Say first mayor of Pisa that carry responsibility Wesel 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.420
 that's why city marketing has become a hall 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.780
 Take this action 111 this for Wesel and I have me a blank 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:24.670
 Ott worried 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.320
 from Wesel because I then in my case - depending on Wetzlar have brought such and 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.440
 Doro Ramsch is now my favorite color I thought is a bit of color 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.740
 Do the reader well too 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.670
 It fits very well here he is »outdoor seating so the island Herrmann 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.280
 is then one 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.540
 and stumbling block in the city hall now the upper and 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:45.430
 below the Mahlberger the Darman 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.270
 is of the opinion that he disturb the cityscape it did not take long since came 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.859
 then 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:54.150
 for contact persons a Karrer second have not challenged 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.050
 with should be well or was just from monument adviser memorial council and 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.229
 responsible to the speech and said Na that was not so here 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:04.480
 the theme must be the way the thing bothers% 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.010
 around the cityscape Shahir in the old city and that do not go and that sets 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.480
 I'm already under pressure 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.480
 so that Denise first so the next two days so 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.650
 and stored here in the café and just a little cheeky 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.070
 let me look out the window 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.150
 creates an extension request made to reference ours 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.820
 last conversation request per cent list additional list 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.229
 of an art object you can see a life size orange of this figure 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.950
 Dewan Rollbrett permanently mounted and thus mobile can be moved if necessary 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.450
 and stored over after coffee 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.810
 because the answer can be quite fast 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.180
 became easy 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.370
 rejected 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.200
 At one point, it is bad for the field of external management 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.190
 To bring that in with a view to the safety and ease of transport 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.510
 no longer compatible 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.880
 Furthermore, it must be assumed that this sets a precedent 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.580
 Probably the fair elephants Giraffes sets up something else 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.060
 around the Canal district from the building code has from the perspective of historic preservation 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.610
 also with her request to the concerned 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.580
 and him the result percent gives there a come to the 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.080
 Conclusion that art object would exert an unwanted effect and that 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.820
 Appearance of the entire plant in one in the sense of the monument protection not 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.910
 sustainable manner 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:24.929
 and since we decided that we grant asylum to Arnesen 

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:28.739
 and me only us alone but the whole lot of colleagues in the old town 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.769
 our neighbors over here and everywhere 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.400
 Percent grant the reader asylum and Armin daily by now 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.980
 standing by and 2 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.209
 To get there on the way to the nine stores are also back then 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.419
 when I pick it up 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:45.269
 there is always a lot of talk the business people tell of many 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.589
 things; matters 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:49.539
 where they have been addressed and developed accordingly 

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:50.889
 would you like that part 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:52.219
 and around 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:56.199
 like Fitch to saying big of small of children of tourists of 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:57.010
 business people 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.069
 Everyone loves Haarmann in the mouth that is great and what does Gieseler say about it
