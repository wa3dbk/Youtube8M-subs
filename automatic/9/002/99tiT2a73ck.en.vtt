00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
within the last few years these two

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.420 
within the last few years these two
versions<00:01:06.229> this<00:01:07.229> one's<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.680> Beamer<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.100> this

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
versions this one's the Beamer and this

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.240 
versions this one's the Beamer and this
one's<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.700> travel<00:01:09.210> one<00:01:09.830> so<00:01:10.830> they're<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> lot

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
one's the travel one so they're a lot

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.660 
one's the travel one so they're a lot
smaller<00:01:11.869> as<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:13.500> can<00:01:13.799> see<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.159> there's<00:01:14.430> a

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
smaller as you can see it there's a

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.510 
smaller as you can see it there's a
little<00:01:15.509> bit<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.840> difference<00:01:16.650> but<00:01:17.100> they<00:01:17.280> both

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
little bit of a difference but they both

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.280 
little bit of a difference but they both
have<00:01:17.909> these<00:01:18.330> triangle<00:01:19.049> tine<00:01:19.470> blades<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:21.290> I

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
have these triangle tine blades and I

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.100 
have these triangle tine blades and I
don't<00:01:23.159> know<00:01:23.369> if<00:01:23.520> that's<00:01:23.759> I'll<00:01:24.180> show<00:01:24.540> how<00:01:25.049> that

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
don't know if that's I'll show how that

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.789 
don't know if that's I'll show how that
works<00:01:25.590> in<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.549> favorite<00:01:27.450> product<00:01:27.810> video<00:01:28.049> but

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
works in the favorite product video but

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.530 
works in the favorite product video but
that<00:01:29.070> image<00:01:29.430> kind<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:30.000> shows<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.420> the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
that image kind of shows you the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.090 
that image kind of shows you the
difference<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.170> see<00:01:31.350> how<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.530> litter<00:01:31.890> is

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
difference of see how the litter is

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.700 
difference of see how the litter is
falling<00:01:32.549> through<00:01:32.850> on<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.090> right<00:01:33.240> hand<00:01:33.540> side

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
falling through on the right hand side

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.289 
falling through on the right hand side
and<00:01:35.450> I<00:01:36.920> mean<00:01:37.920> on<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.310> left<00:01:38.490> hand<00:01:38.700> side<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
and I mean on the left hand side the

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.600 
and I mean on the left hand side the
litter<00:01:39.509> has<00:01:39.659> fallen<00:01:39.990> through<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.369> other

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
litter has fallen through and the other

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.819 
litter has fallen through and the other
one<00:01:41.880> it's<00:01:42.150> taking<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.689> lot<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.990> time<00:01:43.140> because<00:01:43.470> of

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
one it's taking a lot of time because of

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:51.350 
one it's taking a lot of time because of
how<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.159> tines<00:01:44.700> are<00:01:47.000> so<00:01:48.000> it's<00:01:48.390> not<00:01:50.090> it's<00:01:51.090> not

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
how the tines are so it's not it's not

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.620 
how the tines are so it's not it's not
that<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:52.170> it's<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:53.640> know<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.790> big<00:01:54.060> saver<00:01:54.479> of

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
that it it's you know a big saver of

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.560 
that it it's you know a big saver of
time<00:01:54.960> but<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.470> for<00:01:55.799> me<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:56.790> like<00:01:57.329> that

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
time but it is for me I like that

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.780 
time but it is for me I like that
there's<00:01:57.780> no<00:01:57.930> shaking<00:01:58.530> no<00:01:58.710> shifting<00:01:59.130> less<00:01:59.399> dust

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
there's no shaking no shifting less dust

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.319 
there's no shaking no shifting less dust
and<00:02:00.200> all<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.500> have<00:02:01.710> left<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:03.149> litter

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
and all you have left is the litter

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.380 
and all you have left is the litter
waste<00:02:03.630> so<00:02:04.340> you<00:02:05.340> actually<00:02:05.729> use<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.030> lot<00:02:06.329> less

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
waste so you actually use a lot less

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.139 
waste so you actually use a lot less
litter<00:02:06.930> your<00:02:07.619> litter<00:02:07.979> lasts<00:02:08.310> longer

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
litter your litter lasts longer

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.850 
litter your litter lasts longer
it's<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.599> lot<00:02:09.780> easier<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.379> scoop<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:12.090> so<00:02:12.959> the

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
it's a lot easier to scoop and so the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.610 
it's a lot easier to scoop and so the
this<00:02:14.430> is<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.640> never<00:02:15.030> miss<00:02:15.360> litter<00:02:15.600> box<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.200> I

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
this is a never miss litter box and I

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.950 
this is a never miss litter box and I
honestly<00:02:17.100> think<00:02:17.460> that<00:02:18.090> these<00:02:18.300> two<00:02:18.630> go

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
honestly think that these two go

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.790 
honestly think that these two go
hand-in-hand<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.870> potentially<00:02:22.590> should

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
hand-in-hand and and potentially should

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.690 
hand-in-hand and and potentially should
be<00:02:22.950> sold<00:02:23.190> together<00:02:24.380> or<00:02:25.380> have<00:02:26.040> an<00:02:26.190> option<00:02:26.610> on

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
be sold together or have an option on

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.310 
be sold together or have an option on
their<00:02:26.880> websites<00:02:27.300> where<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:27.660> can<00:02:27.690> buy<00:02:27.960> a<00:02:27.990> never

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
their websites where you can buy a never

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.420 
their websites where you can buy a never
