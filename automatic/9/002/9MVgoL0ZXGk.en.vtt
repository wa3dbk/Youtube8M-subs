00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.819
 Hello everyone, welcome back to my channel 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.400
 after a break of about two weeks 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.349
 in which meanwhile or platinum filippo 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.790
 14 so as to close definitively 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.639
 this parenthesis 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.770
 after that I received my pro copy 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.699
 man of fifa 15 directly from ea 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.580
 sports 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.619
 with a few days in advance also in 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.240
 so you can do the given review 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.220
 which as you know I 'm a journalist 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.279
 videogame and I am the director of a 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.219
 tested precisely for video games 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.469
 in this video I will show you how 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.450
 so many credits quickly in awe 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.030
 ultimate team using the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.920
 buying and selling what is the sale 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.960
 the sale consists 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.270
 in buying players and then 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.809
 resell them at a higher price so 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.460
 to give in this way then I will make you a 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.350
 example explaining also tricks 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.629
 what do I do? 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.390
 I'm focusing on just one player 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.660
 meanwhile this is important in this 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.399
 Campbell case or a card that is 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.409
 very strong because this is one of the 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.119
 so-called paid players ie 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.090
 those that although as in this case 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.090
 75 is in fact due to its 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.520
 statistics in the field is really 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.729
 very very strong even more than 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.909
 some 80 85 and at the same time another 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.240
 characteristic that does not cost much 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.729
 so much so that I do I do at night I 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.850
 I recommend at night that the time slot 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.369
 where the cards really cost a lot 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.170
 much less do I make offers 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.700
 in my case campbell is an example 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.740
 of course everyone can choose his own 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.950
 player purchase it as you see for 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.920
 1,600 in the second column second row 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:48.030
 found in fact purchased for 1,600 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.210
 credits I always make offers 1600 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.100
 as you can see 1600 how do I do 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.049
 the offer is very simple when i 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.320
 transfer markets I write campbell 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:01.560
 selected maximum price 1600 as 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.049
 notice we could triangle y on xbox for 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.210
 do search you load the screen e 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.680
 find a list of campbell games 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.840
 with 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.860
 price masses 1600 and start doing 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.170
 an offer 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.570
 I do them one after the other as you see 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.230
 always at 1600 as a piece I know so much 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:22.380
 it will also rise far more than that price 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.990
 1600 1600 and so on until you 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.450
 I understand the credits having subscriptions 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.910
 20 thousand credits and now this new one 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.820
 account because what it uses for 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.950
 review games and of course I have it 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.690
 by the private sector 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.630
 however with around 20 in the decrees I succeed 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.310
 to buy more than ten and one time 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.470
 done what i do i put myself in 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.510
 sale on the transfer list 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.100
 in the meantime then the objectives are noted 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.200
 market 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.450
 and what happens during the day the 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.130
 price would be vertiginous 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.709
 you have seen those players I have before 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.470
 bought 1600 as everyone 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:03.290
 these here instead during the day 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:08.910
 they are sold for 3,100 3000 3,100 3,700 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:11.670
 4,000 even look here 4,200 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.220
 so more than twice as much as almost 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.610
 three times the value for which I have them 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.440
 purchased during the night 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.840
 so it is very simple you during the 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.630
 night do the offer in this case from 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.739
 1600 then during the day you sell them yourself 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.630
 I had not yet seen him well 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:34.260
 as far as they could serve 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:37.049
 prices however you see I sold it for 2400 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.660
 2000 2200 2300 and so on 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:42.510
 this is because in the morning the prices are 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.150
 still slightly lower while the 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.910
 band the peak was reached in the 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.260
 afternoon and even in the evening in 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.019
 this time slot should be sold 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.600
 on the contrary I repeat during the night vi 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:57.690
 it is worthwhile to buy if during the night 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.480
 of course you don't want to turn on the 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:03.090
 your console you have two other ways to 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.980
 to buy and sell the first one 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.900
 they also advertise in the 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.290
 fifa ultimate main screen 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.390
 team and company up or a 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.670
 application you can download on your 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.400
 smartphone that will allow you to manage 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.739
 your rose and your market too 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.630
 directly from your mobile 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.860
 in this way you can buy 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.130
 sell and check yours 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.780
 negotiations is simply by accessing the 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.900
 your origin account 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.610
 in the same way you can access the 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.610
 your origin account and manage the 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.160
 your rose in the fifa ultimate team 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:41.630
 via the official web app or the 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.530
 site of ea sports that allows you 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:48.330
 exactly like the app for 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:50.100
 smartphone to manage your the 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.820
 transfer market and yours 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.190
 team 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.889
 the link promises indiscretion mi 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.930
 I recommend used only because the only one 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:01.169
 all the others are fakes 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.720
 and serve to steal your accounts 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:06.690
 I tell you because every day I receive 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.120
 comments and emails of their own 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.190
 users who fell for it 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.870
 trap and got screwed 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.039
 but some had also spent money 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:20.430
 real and unfortunately it is so then I repeat 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:23.930
 accepted only through the globe 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:26.280
 ficial that is in description and 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:29.039
 last thing 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.020
 of course I have to believe campbell 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:33.120
 but he is not the only player if you have 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.729
 many credits and I recommend having them 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.220
 so you can make more more offers 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:40.710
 simultaneously go to players 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.320
 which cost even more so 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:46.860
 save time and maximize the 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.750
 I earn and for this video it's all me 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.340
 I thank you for the attention you remember 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.620
 to leave a like if this 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.620
 tutorial here was useful to do so many 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.360
 katey quickly in the fifa ultimate team 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.460

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.740
 you want to get lost in the next videos of the 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.900
 next week it will also start again 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.910
 with the column matt victoria cura that 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.820
 currently it is a state a moment in 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:10.949
 pause because I tried to understand in the 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.320
 meanwhile the various changes made to the 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:15.480
 then team management is done 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.780
 more or less thinks damaged damaged 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.560
 so I feel quite ready to 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.920
 to start 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.600
 however I still have to understand the various ones 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.600
 teams set up the values ​​of the 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.490
 players is the best world for the teams 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.290
 so i took a week in 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.110
 more so as to make you wait for a 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:36.720
 little but make a really useful video 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.950
 and done well that if it is useful for me 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.200
 because then in the end this technique 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:42.320
 use when I play online for you 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:45.990
 that maybe you can take inspiration 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.610
 reuse them in your games 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:50.600
