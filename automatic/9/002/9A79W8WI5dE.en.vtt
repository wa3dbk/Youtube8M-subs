00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
have to do just a little bit put a

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.870 
have to do just a little bit put a
meeting<00:00:07.140> like<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:07.290> flower<00:00:09.740> a<00:00:10.740> little<00:00:11.580> bit<00:00:11.670> more

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
meeting like a flower a little bit more

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.099 
meeting like a flower a little bit more
of<00:00:12.559> the<00:00:13.559> egg<00:00:13.740> from<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.519> top<00:00:14.730> finishes<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.750> twist

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
of the egg from the top finishes a twist

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.290 
of the egg from the top finishes a twist
so<00:00:16.740> on<00:00:16.890> new<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.160> is<00:00:17.250> everyone<00:00:17.550> basically<00:00:17.760> just

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
so on new it is everyone basically just

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.210 
so on new it is everyone basically just
trying<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.660> get<00:00:18.990> this

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.250 

but<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.249> shield

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.080 

and<00:00:28.650> I<00:00:29.010> would<00:00:29.130> just<00:00:29.220> put<00:00:29.400> them<00:00:29.490> on<00:00:29.610> parchment

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
and I would just put them on parchment

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:37.010 
and I would just put them on parchment
and<00:00:32.330> so<00:00:33.330> they<00:00:34.730> actually<00:00:35.730> freezing<00:00:36.600> increased

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
and so they actually freezing increased

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.170 
and so they actually freezing increased
to<00:00:37.230> headline<00:00:37.650> and<00:00:38.450> payment<00:00:39.450> or<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:40.380> way

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.450 

it<00:00:44.180> makes<00:00:44.600> it<00:00:44.780> gets<00:00:45.230> to<00:00:45.350> Stephen<00:00:45.830> that<00:00:45.980> I<00:00:46.010> need

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
it makes it gets to Stephen that I need

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.280 
it makes it gets to Stephen that I need
to<00:00:46.580> freeze<00:00:46.850> them<00:00:47.060> at<00:00:47.180> back<00:00:47.360> for<00:00:47.690> at<00:00:48.020> this<00:00:48.170> point

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
to freeze them at back for at this point
