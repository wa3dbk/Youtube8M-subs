corners while aiming so for example you

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.500 
corners while aiming so for example you
could<00:03:38.200> see<00:03:38.440> me<00:03:38.590> in<00:03:38.650> this<00:03:38.830> game<00:03:39.190> aiming<00:03:39.940> so<00:03:40.240> much

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
could see me in this game aiming so much

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.030 
could see me in this game aiming so much
with<00:03:40.720> what<00:03:41.050> there's<00:03:41.830> no<00:03:42.100> enemies<00:03:42.670> at<00:03:43.150> all<00:03:44.040> the

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
with what there's no enemies at all the

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.400 
with what there's no enemies at all the
reason<00:03:45.760> is<00:03:45.970> I'm<00:03:46.180> only<00:03:46.450> checking<00:03:46.780> corners<00:03:47.200> so

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
reason is I'm only checking corners so

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.180 
reason is I'm only checking corners so
checking<00:03:48.400> is<00:03:48.760> really<00:03:49.060> good<00:03:49.240> it<00:03:50.230> gets<00:03:50.650> you<00:03:50.950> to

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
checking is really good it gets you to

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.190 
checking is really good it gets you to
be<00:03:51.310> ready<00:03:51.550> for<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:51.940> enemy<00:03:52.360> before<00:03:52.720> he's<00:03:52.930> ready

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
be ready for the enemy before he's ready

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.560 
be ready for the enemy before he's ready
for<00:03:53.350> you<00:03:53.640> he's<00:03:54.640> ready<00:03:54.880> for<00:03:55.000> you<00:03:55.150> you're<00:03:55.450> gonna

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
for you he's ready for you you're gonna

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.020 
for you he's ready for you you're gonna
get<00:03:55.810> killed<00:03:56.110> so<00:03:56.980> that's<00:03:57.190> why<00:03:57.340> you<00:03:57.400> need<00:03:57.640> to<00:03:57.820> aim

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
get killed so that's why you need to aim

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.130 
get killed so that's why you need to aim
before<00:03:58.690> anything<00:03:59.320> any<00:03:59.590> crap<00:04:00.190> happens<00:04:00.700> so<00:04:01.690> when

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
before anything any crap happens so when

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.390 
before anything any crap happens so when
you<00:04:02.290> when<00:04:03.010> you<00:04:03.070> aim<00:04:03.600> then<00:04:04.600> and<00:04:04.840> by<00:04:05.800> the<00:04:05.830> way<00:04:06.010> I'm

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
you when you aim then and by the way I'm

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.250 
you when you aim then and by the way I'm
so<00:04:06.790> lucky<00:04:06.940> right<00:04:07.300> now<00:04:07.390> I<00:04:07.510> didn't<00:04:07.870> get<00:04:07.990> killed

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
so lucky right now I didn't get killed

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.290 
so lucky right now I didn't get killed
by<00:04:08.650> that<00:04:08.680> camera<00:04:09.190> anyways<00:04:09.970> so<00:04:10.420> you<00:04:10.750> just<00:04:10.990> aim

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
by that camera anyways so you just aim

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.349 
by that camera anyways so you just aim
while<00:04:13.300> moving<00:04:13.690> and<00:04:14.080> checking<00:04:14.410> corners<00:04:14.770> and

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
while moving and checking corners and

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.810 
while moving and checking corners and
