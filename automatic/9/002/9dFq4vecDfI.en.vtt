00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 or burning youtuber welcome to me 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.759
 channel in this video I will teach you how to 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.790
 uninstall widgets remember that the 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.230
 widgets are the applications are second 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.139
 type of applications are not applications 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.030
 as such inclusive that they have what they give in 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.710
 this in this application menu 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.940
 but we have to enter and 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.400
 search through this option here 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.230
 of applications however its way of 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.990
 installation is very similar 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.670
 applications therefore you do installation 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.439
 from her sets it follows the same 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.689
 procedure on that phone 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.820
 recently from a previous video you 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.160
 teach how to download widgets and how 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.320
 add widgets to our start menu 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.140
 our home screen here I have 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.910
 two battery widgets ie in these 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.399
 moments I have three indicators of 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.590
 battery which is something very redundant 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.570
 not only of your consumption 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.640
 space but also resources from 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.470
 phone then let's uninstall 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.690
 those two widgets that previously had 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.220
 installed to do that basically what 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.680
 What we do is enter the play store 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:02.070
 company quickly planned the magic 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.320
 applications we give here on this side 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.900
 Apply settings and then play store 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.510
 are testing in the play store what 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.340
 we enter here below 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.930
 configuration and we enter my 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.880
 forest applications 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.950
 was this application these widgets were 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.020
 downloaded by him by history 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.030
 then over here you can install let's go 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.920
 to look for them are all applications 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.240
 that I have here are giving application in 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.720
 the school I'm talking about they are 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.740
 battery widgets we give this and 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.740
 let's uninstall 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.910
 okay 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.070
 and wait more than you want to install 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:43.580
 indeed one of the 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.870
 plates dishes that I had here up 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.159
 there we are going to see if I develop the 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.270
 other 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.920
 matter before installing and from that 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.140
 way since we installed just like 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.670
 we install any application and 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.069
 we installed the widgets that you have very 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.079
 installed on the phone and especially 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:01.579

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.269
 learned to configure to use of your
