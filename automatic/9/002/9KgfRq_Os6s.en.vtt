00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
something like this are those that want

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.080 
something like this are those that want
to<00:00:26.810> really<00:00:27.080> fall<00:00:27.830> shaped<00:00:28.189> but<00:00:28.490> it<00:00:28.699> is<00:00:28.820> quite

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
to really fall shaped but it is quite

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.359 
to really fall shaped but it is quite
full<00:00:29.359> of<00:00:29.599> the<00:00:29.900> shell<00:00:30.140> other<00:00:30.439> scalloping<00:00:31.220> is

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
full of the shell other scalloping is

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.939 
full of the shell other scalloping is
quite<00:00:31.609> shallow<00:00:32.170> and<00:00:33.170> it's<00:00:33.410> it's<00:00:33.710> all<00:00:33.920> about

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:33.949 
quite shallow and it's it's all about

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:36.610 
quite shallow and it's it's all about
hitting<00:00:34.670> power<00:00:34.910> basically<00:00:35.600> so<00:00:35.809> it's<00:00:36.410> not

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
hitting power basically so it's not

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.130 
hitting power basically so it's not
really<00:00:36.950> a<00:00:36.980> high<00:00:37.219> or<00:00:37.610> a<00:00:37.640> low<00:00:37.850> middle<00:00:38.239> it's<00:00:38.510> a<00:00:38.750> bit

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
really a high or a low middle it's a bit

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.630 
really a high or a low middle it's a bit
of<00:00:39.230> an<00:00:39.320> all-rounder<00:00:39.800> bat<00:00:39.980> it's<00:00:40.130> got<00:00:40.250> a<00:00:40.280> very

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
of an all-rounder bat it's got a very

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.940 
of an all-rounder bat it's got a very
large<00:00:40.880> spine<00:00:41.420> that<00:00:42.200> if<00:00:42.320> you<00:00:42.440> have<00:00:42.559> a<00:00:42.590> look<00:00:42.800> at

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
large spine that if you have a look at

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.400 
large spine that if you have a look at
really<00:00:43.370> extends<00:00:44.030> from<00:00:44.270> basically<00:00:44.989> the<00:00:45.140> total

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
really extends from basically the total

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.190 
really extends from basically the total
about<00:00:45.770> right<00:00:46.129> through<00:00:46.370> to<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:46.550> shoulders<00:00:46.579> and

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
about right through to the shoulders and

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.930 
about right through to the shoulders and
that<00:00:48.200> in<00:00:48.379> turn<00:00:48.590> helps<00:00:48.950> buff<00:00:49.129> up<00:00:49.340> both<00:00:49.550> the<00:00:49.760> toe

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
that in turn helps buff up both the toe

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.420 
that in turn helps buff up both the toe
and<00:00:50.270> the<00:00:50.329> shoulders<00:00:50.770> which<00:00:51.770> we<00:00:51.950> tend<00:00:52.160> to<00:00:52.190> find

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
and the shoulders which we tend to find

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.549 
and the shoulders which we tend to find
is<00:00:52.640> it's<00:00:52.940> good<00:00:53.180> on<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:53.629> durability<00:00:53.989> so<00:00:54.350> it's<00:00:54.469> a

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
is it's good on the durability so it's a

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.760 
is it's good on the durability so it's a
thing<00:00:54.770> so<00:00:55.420> very<00:00:56.420> square<00:00:56.809> very<00:00:57.199> thick<00:00:57.530> and

great the hand okay so we're just going
to<00:01:37.159> do<00:01:37.340> a<00:01:37.369> bit<00:01:37.520> of<00:01:37.610> a<00:01:37.670> tap<00:01:37.880> test<00:01:38.119> on<00:01:38.360> the<00:01:38.479> grain<00:01:39.110> x

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
to do a bit of a tap test on the grain x

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.160 
to do a bit of a tap test on the grain x
DW<00:01:40.100> signature<00:01:40.700> range<00:01:40.909> in<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.119> kaboom

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
DW signature range in the kaboom

DW signature range in the kaboom
top<00:01:42.680> line<00:01:42.860> timber<00:01:43.340> so<00:01:43.520> this<00:01:43.670> is<00:01:43.759> going<00:01:43.880> to<00:01:43.939> be

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
top line timber so this is going to be

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.429 
top line timber so this is going to be
really<00:01:44.540> nice<00:01:44.659> bad<00:01:44.960> it's<00:01:45.110> a<00:01:45.170> high<00:01:45.320> quality

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
really nice bad it's a high quality

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.160 
really nice bad it's a high quality
grade<00:01:45.920> one<00:01:46.159> and<00:01:46.399> a<00:01:47.149> bit<00:01:47.299> of<00:01:47.390> a<00:01:47.540> bit<00:01:48.020> of<00:01:48.049> an

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
grade one and a bit of a bit of an

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.620 
grade one and a bit of a bit of an
all-rounder<00:01:48.770> style<00:01:49.040> shape<00:01:49.399> so<00:01:49.700> not<00:01:50.390> really

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
all-rounder style shape so not really

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.690 
all-rounder style shape so not really
high<00:01:50.840> not<00:01:51.259> really<00:01:51.500> low<00:01:51.649> in<00:01:51.799> the<00:01:51.860> middle<00:01:52.159> but<00:01:52.310> an

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
high not really low in the middle but an

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.219 
high not really low in the middle but an
all-round<00:01:53.030> let's<00:01:53.210> talk<00:01:53.420> about<00:01:53.570> it<00:01:53.869> will

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
all-round let's talk about it will

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.249 
all-round let's talk about it will
extend<00:01:54.590> down<00:01:54.920> quite<00:01:55.670> low<00:01:55.909> and<00:01:56.270> up<00:01:56.840> quite<00:01:57.229> high

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
extend down quite low and up quite high

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.289 
extend down quite low and up quite high
as<00:01:57.470> well<00:01:57.799> due<00:01:58.070> to<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.250> quality<00:01:58.640> of<00:01:58.729> timber<00:01:59.090> and

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
as well due to the quality of timber and

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.899 
as well due to the quality of timber and
and<00:02:00.259> the<00:02:00.530> large<00:02:00.740> spine<00:02:01.159> in<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.399> bat<00:02:01.549> so<00:02:01.729> give

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
and the large spine in the bat so give

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.760 
and the large spine in the bat so give
it<00:02:01.939> a<00:02:02.030> bit<00:02:02.119> of<00:02:02.149> a<00:02:02.270> test<00:02:02.509> now<00:02:02.719> but<00:02:03.590> you're<00:02:03.680> going

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
it a bit of a test now but you're going

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.319 
it a bit of a test now but you're going
to<00:02:03.829> expect<00:02:04.219> the<00:02:04.430> sweet<00:02:04.670> spot<00:02:04.909> to<00:02:05.030> be<00:02:05.149> around

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
to expect the sweet spot to be around

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:12.330 
to expect the sweet spot to be around
this<00:02:05.450> sort<00:02:05.659> of<00:02:05.719> area<00:02:05.899> there

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.070 

and<00:02:13.340> there<00:02:13.519> it<00:02:13.610> is<00:02:13.670> right<00:02:13.910> there<00:02:17.080> really

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
and there it is right there really

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.259 
and there it is right there really
basically<00:02:18.680> tap<00:02:19.010> all<00:02:19.519> the<00:02:19.760> way<00:02:19.910> down<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.209> the

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
basically tap all the way down to the

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.270 
basically tap all the way down to the
bottom<00:02:20.420> you<00:02:20.690> know<00:02:20.840> down<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.650> bottom<00:02:21.980> probably

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
bottom you know down the bottom probably

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.699 
bottom you know down the bottom probably
three<00:02:22.489> centimeters<00:02:23.000> or<00:02:23.120> so<00:02:23.300> and<00:02:23.569> that<00:02:24.530> is

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
three centimeters or so and that is

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.760 
three centimeters or so and that is
quite<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.040> large<00:02:25.310> Center
