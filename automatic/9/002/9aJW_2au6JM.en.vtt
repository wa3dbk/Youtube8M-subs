in as hot like 200 degrees hot and it is
cool<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:51.449> side<00:00:51.660> now<00:00:52.079> what<00:00:52.289> we<00:00:52.379> have<00:00:52.530> going

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
cool on this side now what we have going

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.810 
cool on this side now what we have going
the<00:00:52.860> opposite<00:00:53.340> way<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:54.379> ice<00:00:55.379> cold<00:00:55.649> water

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
the opposite way in ice cold water

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.130 
the opposite way in ice cold water
coming<00:00:56.820> out<00:00:57.030> it's<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.420> water<00:00:57.570> after<00:00:57.989> it's

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
coming out it's the water after it's

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.119 
coming out it's the water after it's
done<00:00:58.859> it's<00:00:59.070> heat<00:00:59.550> transfer<00:01:00.859> so<00:01:01.859> we<00:01:01.980> have<00:01:02.100> a

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
done it's heat transfer so we have a

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.080 
done it's heat transfer so we have a
left<00:01:02.430> over<00:01:03.949> work<00:01:04.949> chiller<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.489> old-style

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
left over work chiller of the old-style

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.969 
left over work chiller of the old-style
I'm<00:01:06.840> pushing<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.260> through<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.590> into<00:01:07.860> some

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
I'm pushing it through that into some

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.530 
I'm pushing it through that into some
ice<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.250> try<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.460> cool<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:08.850> hot<00:01:09.060> water<00:01:09.270> excess

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
ice to try to cool this hot water excess

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.440 
ice to try to cool this hot water excess
water<00:01:09.720> coming<00:01:09.990> out<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.140> here<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.320> hot<00:01:11.450> going

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
water coming out of here is hot going

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.380 
water coming out of here is hot going
into<00:01:13.070> the<00:01:14.070> big<00:01:14.250> ice<00:01:14.430> tub<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.970> what<00:01:15.090> we<00:01:15.180> have<00:01:15.299> in

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
into the big ice tub and what we have in

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.390 
into the big ice tub and what we have in
here<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.689> sump<00:01:15.930> pump<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.740> sump<00:01:17.040> pump<00:01:17.310> is

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
here is a sump pump the sump pump is

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.780 
here is a sump pump the sump pump is
actually<00:01:18.110> was<00:01:19.110> feeding<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.680> into<00:01:20.520> this

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
actually was feeding it into this

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.539 
actually was feeding it into this
Lichtman<00:01:21.659> terminator<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:23.250> we've<00:01:23.340> got<00:01:23.460> this

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
Lichtman terminator so we've got this

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.800 
Lichtman terminator so we've got this
nice<00:01:23.729> little<00:01:23.790> cycle<00:01:24.299> here<00:01:24.450> we're<00:01:24.600> trying<00:01:24.659> to

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
nice little cycle here we're trying to

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.780 
nice little cycle here we're trying to
reduce<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.200> amount<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.439> tap<00:01:26.369> water<00:01:26.400> we're

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
reduce the amount of tap water we're

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.240 
reduce the amount of tap water we're
using<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.240> by<00:01:28.080> using<00:01:28.290> ice<00:01:28.530> we've<00:01:28.770> got<00:01:28.950> really

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
using and by using ice we've got really

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.240 
using and by using ice we've got really
cold<00:01:29.520> water

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
cold water

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.719 
cold water
we<00:01:32.250> already<00:01:32.430> filled<00:01:32.909> one<00:01:33.180> 5-gallon<00:01:34.140> carboy

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
we already filled one 5-gallon carboy

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.560 
we already filled one 5-gallon carboy
160<00:01:35.729> island<00:01:35.909> car<00:01:36.000> park<00:01:36.180> filled<00:01:36.299> with<00:01:36.360> five

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
160 island car park filled with five

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.350 
160 island car park filled with five
gallons<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.920> build<00:01:38.490> really<00:01:38.759> quickly<00:01:39.210> and

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
gallons and it build really quickly and

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.440 
gallons and it build really quickly and
it<00:01:39.450> came<00:01:39.600> out<00:01:39.750> at<00:01:39.900> 84<00:01:40.590> degrees<00:01:41.270> now<00:01:42.270> we've

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
it came out at 84 degrees now we've

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.499 
it came out at 84 degrees now we've
turned<00:01:42.630> our<00:01:42.840> flow<00:01:43.140> down<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:44.390> what<00:01:45.390> we're

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
turned our flow down and what we're

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.899 
turned our flow down and what we're
noticing<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:47.369> water<00:01:47.579> coming

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
noticing is that the the water coming

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:48.950 
noticing is that the the water coming
out

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
out

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.990 
out
is<00:01:49.960> not<00:01:50.290> hot<00:01:50.580> when<00:01:51.580> we<00:01:51.610> had<00:01:51.850> the<00:01:52.030> flow-rate<00:01:54.000> the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
is not hot when we had the flow-rate the

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.700 
is not hot when we had the flow-rate the
highest<00:01:55.299> highest<00:01:55.840> speed<00:01:56.200> it<00:01:56.320> was<00:01:56.380> coming<00:01:56.650> out

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
highest highest speed it was coming out

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.109 
highest highest speed it was coming out
hot<00:01:57.009> hot<00:01:57.190> in<00:01:57.310> fact<00:01:57.460> we<00:01:57.520> couldn't<00:01:57.700> put<00:01:57.940> it<00:01:58.030> in

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
hot hot in fact we couldn't put it in

here wearing a hand so that's the
wonderful<00:02:03.070> blatant<00:02:03.549> terminator<00:02:03.939> price<00:02:04.840> tag

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
wonderful blatant terminator price tag

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.240 
wonderful blatant terminator price tag
kind<00:02:05.409> of<00:02:05.500> hide<00:02:05.649> but<00:02:06.659> we<00:02:07.659> tried<00:02:08.619> to<00:02:08.739> chill<00:02:08.950> 10

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250
