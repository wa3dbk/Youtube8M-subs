00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 to 

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.450
 no no no 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:07.450
 Hi everyone 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.930
 the last few days apple has formalized the date of the event 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:16.279
 October traditionally dedicated to the renewal of my mac on 20 October 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.390
 this means that in the next few days we will have some news but a second one 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.910
 I won't be talking about computers as much as you let me cry for netbooks 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.050
 have been updated in the last few months so I think they will be more about the 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.929
 software 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.190
 in particular as you can see from the image also sent to 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.290
 journalists 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.840
 for the invitation 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.610
 through the apple logo we see a lion 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.520
 this means that probably the new version of marco s10 will be called 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.530
 the yamaha 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.320
 and it will be ten. 7 we still don't know what the news will be 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.550
 introduced but I personally expect the whole event to be 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:55.739
 concentrated 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.740
 on this new version of marco s10 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.500
 and unfortunately I don't think it will be released soon 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.800
 since when they released san leo bar of the current version 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.150
 about a year has passed since the presentation to the sale 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.950
 of the new operating system 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.400
 so maybe we will have to wait a little 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.829
 index the things that surely we will be able to buy in quotation marks 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:24.409
 in the short term they are highlife 2011 te time warp 2011 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.510
 since last year they were not renewed on our machines 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.360
 we have still installed the 2009 version 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.080
 hi i'm waiting for sure that eur's highlights will get moving 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.030
 another thing that could arrive but has not been confirmed 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.610
 is a new mac book air 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.330
 since it is the only apple computer that has not yet been renewed 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.749
 in the lasts 

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:50.130
 months but maybe even in recent years 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.070
 the new version could arrive 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.690
 or since they say that there is not much there could be removed from 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:57.780
 trade 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.640
 I don't know I personally expect more in a version I can't like 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.570
 success or with apple tv that we don't sell very much they tried to improve e 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.380
 now they are trying to see the results I hope it does something of the 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.750
 kind even with the mac booked maybe a lower price a more size 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.459
 compact and better performance 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:19.409
 anyway 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:22.740
 all this awake was October 20th 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.779
