00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
suede I was told that in the previous

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.670 
suede I was told that in the previous
pairs<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.670> red<00:01:29.850> was<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.180> lot<00:01:30.390> brighter<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:31.020> heard

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
pairs the red was a lot brighter I heard

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.410 
pairs the red was a lot brighter I heard
it<00:01:31.740> was<00:01:31.829> more<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.189> true<00:01:32.460> rig<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:32.880> one's<00:01:33.119> a

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
it was more of a true rig this one's a

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.940 
it was more of a true rig this one's a
varsity<00:01:33.630> red<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.229> it's<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.439> little<00:01:34.560> bit<00:01:34.770> duller

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
varsity red so it's a little bit duller

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.530 
varsity red so it's a little bit duller
but<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.369> does<00:01:35.490> pop<00:01:35.729> off<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.090> black<00:01:36.180> so<00:01:36.479> it

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
but it does pop off the black so it

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.560 
but it does pop off the black so it
looks<00:01:36.689> pretty<00:01:36.960> good<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.700> it's<00:01:38.700> suede<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.360> it

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
looks pretty good and it's suede so it

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.160 
looks pretty good and it's suede so it
