hey<00:00:00.780> everyone<00:00:01.170> diabetic<00:00:01.920> Danica<00:00:02.340> and<00:00:02.520> we<00:00:03.210> all

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
hey everyone diabetic Danica and we all

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.059 
hey everyone diabetic Danica and we all
know<00:00:03.540> that<00:00:03.659> checking<00:00:03.899> blood<00:00:04.200> sugar<00:00:04.470> is<00:00:04.680> a<00:00:04.710> good

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
know that checking blood sugar is a good

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.220 
know that checking blood sugar is a good
idea<00:00:05.250> but<00:00:05.850> today<00:00:06.540> I'm<00:00:06.720> going<00:00:06.870> to<00:00:06.960> share<00:00:07.109> with

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
idea but today I'm going to share with

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.919 
idea but today I'm going to share with
you<00:00:07.440> some<00:00:07.680> of<00:00:07.830> my<00:00:08.460> personal<00:00:08.490> reasons<00:00:09.450> what

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
you some of my personal reasons what

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.419 
you some of my personal reasons what
keeps<00:00:10.139> me<00:00:10.260> motivated<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.980> check<00:00:11.130> my<00:00:11.250> blood

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
keeps me motivated to check my blood

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.780 
keeps me motivated to check my blood
sugar<00:00:11.490> all<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.690> time<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.370> hopefully<00:00:14.370> it<00:00:14.610> will

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
sugar all the time and hopefully it will

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.840 
sugar all the time and hopefully it will
get<00:00:15.360> some<00:00:15.570> insight<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.310> so<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.340> guess<00:00:17.670> there

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
get some insight to you so I guess there

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.090 
get some insight to you so I guess there
would<00:00:17.970> be<00:00:18.000> three<00:00:18.630> main<00:00:18.930> reasons<00:00:19.439> why<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:19.800> check

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
would be three main reasons why I check

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.670 
would be three main reasons why I check
my<00:00:20.250> blood<00:00:20.400> sugar<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.720> first<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.289> really

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
my blood sugar and the first is really

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.790 
my blood sugar and the first is really
obvious<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.310> because<00:00:23.850> my<00:00:24.060> endocrinologist

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
obvious is because my endocrinologist

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.130 
obvious is because my endocrinologist
told<00:00:25.800> me<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.180> that's<00:00:27.180> number<00:00:27.510> one<00:00:27.810> because

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
told me to that's number one because

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.990 
told me to that's number one because
when<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.320> was<00:00:28.470> first<00:00:28.650> diagnosed<00:00:29.189> if<00:00:29.490> no<00:00:29.699> one<00:00:29.849> had

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
when I was first diagnosed if no one had

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.569 
when I was first diagnosed if no one had
told<00:00:30.150> me<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.420> check<00:00:30.599> my<00:00:30.720> blood<00:00:30.900> sugar<00:00:30.960> I

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
told me to check my blood sugar I

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.030 
told me to check my blood sugar I
wouldn't<00:00:32.579> have<00:00:33.110> now<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.140> almost<00:00:34.530> didn't<00:00:34.860> count

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
wouldn't have now I almost didn't count

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.190 
wouldn't have now I almost didn't count
this<00:00:35.160> into<00:00:35.399> radians<00:00:35.790> really<00:00:36.600> obvious<00:00:37.020> like

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
this into radians really obvious like

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.049 
this into radians really obvious like
your<00:00:37.380> parent<00:00:37.800> or<00:00:37.950> endocrinologist<00:00:38.700> people

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
your parent or endocrinologist people

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.880 
your parent or endocrinologist people
like<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.329> are<00:00:39.809> telling<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.590> need<00:00:40.770> to

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
like that are telling you you need to

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.369 
like that are telling you you need to
check<00:00:41.070> your<00:00:41.219> blood<00:00:41.340> sugar<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.809> mean<00:00:43.320> I

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
check your blood sugar and so I mean I

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.990 
check your blood sugar and so I mean I
figured<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.800> was<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.920> reason<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.610> put<00:00:44.850> in

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
figured it was a reason so I put in

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.850 
figured it was a reason so I put in
there<00:00:45.149> but<00:00:45.390> I'm<00:00:45.719> just<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.289> pretty<00:00:46.620> logical

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
there but I'm just a pretty logical

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.350 
there but I'm just a pretty logical
person<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.620> really<00:00:49.620> need<00:00:49.920> other<00:00:50.700> reasons

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
person so I really need other reasons

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.330 
person so I really need other reasons
you<00:00:51.570> know<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:52.260> check<00:00:52.410> my<00:00:52.530> blood<00:00:52.710> sugar<00:00:52.770> besides

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
you know to check my blood sugar besides

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.180 
you know to check my blood sugar besides
someone<00:00:53.640> telling<00:00:54.090> me<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.690> have<00:00:54.899> my<00:00:55.050> own

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
someone telling me to so I have my own

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.920 
someone telling me to so I have my own
internal<00:00:56.190> motivation<00:00:56.760> for<00:00:57.180> why<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.360> do<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.780> so

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
internal motivation for why I do it so

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.830 
internal motivation for why I do it so
often<00:00:58.520> because<00:00:59.520> having<00:01:00.059> someone<00:01:00.359> tell<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.809> to

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
often because having someone tell you to

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.770 
often because having someone tell you to
do<00:01:01.050> something<00:01:01.530> will<00:01:01.949> only<00:01:02.250> go<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:02.550> far<00:01:03.030> like<00:01:03.480> it

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
do something will only go so far like it

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.050 
do something will only go so far like it
might<00:01:04.379> help<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.710> do<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.920> initially<00:01:05.129> but<00:01:05.790> it's

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
might help you do it initially but it's

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.700 
might help you do it initially but it's
really<00:01:06.210> going<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.510> take<00:01:06.630> your<00:01:06.840> own<00:01:06.990> reason<00:01:07.470> and

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
really going to take your own reason and

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.010 
really going to take your own reason and
your<00:01:08.040> own<00:01:08.159> internal<00:01:08.610> motivation<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.689> keep<00:01:09.840> it

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
your own internal motivation to keep it

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.300 
your own internal motivation to keep it
up<00:01:11.000> number<00:01:12.000> two<00:01:12.330> reason<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:13.020> because<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.680> want

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
up number two reason is because I want

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.570 
up number two reason is because I want
the<00:01:14.549> information<00:01:15.200> so<00:01:16.200> it's<00:01:17.130> come<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.490> the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
the information so it's come to the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.310 
the information so it's come to the
point<00:01:17.610> where<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.119> have<00:01:18.330> been<00:01:18.360> diabetic<00:01:18.720> long

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
point where I have been diabetic long

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.890 
point where I have been diabetic long
enough<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.460> really<00:01:21.180> want<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.540> know<00:01:21.689> what

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
enough that I really want to know what

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.219 
enough that I really want to know what
my<00:01:22.020> blood<00:01:22.229> sugar<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.909> would<00:01:24.030> rather<00:01:24.420> do

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
my blood sugar is and I would rather do

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.050 
my blood sugar is and I would rather do
a<00:01:25.259> quick<00:01:25.590> trick<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.009> finger<00:01:26.369> take<00:01:26.790> five

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
a quick trick of the finger take five

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.450 
a quick trick of the finger take five
seconds<00:01:27.479> out<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.630> my<00:01:27.750> day<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.320> see<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.130> number

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
seconds out of my day to see that number

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.999 
seconds out of my day to see that number
to<00:01:30.390> me<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.750> information<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.500> valuable<00:01:31.860> enough

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
to me the information is valuable enough

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.370 
to me the information is valuable enough
that<00:01:32.549> it's<00:01:32.670> worth<00:01:32.820> checking<00:01:33.390> my<00:01:33.960> blood<00:01:34.140> sugar

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
that it's worth checking my blood sugar

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.350 
that it's worth checking my blood sugar
is<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.500> good<00:01:34.740> trade-off<00:01:35.040> I'm<00:01:35.460> willing<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.150> do

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
is a good trade-off I'm willing to do

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.200 
is a good trade-off I'm willing to do
that<00:01:36.540> in<00:01:36.750> order<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.990> know<00:01:37.229> where<00:01:37.530> I'm<00:01:37.650> at<00:01:37.770> and

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
that in order to know where I'm at and

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.700 
that in order to know where I'm at and
it<00:01:39.210> doesn't<00:01:39.479> matter<00:01:39.630> since<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.200> good<00:01:40.500> blood

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
it doesn't matter since is a good blood

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.120 
it doesn't matter since is a good blood
sugar<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> bad<00:01:41.460> blood<00:01:41.759> sugar<00:01:42.439> anything<00:01:43.439> like<00:01:43.950> I

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
sugar a bad blood sugar anything like I

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.010 
sugar a bad blood sugar anything like I
just<00:01:44.490> want<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.759> know<00:01:44.939> because<00:01:45.180> then<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.960> know

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
just want to know because then I know

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.319 
just want to know because then I know
how<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.350> can<00:01:46.590> take<00:01:46.710> care<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.270> because<00:01:48.270> you

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
how I can take care of it because you

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.580 
how I can take care of it because you
got<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.600> admit<00:01:48.810> that's<00:01:49.020> one<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.439> good

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
got to admit that's one of the good

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.440 
got to admit that's one of the good
things<00:01:49.799> about<00:01:49.890> diabetes<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.850> know<00:01:51.090> how<00:01:51.390> to

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
things about diabetes you know how to

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.060 
things about diabetes you know how to
fix<00:01:51.750> certain<00:01:51.930> stuff<00:01:52.380> if<00:01:52.649> you're<00:01:52.829> high<00:01:53.009> you

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
fix certain stuff if you're high you

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.429 
fix certain stuff if you're high you
take<00:01:53.430> insulin<00:01:53.790> if<00:01:54.030> you're<00:01:54.210> low<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.630> carbs<00:01:55.200> like

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
take insulin if you're low in carbs like

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.950 
take insulin if you're low in carbs like
it's<00:01:56.070> pretty<00:01:56.670> straightforward<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.719> mean

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
it's pretty straightforward I mean

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.660 
it's pretty straightforward I mean
obviously<00:01:58.170> there's<00:01:58.649> all<00:01:58.829> these<00:01:59.070> factors<00:01:59.549> that

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
obviously there's all these factors that

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.240 
obviously there's all these factors that
go<00:01:59.820> into<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:01.200> it's<00:02:01.649> not<00:02:01.950> always<00:02:02.130> like

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
go into it and so it's not always like

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.550 
go into it and so it's not always like
they're<00:02:02.610> cut<00:02:02.790> but<00:02:03.000> basically<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.930> know<00:02:04.110> what

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
they're cut but basically you know what

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.289 
they're cut but basically you know what
you're<00:02:04.680> supposed<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.009> do<00:02:05.250> for<00:02:05.969> each<00:02:06.060> number

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
you're supposed to do for each number

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.779 
you're supposed to do for each number
but<00:02:07.170> without<00:02:07.439> this<00:02:07.590> information<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.640> would

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
but without this information you would

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.950 
but without this information you would
never<00:02:09.060> know<00:02:09.390> what<00:02:09.660> you're<00:02:09.780> supposed<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.200> do

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
never know what you're supposed to do

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.110 
never know what you're supposed to do
and<00:02:11.050> so<00:02:11.230> to<00:02:11.290> me<00:02:11.620> I<00:02:11.920> just<00:02:12.310> I<00:02:12.550> need<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.030> have

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
and so to me I just I need to have

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.020 
and so to me I just I need to have
information<00:02:13.300> in<00:02:14.050> my<00:02:14.320> head<00:02:14.560> right<00:02:15.370> there<00:02:15.700> and

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
information in my head right there and

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.150 
information in my head right there and
it's<00:02:16.720> worth<00:02:16.930> it<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.260> me<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.440> check<00:02:17.830> for<00:02:18.070> that

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
it's worth it to me to check for that

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.330 
it's worth it to me to check for that
information<00:02:19.200> number<00:02:20.200> three<00:02:20.650> reason<00:02:20.950> why<00:02:21.310> I

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
information number three reason why I

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.270 
information number three reason why I
checked<00:02:21.640> my<00:02:21.790> blood<00:02:21.940> sugar<00:02:22.330> is<00:02:22.480> because<00:02:22.930> I<00:02:23.280> want

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
checked my blood sugar is because I want

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.030 
checked my blood sugar is because I want
to<00:02:24.370> feel<00:02:24.550> good<00:02:24.790> I<00:02:25.170> don't<00:02:26.170> know<00:02:26.350> about<00:02:26.470> you<00:02:26.770> but

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
to feel good I don't know about you but

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.730 
to feel good I don't know about you but
when<00:02:27.670> I'm<00:02:27.820> high<00:02:28.090> for<00:02:28.450> a<00:02:28.480> long<00:02:28.630> time<00:02:28.990> I'm<00:02:29.320> now

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
when I'm high for a long time I'm now

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.820 
when I'm high for a long time I'm now
feel<00:02:30.040> good<00:02:30.250> I<00:02:30.840> do<00:02:31.840> not<00:02:31.990> like<00:02:32.200> that<00:02:32.230> feeling<00:02:32.620> at

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
feel good I do not like that feeling at

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.730 
feel good I do not like that feeling at
all<00:02:32.950> and<00:02:33.490> I<00:02:33.700> would<00:02:33.880> rather<00:02:34.090> be<00:02:34.540> in<00:02:35.200> range<00:02:35.500> more

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
all and I would rather be in range more

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.340 
all and I would rather be in range more
often<00:02:36.300> obviously<00:02:37.300> this<00:02:37.750> is<00:02:37.930> kind<00:02:38.140> of<00:02:38.200> going

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
often obviously this is kind of going

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.960 
often obviously this is kind of going
off<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.710> second<00:02:39.040> one<00:02:39.160> then<00:02:39.310> because<00:02:39.610> once<00:02:39.820> I

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
off the second one then because once I

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.030 
off the second one then because once I
check<00:02:40.210> and<00:02:40.450> I<00:02:40.510> see<00:02:40.690> that<00:02:40.810> information<00:02:41.080> then<00:02:41.950> I

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
check and I see that information then I

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.160 
check and I see that information then I
know<00:02:42.100> what<00:02:42.340> I<00:02:42.400> can<00:02:42.490> do<00:02:42.730> to<00:02:42.820> fix<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.210> or<00:02:43.480> keep<00:02:44.050> it

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
know what I can do to fix it or keep it

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.800 
know what I can do to fix it or keep it
how<00:02:44.290> it<00:02:44.440> is<00:02:44.530> and<00:02:44.800> then<00:02:45.700> I'm<00:02:45.910> going<00:02:46.240> to<00:02:46.480> in<00:02:46.780> turn

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
how it is and then I'm going to in turn

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.590 
how it is and then I'm going to in turn
feel<00:02:47.350> better<00:02:47.590> now<00:02:48.580> I<00:02:48.610> hear<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.060> lot<00:02:49.300> of<00:02:49.330> people

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
feel better now I hear a lot of people

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.480 
feel better now I hear a lot of people
say<00:02:49.960> that<00:02:50.260> they<00:02:50.590> don't<00:02:50.890> check<00:02:51.130> their<00:02:51.310> blood

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
say that they don't check their blood

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.190 
say that they don't check their blood
sugar<00:02:51.790> because<00:02:52.120> they<00:02:52.270> hate<00:02:52.570> being<00:02:52.870> bad

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
sugar because they hate being bad

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.950 
sugar because they hate being bad
numbers<00:02:53.620> and<00:02:53.890> to<00:02:54.400> me<00:02:54.580> like<00:02:54.820> this<00:02:55.450> is<00:02:55.630> just<00:02:55.840> a

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
numbers and to me like this is just a

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.290 
numbers and to me like this is just a
horrible<00:02:56.470> reason<00:02:56.980> not<00:02:57.640> to<00:02:57.700> check<00:02:57.880> your<00:02:58.210> blood

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
horrible reason not to check your blood

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.990 
horrible reason not to check your blood
sugar<00:02:58.830> because<00:02:59.830> okay<00:03:00.370> I'll<00:03:00.490> try<00:03:00.700> to<00:03:00.730> play

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
sugar because okay I'll try to play

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.850 
sugar because okay I'll try to play
think<00:03:01.450> of<00:03:01.540> it<00:03:01.660> this<00:03:01.840> way<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.500> good<00:03:02.710> numbers

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
think of it this way the good numbers

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.520 
think of it this way the good numbers
and<00:03:03.310> bad<00:03:03.460> numbers<00:03:03.850> are<00:03:04.120> part<00:03:04.720> of<00:03:04.780> diabetes<00:03:05.350> and

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
and bad numbers are part of diabetes and

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.950 
and bad numbers are part of diabetes and
you're<00:03:06.040> going<00:03:06.250> to<00:03:06.280> have<00:03:06.490> them<00:03:06.700> no<00:03:07.450> matter<00:03:07.630> how

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
you're going to have them no matter how

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.570 
you're going to have them no matter how
many<00:03:08.140> times<00:03:08.380> you<00:03:08.530> check<00:03:08.710> you<00:03:08.890> can<00:03:09.010> check<00:03:09.220> once

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
many times you check you can check once

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.480 
many times you check you can check once
a<00:03:09.730> day<00:03:09.850> you<00:03:09.910> can<00:03:10.120> check<00:03:10.270> ten<00:03:10.600> times<00:03:10.900> a<00:03:10.990> day

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
a day you can check ten times a day

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.010 
a day you can check ten times a day
you're<00:03:12.490> still<00:03:12.610> going<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.000> have<00:03:13.150> that<00:03:13.600> and<00:03:13.870> good

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
you're still going to have that and good

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.530 
you're still going to have that and good
numbers<00:03:14.410> for<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:15.430> thing<00:03:15.700> about<00:03:16.000> not<00:03:16.240> checking

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
numbers for the thing about not checking

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.960 
numbers for the thing about not checking
often<00:03:17.260> is<00:03:17.500> that<00:03:17.560> those<00:03:18.130> bad<00:03:18.370> numbers<00:03:18.790> are

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
often is that those bad numbers are

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.030 
often is that those bad numbers are
going<00:03:19.090> to<00:03:19.150> last<00:03:19.450> longer<00:03:19.870> and<00:03:20.260> they're<00:03:20.920> going

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
going to last longer and they're going

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.710 
going to last longer and they're going
to<00:03:21.130> last<00:03:21.340> longer<00:03:21.670> because<00:03:21.940> you<00:03:22.450> don't<00:03:22.600> have

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
to last longer because you don't have

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.620 
to last longer because you don't have
the<00:03:22.900> information<00:03:23.050> to<00:03:23.470> fix<00:03:23.860> them<00:03:24.130> so<00:03:24.480> let's<00:03:25.480> say

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
the information to fix them so let's say

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.760 
the information to fix them so let's say
I<00:03:25.660> checked<00:03:26.110> seven<00:03:27.100> times<00:03:27.340> a<00:03:27.520> day<00:03:27.670> and<00:03:28.020> I<00:03:29.020> check

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
I checked seven times a day and I check

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.440 
I checked seven times a day and I check
you<00:03:29.980> know<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.100> morning<00:03:30.580> and<00:03:30.850> I'm<00:03:30.940> good<00:03:31.180> and

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
you know the morning and I'm good and

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.660 
you know the morning and I'm good and
then<00:03:31.600> later<00:03:31.840> I'm<00:03:32.050> high<00:03:32.290> and<00:03:32.620> yeah<00:03:33.250> I<00:03:33.280> might<00:03:33.640> be

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
then later I'm high and yeah I might be

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.140 
then later I'm high and yeah I might be
like<00:03:34.290> dang<00:03:35.290> it<00:03:35.440> I'm<00:03:36.010> high<00:03:36.250> like<00:03:36.550> I<00:03:36.730> might<00:03:36.910> still

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
like dang it I'm high like I might still

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.630 
like dang it I'm high like I might still
feel<00:03:37.390> that<00:03:37.470> but<00:03:38.470> it's<00:03:38.620> only<00:03:38.800> been<00:03:39.130> like<00:03:39.400> two

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
feel that but it's only been like two

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.000 
feel that but it's only been like two
hours<00:03:40.300> since<00:03:40.450> I<00:03:40.600> last<00:03:40.780> checked<00:03:40.960> and<00:03:41.470> since<00:03:41.920> I

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
hours since I last checked and since I

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.470 
hours since I last checked and since I
know<00:03:42.070> that<00:03:42.280> I'm<00:03:42.550> high<00:03:42.760> I<00:03:43.030> think<00:03:43.090> this<00:03:43.360> gives

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
know that I'm high I think this gives

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.350 
know that I'm high I think this gives
more<00:03:43.780> insulin<00:03:44.110> and<00:03:44.380> then<00:03:45.040> fix<00:03:45.400> it<00:03:45.580> you<00:03:45.850> know<00:03:45.970> so

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
more insulin and then fix it you know so

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.970 
more insulin and then fix it you know so
the<00:03:46.840> time<00:03:47.140> that<00:03:47.620> I'm<00:03:47.770> high<00:03:48.010> isn't<00:03:48.970> that<00:03:49.120> long

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
the time that I'm high isn't that long

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.290 
the time that I'm high isn't that long
but<00:03:50.980> if<00:03:51.310> you're<00:03:51.460> on<00:03:51.550> the<00:03:51.670> other<00:03:51.700> side<00:03:51.970> of

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
but if you're on the other side of

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.420 
but if you're on the other side of
things<00:03:52.540> and<00:03:52.810> you<00:03:52.960> check<00:03:53.200> every<00:03:53.590> me<00:03:53.740> like<00:03:53.890> three

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
things and you check every me like three

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.400 
things and you check every me like three
days<00:03:54.640> let's<00:03:54.970> say<00:03:55.120> when<00:03:55.840> you<00:03:55.930> see<00:03:56.080> that<00:03:56.200> high

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
days let's say when you see that high

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.930 
days let's say when you see that high
you're<00:03:56.740> still<00:03:56.980> going<00:03:57.130> to<00:03:57.160> feel<00:03:57.430> that<00:03:57.460> same

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
you're still going to feel that same

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.940 
you're still going to feel that same
thing<00:03:58.240> that<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:58.990> person<00:03:59.140> who<00:03:59.350> checks<00:03:59.590> seven

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
thing that the person who checks seven

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.030 
thing that the person who checks seven
times<00:04:00.160> a<00:04:00.280> day<00:04:00.310> cells<00:04:00.900> but<00:04:01.900> your<00:04:02.380> high<00:04:02.590> goal<00:04:02.920> has

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
times a day cells but your high goal has

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.580 
times a day cells but your high goal has
been<00:04:03.280> probably<00:04:03.820> for<00:04:04.300> a<00:04:04.360> lot<00:04:04.600> longer<00:04:05.020> than<00:04:05.320> that

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
been probably for a lot longer than that

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.520 
been probably for a lot longer than that
so<00:04:06.120> no<00:04:07.120> matter<00:04:07.300> how<00:04:07.600> often<00:04:07.810> you<00:04:08.020> check<00:04:08.320> you're

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
so no matter how often you check you're

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.020 
so no matter how often you check you're
gonna<00:04:08.740> see<00:04:09.040> those<00:04:09.190> numbers<00:04:09.400> that<00:04:09.610> make<00:04:09.910> you

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
gonna see those numbers that make you

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.670 
gonna see those numbers that make you
kind<00:04:10.210> of<00:04:11.130> die<00:04:12.130> a<00:04:12.160> little<00:04:12.580> bit<00:04:12.760> but<00:04:13.690> if<00:04:14.200> you

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
kind of die a little bit but if you

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.950 
kind of die a little bit but if you
check<00:04:14.860> it<00:04:15.010> more<00:04:15.160> often<00:04:15.390> you're<00:04:16.390> going<00:04:16.480> to<00:04:16.570> be

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:16.960 
check it more often you're going to be

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.950 
check it more often you're going to be
that<00:04:17.170> high<00:04:17.380> for<00:04:17.799> way<00:04:18.130> less<00:04:18.340> time<00:04:18.640> and<00:04:19.000> when

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:19.960 
that high for way less time and when

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.640 
that high for way less time and when
you're<00:04:20.080> high<00:04:20.230> light

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
you're high light

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:21.960 
you're high light
you're<00:04:20.889> just<00:04:21.070> going<00:04:21.250> to<00:04:21.310> feel<00:04:21.459> better<00:04:21.639> I

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
you're just going to feel better I

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.230 
you're just going to feel better I
promise<00:04:22.000> you<00:04:22.810> you<00:04:22.960> will<00:04:23.100> and<00:04:24.100> obviously<00:04:24.790> being

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
promise you you will and obviously being

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.120 
promise you you will and obviously being
high<00:04:25.419> for<00:04:25.660> that<00:04:25.780> long<00:04:25.990> is<00:04:26.229> not<00:04:26.620> good<00:04:26.860> on<00:04:26.919> your

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
high for that long is not good on your

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.710 
high for that long is not good on your
body<00:04:27.310> like<00:04:27.610> I<00:04:27.880> don't<00:04:28.150> want<00:04:28.360> to<00:04:28.419> be<00:04:28.510> a<00:04:28.540> downer

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
body like I don't want to be a downer

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.200 
body like I don't want to be a downer
but<00:04:28.949> your<00:04:29.949> body<00:04:30.130> doesn't<00:04:30.669> like<00:04:30.790> having<00:04:30.940> that

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
but your body doesn't like having that

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.390 
but your body doesn't like having that
much<00:04:31.389> sugar<00:04:31.600> in<00:04:31.810> its<00:04:31.900> system<00:04:32.290> and<00:04:32.530> it's<00:04:33.130> really

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
much sugar in its system and it's really

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.490 
much sugar in its system and it's really
not<00:04:33.610> doing<00:04:33.820> yourself<00:04:34.000> a<00:04:34.330> favor<00:04:34.360> to<00:04:35.199> be<00:04:35.350> that

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
not doing yourself a favor to be that

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.920 
not doing yourself a favor to be that
high<00:04:35.650> all<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:35.889> time<00:04:36.100> so<00:04:36.910> to<00:04:36.970> me<00:04:37.240> it<00:04:37.510> just<00:04:37.720> makes

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
high all the time so to me it just makes

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.080 
high all the time so to me it just makes
sense<00:04:38.139> to<00:04:38.290> check<00:04:38.530> a<00:04:38.560> lot<00:04:38.770> because<00:04:39.250> I<00:04:39.550> would

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
sense to check a lot because I would

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.610 
sense to check a lot because I would
rather<00:04:40.240> know<00:04:40.600> for<00:04:40.870> sure<00:04:40.900> what<00:04:41.139> my<00:04:41.260> number<00:04:41.590> is

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
rather know for sure what my number is

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.760 
rather know for sure what my number is
instead<00:04:42.190> of<00:04:42.340> just<00:04:42.490> guessing<00:04:42.880> like<00:04:43.419> by<00:04:44.080> feeling

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
instead of just guessing like by feeling

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.409 
instead of just guessing like by feeling
even<00:04:45.070> though<00:04:45.280> I<00:04:45.310> can<00:04:45.550> usually<00:04:45.669> tell<00:04:46.090> when<00:04:46.270> I'm

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
even though I can usually tell when I'm

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.510 
even though I can usually tell when I'm
really<00:04:46.600> high<00:04:46.870> or<00:04:46.900> really<00:04:47.229> low<00:04:47.440> I<00:04:47.919> would<00:04:48.250> rather

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
really high or really low I would rather

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.390 
really high or really low I would rather
see<00:04:48.820> the<00:04:48.940> number<00:04:49.240> and<00:04:49.449> know<00:04:49.889> kind<00:04:50.889> of<00:04:51.010> for<00:04:51.220> sure

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
see the number and know kind of for sure

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.909 
see the number and know kind of for sure
I<00:04:51.580> mean<00:04:51.760> meters<00:04:52.210> aren't<00:04:52.449> perfect<00:04:52.840> but<00:04:53.169> no

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
I mean meters aren't perfect but no

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.409 
I mean meters aren't perfect but no
pretty<00:04:54.310> close<00:04:54.580> what<00:04:54.850> my<00:04:54.940> number<00:04:55.240> is

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
pretty close what my number is

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.689 
pretty close what my number is
and<00:04:55.690> the<00:04:56.229> good<00:04:56.410> news<00:04:56.470> is<00:04:56.919> that<00:04:57.130> the<00:04:57.400> more<00:04:57.669> you

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699 
and the good news is that the more you

00:04:57.699 --> 00:04:59.430 
and the good news is that the more you
checked<00:04:58.030> your<00:04:58.180> blood<00:04:58.300> sugars<00:04:58.690> is<00:04:58.900> better<00:04:59.169> your

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
checked your blood sugars is better your

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.290 
checked your blood sugars is better your
numbers<00:04:59.740> are<00:04:59.860> going<00:04:59.949> to<00:05:00.039> be<00:05:00.100> and<00:05:01.030> like<00:05:01.150> I<00:05:01.240> said

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
numbers are going to be and like I said

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.370 
numbers are going to be and like I said
before<00:05:01.449> you<00:05:01.810> know<00:05:01.900> you're<00:05:01.960> just<00:05:02.110> looking<00:05:02.289> to

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
before you know you're just looking to

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.560 
before you know you're just looking to
have<00:05:02.410> highs<00:05:02.680> and<00:05:02.860> lows<00:05:03.010> but<00:05:03.520> since<00:05:04.300> you're

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
have highs and lows but since you're

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.420 
have highs and lows but since you're
checking<00:05:05.229> in<00:05:05.320> on<00:05:05.410> it<00:05:05.560> more<00:05:05.710> often<00:05:05.889> you<00:05:06.280> can

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
checking in on it more often you can

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.700 
checking in on it more often you can
adjust<00:05:06.850> things<00:05:07.120> better<00:05:07.360> you<00:05:07.510> can<00:05:07.930> you<00:05:08.590> know

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
adjust things better you can you know

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.590 
adjust things better you can you know
fine-tune<00:05:09.250> your<00:05:09.280> basal<00:05:09.850> rates<00:05:10.030> and<00:05:10.330> really

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
fine-tune your basal rates and really

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.990 
fine-tune your basal rates and really
see<00:05:10.870> how<00:05:11.110> much<00:05:11.350> instant<00:05:11.740> you<00:05:11.800> need<00:05:12.010> all<00:05:12.520> the

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
see how much instant you need all the

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.390 
see how much instant you need all the
time<00:05:13.180> and<00:05:13.479> your<00:05:14.289> numbers<00:05:14.590> are<00:05:14.919> just<00:05:15.070> going<00:05:15.310> to

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
time and your numbers are just going to

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.090 
time and your numbers are just going to
get<00:05:15.580> better<00:05:16.360> because<00:05:16.720> you<00:05:17.680> know<00:05:17.860> what<00:05:17.979> they

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
get better because you know what they

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.189 
get better because you know what they
are<00:05:18.250> you<00:05:19.090> know<00:05:19.180> what<00:05:19.300> you<00:05:19.360> can<00:05:19.510> do<00:05:19.660> to<00:05:19.810> fix<00:05:19.990> them

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199 
are you know what you can do to fix them

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:22.860 
are you know what you can do to fix them
so<00:05:20.699> let's<00:05:21.699> say<00:05:21.850> you've<00:05:22.030> checked<00:05:22.240> once<00:05:22.630> in<00:05:22.810> the

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.190 
sugars all day long now I would love to
think<00:05:36.789> that<00:05:37.000> yeah<00:05:37.180> you<00:05:37.570> did<00:05:37.720> have<00:05:37.870> good<00:05:38.080> blood

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200

Sugar's<00:05:38.560> all<00:05:38.710> day<00:05:38.860> long<00:05:39.070> but<00:05:39.430> I<00:05:39.669> can't

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:40.389 
Sugar's all day long but I can't

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:42.089 
Sugar's all day long but I can't
guarantee<00:05:40.539> that<00:05:40.840> because<00:05:41.139> you<00:05:41.740> didn't<00:05:41.950> check

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:42.099 
guarantee that because you didn't check

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:44.159 
guarantee that because you didn't check
your<00:05:42.160> blood<00:05:42.430> sugar<00:05:42.729> and<00:05:42.910> you<00:05:43.810> have<00:05:43.930> no<00:05:44.139> idea

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
your blood sugar and you have no idea

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:46.080 
your blood sugar and you have no idea
what<00:05:44.830> your<00:05:45.039> blood<00:05:45.220> Sugar's<00:05:45.520> are<00:05:45.639> doing<00:05:45.880> in

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
what your blood Sugar's are doing in

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.760 
what your blood Sugar's are doing in
between<00:05:46.210> these<00:05:46.570> few<00:05:46.810> chips<00:05:46.990> it<00:05:47.320> can<00:05:47.500> be<00:05:47.620> like

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
between these few chips it can be like

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.480 
between these few chips it can be like
this<00:05:47.800> that's<00:05:48.669> it<00:05:48.880> really<00:05:49.419> no<00:05:49.870> so<00:05:50.800> I<00:05:50.830> would<00:05:51.280> much

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
this that's it really no so I would much

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.060 
this that's it really no so I would much
rather<00:05:51.550> just<00:05:52.479> check<00:05:53.110> and<00:05:53.320> see<00:05:53.410> those<00:05:53.830> numbers

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
rather just check and see those numbers

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.150 
rather just check and see those numbers
in<00:05:54.460> between<00:05:55.080> this<00:05:56.080> is<00:05:56.229> also<00:05:56.410> the<00:05:56.650> reason<00:05:56.770> why<00:05:57.070> I

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 
in between this is also the reason why I

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.430 
in between this is also the reason why I
really<00:05:57.520> want<00:05:57.669> to<00:05:57.760> see<00:05:57.940> GM<00:05:58.210> can<00:05:59.020> can<00:05:59.139> use<00:05:59.260> this

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
really want to see GM can can use this

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.320 
really want to see GM can can use this
monitor<00:06:00.010> because<00:06:00.729> you<00:06:00.849> can<00:06:01.000> see<00:06:01.150> way<00:06:01.300> more

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
monitor because you can see way more

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.909 
monitor because you can see way more
blood<00:06:01.720> sugars<00:06:02.020> in<00:06:02.139> between<00:06:02.500> and<00:06:02.650> it<00:06:02.710> would<00:06:02.830> be

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919 
blood sugars in between and it would be

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:05.339 
blood sugars in between and it would be
so<00:06:03.160> cool<00:06:03.370> but<00:06:04.210> I'm<00:06:04.330> not<00:06:04.449> that<00:06:04.690> point<00:06:04.930> yet<00:06:05.139> but

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:05.349 
so cool but I'm not that point yet but

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:07.860 
so cool but I'm not that point yet but
hopefully<00:06:05.560> soon<00:06:06.010> so<00:06:06.910> just<00:06:07.240> needs<00:06:07.570> to<00:06:07.690> point

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
hopefully soon so just needs to point

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.089 
hopefully soon so just needs to point
