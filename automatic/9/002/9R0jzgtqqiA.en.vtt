00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.180
 yes I'm the stefan and I'll show you 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.770
 today the ppt 200 and what she can and 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:17.730
 what's in there you can see now 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:19.560
 here at music star tv you remember 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.540
 maybe as a last video where I am 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.120
 the gibson with the mini tune 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.340
 car door link system showed pippi 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.710
 does not go on completely different way as at 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.600
 The gibson guitar with motors above 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.219
 make mechanics something on the strings 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.380
 voltage changed every time but 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.440
 here with the car doors to day system 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.170
 the whole folk here over a four to 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.190
 bridge and what can I show you 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.190
 Now a few examples 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.520
 yes, what I did looks similar 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.710
 as if by magic 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.570
 once we have the opportunity if 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.190
 you draw the profile of the whole 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.170
 normal done to take sound and that 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.350
 virtually exclude audiosystem 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.850
 one has the case completely 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.610
 detuned tiles then the 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.869
 of course, but not necessarily 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.300
 the car door would push through the rhine 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.920
 system is activated and now you just have to 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.630
 once again for the normal 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.010
 tuning in all the strings 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.760
 press once 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.760
 the guitar is in tune 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.280
 at the standard to the place to happiness 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.890
 we do not have the possibility 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.439
 to disassociate one's guitar at will 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.030
 It has to imagine the whole thing 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:41.439
 that once you get the fingerboard 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.930
 mirrored in the direction 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.729
 can be opened and then, for example, at 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.770
 a drop tuning that means the 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.829
 deep side would be in the fall around the 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.470
 There are two detuned ones here 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:59.380
 has sounds go up once strike 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:02.009
 all sides again and we already have 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.009
 a drop tuning 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.060
 tuning that I also used to 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.200
 example, drop c works without problems 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.270
 At the same time we have to complete it again 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.550
 move once on the fingerboard 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:25.940
 strike all the strings and have 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.940
 we believe you 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.690
 this time the bariton tuning 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.950
 bariton tuning dropped again 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.710
 june to which I also associations in the 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:05.930
 if she does that, but also once 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.930
 grab all the strings here 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.260
 we already have 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.680
 This time the open show you the tuning 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.220
 yes very nice is that they like the 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.500
 guitar also with a brochure 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.880
 lays where the whole tunings of which I 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.900
 which weakness once showed 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.700
 are recorded 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:43.340
 you can just copy it 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.340
 no problem and self-explanatory 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.210
 The whole thing is pretty cool though 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.480
 the partie 200 waiting for a few 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:53.400
 Extras on the guitar has a midi on 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.230
 that means you can play any guitar 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.030
 trigger any sound generator 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.630
 or when recording different sounds 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.940
 use 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.670
 moreover, it will come in the next time 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.590
 the possibility to different sounds 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.090
 which we should produce according to 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.760
 to put that means you can 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.390
 as well as with current modeling 1 for 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.010
 for example, the banks or Nietzsche 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.690
 let download and download the 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.910
 guitar will sound like that 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:22.980
 Programmers are programmed in China 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:24.960
 has the unix system the at200 has me 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.270
 personally completely convinced when testing 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.190
 comes over in music store and tests 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.540
