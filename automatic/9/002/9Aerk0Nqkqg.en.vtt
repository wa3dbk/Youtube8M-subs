method<00:01:03.809> because<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.379> think<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:04.650> just<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.830> waste

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
method because I think it's just a waste

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.260 
method because I think it's just a waste
of<00:01:05.070> money<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.430> think<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.640> can<00:01:05.670> do<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:05.909> for<00:01:06.210> a

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
of money and I think you can do it for a

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.020 
of money and I think you can do it for a
lot<00:01:06.420> cheaper<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.740> can<00:01:08.340> learn<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.670> lot<00:01:08.790> more

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
lot cheaper and you can learn a lot more

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.700 
lot cheaper and you can learn a lot more
too<00:01:09.270> if<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.540> just<00:01:09.720> take<00:01:09.869> SEO<00:01:10.770> over<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.520> so

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
too if you just take SEO over that so

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.320 
too if you just take SEO over that so
finally<00:01:13.710> SEO<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.610> search<00:01:14.640> engine

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330

from my experience I've learned that web

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.580 
from my experience I've learned that web
two<00:02:33.220> point<00:02:33.250> O<00:02:33.580> is<00:02:33.850> social<00:02:34.390> bookmarks<00:02:34.959> articles

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
two point O is social bookmarks articles

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.590 
two point O is social bookmarks articles
and<00:02:35.950> directories<00:02:36.400> are<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.700> best<00:02:36.940> options<00:02:37.209> of

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
and directories are the best options of

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.140 
and directories are the best options of
doing<00:02:37.840> this<00:02:37.930> and<00:02:38.260> it's<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.459> reason<00:02:39.580> it<00:02:39.880> is<00:02:39.970> is

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
doing this and it's the reason it is is

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.680 
doing this and it's the reason it is is
because<00:02:40.739> Google<00:02:41.739> favors<00:02:42.180> white<00:02:43.180> hat<00:02:43.420> SEO

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
because Google favors white hat SEO

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.449 
because Google favors white hat SEO
which<00:02:44.650> means<00:02:44.860> you<00:02:45.010> know<00:02:45.100> you're<00:02:45.220> not<00:02:45.310> using

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
which means you know you're not using

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:46.740 
which means you know you're not using
programs<00:02:45.910> and<00:02:46.060> something<00:02:46.239> or<00:02:46.300> manually<00:02:46.570> going

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
programs and something or manually going

programs and something or manually going
in<00:02:46.840> there<00:02:46.989> and<00:02:47.110> manually<00:02:47.380> creating<00:02:47.769> this

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
in there and manually creating this

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.120 
in there and manually creating this
stuff<00:02:48.130> so<00:02:48.820> it's<00:02:49.150> harder<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.590> use<00:02:50.590> black<00:02:50.860> hat

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
stuff so it's harder to use black hat

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.820 
stuff so it's harder to use black hat
methods<00:02:51.519> to<00:02:51.790> do<00:02:52.300> these<00:02:52.420> things<00:02:52.480> and<00:02:53.140> because
