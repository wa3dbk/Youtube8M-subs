 cocoa powder soup 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.290
 I'm using cocoa because the content of the 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.989
 antioxidant cocoa is very 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.940
 interesting is very important you

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.440
 I also added a pinch of salt 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.110

 however in this mass are thus 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.650
 here I am using two large weapons 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.720
 that I left treated without water for more 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.000
 or less 20 minutes 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.119
 I'm also using two tablespoons of 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.820
 coconut oil soup that the best time 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.979
 to be used mainly for 12 is 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.200
 extremely nutritious it helps to 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.810
 lowering cholesterol to fat rate 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.670

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.940
 on the sides of the processor and it 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.780
 very firm that is what will happen with 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.780
 she in the bees 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.940
 This is a great way to have 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.370
 side of the torque rim is now only 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.770
 you evenly distributed the dough 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.600
 The window does not need any 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.940
 Mass here is wonderful. 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.760
 I will distribute the home just the 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:36.220
 farmer and then it's just a refrigerator 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.220
 for an hour to get cold in the river 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.390
 the filling of our top the ganache of 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.540
 raspberry chocolate to make the 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.820
 ganache I'm going to use a cup text 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.190
 of cashew nut tea from the full 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.040
 sauce for four hours and then I 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.739
 I put it in the oven to dry it in 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.060
 Benedict is a good to use a good 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.640

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.920
 A little kaka, I'm going to use cocoa too. 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:10.540
 by the antioxidant factor and is more 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:14.989
 also nutritious than chocolate powder 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:18.079
 I'll use the 1 4 cups of oil 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:20.090
 he must have melted that I 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.910
 I like to use coconut oil because it is 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.950
 much healthier to terms 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:28.990
 excellent quality the pousada half 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.120
 cup of raspberry tea I created 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.340

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.550
 Raspberry I'm going to use 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.770

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.370
 to combine raspberry sour as 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:45.310
 Chocolate ganache candy will fall 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:51.100
 very well not to go out on the ganache I go 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:53.620
 using a cup of tea from h-1h 9 is like 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.620
 if it were a honey produced the potato is 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.670
 a Mexican cactus I like to use it 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:03.880
 Why are you going to leave vegan then? 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:06.820
 it becomes easier to get the parts 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.130
 are improved and give vegetarian 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.200
 a touch in the salty to hire 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:15.700
 counterbalance with this sweet 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:18.100
 I'm going to use half a teaspoon of this 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.380
 show this show is the show always take 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.810

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.860
 I indicated this show that is very high 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.620
 quality 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.550
 so I'll use only half a spoonful of 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.320
 tea just to give a touch is not for 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.680
 stand out the flavor of the show 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:38.460

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.460
 pretty far 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:48.520
 the dough stayed an hour in the refrigerator and the 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.670
 ganache now you can see graphic well 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.900
 creamy is just to fill here the center of 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.670
 pie 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.330

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:04.110
 about 20 minutes and then you take 15 minutes 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:04.110
