00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
we've got going on here and this is to

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.010 
we've got going on here and this is to

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
start the row of the staggered at

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.750 
start the row of the staggered at
shingle<00:00:21.289> so<00:00:21.619> that<00:00:21.770> everything<00:00:22.100> is<00:00:22.250> protected

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
shingle so that everything is protected

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.359 
shingle so that everything is protected
you<00:00:23.420> and<00:00:23.480> down<00:00:23.660> to<00:00:23.810> the<00:00:23.869> bottom<00:00:24.080> and<00:00:24.440> I'll<00:00:25.220> show

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:26.710 
you and down to the bottom and I'll show
you<00:00:25.400> what<00:00:25.580> that<00:00:25.610> looks<00:00:25.760> like<00:00:25.970> a<00:00:26.090> close<00:00:26.480> here

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
you what that looks like a close here

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.560 
you what that looks like a close here
let's<00:00:26.900> go<00:00:28.600> so<00:00:29.600> we've<00:00:30.199> got<00:00:30.440> a<00:00:31.119> drip<00:00:32.119> flashing

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
let's go so we've got a drip flashing

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.720 
let's go so we've got a drip flashing
here<00:00:32.930> and<00:00:33.110> this<00:00:33.559> stuff<00:00:33.800> is<00:00:33.890> bent<00:00:34.160> up<00:00:34.460> on<00:00:34.640> the

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
here and this stuff is bent up on the

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.260 
here and this stuff is bent up on the
wall<00:00:35.110> down<00:00:36.110> and<00:00:36.530> onto<00:00:37.489> the<00:00:37.520> brick<00:00:37.820> like<00:00:38.059> that

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
wall down and onto the brick like that

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.260 
wall down and onto the brick like that
so<00:00:38.510> that<00:00:38.630> the<00:00:38.750> water<00:00:38.960> can<00:00:39.350> just<00:00:40.070> run<00:00:41.000> right<00:00:41.210> off

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
so that the water can just run right off

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.770 
so that the water can just run right off
this<00:00:42.170> way<00:00:42.380> and<00:00:43.210> nothing<00:00:44.210> will<00:00:44.510> infiltrate

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
this way and nothing will infiltrate

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.770 
this way and nothing will infiltrate
into<00:00:45.410> the<00:00:45.800> into<00:00:46.340> the<00:00:46.489> back<00:00:47.149> wall<00:00:47.360> area<00:00:47.570> between

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
into the into the back wall area between

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.950 
into the into the back wall area between
the<00:00:47.930> brake<00:00:48.140> and<00:00:48.170> the<00:00:48.350> siding<00:00:48.730> and<00:00:49.730> then<00:00:50.270> this

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
the brake and the siding and then this

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.260 
the brake and the siding and then this
is<00:00:51.020> coil<00:00:51.469> stock<00:00:51.680> metal<00:00:51.980> too<00:00:52.129> so<00:00:52.399> it<00:00:52.640> paints<00:00:53.180> up

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
is coil stock metal too so it paints up

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.260 
is coil stock metal too so it paints up
really<00:00:53.450> great<00:00:53.719> but<00:00:54.320> it's<00:00:54.469> um<00:00:54.710> it's<00:00:55.610> grain<00:00:56.030> so

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
really great but it's um it's grain so

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.700 
really great but it's um it's grain so
it'll<00:00:56.450> blend<00:00:56.600> with<00:00:56.780> the<00:00:56.870> grain<00:00:57.050> of<00:00:57.079> the<00:00:57.260> siding

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
it'll blend with the grain of the siding

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.750 
it'll blend with the grain of the siding
and<00:00:59.710> this<00:01:00.710> is<00:01:00.860> basically<00:01:01.070> going<00:01:01.340> to<00:01:01.430> cover<00:01:01.579> the

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
and this is basically going to cover the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.479 
and this is basically going to cover the
area<00:01:02.030> where<00:01:02.149> that<00:01:02.180> we<00:01:02.420> put<00:01:02.660> our<00:01:02.750> laps<00:01:03.020> down<00:01:03.489> so

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
area where that we put our laps down so

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.219 
area where that we put our laps down so
you're<00:01:04.640> going<00:01:04.729> to<00:01:04.820> see<00:01:05.059> you're<00:01:05.840> going<00:01:05.930> to<00:01:06.050> see

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
you're going to see you're going to see

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.090 
you're going to see you're going to see
the<00:01:06.440> shingles<00:01:07.300> installed<00:01:08.300> here<00:01:08.690> in<00:01:08.860> the<00:01:09.860> in

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
the shingles installed here in the in

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.609 
the shingles installed here in the in
this<00:01:10.340> area<00:01:10.640> and<00:01:11.140> they're<00:01:12.140> going<00:01:12.259> to<00:01:12.319> go<00:01:12.440> down

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
this area and they're going to go down

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.710 
this area and they're going to go down
to<00:01:12.800> the<00:01:12.950> to<00:01:13.819> the<00:01:13.850> flashing<00:01:14.330> and<00:01:14.390> touch<00:01:14.569> the

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.169 
to the to the flashing and touch the
flashing<00:01:15.140> so<00:01:15.890> it'll<00:01:16.009> be<00:01:16.069> really<00:01:16.130> a<00:01:16.369> nice<00:01:16.550> nice

installation<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:20.030> shutters<00:01:20.929> I<00:01:21.229> think<00:01:21.950> these

00:01:22.059 --> 00:01:22.069 
installation the shutters I think these

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:24.330 
installation the shutters I think these
look<00:01:22.099> really<00:01:22.429> cool<00:01:22.729> i<00:01:22.789> like<00:01:23.119> the<00:01:23.300> bevel<00:01:23.929> edge

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
look really cool i like the bevel edge

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.609 
look really cool i like the bevel edge
let's<00:01:25.340> look<00:01:25.429> really<00:01:25.700> neat<00:01:26.349> going<00:01:27.349> along<00:01:27.470> the

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
let's look really neat going along the

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.469 
let's look really neat going along the
outside<00:01:28.160> it<00:01:28.550> just<00:01:28.700> adds<00:01:28.910> a<00:01:29.030> little<00:01:29.209> bit<00:01:29.390> of

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
outside it just adds a little bit of

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.240 
outside it just adds a little bit of
accent<00:01:29.959> to<00:01:30.110> it<00:01:30.259> as<00:01:30.380> opposed<00:01:30.709> to<00:01:30.800> just<00:01:30.860> having<00:01:31.009> a

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
accent to it as opposed to just having a

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.870 
accent to it as opposed to just having a
straight<00:01:31.520> edge<00:01:31.729> on<00:01:32.000> the<00:01:32.319> on<00:01:33.319> the<00:01:33.380> end<00:01:33.770> so<00:01:34.099> every
