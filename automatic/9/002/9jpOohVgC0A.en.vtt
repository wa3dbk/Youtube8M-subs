00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
raising like that because I actually had

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.440 
raising like that because I actually had

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
ever plan on getting partnered probably

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.119 
ever plan on getting partnered probably
not<00:03:02.200> i<00:03:02.440> don't<00:03:02.530> think<00:03:02.769> they<00:03:02.890> were<00:03:02.980> going<00:03:03.069> to

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
not i don't think they were going to

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:04.559 
not i don't think they were going to
happen<00:03:03.489> which<00:03:03.700> I<00:03:03.819> don't<00:03:03.879> really<00:03:04.120> care<00:03:04.420> about

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
happen which I don't really care about

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.800 
happen which I don't really care about
either<00:03:05.069> minute<00:03:06.069> just<00:03:06.220> for<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.519> phone<00:03:06.760> and<00:03:07.060> I

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
either minute just for the phone and I

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.869 
either minute just for the phone and I
guess<00:03:08.140> just<00:03:08.440> something<00:03:08.830> to<00:03:08.920> pass<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.160> time<00:03:09.430> I

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
guess just something to pass the time I

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.080 
guess just something to pass the time I
guess<00:03:10.060> is<00:03:10.269> to<00:03:10.360> post<00:03:10.599> these<00:03:10.780> commentaries<00:03:11.349> and

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
guess is to post these commentaries and

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.130
