00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
case i have a filter to around eight

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.940 
case i have a filter to around eight
hundred<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.810> fifty<00:01:37.110> kilometres<00:01:37.439> to

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
hundred and fifty kilometres to

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.749 
hundred and fifty kilometres to
somewhere<00:01:38.880> around<00:01:39.290> 1300<00:01:40.290> i<00:01:40.380> believe<00:01:40.650> i<00:01:40.890> wanted

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
somewhere around 1300 i believe i wanted

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:42.859 
somewhere around 1300 i believe i wanted
to<00:01:41.850> keep<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.060> small<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.420> that's<00:01:42.689> what<00:01:42.810> you

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
to keep it small and that's what you

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.990 
to keep it small and that's what you
generally<00:01:43.020> want<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.590> do<00:01:43.740> with<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.220> geo<00:01:44.520> filter

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
generally want to do with the geo filter

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.300 
generally want to do with the geo filter
so<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.479> get<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:46.530> pool<00:01:46.710> players<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.189> be

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
so that you get the pool players to be

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.069 
so that you get the pool players to be
as<00:01:47.430> close<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:48.030> as<00:01:48.149> possible<00:01:48.750> that's<00:01:48.840> going

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
as close to you as possible that's going

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
watched my unboxing which was the video

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.300 
watched my unboxing which was the video
prior<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.229> this<00:02:01.350> if<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.530> haven't<00:02:01.979> checked<00:02:02.130> it

prior to this if you haven't checked it
out<00:02:02.399> go<00:02:02.579> check<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:02.939> out<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.750> router<00:02:03.990> itself

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
out go check it out the router itself

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.069 
out go check it out the router itself
visually<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.700> not<00:02:05.939> very<00:02:06.240> impressive<00:02:06.689> I

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
visually is not very impressive I

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.719 
visually is not very impressive I
mentioned<00:02:07.740> in<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.829> video<00:02:08.039> looks<00:02:08.459> something

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
mentioned in the video looks something

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.780 
mentioned in the video looks something
like<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.060> 1980s<00:02:09.860> router<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:11.310> mean<00:02:11.580> if

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
like a 1980s router I mean if

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.160 
like a 1980s router I mean if
have<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:11.969> be<00:02:12.090> honest<00:02:12.480> that's<00:02:12.689> what<00:02:12.870> it<00:02:12.989> looked

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
have to be honest that's what it looked

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.050 
have to be honest that's what it looked
like<00:02:13.260> but<00:02:13.530> this<00:02:13.680> router<00:02:13.950> really<00:02:14.280> makes<00:02:14.519> games

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
like but this router really makes games

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.119 
like but this router really makes games
like<00:02:15.420> advanced<00:02:15.870> warfare<00:02:16.319> way<00:02:16.560> more<00:02:16.769> playable

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
like advanced warfare way more playable

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.819 
like advanced warfare way more playable
than<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.549> is<00:02:17.810> normally<00:02:18.810> another<00:02:19.560> feature

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
than it is normally another feature

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.250 
than it is normally another feature
though<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:20.819> I've<00:02:20.939> messed<00:02:21.239> with<00:02:21.510> is<00:02:21.689> the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
though that I've messed with is the

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.199 
though that I've messed with is the
congestion<00:02:23.099> control<00:02:23.489> and<00:02:23.879> that<00:02:24.000> all<00:02:24.180> that

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
congestion control and that all that

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.050 
congestion control and that all that
really<00:02:24.510> does<00:02:24.780> is<00:02:25.019> just<00:02:25.230> prioritize<00:02:25.920> what<00:02:26.849> gets

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
really does is just prioritize what gets

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.819 
really does is just prioritize what gets
your<00:02:27.209> bandwidth<00:02:27.719> within<00:02:28.019> your<00:02:28.319> home<00:02:28.590> network

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
your bandwidth within your home network

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:32.030 
your bandwidth within your home network
so<00:02:29.489> if<00:02:29.640> it's<00:02:29.790> your<00:02:29.909> playstation<00:02:30.510> 4<00:02:30.780> xbox<00:02:31.040> 360

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
so if it's your playstation 4 xbox 360

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.819 
so if it's your playstation 4 xbox 360
xbox<00:02:32.069> one<00:02:32.900> anything<00:02:33.900> like<00:02:34.049> that<00:02:34.079> so<00:02:34.560> just<00:02:34.680> want

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
xbox one anything like that so just want

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.130 
xbox one anything like that so just want
to<00:02:34.920> go<00:02:35.069> ahead<00:02:35.159> and<00:02:35.340> segue<00:02:35.579> now<00:02:35.909> into<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.720> setup

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
to go ahead and segue now into the setup

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.339 
to go ahead and segue now into the setup
the<00:02:37.769> setup<00:02:38.099> was<00:02:38.280> very<00:02:38.760> easy<00:02:39.659> it<00:02:40.109> was

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
the setup was very easy it was

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.920 
the setup was very easy it was
plug-and-play<00:02:41.150> just<00:02:42.150> like<00:02:42.269> any<00:02:42.420> other<00:02:42.540> router

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
plug-and-play just like any other router

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.710 
plug-and-play just like any other router
just<00:02:43.230> like<00:02:43.409> your<00:02:43.560> netgear<00:02:44.010> at<00:02:44.220> home<00:02:44.519> any<00:02:45.000> other

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
just like your netgear at home any other

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.289 
just like your netgear at home any other
router<00:02:46.019> out<00:02:46.290> there<00:02:46.470> it's<00:02:46.620> just<00:02:46.889> as<00:02:47.099> simple<00:02:47.310> you

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
router out there it's just as simple you

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.179 
router out there it's just as simple you
plug<00:02:48.689> it<00:02:48.840> in<00:02:48.959> like<00:02:49.170> you<00:02:49.290> normally<00:02:49.470> would<00:02:49.739> you

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:50.189 
plug it in like you normally would you

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:51.649 
plug it in like you normally would you
would<00:02:50.310> just<00:02:50.459> do<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.909> settings<00:02:51.329> for<00:02:51.480> your

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
would just do the settings for your

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.750 
would just do the settings for your
Wi-Fi<00:02:52.230> then<00:02:52.650> from<00:02:52.889> there<00:02:53.069> you<00:02:53.099> would<00:02:53.400> just<00:02:53.519> log

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
Wi-Fi then from there you would just log

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.089 
Wi-Fi then from there you would just log
in<00:02:54.060> through<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:54.989> IP<00:02:55.169> address<00:02:55.409> that<00:02:55.829> it<00:02:55.950> gives
