things<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.380> thought<00:00:19.560> was<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.710> little<00:00:19.920> bit

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
things that I thought was a little bit

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.230 
things that I thought was a little bit
strange<00:00:20.250> like<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.730> know<00:00:20.789> in<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.060> lot<00:00:21.210> of

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
strange like I know in a lot of

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.880 
strange like I know in a lot of
traditional<00:00:21.420> Asian<00:00:22.140> cultures<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.560> lot<00:00:22.800> of

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
traditional Asian cultures a lot of

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.800 
traditional Asian cultures a lot of
people<00:00:23.130> consider<00:00:23.400> women<00:00:23.789> in<00:00:23.910> their<00:00:24.029> 30s<00:00:24.420> who

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
people consider women in their 30s who

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.240 
people consider women in their 30s who
are<00:00:24.900> still<00:00:25.109> single<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.740> be<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.859> little<00:00:26.130> bit

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
are still single to be a little bit

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.710 
are still single to be a little bit
strange<00:00:26.460> but<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:26.910> kind<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.180> don't<00:00:27.330> agree<00:00:27.570> with

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
strange but I kind of don't agree with

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.970 
strange but I kind of don't agree with
that<00:00:27.779> especially<00:00:28.080> since<00:00:28.320> people<00:00:28.710> are<00:00:28.830> living

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
that especially since people are living

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.279 
that especially since people are living
longer<00:00:29.099> nowadays<00:00:29.820> like<00:00:30.150> in<00:00:30.300> retrospect<00:00:30.810> 30<00:00:31.080> is

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
longer nowadays like in retrospect 30 is

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.780 
longer nowadays like in retrospect 30 is
still<00:00:31.560> relatively<00:00:32.040> really<00:00:32.369> young<00:00:32.520> and

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
still relatively really young and

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.400 
still relatively really young and
there's<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.149> much<00:00:33.300> bigger<00:00:33.510> population<00:00:34.230> now

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
there's a much bigger population now

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.440 
there's a much bigger population now
both<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:34.920> Asia<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.309> America<00:00:35.760> where<00:00:36.030> women<00:00:36.390> and

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
both in Asia in America where women and

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.729 
both in Asia in America where women and
men<00:00:36.630> are<00:00:36.809> kind<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.050> starting<00:00:37.350> their<00:00:37.410> families

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
men are kind of starting their families

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:38.479 
men are kind of starting their families
later<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.129> life

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
later in life

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.410 
later in life
which<00:00:38.610> kind<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.820> makes<00:00:38.940> sense<00:00:39.030> because<00:00:39.149> more

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
which kind of makes sense because more

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.090 
which kind of makes sense because more
people<00:00:39.450> are<00:00:39.809> going<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.110> college<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.829> more

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
people are going to college and more

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.319 
people are going to college and more
people<00:00:41.250> are<00:00:41.430> kind<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.670> doing<00:00:41.820> mid-career

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
people are kind of doing mid-career

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.000 
people are kind of doing mid-career
things<00:00:42.809> before<00:00:43.379> they<00:00:43.500> start<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.860> career

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
things before they start the career

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.950 
things before they start the career
which<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.670> ideally<00:00:45.329> when<00:00:45.450> people<00:00:45.719> want<00:00:45.899> to

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
which is ideally when people want to

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.540 
which is ideally when people want to
start<00:00:46.140> their<00:00:46.289> families<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.219> whole<00:00:47.340> time

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
start their families so the whole time

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.979 
start their families so the whole time
that<00:00:47.700> look<00:00:47.850> I'd<00:00:47.969> kept<00:00:48.180> talking<00:00:48.570> about<00:00:48.660> how<00:00:48.930> she

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
that look I'd kept talking about how she

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.520 
that look I'd kept talking about how she
was<00:00:49.230> like<00:00:49.410> too<00:00:50.010> old<00:00:50.280> for<00:00:50.550> husky<00:00:51.320> shoulders<00:00:52.320> be

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
was like too old for husky shoulders be

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.810 
was like too old for husky shoulders be
like<00:00:52.680> you're<00:00:52.920> not<00:00:52.949> old

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
like you're not old

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.520 
like you're not old
stop<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.809> later<00:00:55.020> she<00:00:55.110> could<00:00:55.320> have<00:00:55.410> sex

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
stop it and later she could have sex

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.049 
stop it and later she could have sex
when<00:00:55.710> she<00:00:55.949> was<00:00:56.039> self-conscious<00:00:56.460> because<00:00:56.850> her

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
when she was self-conscious because her

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.400 
when she was self-conscious because her
husband<00:00:57.420> was<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.750> only<00:00:57.780> man<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.140> her<00:00:58.379> life

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
husband was the only man in her life

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.439 
husband was the only man in her life
before<00:00:58.859> beating<00:00:59.280> husky<00:00:59.760> and<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.000> kind<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.270> found

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
before beating husky and I kind of found

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.959 
before beating husky and I kind of found
that<00:01:00.539> as<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.930> more<00:01:01.320> legitimate<00:01:01.559> worry<00:01:02.430> because

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
that as a more legitimate worry because

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.579 
that as a more legitimate worry because
she<00:01:03.090> wasn't<00:01:03.239> sure<00:01:03.480> if<00:01:03.510> her<00:01:03.750> experiences<00:01:04.439> were

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
she wasn't sure if her experiences were

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.780 
she wasn't sure if her experiences were
enough<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.129> kind<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.369> have<00:01:05.519> another

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
enough to kind of have another

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.429 
enough to kind of have another
relationship<00:01:06.060> like<00:01:06.780> how<00:01:06.869> old<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.229> house<00:01:07.409> of

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
relationship like how old is house of

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.609 
relationship like how old is house of
keys<00:01:07.650> like<00:01:07.799> 24<00:01:08.310> 25<00:01:09.000> me<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.689> forget<00:01:10.049> whatever<00:01:10.290> is

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
enough to understand the situation

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.200 
enough to understand the situation
around<00:01:13.740> him<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.220> although<00:01:14.400> Hazuki<00:01:14.939> kind<00:01:15.119> of

around him and although Hazuki kind of

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.520 
around him and although Hazuki kind of
starts<00:01:15.420> off<00:01:15.509> as<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:15.810> character<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.350> really

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
starts off as this character that really

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.840 
starts off as this character that really
seems<00:01:16.710> like<00:01:16.799> he<00:01:16.979> has<00:01:17.100> no<00:01:17.250> direction<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:17.820> life

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850
