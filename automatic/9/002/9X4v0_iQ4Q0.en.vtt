00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.830
 the chat of this young man was thinking there 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.750
 In general, someone thought of implementation 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.600
 also does not disappoint everything looks enough 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.899
 cool certain days are arranged 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.660
 holidays on which at certain 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.550
 conditions of course evolve 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:47.270
 certain events that is the bards sings 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.829

 tab holidays holidays that is and 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.450
 let's see the replacement is me so 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.970
 I understand the substitution of some holidays 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.460
 other holidays look strange but 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.020
 I do not know how else to explain his sex 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.220
 so it is there are also options that is 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.630
 any holiday what should 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.170
 attend that is festive 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.150

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.700
 and on holidays example during satura whether 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.390

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.869

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.509
 Of course , many thanks to the developers 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.979

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.030
 depending on the local holiday npc would 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.509
 gather in temples shops taverns 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.189

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.960
