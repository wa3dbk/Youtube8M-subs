00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:12.560 
and what you're looking at here is the
new<00:00:05.400> setup<00:00:06.529> for<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:08.900> electrolyzer<00:00:10.790> in<00:00:11.790> the

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
new setup for the electrolyzer in the

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.990 
new setup for the electrolyzer in the
left<00:00:12.780> hand<00:00:12.960> side<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:13.230> have<00:00:13.380> my<00:00:13.710> 8<00:00:14.280> by<00:00:14.519> 3<00:00:14.549> inch

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
plates or series get no closer there you

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.750 
plates or series get no closer there you
see<00:00:20.910> all<00:00:21.810> series<00:00:22.350> there<00:00:22.680> this<00:00:23.310> one<00:00:23.490> this<00:00:23.699> is

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
see all series there this one this is

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.210 
see all series there this one this is
the<00:00:24.539> right<00:00:24.869> hand<00:00:25.080> side<00:00:25.170> is<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.560> one<00:00:25.680> from<00:00:25.920> my

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
the right hand side is the one from my

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.330 
the right hand side is the one from my
previous<00:00:27.260> electrolyzer<00:00:28.260> which<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:28.859> took<00:00:29.010> out

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
previous electrolyzer which I took out

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.460 
previous electrolyzer which I took out
these<00:00:30.000> containers<00:00:30.420> eyeball<00:00:30.929> pretty<00:00:31.199> cheap

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
these containers eyeball pretty cheap

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.470 
these containers eyeball pretty cheap
they're<00:00:31.650> ten<00:00:31.859> dollars<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.399> found<00:00:33.120> these<00:00:33.300> really

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
they're ten dollars I found these really

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.569 
they're ten dollars I found these really
easy<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.430> easy<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.790> open<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.690> close<00:00:37.430> easy<00:00:38.430> to

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
easy and easy to open and close easy to

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.700 
easy and easy to open and close easy to
work<00:00:38.730> with<00:00:39.020> their<00:00:40.020> acrylic<00:00:41.270> bottom<00:00:42.710> petsmart

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
work with their acrylic bottom petsmart

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.840 
work with their acrylic bottom petsmart
than<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.040> was<00:00:45.320> and<00:00:46.320> what<00:00:47.129> you're<00:00:47.340> looking<00:00:47.489> at

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
than it was and what you're looking at

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.950 
than it was and what you're looking at
is<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.750> new<00:00:48.989> setup<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.920> have<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.190> theory<00:00:50.960> since

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
is the new setup I have a theory since

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.569 
is the new setup I have a theory since
I'm<00:00:52.199> going<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.500> be<00:00:52.559> putting<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:53.160> lot<00:00:53.550> more

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
I'm going to be putting a lot more

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.000 
I'm going to be putting a lot more
amperage<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.690> while<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.620> one's<00:00:55.829> gonna<00:00:55.920> be

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
amperage and while this one's gonna be

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.260 
amperage and while this one's gonna be
requiring<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.489> lot<00:00:56.610> more<00:00:56.730> amperage<00:00:57.000> because

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
requiring a lot more amperage because

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.029 
requiring a lot more amperage because
the<00:00:57.390> bigger<00:00:57.570> plate<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.020> know<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.370> figured

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
the bigger plate to know so I figured

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.319 
the bigger plate to know so I figured
the<00:01:02.039> water<00:01:02.280> in<00:01:02.520> here<00:01:02.699> i'm<00:01:02.850> pretty<00:01:03.090> sure<00:01:03.210> is

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
the water in here i'm pretty sure is

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.690 
the water in here i'm pretty sure is
going<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.539> heat<00:01:03.690> up<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:04.350> i<00:01:04.830> had<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.460> theory

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
going to heat up so i had a theory

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.359 
going to heat up so i had a theory
behind<00:01:05.970> using<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.930> hydrogen<00:01:07.439> build<00:01:08.130> up<00:01:08.250> from

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
behind using the hydrogen build up from

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.990 
behind using the hydrogen build up from
this<00:01:08.580> one<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.510> pass<00:01:09.720> through<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.200> tube<00:01:10.500> and

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
this one to pass through this tube and

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.090 
this one to pass through this tube and
the<00:01:12.000> gas<00:01:12.210> flows<00:01:12.570> through<00:01:12.900> there<00:01:13.110> on<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.890> top

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
the gas flows through there on the top

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.770 
the gas flows through there on the top
of<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.340> one<00:01:14.520> just<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:15.030> one<00:01:15.180> goes<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.360> my

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
of this one just this one goes to my

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.760 
of this one just this one goes to my
bubbler<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:17.840> takes<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.140> hydrogen<00:01:19.590> and

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
bubbler and takes the hydrogen and

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.280 
bubbler and takes the hydrogen and
oxygen<00:01:19.890> gas<00:01:20.189> from<00:01:20.549> there<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.509> bridge<00:01:21.780> here

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
oxygen gas from there the bridge here

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.100 
oxygen gas from there the bridge here
i'm<00:01:22.979> hoping<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.240> cooling<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.810> gas

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
i'm hoping that the cooling of the gas

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.429 
i'm hoping that the cooling of the gas
it<00:01:25.560> flows<00:01:25.890> through<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.280> water<00:01:26.520> will<00:01:26.970> help

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
it flows through the water will help

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.870 
it flows through the water will help
cool<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.710> site<00:01:28.950> at<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.250> same<00:01:29.400> time<00:01:29.610> try<00:01:29.850> to

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
cool this site at the same time try to

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.080 
cool this site at the same time try to
transfer<00:01:30.390> some<00:01:30.570> but<00:01:30.960> some<00:01:31.140> cooling<00:01:31.530> back<00:01:32.250> to

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
transfer some but some cooling back to

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.969 
transfer some but some cooling back to
this<00:01:33.390> side<00:01:33.630> which<00:01:33.930> i<00:01:34.170> don't<00:01:34.350> think<00:01:34.500> going<00:01:34.860> to

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
this side which i don't think going to

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.460 
this side which i don't think going to
be<00:01:35.040> producing<00:01:35.400> too<00:01:35.549> much<00:01:35.579> but<00:01:36.320> it's<00:01:37.320> all

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
be producing too much but it's all

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.190 
be producing too much but it's all
theory<00:01:37.710> right<00:01:37.950> now<00:01:38.130> i'm<00:01:39.090> looking<00:01:39.659> for<00:01:39.990> some

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
theory right now i'm looking for some

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.179 
theory right now i'm looking for some
aquatic<00:01:41.390> temperature<00:01:42.390> strips<00:01:42.860> or<00:01:43.860> actually

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
aquatic temperature strips or actually

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.380 
aquatic temperature strips or actually
you<00:01:44.220> go<00:01:44.399> yeah<00:01:44.729> pretty<00:01:44.939> much<00:01:45.060> temperature

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
you go yeah pretty much temperature

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.200 
you go yeah pretty much temperature
temperature<00:01:46.020> strips<00:01:46.710> i<00:01:46.890> can<00:01:47.040> put<00:01:47.189> inside<00:01:47.490> that

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
temperature strips i can put inside that

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.580 
temperature strips i can put inside that
way<00:01:48.390> i<00:01:48.420> can<00:01:48.479> see<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.810> from<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.990> outside<00:01:49.020> what

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
way i can see it from the outside what

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.219 
way i can see it from the outside what
the<00:01:49.710> temperature<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.130> inside<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.790> water<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.960> i

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
the temperature is inside the water so i

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.109 
the temperature is inside the water so i
didn't<00:01:52.439> want<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.649> use<00:01:53.100> any<00:01:53.130> electronic<00:01:53.880> stuff

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
didn't want to use any electronic stuff

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.999 
didn't want to use any electronic stuff
at<00:01:54.329> this<00:01:54.540> time<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:55.020> put<00:01:55.200> any<00:01:55.350> more<00:01:55.439> holes<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:55.890> it

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
at this time to put any more holes in it

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.550 
at this time to put any more holes in it
so<00:01:56.250> i<00:01:56.460> don't<00:01:56.670> want<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.880> we<00:01:57.719> can<00:01:57.750> be<00:01:58.170> the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
so i don't want to we can be the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.000 
so i don't want to we can be the
container<00:01:58.920> itself<00:01:59.280> but<00:01:59.549> this

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
container itself but this

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.720 
container itself but this
that's<00:02:00.790> my<00:02:01.620> setup<00:02:02.620> I'm<00:02:03.190> still<00:02:03.370> working<00:02:03.400> on

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
that's my setup I'm still working on

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.630 
that's my setup I'm still working on
bubbler<00:02:04.060> because<00:02:04.240> I<00:02:04.300> got<00:02:04.420> to<00:02:04.510> change<00:02:05.230> it<00:02:05.440> from

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
bubbler because I got to change it from

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.280
