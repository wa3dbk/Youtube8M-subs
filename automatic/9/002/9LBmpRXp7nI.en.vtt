30 question driver has to just go make
it<00:01:19.080> round<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:20.009> you're<00:01:20.220> using<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:21.020> purely<00:01:22.020> to

there this is all open and I'll what it

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.530 
there this is all open and I'll what it
does<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:28.799> charging<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.640> battery<00:01:30.030> if

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.600 

see<00:01:48.360> anything<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:48.960> says<00:01:49.020> human<00:01:50.010> and<00:01:50.160> energy

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
see anything that says human and energy

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.730 
see anything that says human and energy
is<00:01:50.940> important<00:01:51.570> in<00:01:51.840> India<00:01:52.140> because<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.620> know

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
is important in India because you know

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.850 
is important in India because you know
like<00:01:53.010> it's<00:01:53.790> basically<00:01:54.330> to<00:01:54.660> energy<00:01:55.410> and<00:01:55.590> fuel

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
like it's basically to energy and fuel

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.760 
like it's basically to energy and fuel
is<00:01:56.510> something<00:01:57.510> that<00:01:57.660> the<00:01:57.780> cost<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.260> going<00:01:58.470> up

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
is something that the cost is going up

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.330 
is something that the cost is going up
and<00:01:59.040> now<00:01:59.640> if<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.880> can<00:02:00.030> find<00:02:00.270> alternate<00:02:00.960> way

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
and now if you can find alternate way

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.380 
and now if you can find alternate way
you<00:02:02.340> know<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.520> conserve<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.420> energy<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.440> use

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
you know to conserve that energy and use

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.540 
you know to conserve that energy and use
sunlight<00:02:06.390> or<00:02:06.660> use<00:02:06.960> solar<00:02:07.290> panels<00:02:07.800> to<00:02:08.070> run<00:02:08.429> an
