00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
move because that has a hundred percent

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.149 
move because that has a hundred percent
accuracy<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.570> he<00:01:36.780> isn't<00:01:37.110> gonna<00:01:37.229> miss<00:01:37.500> now

burn and that's gonna ruin my set
because<00:03:10.410> I<00:03:10.440> am<00:03:10.769> that<00:03:11.010> starve<00:03:11.370> berry<00:03:11.640> set<00:03:11.910> I<00:03:11.940> was

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
because I am that starve berry set I was

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.840 
because I am that starve berry set I was
talking<00:03:12.480> about<00:03:12.540> in<00:03:12.989> my<00:03:13.050> last<00:03:13.650> two<00:03:13.860> videos<00:03:13.890> so<00:03:14.819> I

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
talking about in my last two videos so I

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.560 
talking about in my last two videos so I
know<00:03:15.150> he's<00:03:15.480> not<00:03:15.690> going<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:17.120> switch<00:03:18.120> out<00:03:18.329> cuz

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
know he's not going to switch out cuz

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.390 
know he's not going to switch out cuz
he's<00:03:18.720> gonna<00:03:18.840> predict<00:03:19.290> me<00:03:19.440> not<00:03:19.680> to<00:03:19.860> go<00:03:20.040> for<00:03:20.370> the

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
he's gonna predict me not to go for the

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.270 
he's gonna predict me not to go for the
energy<00:03:21.030> ball<00:03:21.180> right<00:03:21.510> off<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.840> bat<00:03:22.019> so<00:03:22.260> um<00:03:23.070> he

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
energy ball right off the bat so um he

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.009 
energy ball right off the bat so um he
ends<00:03:23.430> up<00:03:23.549> staying<00:03:23.790> in<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.299> I<00:03:24.510> can<00:03:24.690> take<00:03:24.840> him

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
ends up staying in and I can take him

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.840 
ends up staying in and I can take him
down<00:03:25.079> with<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:25.650> four<00:03:26.100> time<00:03:26.250> super<00:03:26.519> effective

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
down with a four time super effective

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.420 
down with a four time super effective
energy<00:03:27.000> ball<00:03:27.329> so<00:03:27.510> that<00:03:27.660> is<00:03:27.810> perfect<00:03:28.230> now<00:03:28.920> right

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
energy ball so that is perfect now right

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.160 
energy ball so that is perfect now right
here<00:03:29.760> I'm<00:03:29.970> just<00:03:30.090> gonna<00:03:30.239> leave<00:03:30.510> my<00:03:30.660> executor

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
here I'm just gonna leave my executor

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.660 
here I'm just gonna leave my executor
here<00:03:31.350> as<00:03:31.440> death<00:03:31.650> father<00:03:31.890> because<00:03:32.190> it's<00:03:32.370> burned

and I really don't have anything else to
take<00:03:36.360> a<00:03:36.600> Infernape<00:03:37.530> on<00:03:37.739> so<00:03:38.549> yeah<00:03:39.180> he's<00:03:39.390> just

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
take a Infernape on so yeah he's just

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.880 
take a Infernape on so yeah he's just
gonna<00:03:39.750> take<00:03:39.930> me<00:03:40.049> out<00:03:40.200> with<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.410> flour<00:03:40.620> bullets

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
gonna take me out with the flour bullets

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.009 
gonna take me out with the flour bullets
that<00:03:41.100> tells<00:03:41.310> me<00:03:41.459> he<00:03:41.640> isn't<00:03:41.880> scarfed<00:03:42.720> and<00:03:42.959> I

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
that tells me he isn't scarfed and I

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.270 
that tells me he isn't scarfed and I
thought<00:03:43.200> he<00:03:43.320> was<00:03:43.410> carved<00:03:43.769> because<00:03:43.950> he<00:03:44.040> showed

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
thought he was carved because he showed

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.550 
thought he was carved because he showed
me<00:03:44.459> he<00:03:44.579> had<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:44.820> u-turn<00:03:45.209> but<00:03:45.870> now<00:03:46.019> I<00:03:46.049> go<00:03:46.320> into

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
me he had the u-turn but now I go into

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.410 
me he had the u-turn but now I go into
my<00:03:46.980> azumarill<00:03:47.519> and<00:03:47.730> he's<00:03:47.880> just<00:03:48.090> going<00:03:48.269> to<00:03:48.329> go

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
my azumarill and he's just going to go

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.930 
my azumarill and he's just going to go
for<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.870> mock<00:03:49.079> bunch<00:03:49.549> predicting<00:03:50.549> me<00:03:50.670> to<00:03:50.790> go

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
for the mock bunch predicting me to go

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.000 
for the mock bunch predicting me to go
for<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.420> Aquajet<00:03:51.780> but<00:03:52.170> I'm<00:03:52.320> actually<00:03:52.530> a<00:03:52.709> sub

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
for the Aquajet but I'm actually a sub

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.259 
for the Aquajet but I'm actually a sub
punching<00:03:53.340> set<00:03:53.549> and<00:03:53.670> I<00:03:53.730> don't<00:03:53.790> carry<00:03:54.209> a

priority<00:03:54.810> on<00:03:54.900> this<00:03:55.019> azumarill<00:03:55.470> so<00:03:56.190> that

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
priority on this azumarill so that

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.789 
priority on this azumarill so that
worked<00:03:56.609> out<00:03:56.760> by<00:03:56.910> quite<00:03:57.690> well<00:03:57.840> for<00:03:57.989> me<00:03:58.049> I<00:03:58.350> am

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
right here he goes into his er arc and

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.140 
right here he goes into his er arc and
I'm<00:04:04.769> just<00:04:05.040> gonna<00:04:05.190> go<00:04:05.430> for<00:04:05.609> the<00:04:05.730> waterfall<00:04:06.120> I

I'm just gonna go for the waterfall I

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.210 
I'm just gonna go for the waterfall I
believe<00:04:06.510> just<00:04:06.750> to<00:04:06.840> deal<00:04:06.989> some<00:04:07.200> damage<00:04:07.350> and<00:04:07.739> try

it's not gonna take me out because zu
Merle<00:04:15.239> is<00:04:15.359> extremely<00:04:15.900> bulky<00:04:16.079> and<00:04:16.470> that<00:04:17.190> Zurich

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
Merle is extremely bulky and that Zurich

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.199 
Merle is extremely bulky and that Zurich
is<00:04:17.789> gonna<00:04:18.150> be<00:04:18.450> taken<00:04:19.320> down<00:04:19.470> so<00:04:20.250> he's<00:04:20.850> gonna<00:04:21.030> go

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
is gonna be taken down so he's gonna go

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.690 
is gonna be taken down so he's gonna go
into<00:04:21.479> his<00:04:21.570> real<00:04:21.870> Gliscor<00:04:22.590> here<00:04:22.890> and<00:04:23.130> that's

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
into his real Gliscor here and that's

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.790 
into his real Gliscor here and that's
okay<00:04:24.000> he<00:04:24.479> is<00:04:24.510> gonna<00:04:24.690> go<00:04:24.900> for<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.169> bulldoze<00:04:25.560> I

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
okay he is gonna go for the bulldoze I

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.430 
okay he is gonna go for the bulldoze I
am<00:04:25.979> just<00:04:26.190> going<00:04:26.280> to<00:04:26.340> go<00:04:26.550> for<00:04:26.760> the<00:04:26.880> ice<00:04:27.000> punch

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
am just going to go for the ice punch

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.200 
am just going to go for the ice punch
I<00:04:27.470> believe<00:04:27.770> because<00:04:28.280> it's<00:04:28.550> four<00:04:28.730> times<00:04:28.880> super

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
I believe because it's four times super

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.120 
I believe because it's four times super
effective<00:04:29.630> actually<00:04:30.290> I<00:04:30.350> go<00:04:30.560> for<00:04:30.830> the

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
effective actually I go for the

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.550 
effective actually I go for the
waterfall<00:04:31.700> and<00:04:31.940> I<00:04:32.630> don't<00:04:32.930> understand<00:04:33.380> I

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
waterfall and I don't understand I

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.070 
waterfall and I don't understand I
missed<00:04:33.950> which<00:04:34.700> was<00:04:34.880> really<00:04:35.420> really<00:04:35.600> weird<00:04:35.840> I

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
missed which was really really weird I

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.200 
missed which was really really weird I
don't<00:04:36.140> understand<00:04:36.680> how<00:04:36.920> that<00:04:36.950> happened<00:04:37.520> but

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
don't understand how that happened but

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.780 
don't understand how that happened but
um<00:04:38.440> yeah<00:04:39.440> I<00:04:39.470> think<00:04:39.650> he<00:04:40.280> would<00:04:40.460> have<00:04:40.550> been<00:04:40.640> able

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
um yeah I think he would have been able

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.850 
um yeah I think he would have been able
to<00:04:40.940> take<00:04:41.210> one<00:04:41.480> waterfall<00:04:41.900> anyway<00:04:42.290> so<00:04:42.350> no<00:04:42.680> big

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
to take one waterfall anyway so no big

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.750 
to take one waterfall anyway so no big
deal<00:04:43.130> and<00:04:43.400> I<00:04:43.730> am<00:04:43.940> just<00:04:44.150> gonna<00:04:44.270> go<00:04:44.360> into<00:04:44.780> my

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
deal and I am just gonna go into my

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.860 
deal and I am just gonna go into my
scratchy<00:04:46.760> here<00:04:46.970> and<00:04:47.120> this<00:04:47.240> is<00:04:47.360> a<00:04:47.390> dragon
