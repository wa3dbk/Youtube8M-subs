ended up buying this brush because I

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.150 
ended up buying this brush because I
like<00:02:35.690> to<00:02:35.810> start<00:02:36.020> off<00:02:36.110> a<00:02:36.170> little<00:02:36.290> bit<00:02:36.530> messy<00:02:36.920> and

like to start off a little bit messy and

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.740 
like to start off a little bit messy and
then<00:02:37.340> everything<00:02:37.880> just<00:02:38.000> comes<00:02:38.210> together<00:02:38.420> in
