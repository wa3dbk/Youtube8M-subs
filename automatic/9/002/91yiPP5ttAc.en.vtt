on<00:04:47.550> a<00:04:47.580> larger<00:04:48.150> map<00:04:48.360> such<00:04:48.870> as<00:04:49.080> this<00:04:49.229> world<00:04:49.500> map

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
on a larger map such as this world map

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.330 
on a larger map such as this world map
you<00:04:50.340> do<00:04:50.460> not<00:04:50.610> have<00:04:50.880> a<00:04:50.910> line<00:04:51.210> for<00:04:51.570> every<00:04:51.870> degree

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
you do not have a line for every degree

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.129 
you do not have a line for every degree
for<00:04:53.340> example<00:04:53.370> when<00:04:54.000> we<00:04:54.120> look<00:04:54.270> at<00:04:54.449> our<00:04:54.600> latitude

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
for example when we look at our latitude

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.920 
for example when we look at our latitude
lines<00:04:55.410> we<00:04:55.860> have<00:04:56.070> the<00:04:56.370> equator<00:04:56.700> at<00:04:56.940> 0<00:04:57.510> degrees

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
lines we have the equator at 0 degrees

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.350 
lines we have the equator at 0 degrees
and<00:04:58.169> then<00:04:58.919> 30<00:04:59.870> 60<00:05:00.870> and<00:05:01.020> 90<00:05:01.770> degrees<00:05:02.400> north<00:05:03.150> and

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
and then 30 60 and 90 degrees north and

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.400 
and then 30 60 and 90 degrees north and
south<00:05:03.479> of<00:05:03.960> the<00:05:04.050> Equator<00:05:05.450> therefore<00:05:06.450> if<00:05:06.690> we<00:05:07.169> had

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
south of the Equator therefore if we had

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.219 
south of the Equator therefore if we had
a<00:05:07.440> coordinate<00:05:08.010> of<00:05:08.250> 15<00:05:08.790> degrees<00:05:09.150> north<00:05:09.510> we

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
a coordinate of 15 degrees north we

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:12.070 
a coordinate of 15 degrees north we
would<00:05:10.350> have<00:05:10.560> to<00:05:10.710> estimate<00:05:10.889> its<00:05:11.430> location

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
would have to estimate its location

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.830 
would have to estimate its location
somewhere<00:05:13.080> between<00:05:13.229> 0<00:05:13.889> and<00:05:14.190> 30<00:05:14.550> degrees<00:05:15.000> this

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
somewhere between 0 and 30 degrees this

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.750 
somewhere between 0 and 30 degrees this
would<00:05:16.110> make<00:05:16.320> it<00:05:16.470> difficult<00:05:16.680> to<00:05:17.250> find<00:05:17.280> the

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
would make it difficult to find the

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.350 
would make it difficult to find the
actual<00:05:18.080> absolute<00:05:19.080> location<00:05:19.910> when<00:05:20.910> finding<00:05:21.180> a

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
actual absolute location when finding a

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.450 
actual absolute location when finding a
location<00:05:21.720> in<00:05:22.020> the<00:05:22.110> United<00:05:22.470> States<00:05:22.740> it's<00:05:23.039> best

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
location in the United States it's best

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.180 
location in the United States it's best
to<00:05:23.580> use<00:05:23.760> a<00:05:23.789> map<00:05:24.120> that<00:05:24.810> is<00:05:24.960> focused<00:05:25.470> just<00:05:25.560> on<00:05:25.919> the

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
to use a map that is focused just on the

to<00:06:36.790> find<00:06:37.060> the<00:06:37.180> coordinates<00:06:37.420> of<00:06:37.720> a<00:06:37.840> city<00:06:38.080> you

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:38.410 
to find the coordinates of a city you

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.200 
to find the coordinates of a city you
will<00:06:38.500> need<00:06:38.680> to<00:06:38.830> follow<00:06:39.070> the<00:06:39.490> latitude<00:06:40.060> and

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
will need to follow the latitude and

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.720 
will need to follow the latitude and
longitude<00:06:40.540> lines<00:06:41.200> to<00:06:41.740> the<00:06:41.890> edges<00:06:42.220> of<00:06:42.370> the<00:06:42.490> page

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:45.700 
on a map like this one you need to make

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.210 
on a map like this one you need to make
sure<00:06:45.730> that<00:06:45.970> you<00:06:46.480> curve<00:06:46.870> with<00:06:47.200> the<00:06:47.350> lines<00:06:47.590> so

page you need to make sure you're
looking<00:07:16.030> at<00:07:16.210> the<00:07:16.270> latitude<00:07:16.870> lines<00:07:17.350> now<00:07:18.220> let's

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:18.520 
looking at the latitude lines now let's

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.090 
looking at the latitude lines now let's
find<00:07:18.730> the<00:07:18.880> longitude<00:07:19.420> this<00:07:20.410> time<00:07:20.740> we<00:07:20.980> will

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:21.100 
find the longitude this time we will

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.030 
find the longitude this time we will
follow<00:07:21.450> the<00:07:22.450> longitude<00:07:22.990> lines<00:07:23.230> to<00:07:23.560> the<00:07:23.650> top<00:07:23.860> of

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:24.040 
follow the longitude lines to the top of

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:28.230 
follow the longitude lines to the top of
the<00:07:24.130> page<00:07:24.370> as<00:07:25.950> you<00:07:26.950> can<00:07:26.980> see<00:07:27.340> we<00:07:27.580> are<00:07:27.610> just<00:07:28.060> to

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:28.240 
the page as you can see we are just to

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:32.010 
the page as you can see we are just to
the<00:07:28.270> east<00:07:28.600> of<00:07:28.840> 10<00:07:29.290> degrees<00:07:29.740> east<00:07:30.840> therefore<00:07:31.840> we

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:32.020 
the east of 10 degrees east therefore we

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.500 
the east of 10 degrees east therefore we
can<00:07:32.170> estimate<00:07:32.560> that<00:07:32.740> we<00:07:33.130> are<00:07:33.220> at<00:07:33.370> 13<00:07:34.060> degrees

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:34.510 
can estimate that we are at 13 degrees

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:38.850 
can estimate that we are at 13 degrees
east<00:07:34.870> longitude<00:07:37.110> this<00:07:38.110> means<00:07:38.470> that<00:07:38.740> our

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:38.860 
east longitude this means that our

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.640 
east longitude this means that our
