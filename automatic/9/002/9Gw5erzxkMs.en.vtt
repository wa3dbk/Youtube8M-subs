know
in<00:02:13.740> terms<00:02:13.890> of<00:02:14.070> appearance<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.850> lot<00:02:15.510> of<00:02:15.600> thing<00:02:15.780> a

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
in terms of appearance a lot of thing a

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.710 
in terms of appearance a lot of thing a
lot<00:02:16.230> of<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.470> things<00:02:16.650> are<00:02:16.770> missing<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.720> I

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
lot of the things are missing and I

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.010 
lot of the things are missing and I
really<00:02:19.680> don't<00:02:19.890> like<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:20.750> you<00:02:21.750> know<00:02:21.870> the

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
really don't like it you know the

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.450 
really don't like it you know the
browser<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:22.590> know<00:02:22.680> everything<00:02:23.040> everything

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
browser you know everything everything

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.060 
browser you know everything everything
works<00:02:23.640> okay<00:02:24.090> but<00:02:24.510> my<00:02:25.110> expectation<00:02:25.410> was<00:02:25.740> a<00:02:25.860> bit

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
works okay but my expectation was a bit

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.430 
works okay but my expectation was a bit
too<00:02:26.160> high<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.870> if<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:28.020> guys<00:02:28.170> aren't

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
too high and if you guys aren't

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.770 
too high and if you guys aren't
expecting<00:02:29.040> too<00:02:29.220> much<00:02:29.250> from<00:02:29.700> Samsung<00:02:30.600> or

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
expecting too much from Samsung or

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.450 
expecting too much from Samsung or
TouchWiz<00:02:31.230> then<00:02:31.890> I<00:02:31.950> think<00:02:32.130> you<00:02:32.190> guys<00:02:32.280> will

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
TouchWiz then I think you guys will

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.790 
TouchWiz then I think you guys will
probably<00:02:32.580> like<00:02:32.940> it<00:02:32.970> it's<00:02:33.690> probably<00:02:34.080> an<00:02:34.440> okay

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
probably like it it's probably an okay

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.370 
probably like it it's probably an okay
transition<00:02:35.430> there's<00:02:36.090> some<00:02:36.540> new<00:02:36.720> widgets<00:02:37.110> and

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
transition there's some new widgets and

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.870 
transition there's some new widgets and
stuff<00:02:37.620> like<00:02:37.740> that<00:02:37.800> but<00:02:38.220> as<00:02:38.910> far<00:02:38.970> as<00:02:40.880> how

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
stuff like that but as far as how

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.640 
stuff like that but as far as how
performance<00:02:42.360> goes<00:02:42.810> it's<00:02:43.350> not<00:02:43.500> that<00:02:43.620> much

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
performance goes it's not that much

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.730 
performance goes it's not that much
better<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:44.160> think<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:45.080> you<00:02:46.080> know<00:02:46.170> there's

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
better I think and you know there's

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.560 
better I think and you know there's
little<00:02:47.190> things<00:02:47.340> like<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.700> face<00:02:47.880> unlock<00:02:48.270> which

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
little things like the face unlock which

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.480 
little things like the face unlock which
a<00:02:48.690> lot<00:02:48.840> of<00:02:48.870> people<00:02:48.930> liked<00:02:49.320> and<00:02:49.940> of<00:02:50.940> course

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
a lot of people liked and of course

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.350 
a lot of people liked and of course

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
multitasking which you just swipe you

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.940
