00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:07.520
 watson youtube as they are 24 and we are 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.280
 in a gta 5 boxing then we're not going to 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:15.110
 open it because it has what it has 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:17.150
 emotion that emotion, but now you 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.929
 AHA 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:26.699
 as in happiness 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:28.730
 the back well 13 63 and the third 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.460
 of equal 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.820
 had already opened with the scissors for 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.340
 that would be easier for me and well 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.079
 positive truth very easy the fart like 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.390
 the east has two discs 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.929
 and one is for installation and one is 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.300
 to play obviously for those who do not 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:50.609
 They obviously knew this I recommend to 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.239
 those who are going to buy this soloist in 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:56.070
 disk one since it's install the two 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.869
 discs and cause problems to the 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.449
 console today they play or they did not tell me 

00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:03.089
 promise the console but this would be what 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:08.630
 that is the map comes with two saints 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:11.539
 sweet before halo opens wider more 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.710
 this good or bad I'm going to show you my face 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:17.300
 so that they see it exactly we are going 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.900
 that 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.870
 it would be all this that I have voted yes yes 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:27.100
 much more voted yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:31.810
 it surprises me yes yes yes yes 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:34.350
 ok this is called for good but good 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.650
 let's keep going 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.049
 because I see it well in what is a 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.130
 code this is the code I do not show it 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:47.280
 this is the code and it flies with the 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:51.110
 atomic blimp for mothers 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.110
 and this would be what the manual would be 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.350
 cb of vegueta 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.229
 go ahead 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:05.220
 control milestone and mom well this would not be 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:09.800
 all boxing and we see it this since I have 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:12.040
 I have to be this album to 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.040
 what 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.480
