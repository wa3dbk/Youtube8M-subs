 Ready, this video I'm doing here. 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:18.390
 is the following I made a video in ac 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.550
 video channel is pretty old 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:26.609
 one of the most accessed that is 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:31.340

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:36.239
 through this program that is an image 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:38.820

 enter the program there you want to know 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:46.710
 How to use this is to have a video on the channel

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.500
 forget windows 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:59.129

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.190
 it to make a changeable pendrive 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.719
