00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:13.540
 Mistaken temporary exemption problem then 

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:17.079
 While driving a car, when there is an obstacle ahead of the path, he pauses and slowly progresses from the opposite direction 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:20.990
 The answer for passing cars ahead is circle 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:28.670
 Is the car of the person who has obstacle also pause? 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:35.000
 Automatic car change lever Noel is steep, passing slowly to the car from the opposite direction 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:38.180
 A good answer is circle when used when traveling uphill or steep downhill 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.980
 Increase the reaction force on a steep uphill 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:49.550
 Falling leaves of engine brake on downhill 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:54.170
 If the Cormorant labeling but overtaking was prohibited by such as running slow track of forward speed 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:01:01.550
 It may be out forward past the next to change the course 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:08.869
 The answer is that in a punishment overpass area, if you overtake even if the previous car is running at a slow speed 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:09.540
 We have no choice but to go out from a narrow road or from a narrow road where there are no good prospects for the construction method. 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.210
 In the back 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.010
 When calling 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:22.070
 If you ask the passenger to help check back, the good answer is circle 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:29.810
 When backing up, it is good to have the passenger help the safety check behind 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:31.200
 When there are three or more vehicle zones in the same direction, the right-most vehicle zone is for passing 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.710
 It came set aside to 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:42.360
 Round left most right 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:47.130
 Do you have people crossing when you approach a pedestrian crossing that passes other vehicle zones depending on speed ? 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:51.190
 It was not clear so I passed at the same speed 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:55.450
 The answer is that when the existence of a punitive pedestrian is not clear 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.640
 Progress at such a speed that you can stop in front of it 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:03.450
 Tsuruma is 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:07.050
 You can not pass through the track but turn right and left 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:14.310
 Can traverse the inside of the track for deployment etc. 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:16.630
 The answer is a round principle can not but turn right turn left across traffic 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:24.250
 At the time of opinion etc 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:27.640
 If the width of the left side of the road that can cross the trackbed is 6m or more, go through the right side 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:31.540
 The answer that can be overtaken is a punishment 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:38.739
 If the width of the left portion is equal to or more than 6m is 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:39.819
 When the car stops moving inside the level crossing that can be pushed out to the right and can not pass, a smoke tube etc. 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:44.319
 Using 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:51.530
 The answer is to circle as soon as you can see the train 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:59.000
 Use an emergency button or smoke tube to signal the train as soon as possible, and cross the car outside 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:03:04.430
 Crosswalk bicycles crossing zone when the front of the traffic that moves is congested in 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:10.670
 If you want to stop at the level crossing, you have to stop before that 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:11.520
 Entry is prohibited if there is a risk of getting stuck in it due to congestion 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.760
 If it is ok 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.680
