00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
recording devices as you can see it

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.540 
recording devices as you can see it
shows<00:00:35.880> all<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.090> recording<00:00:36.660> devices<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.739> my

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
shows all the recording devices and my

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.139 
shows all the recording devices and my
microphone<00:00:38.760> I'm<00:00:39.210> using<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.750> film<00:00:40.469> this

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
microphone I'm using to film this

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.160 
microphone I'm using to film this
screencast<00:00:42.710> so<00:00:43.710> if<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:45.390> don't<00:00:45.570> see<00:00:45.840> stereo

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
screencast so if you don't see stereo

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.360 
screencast so if you don't see stereo
mix<00:00:46.410> on<00:00:46.559> there<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.829> want<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.010> right<00:00:47.190> click

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
mix on there you want to right click

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.220 
mix on there you want to right click
anywhere<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.910> box<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.420> go<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.690> show

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
anywhere in the box and go to show

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.110 
anywhere in the box and go to show
disabled<00:00:49.649> devices<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.309> show<00:00:50.550> this<00:00:50.700> connected

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
disabled devices and show this connected

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.389 
disabled devices and show this connected
devices<00:00:51.329> stereo<00:00:52.199> mix<00:00:52.440> should<00:00:52.680> pop<00:00:52.949> up<00:00:52.980> and

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
devices stereo mix should pop up and

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.340 
devices stereo mix should pop up and
since<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.660> disabled

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
since this is disabled

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.510 
since this is disabled
basically<00:00:56.219> what<00:00:56.460> stereo<00:00:56.850> mix<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.449> exactly

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
basically what stereo mix is is exactly

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.799 
basically what stereo mix is is exactly
it's<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.579> sound<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.059> comes<00:01:00.270> out<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.449> your

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
it's the sound that comes out of your

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.290 
it's the sound that comes out of your
speaker's<00:01:01.289> for<00:01:01.559> instance<00:01:01.890> if<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.789> just<00:01:03.030> had<00:01:03.180> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
speaker's for instance if I just had the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.570 
speaker's for instance if I just had the
microphone<00:01:03.809> when<00:01:04.500> screencasting<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.549> I

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
microphone when screencasting and I

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.700 
microphone when screencasting and I
wanted<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.850> play<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.119> video<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:07.260> microphone

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
wanted to play a video the microphone

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.950 
wanted to play a video the microphone
would<00:01:07.890> only<00:01:08.070> pick<00:01:08.310> up<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:09.090> sounds<00:01:09.420> coming<00:01:09.659> out

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
would only pick up the sounds coming out

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.740 
would only pick up the sounds coming out
of<00:01:10.260> my<00:01:10.470> speakers<00:01:10.950> well<00:01:11.549> when<00:01:11.850> I'm<00:01:11.939> if<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.270> enable

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
of my speakers well when I'm if I enable

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.359 
of my speakers well when I'm if I enable
stereo<00:01:13.320> mix<00:01:13.560> in<00:01:13.740> conjunction<00:01:14.070> with<00:01:14.340> a

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
stereo mix in conjunction with a

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.450 
stereo mix in conjunction with a
microphone<00:01:15.020> my<00:01:16.020> screencast<00:01:16.560> will<00:01:16.979> include

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
microphone my screencast will include

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.359 
microphone my screencast will include
the<00:01:18.030> microphone<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.920> what's<00:01:19.920> coming<00:01:20.220> out<00:01:20.340> of

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
the microphone and what's coming out of

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.760 
the microphone and what's coming out of
my<00:01:20.520> speakers<00:01:21.140> except<00:01:22.140> it's<00:01:22.439> going<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.650> be<00:01:22.740> a

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
my speakers except it's going to be a

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.719 
my speakers except it's going to be a
lot<00:01:22.979> higher<00:01:23.220> quality<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.830> so<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.890> enable<00:01:26.640> this

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
lot higher quality and so to enable this

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.280 
lot higher quality and so to enable this
all<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:26.939> want<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.119> do<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.240> right<00:01:27.479> click<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:28.020> go

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
all you want to do is right click and go

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.560 
all you want to do is right click and go
to<00:01:28.320> enable<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.070> as<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.880> can<00:01:30.000> see<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.479> is

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
to enable and as you can see it is

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.219 
to enable and as you can see it is
working<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.170> let's<00:01:31.500> do<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> quick<00:01:32.100> test<00:01:33.229> for

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
working so let's do a quick test for

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.020 
working so let's do a quick test for
instance<00:01:34.500> if<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.619> wanted<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.189> do<00:01:35.759> one<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:35.909> my

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
instance if I wanted to do one of my

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.719 
instance if I wanted to do one of my
videos<00:01:36.710> you<00:01:37.710> should<00:01:37.740> be<00:01:38.009> able<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.220> hear<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
videos you should be able to hear the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:47.490 
videos you should be able to hear the
audio<00:01:39.119> in<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.450> video<00:01:39.540> very<00:01:39.960> clearly

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.800 

so<00:01:48.500> as<00:01:48.590> you<00:01:48.710> can<00:01:48.800> see<00:01:48.860> it<00:01:49.790> works<00:01:50.090> sterile<00:01:50.600> mix

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
so as you can see it works sterile mix

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.469 
so as you can see it works sterile mix
both<00:01:51.320> stereo<00:01:51.710> mix<00:01:52.010> and<00:01:52.520> my<00:01:52.640> microphone<00:01:53.180> are

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
both stereo mix and my microphone are

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.280 
both stereo mix and my microphone are
being<00:01:53.840> picked<00:01:54.050> up<00:01:54.200> by<00:01:54.290> my<00:01:54.560> screencast<00:01:55.130> and

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
being picked up by my screencast and

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.240 
being picked up by my screencast and
that's<00:01:57.290> pretty<00:01:57.440> much<00:01:57.560> it<00:01:57.830> for<00:01:57.860> this<00:01:58.070> tutorial

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
