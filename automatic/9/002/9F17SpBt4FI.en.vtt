00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
the netcode being adjusted and I think

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.020 
the netcode being adjusted and I think
the<00:00:58.500> fact<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.070> game<00:00:59.250> appearing<00:00:59.850> on<00:01:00.000> a

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
next-generation platform could really

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.979 
next-generation platform could really

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
assist that I mean come on why would you

good call PC is great as well but at the
same<00:01:21.600> time<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.960> netcode<00:01:22.259> for<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.560> PC<00:01:22.860> version

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
same time the netcode for the PC version

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.859 
same time the netcode for the PC version
is<00:01:23.250> nearly<00:01:23.700> like<00:01:24.060> it's<00:01:24.299> not<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.479> little<00:01:24.780> bit

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
is nearly like it's not a little bit

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.480 
is nearly like it's not a little bit
better<00:01:25.110> than<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.619> console<00:01:26.009> version<00:01:26.340> so

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
better than the console version so

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.219 
better than the console version so
there's<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.909> -<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.450> don't<00:01:27.960> know<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.170> think

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
there's that - I don't know I think

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.410 
there's that - I don't know I think
having<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.829> game<00:01:29.070> on<00:01:29.280> ps4<00:01:29.700> or<00:01:29.939> whatever

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
having this game on ps4 or whatever

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.999 
having this game on ps4 or whatever
system<00:01:30.720> would<00:01:30.869> be<00:01:30.960> extremely<00:01:31.290> good<00:01:31.500> it

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
system would be extremely good it

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.859 
system would be extremely good it
convinced<00:01:32.430> me<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.549> buy<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.759> ps4<00:01:33.270> outright<00:01:33.689> if

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
convinced me to buy a ps4 outright if

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.600 
convinced me to buy a ps4 outright if
this<00:01:34.079> are<00:01:34.259> guilty<00:01:34.530> gear<00:01:34.680> xrd<00:01:34.740> dn't<00:01:35.369> come<00:01:35.490> out

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
this are guilty gear xrd dn't come out

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.640 
this are guilty gear xrd dn't come out
first<00:01:35.880> but<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.630> think<00:01:36.960> there<00:01:37.079> could<00:01:37.200> be<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.380> lot

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
first but I think there could be a lot

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.620 
first but I think there could be a lot
bigger<00:01:37.979> expansion<00:01:38.790> all<00:01:38.970> things<00:01:39.240> considered

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
bigger expansion all things considered

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.240 
bigger expansion all things considered
there's<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.020> reason<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.439> get<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.680> fighting<00:01:41.100> game

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
there's a reason to get a fighting game

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.950 
there's a reason to get a fighting game
on<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.490> new<00:01:41.759> generation<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.360> system<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.810> that

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
on a new generation a system and that

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.420 
on a new generation a system and that
could<00:01:43.110> be<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.259> big<00:01:43.470> reason<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.890> draw<00:01:44.070> in<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.250> whole

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
could be a big reason to draw in a whole

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.550 
could be a big reason to draw in a whole
lot<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.880> new<00:01:45.090> players<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.930> course<00:01:46.110> Street

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
lot of new players of course Street

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.469 
lot of new players of course Street
Fighter<00:01:46.770> 4<00:01:46.950> at<00:01:47.070> large<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.610> responsible<00:01:48.299> for

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
Fighter 4 at large is responsible for

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.940 
Fighter 4 at large is responsible for
the<00:01:48.540> fighting<00:01:48.840> game<00:01:48.930> community<00:01:48.960> being<00:01:49.560> as<00:01:49.740> big

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
the fighting game community being as big

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.499 
the fighting game community being as big
as<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.820> much<00:01:50.970> bigger<00:01:51.119> than<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.479> was

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
as it is and much bigger than it was

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.210 
as it is and much bigger than it was
before<00:01:51.659> but<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.649> think<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:52.950> would<00:01:53.070> be<00:01:53.159> an

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
before but I think this would be an

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.130 
before but I think this would be an
amazing<00:01:53.399> opportunity<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.149> really<00:01:54.479> expand<00:01:54.960> the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
amazing opportunity to really expand the

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.630 
amazing opportunity to really expand the
player<00:01:55.380> list<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.920> bunch<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.340> people<00:01:56.610> that

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
player list to a bunch of people that

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.280 
player list to a bunch of people that
are<00:01:56.759> actually<00:01:57.119> buying<00:01:57.329> into<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.719> new<00:01:57.810> systems

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
are actually buying into the new systems

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.560 
are actually buying into the new systems
now<00:01:58.950> what<00:01:59.399> also<00:01:59.579> was<00:01:59.880> announced<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.479> is

the original Street Fighter 4 works and
the<00:02:06.180> stuff<00:02:06.360> that's<00:02:06.450> happening<00:02:06.810> in<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:06.960> new

the stuff that's happening in the new
one<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.799> changes<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.459> were<00:02:08.550> made<00:02:08.580> to

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
one is the changes that were made to

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.880 
one is the changes that were made to
read<00:02:09.030> focus<00:02:09.420> we<00:02:09.959> talked<00:02:10.170> about<00:02:10.289> red<00:02:10.470> focus<00:02:10.770> in

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
read focus we talked about red focus in

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.280 
read focus we talked about red focus in
a<00:02:10.950> previous<00:02:11.250> video<00:02:11.430> and

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
a previous video and

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.990 
a previous video and
there<00:02:12.379> was<00:02:12.500> a<00:02:12.530> big<00:02:12.799> problem<00:02:13.069> where<00:02:13.400> red<00:02:13.610> focus

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
there was a big problem where red focus

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.690 
there was a big problem where red focus
cost<00:02:14.269> for<00:02:15.110> bars<00:02:15.560> or<00:02:16.010> something<00:02:16.040> along<00:02:16.549> those

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
cost for bars or something along those

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.699 
cost for bars or something along those
lines<00:02:16.849> it<00:02:17.180> cost<00:02:17.329> like<00:02:17.510> a<00:02:17.540> full<00:02:17.840> four<00:02:18.170> bars<00:02:18.439> for

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
lines it cost like a full four bars for

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.860 
lines it cost like a full four bars for
you<00:02:18.799> to<00:02:18.920> do<00:02:19.010> a<00:02:19.040> red<00:02:19.250> focus<00:02:19.640> cancel<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:20.299> the<00:02:20.719> red

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
you to do a red focus cancel and the red

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.050 
you to do a red focus cancel and the red
focus<00:02:21.200> itself<00:02:21.530> however<00:02:21.799> it<00:02:22.159> cost<00:02:22.459> a<00:02:22.670> lot<00:02:23.000> of

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
focus itself however it cost a lot of

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.030 
focus itself however it cost a lot of
meter<00:02:23.420> almost<00:02:23.870> all<00:02:24.049> of<00:02:24.109> your<00:02:24.409> meter<00:02:24.590> stock<00:02:24.890> to

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
meter almost all of your meter stock to

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.649 
meter almost all of your meter stock to
do<00:02:25.159> some<00:02:25.400> of<00:02:25.489> the<00:02:25.579> moves<00:02:25.790> but<00:02:26.359> they<00:02:26.480> have

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:26.659 
do some of the moves but they have

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:28.360 
do some of the moves but they have
actually<00:02:27.079> confirmed<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.739> this<00:02:28.099> is<00:02:28.219> not

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
actually confirmed and this is not

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.890 
actually confirmed and this is not
exactly<00:02:28.730> final<00:02:29.180> yet<00:02:29.329> so<00:02:29.420> I<00:02:29.450> think<00:02:29.569> they're

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
exactly final yet so I think they're

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.960 
exactly final yet so I think they're
still<00:02:30.019> doing<00:02:30.170> testing<00:02:30.680> red<00:02:30.950> focus<00:02:31.370> itself

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
still doing testing red focus itself

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.309 
still doing testing red focus itself
where<00:02:32.180> you<00:02:32.209> can<00:02:32.390> soak<00:02:32.569> a<00:02:32.629> multitude<00:02:33.109> of

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
where you can soak a multitude of

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.500 
where you can soak a multitude of
attacks<00:02:33.680> is<00:02:34.250> going<00:02:34.430> to<00:02:34.489> cost<00:02:34.640> two<00:02:34.909> bars<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:35.390> do

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
attacks is going to cost two bars to do

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.849 
attacks is going to cost two bars to do
the<00:02:35.599> red<00:02:35.750> focus<00:02:36.079> itself<00:02:36.319> so<00:02:36.500> that's<00:02:36.650> pretty

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:36.859 
the red focus itself so that's pretty

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:38.199 
the red focus itself so that's pretty
cool<00:02:37.040> that's<00:02:37.189> going<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.459> change<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.790> dynamics

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
cool that's going to change the dynamics

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.610 
cool that's going to change the dynamics
of<00:02:38.299> the<00:02:38.389> game<00:02:38.510> quite<00:02:38.780> a<00:02:38.840> bit<00:02:39.049> if<00:02:39.200> you<00:02:39.290> can<00:02:39.319> soak

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
of the game quite a bit if you can soak

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.280 
of the game quite a bit if you can soak
a<00:02:39.769> multitude<00:02:40.129> of<00:02:40.340> attacks<00:02:40.639> albeit<00:02:41.540> very<00:02:41.870> risky

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
a multitude of attacks albeit very risky

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.899 
a multitude of attacks albeit very risky
because<00:02:42.620> it<00:02:42.769> still<00:02:42.950> costs<00:02:43.340> half<00:02:43.489> your<00:02:43.700> meter

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909 
because it still costs half your meter

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:45.339 
because it still costs half your meter
you<00:02:44.480> really<00:02:44.780> really<00:02:44.900> want<00:02:45.109> to<00:02:45.200> save<00:02:45.319> that

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
you really really want to save that

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:46.990 
you really really want to save that
meter<00:02:45.620> sometimes<00:02:46.010> for<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.250> folks<00:02:46.459> attack<00:02:46.790> -

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
meter sometimes for a folks attack -

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.879 
meter sometimes for a folks attack -
cancel<00:02:47.389> but<00:02:47.599> they<00:02:47.689> also<00:02:47.989> change<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.769> way

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:48.889 
cancel but they also change the way

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:51.309 
cancel but they also change the way
uppercuts<00:02:49.639> work<00:02:49.849> that's<00:02:50.180> right<00:02:50.480> uppercuts

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
uppercuts work that's right uppercuts

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:52.960 
uppercuts work that's right uppercuts
right<00:02:51.500> now<00:02:51.620> are<00:02:51.769> negative<00:02:52.189> five<00:02:52.430> on<00:02:52.639> block

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
right now are negative five on block

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.690 
right now are negative five on block

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
even after focus attack - cancelled so

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.979 
even after focus attack - cancelled so
that<00:02:55.849> means<00:02:56.030> when<00:02:56.180> you<00:02:56.269> see<00:02:56.299> guys<00:02:56.599> do<00:02:56.810> these

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
that means when you see guys do these

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.420 
that means when you see guys do these
uppercuts<00:02:57.409> on<00:02:57.560> wakeup<00:02:57.799> and<00:02:58.069> they<00:02:58.159> use<00:02:58.280> it<00:02:58.310> to

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
uppercuts on wakeup and they use it to

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.550 
uppercuts on wakeup and they use it to
get<00:02:58.639> out<00:02:58.730> of<00:02:58.849> free<00:02:59.060> sometimes<00:02:59.299> that<00:03:00.230> will<00:03:00.439> be

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
get out of free sometimes that will be

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.589 
get out of free sometimes that will be
nearly<00:03:00.859> good<00:03:01.189> as<00:03:01.459> it<00:03:01.790> is<00:03:02.000> although<00:03:02.359> they've

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
nearly good as it is although they've

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:03.819 
nearly good as it is although they've
said<00:03:02.780> that's<00:03:02.930> not<00:03:03.049> final<00:03:03.530> that<00:03:03.680> would

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
said that's not final that would

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.979 
said that's not final that would
definitely<00:03:04.370> change<00:03:04.639> the<00:03:04.790> game<00:03:04.989> drastically

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
definitely change the game drastically

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.569 
definitely change the game drastically
who<00:03:06.200> knows<00:03:06.379> what<00:03:06.680> that<00:03:06.829> actually<00:03:07.250> do<00:03:07.370> to<00:03:07.489> the

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
the favor of the offender much more if

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.990 
the favor of the offender much more if
you're<00:03:12.530> at<00:03:12.680> a<00:03:12.709> disadvantage<00:03:12.950> after<00:03:13.609> -

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
you're at a disadvantage after -

cancelling after a big uppercut either

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.039 
cancelling after a big uppercut either
way<00:03:16.220> that's<00:03:16.519> a<00:03:16.699> big<00:03:16.909> change<00:03:17.180> and<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.690> biggest

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
way that's a big change and the biggest

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.479 
way that's a big change and the biggest
one<00:03:18.260> and<00:03:18.500> the<00:03:18.560> one<00:03:18.739> that<00:03:18.769> I'm<00:03:19.010> really<00:03:19.040> excited

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
one and the one that I'm really excited

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.020 
one and the one that I'm really excited
about<00:03:20.030> is<00:03:20.329> e^x<00:03:21.229> focus<00:03:21.709> canceling<00:03:22.310> um<00:03:22.489> so<00:03:22.970> you

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
about is e^x focus canceling um so you

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.640 
about is e^x focus canceling um so you
guys<00:03:23.269> understand<00:03:23.720> how<00:03:23.750> focus<00:03:24.169> attacks<00:03:24.409> work

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
guys understand how focus attacks work

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:25.839 
guys understand how focus attacks work
in<00:03:24.889> the<00:03:25.069> previous<00:03:25.370> Street<00:03:25.549> Fighter

in the previous Street Fighter
you<00:03:26.209> pretty<00:03:26.389> much<00:03:26.479> focus<00:03:26.989> out<00:03:27.139> of<00:03:27.319> a<00:03:27.409> move<00:03:27.650> you

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:27.979 
you pretty much focus out of a move you

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:29.830 
you pretty much focus out of a move you
take<00:03:28.280> two<00:03:28.549> bars<00:03:28.819> and<00:03:29.150> you're<00:03:29.359> able<00:03:29.449> to<00:03:29.569> dash

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
take two bars and you're able to dash

take two bars and you're able to dash
forward<00:03:30.260> or<00:03:30.379> dash<00:03:30.530> back<00:03:30.769> to<00:03:31.250> get<00:03:31.400> another<00:03:31.760> move

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
forward or dash back to get another move

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
you can do the exact same thing with red

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.159 
you can do the exact same thing with red
focus<00:03:36.500> but<00:03:37.190> it<00:03:37.280> acts<00:03:37.489> a<00:03:37.849> lot<00:03:38.090> differently<00:03:38.780> you

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:39.169 
focus but it acts a lot differently you

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:40.809 
focus but it acts a lot differently you
guys<00:03:39.319> know<00:03:39.560> how<00:03:39.739> if<00:03:39.949> you<00:03:40.010> get<00:03:40.159> a<00:03:40.190> level<00:03:40.459> two<00:03:40.790> or

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
guys know how if you get a level two or

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.449 
guys know how if you get a level two or
a<00:03:41.180> level<00:03:41.690> three<00:03:42.109> of<00:03:42.349> a<00:03:42.500> focus<00:03:42.949> attack<00:03:43.250> it

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
a level three of a focus attack it

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.819 
a level three of a focus attack it
actually<00:03:44.209> ends<00:03:44.479> up<00:03:44.540> crumpling<00:03:45.139> the<00:03:45.319> opponent

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
actually ends up crumpling the opponent

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.649 
actually ends up crumpling the opponent
it<00:03:45.979> puts<00:03:46.190> them<00:03:46.310> into<00:03:46.459> a<00:03:46.549> state<00:03:46.639> where<00:03:47.209> they

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:47.659 
it puts them into a state where they

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:49.839 
it puts them into a state where they
cannot<00:03:48.290> hit<00:03:48.680> you<00:03:48.889> they<00:03:49.129> fall<00:03:49.370> to<00:03:49.400> the<00:03:49.579> ground

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
cannot hit you they fall to the ground

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:51.219 
cannot hit you they fall to the ground
and<00:03:50.030> they're<00:03:50.180> pretty<00:03:50.389> much<00:03:50.510> except<00:03:50.930> achill<00:03:51.109> -

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:51.229 
and they're pretty much except achill -

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:52.990 
and they're pretty much except achill -
a<00:03:51.260> combo<00:03:51.680> or<00:03:51.859> a<00:03:51.889> juggle<00:03:52.340> or<00:03:52.519> something<00:03:52.849> like

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
a combo or a juggle or something like

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.119 
a combo or a juggle or something like
that<00:03:53.060> and<00:03:53.840> what's<00:03:54.079> going<00:03:54.199> to<00:03:54.260> happen<00:03:54.680> is<00:03:54.829> the

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:55.129 
that and what's going to happen is the

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:57.819 
that and what's going to happen is the
e^x<00:03:55.609> focus<00:03:56.090> cancel<00:03:56.569> which<00:03:56.720> costs<00:03:57.169> a<00:03:57.290> total<00:03:57.530> of

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
e^x focus cancel which costs a total of

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.219 
e^x focus cancel which costs a total of
three<00:03:58.189> bars<00:03:58.459> is<00:03:58.819> going<00:03:59.329> to<00:03:59.389> put<00:03:59.629> the<00:03:59.780> opponent

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:00.229 
three bars is going to put the opponent

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:02.439 
three bars is going to put the opponent
into<00:04:00.349> a<00:04:00.470> juggle<00:04:00.889> state<00:04:00.979> even<00:04:01.459> off<00:04:01.609> a<00:04:01.879> level<00:04:02.239> one

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:02.449 
into a juggle state even off a level one

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:04.569 
into a juggle state even off a level one
so<00:04:03.079> that<00:04:03.229> means<00:04:03.409> even<00:04:03.650> even<00:04:04.220> off<00:04:04.310> of<00:04:04.430> like

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
so that means even even off of like

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:06.550 
so that means even even off of like
basic<00:04:05.030> moves<00:04:05.299> like<00:04:05.659> you<00:04:05.720> know<00:04:05.930> short<00:04:06.290> short

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
basic moves like you know short short

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.379 
basic moves like you know short short
into<00:04:06.919> a<00:04:06.949> medium<00:04:07.430> punch<00:04:07.669> and<00:04:07.879> then<00:04:07.939> you<00:04:08.030> e<00:04:08.060> X

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:08.389
