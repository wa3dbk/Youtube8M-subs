00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:44.270
 this is the event the new helmet helmet 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.010
 special aerodynamic a helmet that 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.800
 specialty designed wine in the gallery 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.080
 of the wind also thanks to the advice 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.220
 provided by the most famous providers of 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.000
 these mark cavendish 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.850
 with this helmet he has already won many 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.530
 you obviously fly a helmet all over 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.070
 in the name of the reduction of the 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.860
 air resistance as his shows 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.780
 very compact and stringy shape 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.850
 practically a middle ground from the prive 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.790
 that is, the classic road helmet 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.920
 of the species the t4 that the helmet that i 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.020
 specialized equipped runners 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.910
 use deny to time trial 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.500
 all new construction shell all 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:28.820
 new front doors plus small doors 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.680
 rear wheels increased to increase 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.390
 the air flow and therefore also the 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.550
 ventilation that is still discreet 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.040
 although this is a helmet 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.369
 aerodynamic ie with a semi- shell 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:44.390
 diosa the retention system and that 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:46.370
 tested with special straps 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.490
 trifix which therefore give the minimum 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.020
 impediment on the ears 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.790
 voltage regulation with one 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.440
 wheel that allows you to adapt 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:00.360
 the helmet has perfectly any 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:05.120
 anatomy of the user's skull 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.120
 three sizes produced sml
