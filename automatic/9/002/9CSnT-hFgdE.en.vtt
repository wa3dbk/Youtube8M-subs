00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 hello this welcome in recipes 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.309
 roulettes the recipe of the day and the 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.880
 lyall soups call for 4 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.309
 we need 400 g of risotto 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.740
 225 g mozzarella 120 g cooked ham 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.439
 a good bowl of breadcrumbs and oil of 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.480
 frying lyall soups telefono it's 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.070
 a perfect recipe realized when he 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.260
 we remain to rest of this delicious 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.820
 risotto and yes these are small 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.460
 risotto croquettes inside 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.140
 of which we will have put cheese and 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.910
 why al telefono this because when 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.100
 we are cut in half we have a son of 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.510
 cheese the phone wire 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.219
 okay it's more very current 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.780
 because today's phones 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.010
 have no son, though there are 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.469
 some that are very vintage 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.190
 I start by cutting the ham into 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.190
 small cubes 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.579
 I also cut the mozzarella 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.420
 I will now mix the risotto 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.420
 with the beaten egg 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.020
 the texture of my risotto is perfect 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:10.640
 that is, he reads them too much liquid 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.679
 not too sticky so I do not put 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.509
 not added the second if you ever 

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:17.119
 a very sticky texture very sticky 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.530
 add the second there for me it's not 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.000
 necessary like when I'm doing a 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.950
 dumpling I wet the palm of my 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.860
 hand and I put him a good spoon 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.209
 in the cars I add in the center of the 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.209
 mozzarella and the day 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:36.540
 and I will pack in the breadcrumbs I 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.800
 puts to heat the cooking oil 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:46.510
 when one is hot I will dive 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:47.620
 but under cover and here it is golden 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:53.530
 I'm going to put on an absorbent paper 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:56.260
 to absorb the excess fat and 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:00.100

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.870
