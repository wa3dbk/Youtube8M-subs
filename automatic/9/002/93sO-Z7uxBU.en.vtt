00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 already older as they were welcome to 1 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.940
 video and good guys this time 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.250
 we are with the first informative video 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.929
 about minecraft pocket edition 0.12 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.969
 point zero the boys and girls 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.980
 we will talk about everything that currently 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.369
 we know about this version and what 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.039
 possibly it will possibly be added as well 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.050
 that fits you take off your shoes and 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.910
 you enjoy the video well then we start 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.099
 strong with something for which we have been 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.689
 waiting for a long time the neider 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.369
 it's a very big change to minecraft 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.920
 pocket edition and everything indicates that what 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.059
 we'll see in the next update and 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.309
 the proof of this is an image 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.780
 posted by tomas or chelsea months 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.059
 back where we can see clearly 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.890
 who have added it to the game even though we 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.590
 we see if it really is going to be in 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.239
 steel point 2.0 since you take Chinese made 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.090
 gave more information about it but 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.940
 let's hope seriously let's hope it is 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.860
 in this next update guys and 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.960
 we continue with another feature more than 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.730
 obvious or is what I believe since with 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.980
 sneijder in the game and the effects of 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.750
 the issues already added is obvious or 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.280
 is what I believe as I repeat that the one 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.860
 the positions can not be missing in the 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.990
 0.12 point zero remember that 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.930
 previously mougán commented that no 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.460
 they would say these positions at 0.11 already 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.890
 that we would not have the leader in said 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.810
 version but as we know many of the 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.670
 ingredients for many positions only 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.680
 we are only from neder by 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.780
 what it looks like guys and girls that 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.640
 positions are going to be present in this 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.619
 next version since there is a 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.520
 way for this then I think not 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.470
 may be missing 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.810
 well then we continue with a bot that 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.159
 it seems to be late arrival to minecraft and 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.229
 is that with every user for his 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.429
 implementation we found very strange 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.830
 that the Zealots were not among 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:39.630
 us at 0.11 point zero 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.729
 nevertheless we firmly believe that what 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.500
 we can see at 0.12 point zero and 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.630
 proof of this is a shared gif 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.130
 because in the taste in hop on twitter and 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.659
 I'm telling you guys here because they're not 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.240
 you have seen it so it seems so 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.179
 guys we will see this mobile the 0.12 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.860
 zero point and it seems also that 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.110
 we can turn it into our mascot 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.119
 that is a kitten because then we already have 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.189
 with fishing since we already have 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.959
 fish so I think it would not be bad 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.789
 that they already put us in the light of 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:08.220
 batch do not also remember that the middle 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.950
 it implies more mobs onu those that are missing in 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.840
 yes because sneijder are the 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.450
 spend 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.099
 in the blazers only place and also 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.930
 find the winter skeleton if not 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.030
 I'm wrong then I think guys 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.040
 that we will also have these modes this 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.330
 it's not confirmed but the ocelot I think 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.769
 yes it is ok 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.690
 well then to culminate with this video 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.459
 informative we will see a tweet again 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.440
 on the part of tomás 8 elche that says what 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.580
 next here is a clear list of 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.340
 the initials of the new 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.019
 characteristics which is not a mockery 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.910
 but extreme I do not know very well who you 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.709
 significant but of all 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.470
 initials that he placed I'm sure of 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.630
 several ok the net that is the n obviously 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.110
 is printing and / or is nike inc that would be 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.000
 run and crouch with the c I would say 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.950
 that the commands although in truth we 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.780
 they said before that the commands that we 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.599
 they would put in because they require a lot of things 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.760
 although it can not be that we can 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.470
 surprise as a list of commands a 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.629
 little shorter than the pc but 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.730
 maybe it can be guys remember 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.410
 which is possibly do not say then to the 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.239
 tones as our nation points and we 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.829
 you said I would put them not ok 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.780
 I say to you, maybe it is because 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.879
 commands link moment that point zero 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.370
 that with the voice of course they would be 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:19.459
 the ocelots the tail 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.019
 h I am among horses or dairy corsets 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.629
 ok the hunger bar eat then 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.700
 well this is a debate equally guys 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:27.379
 so then I between the horses and the 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.569
 hunger bar and I think that I 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.909
 I would stay with the horses I do not know what 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.220
 next I would be the one between 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:35.629
 the chantin and I experience that then 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.269
 it would be enchantment 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:40.519
 or experience ok although I think if you put 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.620
 in experience to force a game 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.690
 they would have to put the enchantment 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.269
 because if what you want the click 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.129
 no experience and so with the I think 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.049
 that I can not think of anything and then 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:53.000
 Forget to speak Sheikh 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.940
 which is the goals so six guys 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.040
 in the 0.2 point zero we will have goals 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.019
 ok and well I think because I'll leave it on 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.150
 the comments I need your help to 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.069
 that you try to decipher for yourself that 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.569
 are the missing initials and those that 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.220
 she and peace and those that I already mentioned 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.629
 forgiveness is so bad that there is forgiveness for 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.599
 these guys is that it's a bit strange 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:13.459
 but well so it seems that this 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.079
 It would be you I hope you liked it already 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.910
 you know you can leave your like 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.310
 comment and favorite so until the 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.420
 I love them next minds Nation 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.250

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.440
 that a hug and see you in a 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.480
 next video remember to share this 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.010
 video so that more people do not know and without 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.260
 Any doubt, it will be an update 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.820
 very good and therefore personally 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.760
 I look forward to not remember also 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.830
 in which you can comment what are you waiting for 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.680
 of this version so another thing that 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.810
 forget guys is that you take that or 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.690
 make shots to chelsea put a tweet on 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.640
 the one that said that I can 0.11 point zero 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.160
 It was a version that was slow to arrive 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.140
 no but the next one is 0.12 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.420
 it would come faster guys and girls 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.190
 we are talking about mobile jiang so 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.690
 I do not expect it to come out in about two 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.360
 months if you do not pass but in reality 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.820
 I hope the views start to come out 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.530
 in September or that it is not 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.450
 that I hope so now I do 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.540
 I love them firing Meiners be 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:12.820
