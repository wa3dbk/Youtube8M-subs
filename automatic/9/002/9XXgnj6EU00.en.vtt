00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
I've just used the Star Wars figure

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.539 
I've just used the Star Wars figure
stands<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.479> just<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.159> facilitate<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.939> Stan

the figure the figure can stand very

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.700 
the figure the figure can stand very
well<00:02:02.649> I<00:02:02.679> mean<00:02:02.979> there's<00:02:03.159> no<00:02:03.250> need<00:02:03.280> for<00:02:03.609> a<00:02:03.640> base

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
well I mean there's no need for a base

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.790 
well I mean there's no need for a base
but<00:02:05.710> first<00:02:06.460> just<00:02:07.000> for<00:02:07.319> for<00:02:08.319> purposes<00:02:08.470> of

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
but first just for for purposes of

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.160 
but first just for for purposes of
reviewing<00:02:09.610> them<00:02:09.789> and<00:02:09.819> then<00:02:10.360> just<00:02:10.869> to<00:02:11.019> avoid

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
reviewing them and then just to avoid

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.290 
reviewing them and then just to avoid
knocking<00:02:11.650> them<00:02:11.800> over<00:02:11.950> I<00:02:12.310> think<00:02:12.849> it's<00:02:13.120> best

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
knocking them over I think it's best

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.059 
knocking them over I think it's best
that<00:02:13.390> I<00:02:13.510> used<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:13.900> stand<00:02:14.110> now<00:02:14.410> both<00:02:14.650> figures

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
that I used to stand now both figures

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.320 
that I used to stand now both figures
are<00:02:15.750> come<00:02:16.750> with<00:02:16.959> these<00:02:17.230> energy<00:02:18.220> blasts<00:02:19.060> that

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
are come with these energy blasts that

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.830 
are come with these energy blasts that
fit<00:02:19.540> nicely<00:02:19.810> on<00:02:19.989> their<00:02:20.230> hands<00:02:20.799> even<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.970> class

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
fit nicely on their hands even the class

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.289 
fit nicely on their hands even the class
the<00:02:23.110> modern<00:02:23.590> is<00:02:23.860> marvel<00:02:24.310> has<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:24.730> energy

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
the modern is marvel has the energy

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.440 
the modern is marvel has the energy
blood<00:02:25.750> I<00:02:25.920> then<00:02:26.920> greedy<00:02:27.250> think<00:02:27.640> it<00:02:28.150> was

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
blood I then greedy think it was

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.030 
blood I then greedy think it was
necessary<00:02:28.989> but<00:02:29.260> it<00:02:29.379> was<00:02:29.470> nice<00:02:29.680> that<00:02:29.709> they've

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
necessary but it was nice that they've

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.940 
necessary but it was nice that they've
actually<00:02:30.250> put<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:30.849> uh<00:02:31.290> so<00:02:32.290> again<00:02:32.440> is<00:02:32.650> it's<00:02:32.890> a

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
actually put it uh so again is it's a

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.680 
actually put it uh so again is it's a
well-made<00:02:33.310> figure<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.760> only<00:02:34.060> problem<00:02:34.660> that

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
well-made figure the only problem that

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.140
