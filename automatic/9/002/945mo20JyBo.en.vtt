00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.679
 one together here is christian again 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.870
 and again from mbc 2015 and now 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:13.510
 we are samsung samsung in a few 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.970
 minutes the samsung galaxy s 6 and that 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.769
 samsung galaxy s 6 presented 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.320
 what I currently have him a hand 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:23.019
 that's the samsung galaxy s 6 so that 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.900
 new flagship of 2015 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:27.279
 and at the beginning of 2016 and what this device will do 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.249
 I can do that in the next one 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.140
 minutes show and also say on the 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:33.250
 For the first time we have a quad for the first time 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.500
 hd display that is the 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.500
 display diagonal which is still 51 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.679
 but the resolution is supposed to be 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.590
 2,560 x 1,440 pixels and that generated 

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:45.699
 a pixel density of 577 pixels per inch 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.620
 on the display 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.239
 then we have in the upper area namely 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.949
 above the display next to the 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.070
 earpiece a 5 megapixel front camera 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:56.230
 with a f 1.9 that means she is blind 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.670
 very bright and even under 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.339
 bad lighting conditions are likely with 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.140
 this camera work very well in the 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:03.699
 lower range logically back in 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.409
 physical home button know this 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.390
 We have been from samsung for some time now 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.920
 couple of capacitive buttons left and 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.720
 in time of that he is called back 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.640
 button on the right and the 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.710
 multitasking button on the left side 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.150
 And the fingerprint scanner is something 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.440
 got bigger and it has namely the 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.450
 reason that you can not talk about it anymore 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.820
 must delete but like the iphone 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.560
 For example, the finger hangs up and 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.400
 the device unlocks then as from 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.810
 magic hand 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.090
 the device has on the front 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.430
 gorilla-glas four that is that 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.320
 latest glass extremely resistant and 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.970
 but also has a lot on the 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.100
 back gorilla glass for that means we 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.410
 here have a housing made of glass 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.110
 exists namely front and back and 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.330
 a frame of metal and the pulls 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.800
 around the whole device except in the 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.630
 lower area there are some 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.160
 interruptions namely next to the 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.610
 audio connection because we have that way 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.130
 on 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.440
 a small plastic inlay or the 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.530
 reception should be better guaranteed 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.460
 then we have the audio connection 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.010
 micro-usb connection to load the 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.830
 device the microphone and also the 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.900
 have speakers on the right side 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.760
 here's the sim card slot and here 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.500
 comes a nano sim card for use 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.750
 the power button is in half 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.980
 arranged so in the middle of the 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.960
 you can call him right 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.820
 really pack very well as well 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.920
 Accordingly, this 5 1 inch 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.440
 great device unlock that very well 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.030
 means she will have a really good one 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.410
 sitting position on the left side and 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.570
 then we have the volume rocker and 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.250
 which is now the first time divided into two 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.720
 means we have a louder and quieter 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.300
 button and the pressure points are 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.520
 really good in the head of the device 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.320
 we still have the infrared sensor that 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.750
 We are used to control tv sets 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.640
 have another microphone and as in the 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.190
 lower areas of these plastic inlays 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.100
 for the better reception of this device 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.459
 the galaxy s 6 and also the galaxy s 6 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.440
 can lte cut six that is 300 mbit 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.239
 I'm downloading and I believe 50 in the upload 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.400
 That means extremely fast network 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.769
 on the back have one 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.660
 16 megapixel camera also with a 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.370
 f 1.9 aperture and optical 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.989
 image stabilizer that is already known 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.940
 from samsung galaxy note 4 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.739
 that means the videos but also photos 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.450
 in low light conditions 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.920
 should therefore be well photographed 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.930
 then of course we still have that 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.850
 lightning we have this again 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.049
 heart rate monitor and that is 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.610
 actually the back what else 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.769
 worth mentioning it is of course the battery 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.989
 the man you can load wirelessly 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.239
 This is called 2550 milliamp hours 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.130
 big battery can be on a start in bed 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.720
 be placed and within ten 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.910
 minutes charging time then you have again 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.260
 juice for around four hours 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.320
 the whole thing is driven by now 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.060
 a victim before the 14 minutes naked 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.290
 that's what it was made of 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.870
 not only energy-efficient now 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.280
 Namely around 35 percent and 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.690
 accordingly, one has a longer one 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.190
 battery life but also more potent 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.080
 have become around 20 percent 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.660
 that's the opposite of the samsung galaxy s 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.310
 5, the galaxy nexus s 6 is clear 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.000
 faster but also energy 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.770
 more economical 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.500
 what comes here is here again 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:56.770
 of course the bag for use 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.900
 we already from samsung galaxy s 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.460
 5 android 5.0 lollipop know because 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.750
 that's exactly what works on this device 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:06.990
 if here the white beer endpoint builds up 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.610
 0.2 it installs directly from home 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:13.030
 out of course, as on the samsung 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.430
 galaxy s 6 patch to memory 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.850
 we have three gigabytes of internal 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.470
 memory from 32 gb that is the 16 gb 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.800
 version the assets have been dropped for it 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.990
 we start with 32 64 and 128 gb and 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.510
 this memory supports the new os 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.320
 2.0 standard means it is again 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.000
 become faster 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.950
 there is a small drawback, however 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.720
 also the micro sd card slot is the 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.570
 dropped away leaving the user himself 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.580
 really look in front of the audience 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:43.930
 which memory variant he should take 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:46.300
 that is 32 64 128 and accordingly 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.620
 it is the user defined by 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.300
 I like the pimple rifle 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.490
 really good super amoled course 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.690
 black values bomb the values ​​are 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.490
 Of course we have to be in the final 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.280
 see version and weighing in 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:00.160
 around the 138 grams and a thick of 7 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.840
 mm is not only the samsung galaxy s 6 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.700
 super light but also really thin 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.830
 and it is at first sight 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.300
 not only high quality but also of 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.890
 the surface damn rivers 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.490
 So that was it with a first hands 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.750
 and samsung galaxy s 63 from mwc 2015 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.350
 I thank you that we were there 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.350
 take care
