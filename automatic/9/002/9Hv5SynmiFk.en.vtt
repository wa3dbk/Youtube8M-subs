00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.279 
think about like like I don't think
about<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.119> fact<00:00:21.240> I'm<00:00:21.480> not<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.779> say<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.109> over

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
about the fact I'm not to say it over

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.870 
about the fact I'm not to say it over
and<00:00:22.470> over<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.859> over<00:00:22.920> again<00:00:23.039> hundreds<00:00:23.760> of

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
and over and over again hundreds of

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.089 
and over and over again hundreds of
times<00:00:24.180> if<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.990> leave<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.560> way<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.710> I've

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
times if I leave it the way that I've

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.490 
times if I leave it the way that I've
written<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.960> sometimes<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.199> think<00:00:28.260> about

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
written it and sometimes I think about

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.220 
written it and sometimes I think about
like<00:00:29.269> encircle<00:00:30.269> me<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.570> like<00:00:30.689> not<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.109> way

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
like encircle me is like not the way

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.090 
like encircle me is like not the way
that<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.439> would<00:00:31.529> say<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.340> want<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.300> be<00:00:34.100> touched

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.500 
that I would say I want to be touched
yeah<00:00:35.430> but<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.640> mean<00:00:35.790> hungry<00:00:35.969> wouldn't<00:00:36.420> sound

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
yeah but I mean hungry wouldn't sound

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.020 
yeah but I mean hungry wouldn't sound
ridiculous<00:00:37.050> right<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.700> not<00:00:38.820> enough

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
ridiculous right and this is not enough

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.229 
ridiculous right and this is not enough
syllables<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.719> begin<00:00:39.960> with<00:00:40.140> but<00:00:41.090> how<00:00:42.090> could

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
syllables to begin with but how could

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.319 
syllables to begin with but how could
you<00:00:42.300> make<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.600> work<00:00:43.579> arms<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.700> family<00:00:47.030> no<00:00:48.030> that

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
you make it work arms a family no that

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.060 
you make it work arms a family no that
wouldn't<00:00:48.510> work<00:00:48.570> either<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:49.289> mean<00:00:49.649> it's<00:00:49.770> circle

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
wouldn't work either I mean it's circle

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.490 
wouldn't work either I mean it's circle
me<00:00:50.160> was<00:00:50.340> really<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.760> only<00:00:50.879> option<00:00:51.030> but<00:00:51.750> who

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
me was really the only option but who

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.250 
me was really the only option but who
says<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:53.070> been<00:00:53.280> like<00:00:53.309> ooh<00:00:53.640> beer<00:00:55.789> no<00:00:57.260> actually

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
says that been like ooh beer no actually

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.069 
says that been like ooh beer no actually
I<00:00:58.530> think<00:00:58.980> probably<00:00:59.699> if<00:01:00.270> there<00:01:00.570> was<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.750> group<00:01:00.930> of

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
I think probably if there was a group of

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.660 
I think probably if there was a group of
people<00:01:01.410> who<00:01:01.530> would<00:01:01.739> translate<00:01:02.250> hooked

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
people who would translate hooked

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.789 
people who would translate hooked
inserting<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.780> might<00:01:03.930> be<00:01:04.049> people<00:01:04.500> from

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
inserting it might be people from

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.870 
inserting it might be people from
