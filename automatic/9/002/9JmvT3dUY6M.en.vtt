there's no way to shut that feature off
as<00:02:40.840> well<00:02:41.050> so<00:02:41.380> keep<00:02:41.650> that<00:02:41.770> in<00:02:41.830> mind<00:02:42.070> now<00:02:42.430> the

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
as well so keep that in mind now the

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.100 
as well so keep that in mind now the
camera<00:02:42.790> has<00:02:42.820> optical<00:02:43.420> image<00:02:43.720> stabilization

camera has optical image stabilization

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.930 
camera has optical image stabilization
and<00:02:44.590> it<00:02:44.650> works<00:02:44.800> pretty<00:02:45.010> well<00:02:45.130> to<00:02:45.820> reduce

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
and it works pretty well to reduce

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.150 
and it works pretty well to reduce
shakiness<00:02:46.450> as<00:02:46.750> you<00:02:46.930> can<00:02:47.050> see<00:02:47.200> right<00:02:47.560> how<00:02:47.980> many
