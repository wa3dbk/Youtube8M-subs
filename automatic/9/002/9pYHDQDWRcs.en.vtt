00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
gathers fingerprints very very easily if

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.740 
gathers fingerprints very very easily if
they<00:01:44.640> had<00:01:44.729> done<00:01:44.850> more<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.240> matte<00:01:45.450> design

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
they had done more of a matte design

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.020 
they had done more of a matte design
over<00:01:45.990> here<00:01:46.170> like<00:01:46.350> they<00:01:46.500> have<00:01:46.649> here<00:01:47.130> as<00:01:47.700> opposed

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
over here like they have here as opposed

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.539 
over here like they have here as opposed
to<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.240> very<00:01:48.570> glossy<00:01:48.810> finish<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:50.100> think<00:01:50.490> I

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
to this very glossy finish I think I

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.649 
to this very glossy finish I think I
would<00:01:50.700> have<00:01:50.790> liked<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.060> design<00:01:51.240> quite<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.479> bit

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.230 
would have liked the design quite a bit
better<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.950> next<00:01:53.130> category<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.759> pen<00:01:54.060> input

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
better so the next category is pen input

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.999 
better so the next category is pen input
which<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.630> obviously<00:01:55.020> very<00:01:55.110> important<00:01:55.740> seeing

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
which is obviously very important seeing

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.819 
which is obviously very important seeing
it<00:01:56.130> as<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.280> pen<00:01:56.549> tablet<00:01:57.140> so<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.229> pen<00:01:58.439> input<00:01:58.590> is

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
it as a pen tablet so the pen input is

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.130 
it as a pen tablet so the pen input is
amazing<00:01:59.790> we<00:01:59.969> give<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.240> pen<00:02:00.420> input<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.689> 10<00:02:01.020> out

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
amazing we give the pen input a 10 out

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.700 
amazing we give the pen input a 10 out
of<00:02:01.229> 10

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
of 10

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.179 
of 10
pen<00:02:02.340> input<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.759> great<00:02:03.149> you've<00:02:03.420> got<00:02:04.189> 2048

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
pen input is great you've got 2048

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.249 
pen input is great you've got 2048
levels<00:02:05.219> pressure<00:02:05.880> sensitivity<00:02:06.329> which<00:02:07.079> is

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
levels pressure sensitivity which is

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.380 
levels pressure sensitivity which is
great<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:07.770> if<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.009> open<00:02:08.160> up<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.489> GIMP<00:02:08.700> here<00:02:08.970> you

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
great so if I open up the GIMP here you

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.820 
great so if I open up the GIMP here you
can<00:02:09.539> see<00:02:09.690> we<00:02:09.810> can<00:02:09.929> draw<00:02:10.200> with<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.590> pressure

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
can see we can draw with that pressure

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.820 
can see we can draw with that pressure
sensitivity

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
sensitivity

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.580 
sensitivity
can<00:02:12.280> fade<00:02:12.550> it<00:02:12.700> out<00:02:12.850> make<00:02:13.270> it<00:02:13.300> bigger<00:02:13.600> fade<00:02:14.440> it

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
can fade it out make it bigger fade it

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.610 
can fade it out make it bigger fade it
out<00:02:14.740> you<00:02:15.730> also<00:02:15.880> have<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.210> eraser<00:02:16.690> tool<00:02:16.900> on<00:02:17.140> the

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
out you also have the eraser tool on the

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.770 
out you also have the eraser tool on the
back<00:02:17.800> end<00:02:18.040> of<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.310> brush<00:02:18.520> or<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.120> pen<00:02:19.390> rather

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
back end of the brush or the pen rather

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.020 
back end of the brush or the pen rather
and<00:02:20.170> you<00:02:20.950> also<00:02:21.100> have<00:02:21.310> pressure<00:02:21.610> sensitivity

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
and you also have pressure sensitivity

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.250 
and you also have pressure sensitivity
on<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.420> eraser<00:02:22.840> so<00:02:23.770> you<00:02:23.860> can<00:02:24.040> go<00:02:24.280> in<00:02:24.460> and<00:02:25.260> erase

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
on the eraser so you can go in and erase

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.770 
on the eraser so you can go in and erase
things<00:02:26.610> with<00:02:27.610> pressure<00:02:27.910> sensitivity<00:02:28.330> which

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
things with pressure sensitivity which

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.140 
things with pressure sensitivity which
is<00:02:28.900> really<00:02:29.080> nice<00:02:29.170> so<00:02:29.470> we<00:02:30.460> give<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.790> pen<00:02:31.000> input

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
is really nice so we give the pen input

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.330 
is really nice so we give the pen input
a<00:02:31.390> 10<00:02:31.690> out<00:02:31.900> of<00:02:31.930> 10<00:02:32.050> it's<00:02:32.410> really<00:02:32.800> great<00:02:33.010> pen

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
a 10 out of 10 it's really great pen

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.880 
a 10 out of 10 it's really great pen

configuring your tablet it's definitely

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.230

not<00:02:58.840> it's<00:02:59.320> not<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.650> best<00:02:59.980> software<00:03:00.670> I<00:03:00.790> think

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
not it's not the best software I think

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.820 
not it's not the best software I think
the<00:03:01.300> interface<00:03:01.720> could<00:03:01.930> be<00:03:02.080> a<00:03:02.110> little<00:03:02.710> bit

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
the interface could be a little bit

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.560 
the interface could be a little bit
better<00:03:02.980> as<00:03:03.580> you<00:03:03.670> can<00:03:03.790> see<00:03:03.970> here<00:03:04.210> is<00:03:04.300> kind<00:03:04.540> of

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
better as you can see here is kind of

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.900 
better as you can see here is kind of
just<00:03:04.690> a<00:03:04.840> regular<00:03:05.550> interface<00:03:06.550> I<00:03:06.670> think<00:03:06.820> it

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
just a regular interface I think it

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.150 
just a regular interface I think it
could<00:03:07.090> be<00:03:07.180> a<00:03:07.210> little<00:03:07.450> bit<00:03:07.600> a<00:03:07.950> little<00:03:08.950> bit<00:03:09.040> more

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
could be a little bit a little bit more

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.280 
could be a little bit a little bit more
pizzazz<00:03:09.370> to<00:03:09.850> it<00:03:09.880> I<00:03:10.030> think<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:13.540> Intuos<00:03:14.020> 4

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
pizzazz to it I think the the Intuos 4

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.970 
pizzazz to it I think the the Intuos 4
also<00:03:14.590> comes<00:03:14.950> with<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:16.630> Wacom<00:03:17.380> bundled
