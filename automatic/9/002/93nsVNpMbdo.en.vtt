00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
and you know so they they sort of

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.700 
and you know so they they sort of
pattern<00:01:09.130> themselves<00:01:09.520> after<00:01:10.470> people<00:01:11.470> that<00:01:11.620> are

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
pattern themselves after people that are

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.130 
pattern themselves after people that are
more<00:01:11.890> famous<00:01:12.400> than<00:01:12.430> them<00:01:12.880> so<00:01:13.390> they<00:01:13.540> can<00:01:13.570> hop<00:01:13.930> on

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
more famous than them so they can hop on

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.600 
more famous than them so they can hop on
that<00:01:14.290> bandwagon<00:01:14.620> and<00:01:15.130> they're<00:01:15.370> sort<00:01:15.580> of

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
that bandwagon and they're sort of

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.820 
that bandwagon and they're sort of
saying<00:01:15.880> well<00:01:16.330> if<00:01:16.479> they<00:01:16.630> like<00:01:16.870> this<00:01:17.200> then

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
saying well if they like this then

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.000 
saying well if they like this then
they'll<00:01:18.070> like<00:01:18.280> us<00:01:18.780> right<00:01:19.780> and<00:01:20.260> to<00:01:20.620> me<00:01:20.800> that's

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
they'll like us right and to me that's

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.940 
they'll like us right and to me that's
totally<00:01:21.490> the<00:01:21.520> wrong<00:01:22.090> approach<00:01:22.720> they<00:01:23.290> can<00:01:23.530> they

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
totally the wrong approach they can they

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.440 
totally the wrong approach they can they
should<00:01:24.160> say<00:01:24.400> let's<00:01:24.670> try<00:01:24.910> to<00:01:24.970> do<00:01:25.150> something

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
should say let's try to do something

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.050 
should say let's try to do something
that<00:01:25.630> no<00:01:25.960> one's<00:01:26.200> ever<00:01:26.410> heard<00:01:26.680> before<00:01:26.920> and<00:01:27.490> see

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
that no one's ever heard before and see

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.180 
that no one's ever heard before and see
if<00:01:28.180> people<00:01:28.540> like<00:01:28.720> it<00:01:28.780> and<00:01:29.229> a<00:01:29.650> lot<00:01:29.800> of<00:01:29.860> times

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
if people like it and a lot of times

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.150 
if people like it and a lot of times
more<00:01:31.060> people<00:01:31.540> will<00:01:31.720> like<00:01:31.900> that<00:01:31.930> but<00:01:32.680> this<00:01:32.830> is

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
more people will like that but this is

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.999 
more people will like that but this is
different<00:01:33.430> I<00:01:33.910> think<00:01:34.690> people<00:01:34.869> are<00:01:35.320> tired<00:01:35.740> of

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
record and I we can count the solution

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.230 
record and I we can count the solution
you<00:03:30.709> can

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
you can

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.560 
you can
because<00:03:31.750> if<00:03:31.840> it's<00:03:31.990> digital<00:03:32.500> you<00:03:32.680> can<00:03:32.740> steal<00:03:33.220> it

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
because if it's digital you can steal it

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.610 
because if it's digital you can steal it
and<00:03:35.070> it's<00:03:36.070> a<00:03:36.460> lost<00:03:36.760> cause<00:03:37.120> because<00:03:37.960> it's<00:03:38.470> only

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
and it's a lost cause because it's only

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.890 
and it's a lost cause because it's only
going<00:03:38.860> to<00:03:38.920> get<00:03:39.040> worse<00:03:39.280> because<00:03:40.090> there<00:03:40.420> is<00:03:40.570> no

break that code I'll come up with

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.630 
break that code I'll come up with
another<00:03:53.290> code<00:03:53.590> and<00:03:53.890> someone<00:03:54.160> will<00:03:54.310> figure<00:03:54.490> out
