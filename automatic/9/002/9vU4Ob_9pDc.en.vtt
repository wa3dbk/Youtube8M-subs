but<00:00:16.330> all<00:00:16.990> of<00:00:17.350> the<00:00:20.100> lathe<00:00:21.100> chucks<00:00:21.520> that<00:00:21.670> I've

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:21.790 
but all of the lathe chucks that I've

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.940 
but all of the lathe chucks that I've
seen<00:00:22.060> have<00:00:22.390> slight<00:00:22.779> variances<00:00:23.410> depending<00:00:23.830> on

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:23.950 
seen have slight variances depending on

seen have slight variances depending on
where<00:00:24.160> you<00:00:24.340> remount<00:00:25.119> it<00:00:25.360> so<00:00:25.630> when<00:00:25.779> I<00:00:25.810> go<00:00:25.990> to

trucks are numbered that way I you know
don't<00:00:43.630> have<00:00:43.989> a<00:00:44.500> problem<00:00:44.829> with<00:00:44.950> remembering

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
don't have a problem with remembering

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.830 
don't have a problem with remembering
exactly<00:00:45.640> what<00:00:46.090> went<00:00:46.239> on<00:00:46.360> the<00:00:46.450> lathe<00:00:46.600> and<00:00:46.720> I

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
exactly what went on the lathe and I

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.340 
exactly what went on the lathe and I
find<00:00:47.110> it's<00:00:47.290> just<00:00:47.470> a<00:00:47.559> little<00:00:47.770> bit<00:00:47.860> easier

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
find it's just a little bit easier

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.630 
find it's just a little bit easier
anyways<00:00:50.350> that's<00:00:50.559> that<00:00:50.829> you<00:00:51.160> can<00:00:51.340> see<00:00:51.520> it's

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
anyways that's that you can see it's

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.850 
anyways that's that you can see it's
going<00:00:51.760> to<00:00:51.880> need<00:00:51.969> some<00:00:52.149> sanding<00:00:52.540> but<00:00:53.260> generally

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
going to need some sanding but generally

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.290 
going to need some sanding but generally
i'm<00:00:53.980> just<00:00:54.190> practicing<00:00:54.370> right<00:00:54.850> now<00:00:54.880> this<00:00:55.120> isn't

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
i'm just practicing right now this isn't

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.900 
i'm just practicing right now this isn't
anything<00:00:55.660> that's<00:00:55.840> to<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:57.160> vital<00:00:57.460> or<00:00:57.550> serious

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
anything that's to the vital or serious

anything that's to the vital or serious
i'm<00:00:58.059> just<00:00:58.270> figuring<00:00:58.750> out<00:00:59.050> how<00:00:59.620> to<00:00:59.649> use<00:00:59.890> my

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
i'm just figuring out how to use my

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.889 
i'm just figuring out how to use my
hollowing<00:01:00.489> rig<00:01:00.670> and<00:01:00.879> how<00:01:01.510> to<00:01:01.570> do<00:01:01.780> this

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
hollowing rig and how to do this

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:03.750 
hollowing rig and how to do this
hollowing<00:01:02.289> thing<00:01:02.530> they're<00:01:03.280> quite<00:01:03.489> fun

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
hollowing thing they're quite fun

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.510 
hollowing thing they're quite fun
without<00:01:04.750> this<00:01:04.989> big<00:01:05.199> knob<00:01:05.410> on<00:01:05.649> the<00:01:05.680> bottom<00:01:06.130> here

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
without this big knob on the bottom here

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.190 
without this big knob on the bottom here
which<00:01:06.970> because<00:01:07.509> the<00:01:07.600> beast<00:01:07.780> is<00:01:07.869> quite<00:01:08.020> a<00:01:08.050> bit

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
which because the beast is quite a bit

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.570 
which because the beast is quite a bit
longer<00:01:08.350> when<00:01:08.530> I<00:01:08.560> started<00:01:08.979> this<00:01:09.369> would

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
longer when I started this would

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.109 
longer when I started this would
actually<00:01:09.729> be<00:01:09.940> a<00:01:10.060> fairly<00:01:11.880> very<00:01:12.880> lightweight

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
actually be a fairly very lightweight

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.540 
actually be a fairly very lightweight
thing<00:01:13.990> and<00:01:14.259> with<00:01:15.069> them<00:01:15.220> when<00:01:15.310> that<00:01:15.429> gets

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
thing and with them when that gets

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.249 
thing and with them when that gets
parted<00:01:15.970> off<00:01:16.060> there<00:01:16.360> and<00:01:16.479> I<00:01:16.539> and<00:01:16.720> I<00:01:16.780> do<00:01:16.840> that<00:01:17.080> and

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
parted off there and I and I do that and

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.139 
parted off there and I and I do that and
I<00:01:17.319> finish<00:01:17.619> the<00:01:17.740> base<00:01:17.890> on<00:01:18.130> it<00:01:18.280> this<00:01:18.729> whole<00:01:18.910> thing

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
I finish the base on it this whole thing

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:21.210 
I finish the base on it this whole thing
is<00:01:19.179> going<00:01:19.390> to<00:01:19.450> be<00:01:19.600> super<00:01:19.869> light<00:01:20.170> which<00:01:20.410> is<00:01:20.590> one

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
is going to be super light which is one

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.650 
is going to be super light which is one
of<00:01:21.250> the<00:01:21.399> neat<00:01:21.550> things<00:01:21.580> about<00:01:21.970> hollow<00:01:22.300> forms

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
of the neat things about hollow forms

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.359 
of the neat things about hollow forms
that<00:01:22.780> i<00:01:22.810> like<00:01:23.050> is<00:01:23.080> you<00:01:23.830> know<00:01:23.920> you<00:01:24.009> look<00:01:24.130> at<00:01:24.340> it

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
that i like is you know you look at it

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.820 
that i like is you know you look at it
it<00:01:24.700> looks<00:01:24.780> substantial<00:01:25.780> and<00:01:25.899> fairly<00:01:26.590> large

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
it looks substantial and fairly large

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.080 
it looks substantial and fairly large
and<00:01:27.039> then<00:01:27.130> you<00:01:27.190> pick<00:01:27.369> it<00:01:27.490> up<00:01:27.550> and<00:01:27.759> it's<00:01:27.910> like<00:01:28.060> a

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
and then you pick it up and it's like a

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.540 
and then you pick it up and it's like a
balloon<00:01:28.330> almost<00:01:28.899> no<00:01:29.170> it's<00:01:29.349> kind<00:01:29.590> of<00:01:29.619> kind<00:01:30.429> of

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
balloon almost no it's kind of kind of

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.580 
balloon almost no it's kind of kind of
cool<00:01:30.729> i<00:01:30.759> think<00:01:31.090> so<00:01:31.300> and<00:01:31.990> this<00:01:32.289> is<00:01:32.349> a<00:01:32.380> pretty

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
cool i think so and this is a pretty

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.050 
cool i think so and this is a pretty
uninteresting<00:01:32.920> piece<00:01:33.399> of<00:01:33.550> wood<00:01:33.700> it's<00:01:33.880> got<00:01:34.030> a

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
uninteresting piece of wood it's got a

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.620 
uninteresting piece of wood it's got a
few<00:01:34.770> maybe<00:01:35.770> some<00:01:36.160> kind<00:01:36.759> of<00:01:36.880> spalting<00:01:37.479> or

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
few maybe some kind of spalting or

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.240 
few maybe some kind of spalting or
something<00:01:38.110> going<00:01:38.289> on<00:01:38.380> in<00:01:38.590> here<00:01:38.860> and<00:01:39.009> there's<00:01:39.130> a

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
something going on in here and there's a

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.469 
something going on in here and there's a
couple<00:01:39.520> of<00:01:39.700> knots<00:01:39.880> here<00:01:40.149> and<00:01:40.240> there<00:01:40.360> and

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
couple of knots here and there and

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.330 
couple of knots here and there and
there's<00:01:40.660> a<00:01:40.720> little<00:01:40.840> bit<00:01:40.959> of<00:01:41.020> a<00:01:41.200> I<00:01:41.470> know<00:01:42.099> that

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
there's a little bit of a I know that

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.160 
there's a little bit of a I know that
SAP<00:01:42.580> wood<00:01:42.789> or<00:01:42.940> what<00:01:43.060> that<00:01:43.240> is<00:01:43.420> it's<00:01:43.630> just<00:01:43.720> again

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
SAP wood or what that is it's just again

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.050 
SAP wood or what that is it's just again
Co<00:01:44.380> but<00:01:44.740> anyways<00:01:45.280> it's<00:01:45.490> a<00:01:45.640> good<00:01:45.849> to<00:01:45.910> practice

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
Co but anyways it's a good to practice

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.089 
Co but anyways it's a good to practice
on<00:01:46.450> it<00:01:47.349> was<00:01:47.560> free<00:01:47.920> so<00:01:48.280> the<00:01:48.399> price<00:01:48.610> is<00:01:48.640> right<00:01:48.819> and

00:01:50.089 --> 00:01:50.099 
on it was free so the price is right and

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:54.510
