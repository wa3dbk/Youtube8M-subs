scene what has happened is I've gone all
the<00:01:00.629> way<00:01:00.660> up<00:01:00.840> there<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.350> have<00:01:01.820> indeed

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
the way up there and I have indeed

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.090 
the way up there and I have indeed
gotten<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.329> keycard<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:03.960> I've<00:01:04.799> started<00:01:04.979> to

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
gotten the keycard and I've started to

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.950 
gotten the keycard and I've started to
make<00:01:05.610> my<00:01:05.760> way<00:01:05.880> back<00:01:05.909> but<00:01:06.299> unfortunately<00:01:06.869> as

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
make my way back but unfortunately as

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.140 
make my way back but unfortunately as
you<00:01:07.110> can<00:01:07.320> see<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.670> game<00:01:08.880> does<00:01:09.119> not

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
you can see this game does not

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.899 
you can see this game does not
necessarily<00:01:09.689> have<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.049> best<00:01:10.280> map<00:01:11.310> it's<00:01:11.820> a

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
necessarily have the best map it's a

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.460 
necessarily have the best map it's a
Metroidvania<00:01:12.270> game<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:14.450> you<00:01:15.450> know<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:16.229> has

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
Metroidvania game and you know it it has

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.990 
Metroidvania game and you know it it has
a<00:01:16.500> similar<00:01:16.920> map<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.159> those<00:01:17.280> games<00:01:17.520> but<00:01:17.790> it's

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
a similar map to those games but it's

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.880 
a similar map to those games but it's
kind<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.720> difficult<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.229> see<00:01:19.470> which<00:01:19.650> rooms

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
kind of difficult to see which rooms

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.800 
kind of difficult to see which rooms
you've<00:01:20.070> been<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.549> where<00:01:21.270> exactly<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.750> are

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
you've been in and where exactly you are

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.780 
you've been in and where exactly you are
on<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.020> map<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.280> makes<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.670> little

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
on the map so this makes it a little

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.219 
on the map so this makes it a little
difficult<00:01:23.970> when<00:01:24.330> you're<00:01:24.450> backtracking<00:01:24.840> it's

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
difficult when you're backtracking it's

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.440 
difficult when you're backtracking it's
hard<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.530> kind<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.830> know<00:01:26.009> which<00:01:26.880> location<00:01:27.090> to

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
hard to kind of know which location to

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.450 
hard to kind of know which location to
go<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.259> first<00:01:28.470> one<00:01:28.590> we<00:01:28.710> tried<00:01:28.950> happened

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
go to so the first one we tried happened

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.490 
go to so the first one we tried happened
just<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.700> be<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:30.060> area<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:31.140> we<00:01:31.290> went

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
just to be this area that we went

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.350 
just to be this area that we went
through<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.860> get<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.340> keycard<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.180> is

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
through to get the keycard and this is

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.810 
through to get the keycard and this is
um<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:34.350> can't<00:01:34.619> see<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.950> unfortunately<00:01:35.700> now

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
um you can't see it unfortunately now

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
explosive charge at the water pump which

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.840 
explosive charge at the water pump which
broke<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.710> let<00:01:46.829> us<00:01:46.950> kind<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.280> slip<00:01:47.549> through

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
broke it and let us kind of slip through

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
possible way to get out of this little

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.670 
possible way to get out of this little
labyrinth<00:04:14.790> right<00:04:14.940> here<00:04:16.459> and<00:04:17.459> I<00:04:17.599> mean<00:04:18.599> that

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
labyrinth right here and I mean that

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.560 
labyrinth right here and I mean that
literally<00:04:19.680> we<00:04:20.669> spent<00:04:20.909> about<00:04:20.969> probably<00:04:21.479> an

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
literally we spent about probably an

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.330 
literally we spent about probably an
hour<00:04:21.690> at<00:04:21.870> this<00:04:21.959> point<00:04:22.079> trying<00:04:22.979> to<00:04:23.070> figure<00:04:23.310> it

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
hour at this point trying to figure it

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.330 
hour at this point trying to figure it
out<00:04:23.490> and

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
out and

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.510 
out and
to<00:04:25.180> no<00:04:25.300> avail<00:04:25.389> we<00:04:26.230> research<00:04:26.949> into<00:04:27.220> it<00:04:27.310> and<00:04:27.460> we

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
to no avail we research into it and we

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.520 
to no avail we research into it and we
asked<00:04:27.790> around<00:04:27.880> not<00:04:28.419> many<00:04:28.630> not<00:04:28.870> too<00:04:29.410> many

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
asked around not many not too many

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.689 
asked around not many not too many
people<00:04:29.680> play<00:04:29.980> this<00:04:30.100> game<00:04:30.280> so<00:04:30.430> it's<00:04:30.550> a<00:04:30.580> little

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
people play this game so it's a little

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.909 
people play this game so it's a little
more<00:04:30.790> difficult<00:04:31.330> than<00:04:31.389> a<00:04:31.540> major<00:04:31.690> game<00:04:31.960> but<00:04:32.650> not

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
more difficult than a major game but not

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:34.260 
more difficult than a major game but not
quite<00:04:33.160> a<00:04:33.190> few<00:04:33.400> people<00:04:33.699> have<00:04:33.820> experienced<00:04:34.210> the

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
quite a few people have experienced the

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.180 
quite a few people have experienced the
same<00:04:34.419> thing<00:04:34.690> and<00:04:34.960> they're<00:04:35.530> stuck<00:04:35.710> in<00:04:35.830> here<00:04:35.949> and

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
same thing and they're stuck in here and

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.460 
same thing and they're stuck in here and
the<00:04:36.340> only<00:04:36.490> solution<00:04:36.790> to<00:04:37.389> get<00:04:37.930> out<00:04:38.020> of<00:04:38.139> here<00:04:38.290> is

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
the only solution to get out of here is

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.570 
the only solution to get out of here is
to<00:04:38.500> actually<00:04:39.600> delete<00:04:40.600> your<00:04:40.990> game<00:04:41.260> and<00:04:41.919> start

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
to actually delete your game and start

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.760 
to actually delete your game and start
from<00:04:42.820> scratch<00:04:43.120> so<00:04:43.210> this<00:04:43.510> is<00:04:43.660> a<00:04:43.900> indeed<00:04:44.320> a<00:04:44.500> game

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
from scratch so this is a indeed a game

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.320
