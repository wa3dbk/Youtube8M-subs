like<00:02:07.369> I<00:02:07.489> mentioned<00:02:07.909> some<00:02:08.360> of<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.599> capacitors

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
like I mentioned some of the capacitors

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.430 
like I mentioned some of the capacitors
are<00:02:09.590> solid<00:02:10.009> and<00:02:10.870> it<00:02:11.870> has<00:02:11.989> a<00:02:12.020> massive

in<00:02:15.020> there<00:02:15.170> as<00:02:15.260> well<00:02:15.470> so<00:02:15.500> it's<00:02:15.800> really<00:02:16.099> well<00:02:16.250> put

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
in there as well so it's really well put

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.240 
in there as well so it's really well put
together<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:17.090> it's<00:02:18.020> definitely<00:02:18.440> not<00:02:18.740> cheap

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
together and it's definitely not cheap

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.030

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
really on this one and looking at the

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.399 
really on this one and looking at the
legend<00:02:40.909> here<00:02:41.090> on<00:02:41.269> the<00:02:41.420> voltages<00:02:41.900> this<00:02:42.079> is<00:02:42.200> very

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:42.409 
legend here on the voltages this is very

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:44.470 
legend here on the voltages this is very
important<00:02:42.920> of<00:02:43.040> course<00:02:43.069> we've<00:02:43.909> got<00:02:43.939> a<00:02:44.150> single

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
important of course we've got a single

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.099 
important of course we've got a single
12<00:02:44.989> volt<00:02:45.260> rail<00:02:45.579> 70<00:02:46.579> amps<00:02:46.760> on<00:02:47.060> that<00:02:47.239> rail<00:02:47.480> okay

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
12 volt rail 70 amps on that rail okay

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:49.750 
12 volt rail 70 amps on that rail okay
so<00:02:48.170> that's<00:02:48.439> lots<00:02:48.680> of<00:02:48.799> room<00:02:48.980> for<00:02:49.010> expansion<00:02:49.220> you

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
so that's lots of room for expansion you

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.640 
so that's lots of room for expansion you
can<00:02:49.909> start<00:02:50.359> off<00:02:50.510> with<00:02:50.540> a<00:02:50.780> high<00:02:51.260> end<00:02:51.470> machine

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
can start off with a high end machine

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.949 
can start off with a high end machine
with<00:02:52.069> one<00:02:52.310> graphics<00:02:52.760> card<00:02:53.030> later<00:02:53.510> on<00:02:53.719> add

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
with one graphics card later on add

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.110 
with one graphics card later on add
another<00:02:54.290> high<00:02:54.829> end<00:02:55.040> graphics<00:02:55.250> card<00:02:55.790> or<00:02:55.909> maybe

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
another high end graphics card or maybe

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.030 
another high end graphics card or maybe
three<00:02:56.780> graphics<00:02:57.230> cards<00:02:57.530> it<00:02:57.620> doesn't<00:02:57.889> matter

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
three graphics cards it doesn't matter

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.429 
three graphics cards it doesn't matter
this<00:02:58.250> puppy<00:02:58.639> can<00:02:58.670> probably<00:02:59.090> take<00:02:59.510> more<00:03:00.230> than

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:00.439 
this puppy can probably take more than

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:02.020 
this puppy can probably take more than
you<00:03:00.560> think<00:03:00.829> because<00:03:01.280> of<00:03:01.609> its<00:03:01.760> high<00:03:01.970> quality

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
you think because of its high quality

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.629 
you think because of its high quality
components<00:03:03.019> and<00:03:03.139> efficiency<00:03:03.709> looking<00:03:04.400> again

that<00:03:44.629> I<00:03:44.659> got<00:03:44.900> now<00:03:45.409> on<00:03:45.819> regular<00:03:46.819> machine<00:03:47.120> one

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
that I got now on regular machine one

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.689 
that I got now on regular machine one
graphics<00:03:47.989> card<00:03:48.260> 89<00:03:48.709> percent<00:03:49.099> efficiency

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:49.699 
graphics card 89 percent efficiency

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:52.930 
graphics card 89 percent efficiency
around<00:03:49.879> 2<00:03:50.269> to<00:03:50.389> 300<00:03:50.870> watts<00:03:51.159> is<00:03:52.159> the<00:03:52.430> low<00:03:52.579> test

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
around 2 to 300 watts is the low test

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.710 
around 2 to 300 watts is the low test
here<00:03:53.359> and<00:03:53.590> very<00:03:54.590> quiet<00:03:54.979> very<00:03:55.099> cool<00:03:55.549> high<00:03:56.150> load

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
here and very quiet very cool high load

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.199 
here and very quiet very cool high load
test<00:03:56.989> about<00:03:57.229> 750<00:03:58.010> watts<00:03:58.250> and<00:03:58.489> 90%<00:03:58.849> efficiency

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
test about 750 watts and 90% efficiency

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.099 
test about 750 watts and 90% efficiency
so<00:04:00.139> this<00:04:00.319> really<00:04:00.620> runs<00:04:00.979> really<00:04:01.459> high<00:04:02.269> and<00:04:02.629> and

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
so this really runs really high and and

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:04.629 
so this really runs really high and and
it's<00:04:03.530> definitely<00:04:04.010> something<00:04:04.159> that<00:04:04.609> I
