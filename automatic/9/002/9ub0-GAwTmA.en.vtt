00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:01.500 
hi this is Gary Schutt and I'm going to

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.400 
hi this is Gary Schutt and I'm going to
talk<00:00:01.650> to<00:00:01.709> you<00:00:01.860> about<00:00:01.979> tap<00:00:02.639> harmonics<00:00:03.419> tap

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
talk to you about tap harmonics tap

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.930 
talk to you about tap harmonics tap
harmonics<00:00:04.950> and<00:00:05.009> when<00:00:05.130> you<00:00:05.250> take<00:00:05.430> your<00:00:05.460> tapping

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
harmonics and when you take your tapping

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.610 
harmonics and when you take your tapping
finger<00:00:06.240> on<00:00:06.420> your<00:00:06.569> right<00:00:06.720> hand<00:00:07.049> either<00:00:07.319> your

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
finger on your right hand either your

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.190 
finger on your right hand either your

first finger or your middle finger and

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.629 
first finger or your middle finger and
you<00:00:11.010> play<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:12.139> note<00:00:13.139> on<00:00:13.440> your<00:00:13.500> left<00:00:13.769> hand<00:00:14.009> today

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
you play a note on your left hand today

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.970 
you play a note on your left hand today
we're<00:00:14.820> going<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:15.000> use<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.389> C<00:00:15.660> on<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:16.289> fifth

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
we're going to use the C on the fifth

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.260 
we're going to use the C on the fifth
fret<00:00:17.130> g<00:00:17.580> string<00:00:19.189> or<00:00:20.189> take<00:00:20.400> our<00:00:20.550> tapping<00:00:20.939> finger

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
fret g string or take our tapping finger

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.509 
fret g string or take our tapping finger
this<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:21.960> how<00:00:22.109> we<00:00:22.170> tap<00:00:22.500> harmonics<00:00:23.340> it's

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
this is how we tap harmonics it's

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.160 
this is how we tap harmonics it's
different<00:00:23.880> from<00:00:24.000> regular<00:00:24.269> tapping<00:00:24.840> which<00:00:24.990> is

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
different from regular tapping which is

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.070 
different from regular tapping which is
tapping<00:00:25.650> in<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:27.060> middle<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.140> frets<00:00:30.080> to

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
tapping in the middle of of the frets to

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.600 
tapping in the middle of of the frets to
get<00:00:31.260> your<00:00:31.410> note<00:00:31.560> what<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.859> want<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.099> do<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.369> tap

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
get your note what you want to do is tap

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.170 
get your note what you want to do is tap
actually<00:00:33.180> right<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.930> fret<00:00:34.200> but<00:00:34.530> don't

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
actually right on the fret but don't

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.720 
actually right on the fret but don't
don't<00:00:36.180> press<00:00:36.600> on<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.079> threat<00:00:37.610> because<00:00:38.610> you

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
don't press on the threat because you

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.040 
don't press on the threat because you
will<00:00:38.850> bend<00:00:39.030> your<00:00:39.149> notes<00:00:39.329> sharp<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:39.960> will

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
will bend your notes sharp and it will

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.709 
will bend your notes sharp and it will
sound<00:00:40.200> all<00:00:40.500> terrible<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:42.030> want<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.890> lightly

sound all terrible you want to lightly
bounce<00:00:45.719> off<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.230> frets

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
bounce off the frets

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
see if you tap on an e will get an e so

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:10.190 
see if you tap on an e will get an e so
you<00:01:08.290> will<00:01:08.470> get<00:01:08.590> all<00:01:08.799> the<00:01:08.979> harmonic<00:01:09.610> notes<00:01:09.850> of

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
you will get all the harmonic notes of

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.270 
you will get all the harmonic notes of
the<00:01:11.200> major<00:01:11.759> chord<00:01:12.869> when<00:01:13.869> doing<00:01:14.170> you<00:01:15.039> have<00:01:15.159> the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
the major chord when doing you have the

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.830 
the major chord when doing you have the
roof<00:01:15.460> third<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.909> if<00:01:19.390> you<00:01:19.509> know<00:01:19.659> where

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
roof third and if you know where

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.160 
roof third and if you know where
everything<00:01:20.229> is<00:01:21.539> then<00:01:22.539> you<00:01:22.840> can<00:01:22.960> do<00:01:23.050> whatever

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
you want or you can just experiment by

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:33.779 
you want or you can just experiment by
hitting<00:01:26.380> anywhere<00:01:26.740> I<00:01:32.250> hope<00:01:33.250> you<00:01:33.369> come<00:01:33.520> up<00:01:33.670> with

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
hitting anywhere I hope you come up with

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:36.860 
hitting anywhere I hope you come up with
something

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:02:01.280 

you

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.860 

another<00:02:02.290> cool<00:02:02.500> trick<00:02:02.530> is<00:02:02.920> to<00:02:02.950> trill<00:02:03.630> let's<00:02:04.630> say

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
another cool trick is to trill let's say

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.900 
another cool trick is to trill let's say
we're<00:02:05.590> going<00:02:05.710> to<00:02:05.770> use<00:02:05.890> our<00:02:05.980> open<00:02:06.310> g<00:02:06.460> string<00:02:06.490> and

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
we're going to use our open g string and

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.640 
we're going to use our open g string and
the<00:02:07.720> second<00:02:08.080> fret<00:02:08.259> g<00:02:08.830> string<00:02:08.860> a<00:02:10.470> throw<00:02:11.470> that

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
the second fret g string a throw that

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.160 
the second fret g string a throw that
really<00:02:11.860> fast<00:02:12.160> and<00:02:12.460> you<00:02:12.520> take<00:02:12.810> take<00:02:13.810> your<00:02:13.960> tap

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
really fast and you take take your tap

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.920 
really fast and you take take your tap
finger<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:15.160> you're<00:02:15.400> going<00:02:15.580> to<00:02:15.670> just<00:02:16.420> cut

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
finger and you're going to just cut

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.900 
finger and you're going to just cut
lightly<00:02:17.410> rest<00:02:17.680> your<00:02:17.860> finger<00:02:18.010> along<00:02:18.280> that

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
lightly rest your finger along that

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.060 
lightly rest your finger along that
string<00:02:19.390> and<00:02:19.600> move<00:02:20.050> it<00:02:20.170> up<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.410> down<00:02:20.500> between

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
string and move it up and down between

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:30.840 
string and move it up and down between
the<00:02:21.280> pigs<00:02:21.550> and<00:02:28.410> this<00:02:29.410> works<00:02:29.680> basically<00:02:29.950> on<00:02:30.370> any

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
the pigs and this works basically on any

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:39.630 
the pigs and this works basically on any
of<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.060> screen

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.150 

it's<00:02:40.640> a<00:02:40.730> really<00:02:40.849> cool<00:02:41.090> thing

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:55.640 

you

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.709 

you
