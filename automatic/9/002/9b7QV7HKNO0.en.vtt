fiber bezel and it kind of has the this

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.890 
fiber bezel and it kind of has the this
this<00:01:23.250> bezel<00:01:23.640> shape<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:24.030> really<00:01:24.119> signature<00:01:24.720> to

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
this bezel shape is really signature to

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.630 
this bezel shape is really signature to
the<00:01:24.990> brand<00:01:25.229> they<00:01:25.740> like<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.040> call<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.369> square

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
the brand they like to call it a square

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.460 
the brand they like to call it a square
with<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.030> perfect<00:01:27.570> square<00:01:27.720> within<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.110> perfect

with a perfect square within a perfect
circle<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.790> can<00:01:29.939> see<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.119> circular

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
circle and so you can see a circular

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.920 
circle and so you can see a circular
shape<00:01:30.810> but<00:01:31.020> if<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.229> turn<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.979> can<00:01:32.130> see<00:01:32.340> that

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
shape but if I turn it you can see that

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.420 
shape but if I turn it you can see that
little<00:01:33.930> parts<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.680> bezel<00:01:34.860> been<00:01:35.130> shaved

little parts of the bezel been shaved

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.990 
little parts of the bezel been shaved
off<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.850> actually<00:01:36.210> make<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:37.820> square<00:01:38.820> and

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
off to actually make it square and

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.490 
off to actually make it square and
circular<00:01:39.210> at<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.540> same<00:01:39.720> time<00:01:39.960> which<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.229> kind

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
circular at the same time which is kind

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.649 
circular at the same time which is kind
of<00:01:40.619> neat<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:41.070> can<00:01:41.820> kind<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.090> see<00:01:42.299> from<00:01:42.540> this

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
of neat you can kind of see from this

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.649 
of neat you can kind of see from this
angle<00:01:43.049> here<00:01:43.320> as<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.590> rotate<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.479> my<00:01:45.479> only

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
angle here as I rotate it my only

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.539 
angle here as I rotate it my only
concern<00:01:45.990> with<00:01:46.110> this<00:01:46.259> bezel<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.829> its<00:01:46.979> it's<00:01:47.430> not

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
concern with this bezel is its it's not

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.190 
concern with this bezel is its it's not
metal<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.390> seems<00:01:48.659> like<00:01:48.780> it's<00:01:48.930> something

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
metal so it seems like it's something

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.499 
metal so it seems like it's something
that<00:01:49.320> could<00:01:49.500> maybe<00:01:49.680> scuff<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.159> little<00:01:50.399> bit<00:01:50.549> over

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
that could maybe scuff a little bit over

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.440 
that could maybe scuff a little bit over
time<00:01:51.689> I'm<00:01:51.960> not<00:01:52.110> sure<00:01:52.140> how<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:53.009> would<00:01:53.220> hold<00:01:53.399> up<00:01:53.640> I

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
time I'm not sure how it would hold up I

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.440 
time I'm not sure how it would hold up I
don't<00:01:54.689> really<00:01:55.020> know<00:01:55.549> the<00:01:56.549> way<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.880> bezel

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
don't really know the way the bezel

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
actually works is this little device

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.010 
actually works is this little device
here<00:01:59.850> on<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.060> side<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.479> watch<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.930> you

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
here on the side of the watch and you

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.700 
here on the side of the watch and you
just<00:02:01.740> flip<00:02:02.430> this<00:02:02.640> down<00:02:02.939> or<00:02:03.240> put<00:02:04.020> this<00:02:04.200> up<00:02:04.439> and

just flip this down or put this up and

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.010 
just flip this down or put this up and
then<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.610> turn<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.149> that's<00:02:06.360> what<00:02:06.600> rotates

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
then you turn it and that's what rotates

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.759 
then you turn it and that's what rotates
the<00:02:07.200> bezel<00:02:07.530> as<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.220> can<00:02:08.399> see<00:02:08.580> there

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
so definitely a little bit unique not

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.539 
so definitely a little bit unique not
something<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.519> usually<00:02:15.299> see<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:16.430> then<00:02:17.430> you

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
something you usually see and then you

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.550 
something you usually see and then you
just<00:02:17.760> flip<00:02:17.940> it<00:02:18.030> back<00:02:18.209> up<00:02:18.390> when<00:02:18.569> you're<00:02:18.690> done<00:02:18.810> so
