00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:11.320
 perfect body friends we are in the 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:15.309
 section the professional answers and in 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.500
 this case a friend of ours who is in 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.029
 the physical social network sports that you 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.970
 I recommend everything that is not there 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:25.510
 you are registered to be registered by jce 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.820
 look at the physical google esports and os 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.810
 you do 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.000
 an alias that you can ask questions there 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.560
 and ask in my section of 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.870
 training nutrition and so on 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.410
 here we have a 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.579
 to a boy called cross of valley 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.690
 He is a man who gets 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:49.230
 and says 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.170
 says there is a critic who writes to me 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.890
 always tells me that the abs do not 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.469
 they are nothing that people who have 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.539
 pictures on cold tablet tablet 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.219
 marked laterals have no condition 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.219
 pulmonary or cardiovascular 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.630
 and in theory this is an athlete of 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:13.990
 resistance the one who says this says that he 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.990
 dedicates to marathon half races 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.990
 an athlete like me who trains every 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.160
 day and makes half marathons has more 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.200
 pulmonary and cardiovascular condition and 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.950
 one abdominal frame and I have a bit of 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.210
 belly 10 ward then have them 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.130
 abdominals do not have lung condition 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.510
 nor cardiovascular is to say what they are 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.979
 marked enter to mark the 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.619
 abdominal we know that for that there 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.850
 that having little fat have no condition 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.430
 pulmonary or cardiovascular 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.950
 says he gave me so much courage courage that what 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.130
 eliminate the critical guy for his 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.130
 ignorance 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.940
 and for your criticism here to whom 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.940
 we try to be better every day 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.950
 says that bodybuilders have nothing 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.550
 inside the head and even though it's not 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.750
 we are doctors and cross says we are not 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.040
 doctors but we know giving the subject 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.320
 nutrition that any of these 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.120
 academies that say it would be good to know 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.200
 the problem here is the problem that 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:14.240
 there is here is always a problem of 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:18.170
 that is to say 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.940
 the athlete who does not do weights that does not have 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.440
 muscle hypertrophy that has no tone 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.440
 muscular size muscle 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.480
 criticizes the one who has the social 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.060
 marked because they are covered are 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.680
 based on diet based on 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.600
 exercise 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.600
 Obviously the exercise is not done 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.950
 an activity at an average intensity and 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.900
 a prolonged exercise with 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.820
 included cardiovascular 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.390
 will mark the abdominals in a way 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.950
 exaggerated 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.520
 but what is very clear that a 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:53.170
 person that marks abdominals denotes that 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.730
 do healthy diet exercise 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.080
 therefore your fat level is very 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.810
 low 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.610
 usually cholesterol should also be 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.830
 and above all 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.200
 have a good physical thing that does not have 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.420
 the other who criticizes even if he runs like a 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.900
 unstitched by the street or by the mountain 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.730
 eating all 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.650
 and doing half a marathon is leaving the 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:22.049
 175 278 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.720
 I would tell the endurance athlete 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.010
 that criticizes those who have crunches 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.700
 that if you fix the great champions 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.829
 international of its own discipline 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.629
 to see if they mark or not mark abdominals 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.760
 and you will see that everyone is skinned and 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:37.680
 they mark a lot of abs at a 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.900
 thing they mark the endurance athletes 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.819
 are the belly abdominals do not have 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.549
 because it does a lot of work 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:48.040
 cardiovascular although they do weight for 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.650
 so the pulmonary condition 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.760
 and the athletic condition is marked 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.760
 by a low level of fat 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.079
 because it drags the least weight 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.610
 so you can also perform more and 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.920
 make better times 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.950
 that's the logic if you are not able to 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:11.160
 understand that we stay in criticizing the 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.990
 which marks abs because the brand 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.660
 for the simple reason that they mark them 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:18.430
 and because maybe your wife when they see 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.590
 anginas sure the brand 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.000
 and he looks at it in a more appealing way than 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.570
 yourself 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.550
 criticize a good physicist from the 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.550
 perspective that he is not a physicist with 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.150
 good pulmonary or athletic condition nor 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:37.310
 cardiovascular 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.800
 It is a truism one 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.330
 meanness 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.710
 therefore we do not 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.620
 worry about being criticized because 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.479
 abdominal marques 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.080
 because as you very well you say your work 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.479
 it costs you 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.310
 Your diets cost you work 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:53.750
 cardiovascular costs you and apart from 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.000
 nominal is also good good arm 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.610
 back leg and you work all the 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.449
 muscle groups accordingly for 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.360
 improve your appearance 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:04.360
 and your image does not make you a better person 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.910
 but obviously 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:14.150
 makes you the object of criticism of 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:15.889
 those who feel less before your 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.349
 appearance 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:20.180
 It should not bother you, it should feel 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:23.169
 flattered 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.169
 because that shows 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.590
 that uncomfortable 

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:29.660
 there are two options 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.160
 or criticize those who do well 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.130
 things because they have better physique than 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.920
 us because we are unable to 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.270
 get us to do things well and not 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.790
 we have enough will to 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.540
 emulate them 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:46.340
 instead of criticizing them 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.110
 and learn from them 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.560
 and learn with sacrifices along the way 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:53.760
 to get a good physique 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.760
 we follow the program 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.800
 Y 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:30.320
 i 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.110
 do not 

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:43.300
 Y 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.300
 Y 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.610
 agreement
