00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.220 

so<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.210> like<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.510> use<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.750> corner<00:02:21.990> of<00:02:22.140> my

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
so I like to use the corner of my

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:29.780 
so I like to use the corner of my
clipper

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.789 

and<00:02:30.299> just<00:02:30.540> use<00:02:30.720> that<00:02:30.870> corner<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.319> push<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:31.680> in

a<00:02:31.830> little<00:02:31.890> bit

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.369 

and<00:02:36.970> then<00:02:37.090> in<00:02:37.209> most<00:02:37.329> cases<00:02:37.659> you'll<00:02:37.989> be<00:02:38.079> going

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
and then in most cases you'll be going

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:39.720 
and then in most cases you'll be going
back<00:02:38.409> with<00:02:38.590> a<00:02:38.799> straight<00:02:39.069> razor<00:02:39.280> so<00:02:39.489> you're

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
back with a straight razor so you're

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.250 
back with a straight razor so you're
going<00:02:39.849> to<00:02:39.879> sharp<00:02:40.150> it<00:02:40.299> up<00:02:40.390> and<00:02:40.569> even<00:02:40.989> more<00:02:41.170> in

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
going to sharp it up and even more in

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.740 
going to sharp it up and even more in
this<00:02:41.379> case<00:02:41.620> we<00:02:41.829> can't<00:02:42.069> because<00:02:42.400> of<00:02:42.599> we<00:02:43.599> have<00:02:43.720> a

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
this case we can't because of we have a

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.949 
this case we can't because of we have a
sensitive<00:02:44.260> skin<00:02:44.379> issue<00:02:45.209> so<00:02:46.209> and<00:02:46.840> that's

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
sensitive skin issue so and that's

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.089 
sensitive skin issue so and that's
another<00:02:47.200> reason<00:02:47.409> why<00:02:47.590> we<00:02:47.680> want<00:02:47.799> to<00:02:47.829> be<00:02:47.920> careful

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
another reason why we want to be careful

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.510 
another reason why we want to be careful
not<00:02:48.250> to<00:02:48.370> press<00:02:48.549> too<00:02:48.670> hard<00:02:49.030> with<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:49.329> razor
