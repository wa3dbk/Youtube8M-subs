00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
lots of peanuts in it and it's really

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.719 
lots of peanuts in it and it's really
chewy<00:00:40.870> and<00:00:41.199> it's<00:00:41.470> chocolatey<00:00:42.040> it's<00:00:42.400> really

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:42.729 
chewy and it's chocolatey it's really

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:45.000 
chewy and it's chocolatey it's really
good<00:00:42.879> so<00:00:43.659> now<00:00:43.809> you<00:00:43.870> can<00:00:44.140> make<00:00:44.290> your<00:00:44.440> own<00:00:44.470> if<00:00:44.920> you

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
good so now you can make your own if you

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.070 
good so now you can make your own if you
can't<00:00:45.220> find<00:00:45.400> them<00:00:45.549> where<00:00:45.699> you<00:00:45.790> live<00:00:46.000> start<00:00:46.930> off

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.080 
can't find them where you live start off

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.549 
can't find them where you live start off
with<00:00:47.229> a<00:00:47.290> large<00:00:47.559> saucepan<00:00:47.949> add<00:00:48.610> to<00:00:49.330> that<00:00:49.479> 1<00:00:50.229> cup

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
with a large saucepan add to that 1 cup

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.689 
with a large saucepan add to that 1 cup
of<00:00:50.710> corn<00:00:51.430> syrup<00:00:52.110> now<00:00:53.110> you<00:00:53.170> could<00:00:53.440> probably

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
of corn syrup now you could probably

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.430 
of corn syrup now you could probably
substitute<00:00:54.699> honey<00:00:55.119> for<00:00:55.360> this<00:00:55.540> I<00:00:55.809> think<00:00:56.080> the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
substitute honey for this I think the

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.289 
substitute honey for this I think the
end<00:00:56.589> result<00:00:56.860> won't<00:00:57.280> quite<00:00:57.610> taste<00:00:57.879> the<00:00:58.059> same

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:58.299 
end result won't quite taste the same

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:59.789 
end result won't quite taste the same
but<00:00:58.570> I<00:00:58.600> think<00:00:58.869> it<00:00:58.989> could<00:00:59.110> probably<00:00:59.260> a<00:00:59.559> good

00:00:59.789 --> 00:00:59.799 
but I think it could probably a good

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:03.030 
but I think it could probably a good
substitute<00:01:00.600> after<00:01:01.600> that<00:01:01.750> 1<00:01:02.080> cup<00:01:02.439> of<00:01:02.470> peanut

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
substitute after that 1 cup of peanut

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.160 
substitute after that 1 cup of peanut
butter<00:01:03.159> all<00:01:03.760> i<00:01:04.030> had<00:01:04.390> was<00:01:04.600> smooth<00:01:04.900> peanut

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
butter all i had was smooth peanut

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.660 
butter all i had was smooth peanut
butter<00:01:05.379> in<00:01:05.500> the<00:01:05.590> house<00:01:05.740> but<00:01:05.950> I<00:01:06.010> think<00:01:06.280> chunky

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
butter in the house but I think chunky

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.660 
butter in the house but I think chunky
would<00:01:06.820> be<00:01:06.939> even<00:01:07.270> better<00:01:07.450> and<00:01:07.740> then<00:01:08.740> 1<00:01:09.159> cup<00:01:09.460> of

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
would be even better and then 1 cup of

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.889 
would be even better and then 1 cup of
brown<00:01:10.210> sugar<00:01:10.270> and<00:01:10.990> I'm<00:01:11.979> also<00:01:12.159> adding<00:01:12.600> 1/2<00:01:13.600> cup

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
brown sugar and I'm also adding 1/2 cup

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:16.679 
brown sugar and I'm also adding 1/2 cup
of<00:01:14.049> unsweetened<00:01:14.530> cocoa<00:01:15.219> now<00:01:16.210> stir<00:01:16.509> those

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
of unsweetened cocoa now stir those

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:18.779 
of unsweetened cocoa now stir those
things<00:01:17.020> together<00:01:17.229> over<00:01:17.920> low<00:01:18.159> heat<00:01:18.189> and

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:18.789 
things together over low heat and

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:22.050 
things together over low heat and
continue<00:01:19.630> to<00:01:19.750> stir<00:01:20.049> until<00:01:20.380> it's<00:01:21.280> all<00:01:21.490> combined

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
continue to stir until it's all combined

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.480 
continue to stir until it's all combined
and<00:01:22.359> it<00:01:22.780> starts<00:01:23.109> to<00:01:23.289> melt<00:01:23.439> a<00:01:23.649> little<00:01:23.770> bit<00:01:23.979> so

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
and it starts to melt a little bit so

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.760 
and it starts to melt a little bit so
you<00:01:24.579> can<00:01:24.700> see<00:01:24.880> here<00:01:25.119> it's<00:01:25.240> a<00:01:25.359> little<00:01:25.390> bit<00:01:26.020> thick

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
you can see here it's a little bit thick

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.760 
you can see here it's a little bit thick
on<00:01:27.100> the<00:01:27.130> thick<00:01:27.429> side<00:01:27.600> but<00:01:28.600> as<00:01:28.810> it<00:01:29.259> heats<00:01:29.469> up<00:01:29.710> it

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
on the thick side but as it heats up it

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.649 
on the thick side but as it heats up it
will<00:01:30.340> get<00:01:30.820> a<00:01:30.850> little<00:01:31.270> bit<00:01:31.570> thinner<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:34.509> can

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
will get a little bit thinner you can

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.719 
will get a little bit thinner you can
see<00:01:34.840> it's<00:01:34.960> a<00:01:35.049> bit<00:01:35.289> smoother<00:01:35.979> and<00:01:36.249> a<00:01:36.340> little<00:01:36.609> bit

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
see it's a bit smoother and a little bit

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.580 
see it's a bit smoother and a little bit
thinner<00:01:36.969> you<00:01:37.780> don't<00:01:37.960> have<00:01:38.109> to<00:01:38.200> heat<00:01:38.319> it<00:01:38.380> for

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
thinner you don't have to heat it for

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.020 
thinner you don't have to heat it for
very<00:01:38.740> long<00:01:38.950> you<00:01:39.009> do<00:01:39.310> not<00:01:39.429> want<00:01:39.700> to<00:01:39.789> bring<00:01:39.909> this

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
very long you do not want to bring this

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.690 
very long you do not want to bring this
to<00:01:40.090> a<00:01:40.240> boil<00:01:40.479> it's<00:01:40.749> not<00:01:40.899> necessary<00:01:41.530> then<00:01:42.219> add<00:01:42.429> 1

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700

bar is actually quite thin and then

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.309 
bar is actually quite thin and then
you're<00:02:34.150> just<00:02:34.269> gonna<00:02:34.480> let<00:02:34.689> it<00:02:34.720> stand<00:02:35.019> in<00:02:35.260> the

refrigerator until it's hard enough to
cut<00:02:37.569> into<00:02:37.810> squares<00:02:37.930> and<00:02:38.670> there<00:02:39.670> is<00:02:39.909> the

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
cut into squares and there is the

see<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:44.049> texture<00:02:44.590> is<00:02:44.739> actually<00:02:45.250> quite

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
see the texture is actually quite

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.520 
see the texture is actually quite
similar<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:46.450> commercially<00:02:47.019> made<00:02:47.170> bars

similar to the commercially made bars

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.220 
similar to the commercially made bars
the<00:02:48.340> only<00:02:48.519> big<00:02:48.700> difference<00:02:48.730> is<00:02:49.390> that<00:02:49.629> there<00:02:50.079> is

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
the only big difference is that there is

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.199 
the only big difference is that there is
some<00:02:50.709> cereal<00:02:51.220> in<00:02:51.310> there<00:02:51.519> so<00:02:51.760> they're<00:02:51.939> a<00:02:51.970> little

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
some cereal in there so they're a little

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.720 
some cereal in there so they're a little
bit<00:02:52.569> crunchy<00:02:52.930> er<00:02:53.260> than<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:53.950> commercially

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730
