00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
and I'm just taking the colors that I

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.140 
and I'm just taking the colors that I
hold<00:02:15.989> up<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.379> working<00:02:17.280> these<00:02:17.400> in<00:02:17.700> my<00:02:17.849> crease

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
hold up and working these in my crease

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.759 
hold up and working these in my crease
and<00:02:18.420> you<00:02:18.510> can<00:02:18.660> see<00:02:18.840> I'm<00:02:18.959> buffing<00:02:19.349> this<00:02:19.470> one<00:02:19.650> in

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
and you can see I'm buffing this one in

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.039 
and you can see I'm buffing this one in
the<00:02:19.860> upward<00:02:20.220> motion<00:02:20.640> also<00:02:21.299> in<00:02:21.450> circular

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
the upward motion also in circular

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.050 
the upward motion also in circular
motions<00:02:22.470> as<00:02:22.650> well<00:02:22.860> this<00:02:23.400> will<00:02:23.580> just<00:02:23.670> help<00:02:23.790> it

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
motions as well this will just help it

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.820 
motions as well this will just help it
blend<00:02:24.180> seamlessly<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:25.140> ice<00:02:25.290> cream<00:02:25.590> color

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
blend seamlessly to ice cream color

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.650 
blend seamlessly to ice cream color
which<00:02:26.400> is<00:02:26.580> what<00:02:26.700> we<00:02:26.819> always<00:02:27.000> wanted<00:02:27.180> an<00:02:27.569> eye

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
which is what we always wanted an eye

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.720 
which is what we always wanted an eye
looks<00:02:27.930> of<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.260> it's<00:02:28.379> blended<00:02:28.830> would<00:02:29.459> quickly

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
looks of it it's blended would quickly

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.600 
looks of it it's blended would quickly
and<00:02:30.349> then<00:02:31.349> I<00:02:31.379> just<00:02:31.680> take<00:02:31.860> a<00:02:31.890> clean<00:02:32.250> blending

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
and then I just take a clean blending

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.420 
and then I just take a clean blending
brush<00:02:32.879> as<00:02:33.510> well<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.319> just<00:02:34.799> blend<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.310> edges

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
brush as well and just blend the edges

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.150 
brush as well and just blend the edges
just<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:36.150> make<00:02:36.329> sure<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:36.930> does<00:02:37.530> disappear<00:02:38.069> into

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
just to make sure it does disappear into

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.640 
just to make sure it does disappear into
nothing<00:02:38.549> and<00:02:38.610> there<00:02:38.790> are<00:02:38.880> no<00:02:39.030> harsh<00:02:39.329> lines

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
nothing and there are no harsh lines

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.710 
nothing and there are no harsh lines
then<00:02:40.650> I<00:02:40.920> go<00:02:41.130> in<00:02:41.190> with<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.610> next<00:02:41.940> darker<00:02:42.420> shade

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
then I go in with the next darker shade

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.020 
then I go in with the next darker shade
and<00:02:43.200> I<00:02:43.950> start<00:02:44.220> working<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.640> in<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.819> crease

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
and I start working that in the crease

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.100 
and I start working that in the crease
but<00:02:45.209> here<00:02:45.450> you<00:02:45.599> can<00:02:45.750> see<00:02:45.870> I'm<00:02:45.959> actually

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
but here you can see I'm actually

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.860 
but here you can see I'm actually
flicking<00:02:46.709> it<00:02:46.829> typed<00:02:47.069> on<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.549> end<00:02:47.700> nothing<00:02:48.660> too

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
flicking it typed on the end nothing too

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.650 
flicking it typed on the end nothing too
drastic<00:02:49.140> but<00:02:49.680> this<00:02:50.160> will<00:02:50.370> look<00:02:50.489> perfect<00:02:50.849> with

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
drastic but this will look perfect with

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.910 
drastic but this will look perfect with
our<00:02:52.019> wind<00:02:52.799> liner<00:02:53.489> as<00:02:53.940> well<00:02:54.329> so<00:02:55.260> it<00:02:55.620> kind<00:02:55.860> of

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
our wind liner as well so it kind of

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.309 
our wind liner as well so it kind of
just<00:02:56.099> all<00:02:56.340> flows<00:02:56.760> into<00:02:57.030> one<00:02:57.360> upward<00:02:57.900> motion

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
just all flows into one upward motion

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.080 
just all flows into one upward motion
which<00:02:58.440> is<00:02:58.470> great<00:02:58.920> for<00:02:58.950> creating<00:02:59.370> almond

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
which is great for creating almond

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.270 
which is great for creating almond
shaped<00:03:00.299> eyes<00:03:00.420> especially<00:03:01.260> if<00:03:01.739> you<00:03:01.860> have<00:03:01.890> round

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
shaped eyes especially if you have round

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.339 
shaped eyes especially if you have round
eyes<00:03:02.459> like<00:03:02.730> myself<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.750> then<00:03:03.989> we're<00:03:04.140> doing

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
eyes like myself and then we're doing

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.259 
eyes like myself and then we're doing
the<00:03:04.440> same<00:03:04.650> blend<00:03:05.069> in<00:03:05.250> circular<00:03:05.700> motions<00:03:06.060> and

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
the same blend in circular motions and

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.390 
the same blend in circular motions and
dragging<00:03:06.630> that<00:03:06.750> upwards<00:03:07.260> definitely<00:03:08.220> not

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
dragging that upwards definitely not

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.849 
dragging that upwards definitely not
down<00:03:08.430> onto<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.090> lid<00:03:09.299> then<00:03:10.049> taking<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.680> last

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
down onto the lid then taking the last

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.280 
down onto the lid then taking the last
darkest<00:03:11.489> brown<00:03:11.910> we<00:03:12.180> are<00:03:12.329> just<00:03:12.540> repeating<00:03:12.750> the

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
darkest brown we are just repeating the

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.500 
darkest brown we are just repeating the
same<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:14.010> again<00:03:14.549> with<00:03:14.730> that<00:03:14.760> flick<00:03:15.150> out<00:03:15.299> as

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
same and again with that flick out as

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.740 
same and again with that flick out as
well<00:03:15.780> but<00:03:16.500> remember<00:03:17.220> that<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.519> blending<00:03:18.480> it

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
well but remember that the blending it

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.240 
well but remember that the blending it
can<00:03:19.049> take<00:03:19.380> some<00:03:19.769> time<00:03:20.130> so<00:03:20.540> be<00:03:21.540> patient<00:03:22.410> to<00:03:23.069> be

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
can take some time so be patient to be

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.309 
can take some time so be patient to be
be<00:03:23.700> be<00:03:24.090> patient<00:03:24.599> and<00:03:26.480> stick<00:03:27.480> to<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.930> blending

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
be be patient and stick to the blending

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:29.509 
be be patient and stick to the blending
and<00:03:28.440> again<00:03:28.709> keep<00:03:28.980> blending<00:03:29.190> it<00:03:29.430> upwards

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
and again keep blending it upwards

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.479 
and again keep blending it upwards
rather<00:03:30.120> than<00:03:30.389> downwards<00:03:30.959> and<00:03:31.230> then<00:03:31.980> to<00:03:32.310> finish

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
rather than downwards and then to finish

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.509 
rather than downwards and then to finish
it<00:03:32.669> we<00:03:33.150> what<00:03:33.930> after<00:03:34.349> sort<00:03:34.859> of<00:03:34.919> applying<00:03:35.250> layers

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
it we what after sort of applying layers

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.490 
it we what after sort of applying layers
of<00:03:35.790> this<00:03:35.910> /<00:03:36.150> getting<00:03:36.540> it<00:03:36.660> to<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.900> intensity<00:03:37.290> we

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
of this / getting it to the intensity we

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.159 
of this / getting it to the intensity we
want<00:03:37.769> and<00:03:38.069> then<00:03:38.669> blending<00:03:39.150> we<00:03:39.419> will<00:03:39.630> add<00:03:39.870> a

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
want and then blending we will add a

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:43.940 
want and then blending we will add a
black<00:03:40.919> to<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.430> mix<00:03:41.669> but<00:03:42.180> a<00:03:42.389> tiny<00:03:43.230> bit<00:03:43.590> of<00:03:43.739> black

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
black to the mix but a tiny bit of black

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.640 
black to the mix but a tiny bit of black
just<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.660> deepen<00:03:45.660> it<00:03:45.750> up<00:03:45.959> a<00:03:45.989> little<00:03:46.200> bit<00:03:46.410> but

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
just to deepen it up a little bit but

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.339 
just to deepen it up a little bit but
nothing<00:03:46.769> too<00:03:47.220> drastic<00:03:48.169> basically<00:03:49.169> we're

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
nothing too drastic basically we're

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.490 
nothing too drastic basically we're
trying<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.680> create<00:03:49.980> a<00:03:50.069> cut<00:03:50.400> crease<00:03:50.569> but<00:03:51.569> we

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
trying to create a cut crease but we

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.750 
trying to create a cut crease but we
still<00:03:52.739> want<00:03:52.859> it<00:03:53.010> to<00:03:53.160> be<00:03:53.250> nicely<00:03:53.489> blended

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
still want it to be nicely blended

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
still want it to be nicely blended
nothing<00:03:54.480> too<00:03:54.720> harsh<00:03:55.169> and<00:03:56.090> then<00:03:57.090> guess<00:03:57.720> what

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
nothing too harsh and then guess what

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:58.849 
nothing too harsh and then guess what
you're<00:03:57.959> going<00:03:58.079> to<00:03:58.139> do<00:03:58.260> after<00:03:58.410> you<00:03:58.620> put<00:03:58.829> the

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
you're going to do after you put the

00:03:58.859 --> 00:03:59.960 
you're going to do after you put the
black<00:03:59.099> in<00:03:59.280> there

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
black in there

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:08.540 
black in there
you<00:04:00.540> got<00:04:00.840> it<00:04:01.430> yeah<00:04:02.430> baby<00:04:02.700> you<00:04:03.420> got<00:04:03.870> it<00:04:07.550> just

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
you got it yeah baby you got it just

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:09.950 
you got it yeah baby you got it just
keep<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:08.850> night<00:04:09.090> actually<00:04:09.540> took<00:04:09.660> a<00:04:09.780> little

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960 
keep the night actually took a little
