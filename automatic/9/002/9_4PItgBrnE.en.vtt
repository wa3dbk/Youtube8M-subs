00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.770 
motor and they did something with the
shaft<00:02:22.120> so<00:02:22.330> I<00:02:22.360> guess<00:02:22.600> to<00:02:22.959> make<00:02:23.050> them<00:02:23.230> better<00:02:24.780> the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
shaft so I guess to make them better the

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.470 
shaft so I guess to make them better the
servo<00:02:26.260> that<00:02:26.680> came<00:02:26.860> in<00:02:27.040> this<00:02:27.160> truck<00:02:27.480> was

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
servo that came in this truck was

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.680 
servo that came in this truck was
complete<00:02:28.900> crap<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.500> do<00:02:29.620> not<00:02:29.950> like<00:02:30.130> it<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:31.480> West

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
complete crap I do not like it the West

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.100 
complete crap I do not like it the West
plastic<00:02:32.140> gears<00:02:32.520> it<00:02:33.520> did<00:02:33.820> break<00:02:34.120> very<00:02:34.480> easily<00:02:34.570> I

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
plastic gears it did break very easily I

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.640 
plastic gears it did break very easily I
do<00:02:35.320> have<00:02:35.620> a<00:02:35.680> low<00:02:35.890> c<00:02:36.100> in<00:02:36.190> there<00:02:36.310> now<00:02:36.489> but<00:02:37.480> this<00:02:38.440> is

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
do have a low c in there now but this is

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.140 
do have a low c in there now but this is
the<00:02:38.830> spectrum<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:39.550> i'll<00:02:39.820> probably<00:02:40.000> be

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
the spectrum that i'll probably be

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.449 
the spectrum that i'll probably be
putting<00:02:40.450> it<00:02:40.570> soon<00:02:40.989> but<00:02:41.830> this<00:02:41.980> one<00:02:42.190> here<00:02:42.430> was

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
putting it soon but this one here was

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.270 
putting it soon but this one here was
actually<00:02:42.730> broke<00:02:43.470> that<00:02:44.470> I<00:02:44.500> was<00:02:44.709> Brandon<00:02:44.980> we

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
the shock oil i do run is the losi it is

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.380 
the shock oil i do run is the losi it is
the<00:03:06.060> 60<00:03:07.060> weight<00:03:07.209> in<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.510> front<00:03:09.150> 60<00:03:10.150> weight<00:03:10.269> in

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
the 60 weight in the front 60 weight in

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.380 
the 60 weight in the front 60 weight in
the<00:03:10.450> front<00:03:10.480> and<00:03:10.959> then<00:03:11.860> it<00:03:12.100> is<00:03:12.280> that<00:03:12.580> they<00:03:13.030> the

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
50 weight in the rears um that's just

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.509 
50 weight in the rears um that's just
something<00:03:19.570> you<00:03:19.920> guys<00:03:20.920> wanted<00:03:21.190> to<00:03:21.250> know<00:03:21.370> the

creations<00:03:41.220> Sidewinder<00:03:42.220> SCT<00:03:42.930> um<00:03:44.670> it's<00:03:45.670> got

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
creations Sidewinder SCT um it's got

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.680 
creations Sidewinder SCT um it's got
some<00:03:46.000> power<00:03:46.890> and<00:03:47.890> I<00:03:48.730> mean<00:03:48.970> two<00:03:49.120> wheel<00:03:49.269> drive<00:03:49.299> I

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
some power and I mean two wheel drive I

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.080 
some power and I mean two wheel drive I
get<00:03:50.680> a<00:03:50.799> pop<00:03:51.040> wheelies<00:03:51.400> all<00:03:51.610> day<00:03:51.760> long<00:03:52.650> but<00:03:53.650> um

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
get a pop wheelies all day long but um

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.060 
get a pop wheelies all day long but um
it<00:03:55.090> if<00:03:55.420> you're<00:03:55.870> into<00:03:56.230> like<00:03:56.410> the<00:03:56.560> tracks<00:03:56.860> and

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
it if you're into like the tracks and

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.340 
it if you're into like the tracks and
all<00:03:57.160> that<00:03:57.370> in<00:03:57.549> my<00:03:57.850> opinion<00:03:58.150> the<00:03:58.390> way<00:03:58.690> I<00:03:58.720> have<00:03:59.170> it

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
all that in my opinion the way I have it

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.100 
all that in my opinion the way I have it
all<00:03:59.500> I<00:03:59.560> and<00:04:00.070> set<00:04:00.250> up<00:04:00.370> it<00:04:00.549> jumps<00:04:02.130> amazingly<00:04:03.130> i

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
all I and set up it jumps amazingly i

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.140 
all I and set up it jumps amazingly i
mean<00:04:05.110> like<00:04:05.290> you<00:04:05.380> really<00:04:05.590> have<00:04:05.769> to<00:04:06.120> do<00:04:07.120> anything

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
mean like you really have to do anything

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.449 
mean like you really have to do anything
to<00:04:07.660> it<00:04:07.690> just<00:04:07.959> go<00:04:08.170> full<00:04:08.470> speed<00:04:08.620> way<00:04:08.980> into<00:04:09.220> a<00:04:09.250> full

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
to it just go full speed way into a full

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.610 
to it just go full speed way into a full
speed<00:04:09.700> but<00:04:10.299> I<00:04:10.540> went<00:04:10.720> full<00:04:10.959> speed<00:04:11.080> and<00:04:11.319> I<00:04:11.410> think

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
speed but I went full speed and I think

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.830 
speed but I went full speed and I think
I<00:04:11.709> landed<00:04:12.129> like<00:04:12.910> 60<00:04:13.840> feet

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
I landed like 60 feet

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.379 
I landed like 60 feet
in<00:04:15.019> in<00:04:15.769> the<00:04:16.010> distance<00:04:16.400> I<00:04:16.609> think<00:04:16.970> I<00:04:17.060> was<00:04:17.209> only

in in the distance I think I was only
maybe<00:04:17.510> 45<00:04:18.410> feet<00:04:18.590> high<00:04:18.669> but<00:04:19.669> I<00:04:20.209> didn't<00:04:20.660> break

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
maybe 45 feet high but I didn't break

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.210 
maybe 45 feet high but I didn't break
anything<00:04:21.049> I<00:04:21.320> didn't<00:04:21.560> blow<00:04:21.709> out<00:04:21.859> of<00:04:21.949> shock<00:04:22.190> I

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
buckle is my shafts in just the

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.379 
buckle is my shafts in just the
brushless<00:04:32.810> system<00:04:33.169> oh<00:04:33.699> and<00:04:34.699> my<00:04:34.850> tires<00:04:35.210> and

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
it about that truck it's a very good

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:55.600 
it about that truck it's a very good
truck<00:04:49.010> and<00:04:50.169> then<00:04:51.169> I<00:04:52.990> really<00:04:53.990> like<00:04:54.139> sorry<00:04:54.950> as<00:04:55.370> I

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
picked it up which was a couple years

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.050 
picked it up which was a couple years
ago<00:05:03.410> now<00:05:03.620> i'm<00:05:03.889> sorry<00:05:04.130> it<00:05:04.220> was<00:05:04.370> like<00:05:04.490> maybe<00:05:04.790> last

ago now i'm sorry it was like maybe last

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.300 
ago now i'm sorry it was like maybe last
year<00:05:05.240> or<00:05:05.510> so<00:05:05.540> i<00:05:05.870> picked<00:05:06.530> it<00:05:06.650> up<00:05:06.800> and<00:05:07.010> it<00:05:07.100> was

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
year or so i picked it up and it was

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.620 
year or so i picked it up and it was
about<00:05:07.669> to<00:05:08.380> 22<00:05:09.380> 10<00:05:09.970> that's<00:05:10.970> much<00:05:11.210> as<00:05:11.330> I<00:05:11.419> paid<00:05:11.600> for
