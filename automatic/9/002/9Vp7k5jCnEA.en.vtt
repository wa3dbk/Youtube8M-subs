00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
palette on this it's just very annoying

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.250 
palette on this it's just very annoying
but<00:04:43.919> I<00:04:44.220> can't<00:04:44.639> really<00:04:44.790> complain<00:04:45.240> because<00:04:45.600> this

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
but I can't really complain because this

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.020 
but I can't really complain because this
doesn't<00:04:46.620> really<00:04:47.010> have<00:04:47.250> to<00:04:47.430> be<00:04:47.580> in<00:04:47.669> the<00:04:47.820> game

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
doesn't really have to be in the game

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.000 
doesn't really have to be in the game
they<00:04:48.270> could<00:04:48.450> have<00:04:48.540> just<00:04:48.720> left<00:04:49.320> this<00:04:49.620> alone

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
they could have just left this alone

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.340 
they could have just left this alone
though<00:04:50.400> if<00:04:50.700> they<00:04:51.210> did<00:04:51.480> leave<00:04:51.810> it<00:04:51.990> alone<00:04:52.080> they

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
though if they did leave it alone they

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.110 
though if they did leave it alone they
could<00:04:52.560> have<00:04:52.680> added<00:04:52.860> more<00:04:53.160> mansions<00:04:53.760> but<00:04:54.030> at

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
could have added more mansions but at

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.420 
could have added more mansions but at
the<00:04:54.240> same<00:04:54.419> time<00:04:54.720> who<00:04:55.020> cares<00:04:55.350> multiplayer<00:04:56.190> will

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
the same time who cares multiplayer will

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.750 
the same time who cares multiplayer will
make<00:04:57.120> the<00:04:57.270> game<00:04:57.450> last<00:04:57.690> even<00:04:58.290> longer<00:04:58.320> than<00:04:59.010> just

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
make the game last even longer than just

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.530 
make the game last even longer than just
one<00:05:00.300> adventure<00:05:00.660> or<00:05:01.200> a<00:05:01.560> few<00:05:02.400> playthroughs<00:05:03.060> to

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
one adventure or a few playthroughs to

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.560 
one adventure or a few playthroughs to
get<00:05:03.750> a<00:05:03.960> hundred<00:05:04.200> percent<00:05:04.380> on<00:05:04.800> the<00:05:04.919> game<00:05:05.160> so<00:05:06.090> I

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
get a hundred percent on the game so I

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.440 
get a hundred percent on the game so I
guess<00:05:07.200> I<00:05:07.380> can't<00:05:07.650> replace<00:05:07.979> really<00:05:08.820> complained

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
guess I can't replace really complained

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.469 
guess I can't replace really complained
but<00:05:09.690> I<00:05:10.130> did<00:05:11.130> have<00:05:11.520> thoughts<00:05:12.330> about

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
but I did have thoughts about

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.240 
but I did have thoughts about
multiplayer<00:05:13.050> but<00:05:13.380> I<00:05:13.440> never<00:05:13.710> thought<00:05:14.010> it<00:05:14.160> would

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
multiplayer but I never thought it would

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.670 
multiplayer but I never thought it would
happen<00:05:14.310> and<00:05:14.940> I<00:05:15.419> made<00:05:15.660> my<00:05:15.870> own<00:05:15.900> list<00:05:16.320> of<00:05:16.530> things

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:51.260 
know but we do need to see a little bit
more<00:06:49.650> mansions<00:06:50.190> I've<00:06:50.400> said<00:06:50.669> that<00:06:50.819> in<00:06:50.970> my<00:06:51.060> last

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:51.270 
more mansions I've said that in my last

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:54.110 
more mansions I've said that in my last
updates<00:06:51.810> we<00:06:52.050> need<00:06:52.229> to<00:06:52.349> see<00:06:52.500> more<00:06:52.800> levels<00:06:53.250> and<00:06:53.430> a

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 
updates we need to see more levels and a

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.170 
updates we need to see more levels and a
little<00:06:55.110> bit<00:06:55.259> more<00:06:55.530> about<00:06:55.770> the<00:06:56.009> story<00:06:56.340> not<00:06:56.879> the

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 
little bit more about the story not the

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.740 
little bit more about the story not the
but<00:06:57.690> this<00:06:57.900> is<00:06:58.139> like<00:06:58.560> a<00:06:58.770> mario<00:06:59.159> game<00:06:59.220> or<00:07:00.030> a<00:07:00.090> luigi

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:00.750 
but this is like a mario game or a luigi

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.659 
but this is like a mario game or a luigi
game<00:07:01.110> so<00:07:01.319> story<00:07:01.680> doesn't<00:07:01.919> really<00:07:02.159> matter<00:07:02.520> much

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:02.669 
game so story doesn't really matter much

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:05.240 
game so story doesn't really matter much
but<00:07:03.120> I<00:07:03.360> would<00:07:04.050> very<00:07:04.289> much<00:07:04.379> like<00:07:04.800> to<00:07:04.860> know<00:07:05.039> a

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:05.250 
but I would very much like to know a

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:08.800 
but I would very much like to know a
little<00:07:05.490> bit<00:07:05.940> more<00:07:06.180> about<00:07:06.240> the<00:07:06.960> game<00:07:07.740> overall

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:08.810 
little bit more about the game overall

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.089 
little bit more about the game overall
then<00:07:09.810> some<00:07:10.379> of<00:07:10.409> the<00:07:10.530> stuff<00:07:10.710> they<00:07:10.830> have<00:07:10.919> been

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:11.099 
then some of the stuff they have been

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:14.330 
then some of the stuff they have been
showing<00:07:11.460> but<00:07:11.729> so<00:07:12.210> far<00:07:12.500> multiplayer<00:07:13.500> will<00:07:13.770> hold

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:14.340 
showing but so far multiplayer will hold

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.149 
showing but so far multiplayer will hold
us<00:07:14.520> all<00:07:14.789> over<00:07:14.819> for<00:07:15.479> a<00:07:16.050> long<00:07:16.229> time<00:07:16.590> and<00:07:16.620> I'm<00:07:16.889> sure

00:07:17.149 --> 00:07:17.159 
us all over for a long time and I'm sure

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:19.939 
us all over for a long time and I'm sure
it<00:07:17.430> will<00:07:17.550> increase<00:07:17.940> the<00:07:18.240> longevity<00:07:18.720> of<00:07:19.259> the

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:19.949 
it will increase the longevity of the

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:24.379 
it will increase the longevity of the
game<00:07:21.560> vastly<00:07:22.560> from<00:07:22.919> just<00:07:23.370> the<00:07:23.580> adventure<00:07:24.180> and

00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:24.389 
game vastly from just the adventure and

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:27.550 
game vastly from just the adventure and
going<00:07:24.990> through<00:07:25.229> for<00:07:25.530> maybe<00:07:26.250> one<00:07:26.580> or<00:07:26.729> two<00:07:26.759> more

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:27.560 
going through for maybe one or two more

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.809 
going through for maybe one or two more
playthroughs<00:07:28.560> to<00:07:28.830> get<00:07:28.949> a<00:07:28.979> hundred<00:07:29.190> percent<00:07:29.340> in

00:07:29.809 --> 00:07:29.819 
playthroughs to get a hundred percent in

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:32.620 
playthroughs to get a hundred percent in
the<00:07:29.909> game<00:07:30.120> so<00:07:30.720> those<00:07:31.080> are<00:07:31.229> my<00:07:31.289> thoughts<00:07:31.560> guys
