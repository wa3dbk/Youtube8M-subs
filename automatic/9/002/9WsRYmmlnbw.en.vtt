when<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.699> first<00:00:59.969> came<00:01:00.210> in<00:01:00.359> here<00:01:00.480> how<00:01:00.600> much

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
when you first came in here how much

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.330 
when you first came in here how much
worried<00:01:01.050> about<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.500> bend<00:01:01.710> your<00:01:01.890> knee<00:01:02.070> before

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
worried about to bend your knee before

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.729 
worried about to bend your knee before
we<00:01:02.579> started<00:01:02.910> treatment<00:01:03.449> about<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.899> photo<00:01:04.170> so

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
we started treatment about that photo so

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.160 
we started treatment about that photo so
we<00:01:05.220> have<00:01:05.369> about<00:01:05.610> maybe<00:01:05.970> sixty<00:01:06.659> sixty-five

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
we have about maybe sixty sixty-five

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.719 
we have about maybe sixty sixty-five
degrees<00:01:07.520> of<00:01:08.520> flexion<00:01:08.869> we<00:01:09.869> know<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.229> because

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
degrees of flexion we know that because

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.580 
degrees of flexion we know that because
when<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.850> do<00:01:12.000> have<00:01:12.180> bone<00:01:12.420> on<00:01:12.600> bone<00:01:12.630> arthritis

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
when you do have bone on bone arthritis

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.440 
when you do have bone on bone arthritis
it's<00:01:13.830> very<00:01:14.040> hard<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.369> flex<00:01:14.760> but<00:01:15.060> there's<00:01:15.270> no

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
it's very hard to flex but there's no

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.340 
it's very hard to flex but there's no
space<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.680> there<00:01:17.030> however<00:01:18.049> I'm<00:01:19.049> going<00:01:19.290> to

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
space in there however I'm going to

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.109 
space in there however I'm going to
demonstrate<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.830> therapy<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.520> retest<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
demonstrate a therapy and retest the

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.649 
demonstrate a therapy and retest the
flexibility<00:01:21.890> so<00:01:22.890> basically<00:01:23.490> we<00:01:24.180> always<00:01:24.390> start

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
flexibility so basically we always start

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.359 
flexibility so basically we always start
out<00:01:24.750> with<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.170> high-powered<00:01:25.770> laser<00:01:26.009> therapy

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
out with the high-powered laser therapy

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.120 
out with the high-powered laser therapy
class<00:01:27.360> for<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.439> what<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.400> laser<00:01:29.610> does<00:01:31.130> it

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
class for and what the laser does it

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.499 
class for and what the laser does it
puts<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:33.290> healing<00:01:34.290> photonic<00:01:35.100> light<00:01:35.850> energy

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
puts in healing photonic light energy

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.899 
puts in healing photonic light energy
into<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.990> tissue<00:01:37.310> now<00:01:38.310> we've<00:01:38.490> all<00:01:38.640> heard<00:01:38.670> that

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
into the tissue now we've all heard that

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.740 
into the tissue now we've all heard that
you<00:01:39.299> need<00:01:39.619> vitamin<00:01:40.619> D<00:01:40.799> from<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.100> Sun<00:01:41.750> for

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
you need vitamin D from the Sun for

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.780 
you need vitamin D from the Sun for
strong<00:01:43.170> bones<00:01:43.250> because<00:01:44.250> that's<00:01:44.579> what

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
strong bones because that's what

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.580 
strong bones because that's what
strengthens<00:01:45.180> your<00:01:45.299> bones<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.720> vitamin<00:01:46.110> d3

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
strengthens your bones the vitamin d3

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.460 
strengthens your bones the vitamin d3
and<00:01:46.829> if<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.700> don't<00:01:47.880> have<00:01:47.970> enough<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.470> you

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
and if you don't have enough of that you

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.230 
and if you don't have enough of that you
know<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.680> knees<00:01:49.890> get<00:01:50.159> weak<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.610> they<00:01:50.759> topple

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
know the knees get weak and they topple

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.469 
know the knees get weak and they topple
so<00:01:52.040> not<00:01:53.040> only<00:01:53.159> will<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:53.520> stimulate<00:01:54.119> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
so not only will this stimulate the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:54.940 
so not only will this stimulate the
absorb

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
absorb

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.429 
absorb
vitamin<00:01:55.460> D<00:01:55.640> exactly<00:01:56.329> where<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:56.659> tissue<00:01:56.840> exit

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
vitamin D exactly where the tissue exit

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.580 
vitamin D exactly where the tissue exit
it<00:01:58.310> also<00:01:58.640> brings<00:01:58.880> in<00:01:59.180> heat<00:01:59.659> and<00:01:59.869> blood<00:02:00.289> for

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
it also brings in heat and blood for

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.429 
it also brings in heat and blood for
circulation<00:02:01.159> and<00:02:01.700> that<00:02:02.360> fresh<00:02:02.659> blood<00:02:03.079> will

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
circulation and that fresh blood will

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.679 
circulation and that fresh blood will
bring<00:02:03.679> in<00:02:03.799> fresh<00:02:04.039> stem<00:02:04.399> cells<00:02:04.700> to<00:02:04.880> repair<00:02:05.479> the

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
bring in fresh stem cells to repair the

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.279 
bring in fresh stem cells to repair the
damage<00:02:06.020> of<00:02:06.079> new<00:02:06.229> tissue<00:02:06.640> it<00:02:07.640> will<00:02:07.789> also<00:02:08.289> put

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
damage of new tissue it will also put

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.500 
damage of new tissue it will also put
ATP<00:02:09.860> energy<00:02:09.890> into<00:02:10.849> the<00:02:10.970> cells<00:02:11.269> that

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
ATP energy into the cells that

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.740 
ATP energy into the cells that
mitochondria<00:02:12.200> you<00:02:12.319> need<00:02:12.760> to<00:02:13.760> help<00:02:14.090> increase

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
mitochondria you need to help increase

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.930 
mitochondria you need to help increase
the<00:02:15.080> metabolism<00:02:15.739> which<00:02:16.250> increases<00:02:16.940> the

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
the metabolism which increases the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.440 
the metabolism which increases the
healing<00:02:17.930> factor<00:02:18.319> as<00:02:18.470> well<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:19.459> also<00:02:19.940> shuts<00:02:20.239> off

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
healing factor as well it also shuts off

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.309 
healing factor as well it also shuts off
the<00:02:20.569> pain<00:02:20.780> signals<00:02:21.400> so<00:02:22.870> how<00:02:23.870> does<00:02:23.930> that<00:02:24.019> feel

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
the pain signals so how does that feel

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.440

nice<00:02:24.500> and<00:02:24.560> warm<00:02:24.970> telling<00:02:25.970> you<00:02:26.030> if<00:02:26.120> it's<00:02:26.239> too

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
nice and warm telling you if it's too

let's<00:03:39.830> straighten<00:03:40.130> that<00:03:40.310> out<00:03:40.370> and<00:03:41.410> tell<00:03:42.410> me<00:03:42.620> if

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
let's straighten that out and tell me if

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.400 
let's straighten that out and tell me if
and<00:03:43.250> when<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.460> pain<00:03:43.670> starts<00:03:44.180> you<00:03:45.020> can<00:03:45.110> see<00:03:45.290> we

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
and when the pain starts you can see we

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.130 
and when the pain starts you can see we
could<00:03:45.500> go<00:03:45.620> way<00:03:45.890> past<00:03:46.450> 90<00:03:47.450> degrees<00:03:47.780> in<00:03:47.810> fact

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
could go way past 90 degrees in fact

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.480 
could go way past 90 degrees in fact
he's<00:03:48.290> probably<00:03:48.470> about<00:03:48.920> 130<00:03:49.790> degrees<00:03:50.420> and

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
he's probably about 130 degrees and

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.530 
he's probably about 130 degrees and
supposedly<00:03:52.490> you're<00:03:52.700> not<00:03:52.820> supposed<00:03:53.090> to<00:03:53.240> flex

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
supposedly you're not supposed to flex

supposedly you're not supposed to flex
that<00:03:53.870> far<00:03:54.230> past<00:03:54.830> 90<00:03:55.250> degrees<00:03:55.550> if<00:03:55.700> you<00:03:55.820> have

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
that far past 90 degrees if you have

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.180 
that far past 90 degrees if you have
bone<00:03:56.120> on<00:03:56.240> bone<00:03:56.270> on<00:03:56.630> arthritis<00:03:57.260> so<00:03:57.560> I<00:03:57.800> think

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
bone on bone on arthritis so I think

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.170 
bone on bone on arthritis so I think
we're<00:03:58.490> proving<00:03:58.760> you<00:03:59.660> know<00:03:59.780> them<00:04:00.560> wrong<00:04:01.060> so<00:04:02.060> as

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
we're proving you know them wrong so as

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.420 
we're proving you know them wrong so as
we<00:04:02.330> could<00:04:02.450> see<00:04:02.720> all<00:04:03.020> the<00:04:03.140> procedures<00:04:03.740> are<00:04:04.040> not

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
we could see all the procedures are not

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.630 
we could see all the procedures are not
invasive<00:04:05.230> they<00:04:06.230> heal<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.860> knee<00:04:07.040> naturally

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
invasive they heal the knee naturally

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.530 
invasive they heal the knee naturally
and<00:04:08.950> with<00:04:09.950> these<00:04:10.100> procedures<00:04:10.850> we're<00:04:11.210> hoping

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
and with these procedures we're hoping

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.900 
and with these procedures we're hoping
that<00:04:11.600> most<00:04:12.140> people<00:04:12.620> who<00:04:13.310> are<00:04:13.400> considering

that most people who are considering

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.180 
that most people who are considering

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
total knee replacement surgery we could

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.910 
total knee replacement surgery we could
