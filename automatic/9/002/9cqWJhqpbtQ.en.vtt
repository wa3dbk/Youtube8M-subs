00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.270
 easy and it's a delight then here I 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.660
 I have a pound of ground meat 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.699
 seasoned with pepper salt garlic powder and 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.160
 a little green chive here I 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:42.519
 I have a dukan bread is actually a 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:46.000
 pointer is half the bread of the field and I 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:47.589
 I'm hungry and grind the law well. 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.859
 and I have now added a 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:52.420
 little oat rescued because it gave 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:54.129
 very soon then to be able to 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.280
 reach the quantity 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:01:00.210
 after all I have two eggs beaten with a 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.440
 drop a little salt milk 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.509
 so that's all you need to 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.580
 make our steak breaded 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:10.420
 Then you can make that same recipe. 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.640
 with regular steak with chicken or 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.929
 counts is ground beef as it teaches now 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.090
 for you 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:19.660
 so we'll get a 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.200
 quantity of ground meat thoroughly wash 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.180
 hands right 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.420
 looks good mass has nothing or has not 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.960
 it does not have anything to seasoned ground beef 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.850
 so it makes a format that you 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.860
 prefer those who have that form of 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:40.450
 hamburger is good too, I do not have 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.920
 but no matter what we do - no 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.920
 olhÃ´metro so in the same hand 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.479
 the dough is good to look good 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.300
 and goes modeling with his hands 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.220
 so ready with more or less like this 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.450
 looking like a book is important not to do 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:21.000
 very thick and now we will pass 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:23.340
 in the egg two sides and we will pass the 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:35.280
 so flour in quotes that people 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:38.569
 made of whole wheat bread does not need much 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:43.110
 flour and after we do 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:49.650
 Let's take the excess and straighten it out. 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:56.790

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.500
 Vegetable paper with baking butter 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.470

 an easy top quick recipe and I 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.940
 I was so hungry for meat 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.130
 then it was an idea that did not 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.910
 He gave me the truth or not it does so only 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.889
 who does the breaded with farofa and of course? 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.889
 how can we not behave as a beacon in the 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:50.139
 diet and the farofa of the field is different 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.449
 of traditional and only with the bran 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:55.120
 it would be very dry so I had this idea 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:56.229
 to grate the bread that is also good 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.389
