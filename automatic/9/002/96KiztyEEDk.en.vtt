00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:09.059
 hello dear friends today i am 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.670
 I would like to present you a book of letters 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:18.060
 living dead 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:21.380
 written brewing in general than she told me 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:26.099
 I liked very good impressions 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:29.400
 left and how do I get the tailbone of them 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:33.450
 for a start, at least tell not 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.489
 advised one man my very good 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.760
 friend 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:41.160
 then after about two weeks sharing 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.300
 my friend medium advised this book 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.969
 read and 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.660
 ultimately my work officer at 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:53.809
 she gave these people are not related to each other 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:56.910
 friend did not communicate and I think that by 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:01:00.030
 what fate is up to the book after all 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.660
 got into my hands after reading it 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:10.520
 I have very good memories 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:13.560
 about how the idea is laid out here and about 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.409
 how this world really works i'm about 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.670
 this principle itself is pretty 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:23.549
 often pondered and with the expiration of time 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.689
 I have already formed my own concept 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:34.009
 how this world is organized and why 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:34.009
 everyone must leave us and this is a book 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:40.600
 It was a confirmation of what I am 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:45.880
 I came myself so it was interesting to read 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.920
 what is affected here is affected 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:53.060
 it turns out 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:59.770
 a moment that probably awaits each of 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.770
 us is the transition to the astral plane 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:10.910
 spirit that is the physical plane is keen 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:16.310
 a kind of rhythm how a person is awake 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:19.100
 go to bed asleep with kinda he 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.430
 goes into a thin plan and then 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.120
 wakes up as if to start living again 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.600
 physical body 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.600
 affected here 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.550
 topics about life in this thin plan like 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:43.920
 this is how it is life there 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.920
 implemented as to 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:51.760
 everyone lives there his life and 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:56.800
 what is interesting is that it is described with 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:03:01.110
 hand traveler which of 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:03.100
 the physical plane went there and through 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.670
 woman of the medium 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:11.440
 puts it all and holds the 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:20.920
 such a level which is very disprove 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:26.430
 difficult here and touched on the topic oh well 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:29.890

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.590

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.470

 reveals the nuances of the entities that 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:53.270
 suck the energy out of people thereby 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:58.350
 eat 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:04:02.420
