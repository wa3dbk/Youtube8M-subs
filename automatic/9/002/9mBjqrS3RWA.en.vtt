pretty<00:02:09.660> well<00:02:10.220> it's<00:02:11.220> not<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.550> almost<00:02:11.820> like<00:02:12.030> it

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360

liner soft real liner that they put in
there<00:02:18.360> so<00:02:19.110> we're<00:02:19.530> just<00:02:19.560> gonna<00:02:19.740> hold<00:02:20.040> off<00:02:20.160> on

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
there so we're just gonna hold off on

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.240 
there so we're just gonna hold off on
realigning<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.120> anymore<00:02:21.930> for<00:02:22.200> now<00:02:22.350> but<00:02:23.100> the

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
realigning it anymore for now but the

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.170 
realigning it anymore for now but the
bottoms<00:02:23.670> are<00:02:23.970> definitely<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:26.180> completely

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
bottoms are definitely a completely

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
bottoms are definitely a completely
different<00:02:27.360> experience<00:02:27.740> than<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:28.860> tops<00:02:29.130> were

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
different experience than the tops were

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.870 
different experience than the tops were
but<00:02:31.200> like<00:02:31.350> I<00:02:31.440> said<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:31.740> does<00:02:31.920> feel<00:02:32.220> better<00:02:32.459> so

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
but like I said it does feel better so

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.490 
but like I said it does feel better so
if<00:02:33.209> you<00:02:33.360> have<00:02:33.540> this<00:02:33.720> done<00:02:33.990> and<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.230> find

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
if you have this done and you find

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.130 
if you have this done and you find
yourself<00:02:34.620> in<00:02:35.360> excruciating<00:02:36.360> pain<00:02:36.690> it's

yourself in excruciating pain it's

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.920 
yourself in excruciating pain it's
probably<00:02:37.890> just<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.250> sore<00:02:38.850> spots<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.720> mean

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
that's what mine was I thought it was

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.610 
that's what mine was I thought it was
from<00:02:41.640> that<00:02:41.850> then<00:02:42.480> pulling<00:02:42.750> all<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.140> teeth<00:02:43.410> out
