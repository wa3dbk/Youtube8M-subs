00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hi who no today show you how 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.029
 like a Boreck 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.040
 can make a sandwich it's been there recently 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.570
 ever found a long time ago, and 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.179
 adjusted it yourself 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.509
 it is with feta cheese and parsley 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.820
 and i call them can no please you must 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.710
 but I know the exact 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.779
 dimensions no longer so I do whatever 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.460
 one is also put under by afterwards 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.590
 how much exactly have I used do that 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.490
 a bit on feeling so needed 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.309
 first a bunch of parsley 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.759
 then you need turkish cheese if you like that 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.930
 don't have 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:40.230
 patrick aas and i have a lot here then 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.629
 filo dough this is so to say did 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.280
 olympia dough can be found in the freezer 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.620
 then 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.940
 yogurt jerk yogurt what they thicker 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.149
 fine with it can also just full yogurt 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.199
 use olive oil and eggs 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.840
 the first thing we are going to do is it 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.460
 let the filo pastry thaw and it is often 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.960
 in a lot of truck it is very thin 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.940
 goes fairly quickly and takes it out and then 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.339
 I say put down so that it quickly 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.799
 something cannot fold open yet 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.470
 and then it just breaks 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.320
 And so through you it takes about half a 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.409
 hour ' s mixture I am now six eggs and 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.189
 I break it in a bowl then I take one 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:23.670
 l Turkish yogurt I do there and 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.350
 a glass of olive oil 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.340
 a little less well, she hears with three 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.340
 fourth of a glass 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.880
 stir well and now with the mixer 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.690
 mister bunch of parsley and cut it already 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.690
 a very small piece 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.010
 and this since there now and take your cheese 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.330
 and you crumble it in here 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.850
 I always do is I make of 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.460
 Open packages first and then I cut 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.830
 you actually play it on and then with it 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.550
 some sort of crumbling threw the moisture 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.550
 just as well 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.530
 and do also when all the cheese 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.760
 is in it now I am going through just as well 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.760
 mix on the lowest setting 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.310
 the filo pastry is probably already now 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.230
 large part thawed and you could do it that way 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.580
 open fold this I now place on the 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.190
 cutting board does not matter until there is still cheese 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.640
 sit on screaming well 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.690
 preheat the oven to 180 degrees 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.730
 who knows next here you have it 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.830
 filo pastry joop your sauce 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.080
 then you take a blackboard and have it here 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.180
 you baking sheet with parchment paper on it there 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.140
 we impose later I go through 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.760
 you take a sheet 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:48.910
 please note that they will be destroyed soon enough 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:52.300
 do it early and dip it in the sauce and 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.540
 therefore you really know him along I much 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.540
 crazy 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.630
 Oh 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.940
 was that real 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:11.870
 yes a bit apart but that 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:16.780
 put your plate and here you make a kind 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:23.540
 roll of loosely and you roll it up 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:25.220
 and this explained here and so you go through all 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.780
 pieces that are broken that you can sort 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.340
 stick to each other for something 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.810
 so it 's not at all 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.819
 decently 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.299
 it's about the cheese and the like 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.299
 is in it 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.280
 to the baking tray has been filled, there are there 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.170
 now 17 out I have some really really fat 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.940
 filled and also say when I sat down 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.590
 put even more the ring done in such 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.480
 some I really only go through 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.770
 so how we look at what you get 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.209
 find yourself nicer 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.250
 and this now goes for half an hour 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.000
 in the oven and then I continue immediately 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.000
 with the next load 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.180
 the second load is also ready in advance 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:33.550
 I put on a plate and this is how it is 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.259
 looks like after half an hour 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.860
 they got on well so it must be 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:40.030
 but be soft where the dough should be 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.520
 ready 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.520
 so no need to but 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.520
 speakers 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.069
 clare first load this is what it looks like 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.750
 see 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:57.400
 do you really want to have a lot nicer 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.530
 if all dogs are one way 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.599
 solve each other and I go 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.919
 now the next charge the on then exactly 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:08.520
 just on the same baking paper and yes 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.520
 put it in hope 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.629
 and is what i mean by loose so this 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:18.099
 now goes into the oven and zip 2 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:19.990
 and this is the last charge that is in it 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:20.680
 is going 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.629
 I hope you find it interesting 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.340
 I have found so many times 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:26.560
 made about 40 pieces but it is 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.110
 difficult to visit no matter what 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.699
 convince where so you can say the 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.560
 Take half of the recipe and then you have 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:33.969
 there you have a little less than this 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.050
 visible 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:37.050
 thanks for watching and see you soon
