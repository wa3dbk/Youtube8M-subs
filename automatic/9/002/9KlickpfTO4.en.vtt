00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:15.070
 or the invitation in this video can 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:18.040
 show how I clean those we're going 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.349
 my night routine to go to sleep 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.000
 in beauty tub and what I use is what 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.189
 makes us the father we are going to apply 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.570
 kinda take the good hair let's go 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.790
 start the first thing we see here not 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.410
 I'm makeup and again put the 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.270
 eyelashes is that I have false eyelashes 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.640
 I just pull them out pulling them with 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.290
 the fingers now I use this is make up 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.750
 for eyes from outside and wipes 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.400
 wet musicians if I did not have 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.260
 makeup its implementation in the 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.880
 wet wipes to refresh the face 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.470
 and let's say you want to see how grace of the 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.780
 skin what you picked up on the day in 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.370
 the skin but since I have makeup use 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.930
 the make-up remover for the eyes for 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.510
 internal around the eyes and remove 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.130
 the glue on the false eyelashes and 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.720
 then wipe the rest of the face with 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.700
 the wipe used one side of the wipe 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.030
 for half face and the other side wipe 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.860
 for the other half face I almost always use 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.299
 just a washcloth because after I wash 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.850
 the face then I need to 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.500
 spend more than just one wipes 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.520
 clean very well all the face at the end and 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.920
 I'm fresh 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.780
 and how do I tell them if I did not have makeup 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.210
 I only use the washcloth but whatever 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.610
 makeup this is what I do use my 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.619
 vibrating declining brush that already 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.079
 they had shown to you is brush in 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.179
 a sausage of favorites of the month what 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:26.799
 I prend and what I do is with this 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:28.630
 caracas cleaner because I always use 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.670
 which is called sinde you can use 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.500
 any clean they want I do not deserve 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.350
 the face with warm water to open the 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.240
 pores on the brush with soap or 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.860
 cleaner in the brush and I start in 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.590
 circular movements to clean the 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.149
 face and you if you are not used 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.039
 to use a brush if on the face they start 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.750
 to do it gently because the skin is 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.819
 very delicate especially around the 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.679
 eyes I chose my nose very well because 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:53.049
 that's where I personally come out 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.640
 like several black points then 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.979
 let's say they are always concentrated more 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.590
 that all the cleaning to clean the 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.020
 cheeks and my forehead appointment and then 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.670
 when the ues is over and it stings and I 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.020
 I wash my face with cold water so that 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.399
 pores 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.649
 they close a little bit and do not remain as 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.360
 so exposed and are open I dry 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.030
 the face very gently with a washcloth 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.260
 and this is what I am going to do now 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.200
 called microdermabrasion or 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.700
 mike crowder mind english christian and 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.280
 this one for tico I had already done 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.780
 years like two years a year a video about 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.459
 this so here I leave the link for 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.069
 that have all the details of this 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.200
 apparatus and what it does to suck the skin 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.549
 and also how to scrape it with the little thing 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.920
 what it has inside comes with a 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.470
 bigger head and a few more pebbles 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.480
 great for the skin that is perfect 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.099
 to exfoliate body parts like those 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.599
 elbows knees that are like what 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.150
 they always get super hard or where 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:46.189
 you want to exfoliate this as you 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.590
 I say what does ras for the face and 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:50.420
 suck then clean and makes the 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.670
 skin is renewed to have new skin 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.310
 when I tell them to scrape the face if the 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.530
 scrape but it's not something abrupt that's going to 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.930
 make him bleed or something like that 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.950
 drop your face not obviously as you 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.739
 I say you have to go 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.109
 getting used to the device then this one 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.819
 comes with a few pebbles as for 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.340
 get used as a test so that the 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.230
 cross go get used to this put me 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.090
 a lot of attention please and this is 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.010
 I do this every day so 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.769
 I can can every 20 or once a month 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.180
 because my skin is very delicate and still 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.090
 I'm too young to have to do 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.280
 this much 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.110
 but I love published is that I do 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.989
 as the second third day the class I 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.030
 I feel super fresh new looks super 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.280
 free as very clear as how that 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.340
 shines alone what I do is go 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.019
 cleaning and I do it in order and I'm going 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.060
 doing as with the shape of the 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.590
 muscles of the face in the video that they 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.200
 I say that I'll put them back on 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.390
 inquiet to this video I explain 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.769
 exactly everything about this device but 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.560
 well I love to use it because how do you 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:52.170
 I say it leaves my skin super cute and the 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.090
 stress of the nose as I always say 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.950
 I pay attention on the nose in 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.319
 the part from where I do not even leave 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:02.040
 black spots then I clean it very 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.390
 well and after using this little thing 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.579
 you realize that the skin stays 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.340
 red but then the idea is not that the 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.780
 mistreat too much then yes yes something 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.700
 what happens to them obviously they suspend the 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.870
 use or go using it a few 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:17.850
 this is my tonic the tonic I use it 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.979
 when I have not done the 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.229
 microdermabrasion then this what 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.210
 would use after soap or cleaner 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.919
 liquid after doctor the skin with this 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.580
 because this helps balance the ph of 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.900
 the skin and remove as the 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.400
 and stayed for the afforestation 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.930
 dangers like and the micro tells me of 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.539
 moderation I will not use it because I do not 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.180
 wants to lay my skin now I'm going to use 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.830
 a moisturizer this he used always 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.280
 after doing any kind of 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.830
 weapons 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.080
 micro moderation or assembly with 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.610
 the brush or always after doing me 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.900
 any kind of cleaning so be it only 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.939
 with the wipe use a moisturizer 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.620
 because hydrated skin is very 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:55.080
 important to prevent wrinkles 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.229
 federico spots and that the piece feels 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.030
 just always young and hydrated myself 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.719
 I use neutrogena cream which is a 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.159
 magnet that I used in the ue-15 

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:07.289
 like the beauty routine with abdominal 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:08.729
 and he used the cream for dry skin because my 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:10.710
 skin is dry if you have skin 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:12.900
 fat can use skin cream 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.550
 fat and also around 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.770
 eyes the cream for the eye area 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.210
 This cream is different from cream 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.740
 moisturize the skin because the skin of 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.270
 around the eyes is different from 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.639
 rest of the face part is like very 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.439
 delicate that creame also that of notro 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.000
 generates the eye contour and I would say 

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:29.210
 that you are in companies or use a 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.490
 eye contour from 20 years 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.240
 because in the background the row starts to 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.310
 do as 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.620
 mature not even grow and I prefer 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.389
 paint always and especially if 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.979
 Make up the eyes is also followed 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:41.520
 I recommend a lot of vases we want to 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:45.270
 the eyes 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.310
 then I brush my teeth and put a 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.139
 Colgate cream use normal contact or 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.139
 colgate white the first one you find 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:53.580
 like on the dresser and I wash the 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:55.530
 normal teeth if suddenly you do not 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.810
 they know how to brush their teeth that we can 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:01.490
 know how to remember the song of 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.490
 doctor very lists of colgate 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.400
 and well I wash my teeth normal and 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.169
 almost never used silk while it is 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.790
 very bad and I will always use it but the 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:14.980
 use when I remember and live magnit and 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.930
 as well as assumption of the teeth and already 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.419
 they use them daily and they have teeth 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.160
 you running and what I do is 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:22.389
 wash my tongue and cheeks 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.160
 inside because they also carry many 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:25.840
 bacteria and at the end I get the water in 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.150
 the lips that just to eliminate 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.500
 as dead skin of the lips and that the 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.850
 lips are always foods and 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.590
 hydration is like what I did in the 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.270
 face but on the lips 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.850
 now for Turkish hair and all day 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.169
 then all fluffy and I use an oil 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:40.240
 of argan and I put it in means to 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:41.889
 tips to hydrate the hair this 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.260
 I do every night especially because 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:45.910
 I have recently red hair and 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.470
 I need to return as brightness 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.590
 hydration to the hair and then I get 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:52.450
 a sprite keratin after me 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:54.639
 brush the town as for the 

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:57.220
 products I put on become all the 

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:58.990
 hair and untangle it and then I get 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.040
 a spray on my nose because I have 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.380
 rhinitis and I can not 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.210
 so I have to put that measure 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.860
 all the lips I'm using cármenes 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.600
 right now but the truth is that 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.430
 as the first clip although they have 

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.390
 details and then I get in bed and 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:13.090
 the truth 

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:15.490
 twizy I answer messages and then I have
