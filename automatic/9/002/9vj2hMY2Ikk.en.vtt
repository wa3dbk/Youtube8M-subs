character<00:02:35.010> died<00:02:35.460> and<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.360> whole<00:02:36.540> world

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
character died and the whole world

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.260 
character died and the whole world
around<00:02:37.020> him<00:02:37.320> freezes<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:38.730> can<00:02:38.850> still<00:02:39.090> see

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
him walking around amongst the gunfire I

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.150
