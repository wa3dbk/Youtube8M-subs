00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.279 
kind of use that to to guide me through
this<00:00:21.869> process<00:00:22.170> today<00:00:22.640> for<00:00:23.640> me<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:24.510> like<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.109> meal

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
this process today for me I like to meal

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.040 
this process today for me I like to meal
plan<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.980> day<00:00:26.130> that<00:00:26.279> I<00:00:26.340> grocery<00:00:26.849> shop<00:00:27.300> because

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
plan the day that I grocery shop because

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.540 
plan the day that I grocery shop because
that<00:00:28.320> makes<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.680> most<00:00:28.830> sense<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.250> me<00:00:29.340> because

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
that makes the most sense to me because

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.260 
that makes the most sense to me because
if<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.390> can<00:00:30.840> just<00:00:31.399> portion<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.489> all<00:00:32.669> up<00:00:32.880> before<00:00:33.059> I

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
if I can just portion it all up before I

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.270 
if I can just portion it all up before I
put<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.600> away<00:00:33.719> it's<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.500> lot<00:00:34.530> easier<00:00:35.070> than

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
put it away it's a lot easier than

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.090 
put it away it's a lot easier than
putting<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:35.969> away<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.510> then<00:00:37.140> just<00:00:37.380> putting<00:00:38.010> it

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
putting it away and then just putting it

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.860 
putting it away and then just putting it
there<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.460> then<00:00:38.579> expecting<00:00:39.149> myself<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.690> get

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
there and then expecting myself to get

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.510 
there and then expecting myself to get
it<00:00:39.989> back<00:00:40.140> out<00:00:40.320> in<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.530> couple<00:00:40.680> days<00:00:40.920> I'll<00:00:41.190> wash

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
it back out in a couple days I'll wash

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.190 
it back out in a couple days I'll wash
those<00:00:41.760> strawberries<00:00:42.239> in<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.420> couple<00:00:42.690> days<00:00:42.840> and

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
those strawberries in a couple days and

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.810 
those strawberries in a couple days and
and<00:00:43.379> then<00:00:43.559> I'll<00:00:43.649> portion<00:00:43.980> them<00:00:44.100> out<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.579> never

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
and then I'll portion them out it never

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.369 
and then I'll portion them out it never
happens<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.539> then<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.690> lot<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.050> times<00:00:46.200> my

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
happens and then a lot of times my

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.529 
happens and then a lot of times my
produce<00:00:46.710> goes<00:00:46.950> bad<00:00:47.190> which<00:00:47.700> sucks<00:00:47.969> because<00:00:48.210> I'm

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
produce goes bad which sucks because I'm

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.479 
produce goes bad which sucks because I'm

the exact same portions I have to use

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.850 
the exact same portions I have to use
the<00:03:05.600> containers<00:03:06.050> though<00:03:06.260> to<00:03:06.320> portion<00:03:06.709> them

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
the containers though to portion them

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
the containers though to portion them
out<00:03:08.080> scoop<00:03:09.080> it<00:03:09.200> all<00:03:09.290> into<00:03:09.500> here<00:03:09.799> you<00:03:10.070> can<00:03:10.220> see

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
out scoop it all into here you can see

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.259 
out scoop it all into here you can see
it's<00:03:11.060> all<00:03:11.209> dewy<00:03:12.110> from<00:03:12.440> being<00:03:12.680> scooped<00:03:13.269> in

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
it's all dewy from being scooped in

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.479 
it's all dewy from being scooped in
scoops<00:03:14.660> and<00:03:15.590> then<00:03:15.739> I<00:03:15.799> just<00:03:15.980> dump<00:03:16.160> them<00:03:16.280> into

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
scoops and then I just dump them into

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.460 
scoops and then I just dump them into
these<00:03:16.580> individual<00:03:17.090> containers<00:03:17.420> and<00:03:18.230> it's

these individual containers and it's

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.590 
these individual containers and it's
impossible<00:03:18.739> for<00:03:19.130> me<00:03:19.310> to<00:03:19.640> know<00:03:19.790> exactly<00:03:20.150> what

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
impossible for me to know exactly what

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.479 
impossible for me to know exactly what
each<00:03:20.840> container<00:03:21.590> holds<00:03:22.040> because<00:03:22.160> each

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
each container holds because each

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:23.979 
each container holds because each
container<00:03:22.850> is<00:03:22.970> different<00:03:23.390> I<00:03:23.510> don't<00:03:23.660> have<00:03:23.810> all

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
container is different I don't have all

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.509 
container is different I don't have all
the<00:03:24.140> same<00:03:24.320> containers<00:03:24.920> and<00:03:25.130> I'm<00:03:25.220> sure<00:03:25.340> nobody

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
the same containers and I'm sure nobody

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.660 
the same containers and I'm sure nobody
else<00:03:25.700> does<00:03:25.970> either<00:03:26.150> unless<00:03:26.630> you're<00:03:26.840> psycho

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
else does either unless you're psycho

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.009 
else does either unless you're psycho
but<00:03:28.959> moderately<00:03:29.959> psycho<00:03:30.470> maybe<00:03:31.180> so<00:03:32.209> there<00:03:32.930> we

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
but moderately psycho maybe so there we

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:33.310 
but moderately psycho maybe so there we
go

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
go

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.310 
go
five<00:03:33.500> servings<00:03:33.920> that'll<00:03:34.640> pretty<00:03:35.060> much<00:03:35.320> you're

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
five servings that'll pretty much you're
