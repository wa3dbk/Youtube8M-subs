00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.259
 At the heart of everyone, they make Erfurt lure more and more Vienna 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.590
 and secondly, there are fewer hobby beekeepers than in earlier times 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.860
 Neukirchen-vluyn, the beekeepers have at least no problems with the 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.730
 Offspring because the local Beekeeping Association has just 8 new ones 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.609
 Beekeepers association my colleague Nicole Schreiber is now in 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:23.829
 The beekeeping in the nature conservation center Nicole could because that dives a new hobby 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:25.909
 become 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:29.289
 No, maybe this will not be my new hobby today, I really have 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.700
 Respect standing behind me 5 driving downtown 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.130
 each with up to 50 000 Vienna and I'm honestly not quite 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.640
 harsh but there are people who are interested in this prohibition 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.230
 and they have fun at the beekeeping for example Florianer wo war 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.810
 she is 19 years old and had a love for mp3 since last year 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.300
 Florian often discovers the last one until you've been stung 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.520
 two years Neumann 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.510
 and hurts that 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.460
 Crossgate man bad to carry 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.990
 that scared me off 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.230
 because not really 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.310
 that's not very much 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.390
 During the day with all perpetrators already own bee colony like many work 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.770
 makes a probing people 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.650
 yes about ten to fifteen a week per people 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.860
 So it really works 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.500
 Now the summer of the rapeseed is blooming the fruit trees are blooming as you think so 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.620
 if now to produce and have a lot of honey 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.750
 because you think so as a layman you really have a lot of work with 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.810
 Honeycomb is a bit longer so while it's already running 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.820
 OKI soon torture thirty kilos up to 30 kilos of honey per person 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.710
 then Trachtlern would remain 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.340
 meanwhile all the title has charm but a bee colony just lost it 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.360
 Anhalts a special furniture which it was at Rome about 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.630
 since then in Vienna, dying in Germany 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.470
 and the pensioners got it 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.240
 there you are a bit sad or 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.390
 has life 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.590
 as in the practice so meanwhile 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.390
 For over 30 years there is this service seeking club here in 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.710
 Neukirchen 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.260
 and here, too, of course, have the messages to the NLA on fire 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.380
 this is that bee dying is percent above all America 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.200
 has the couple around but also here in Europe and now pulls 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.780
 Of course, the German in came Hans Peter Patt which since six 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.060
 Years hobby beekeeper himself has 20 bee colonies at home for something 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.660
 She also has the fear that this is also the case with him 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.750
 In this region, of course, so percent can bounce off 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.170
 America this natural and very alarming around 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.560
 the percent one speaks therefore of losses of up to 80% in 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.850
 different regions of the country around that is a mixture of percent 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.620
 various components that probably contributed to and 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.199
 These are the usual ones 

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:40.779
 the usual diseases we have to deal with anyway we do 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:45.159
 Varroa mite then percent such small clouds deep among others 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:49.159
 on the other hand, scientists need pesticides 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:52.180
 careless use of pesticides responsible for this 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.499
 for these losses 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:56.689
 and hope that their future is not percent in the 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:59.249
 Dimension just stop by Schwackenberg 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:02.619
 the situation yes Lower Rhine there is also a bee mortality is that 

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:05.589
 also bad piece far normal that a bee colony is not there 

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:06.469
 lays in the winter 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:10.430
 So for our regions around fashion are currently so many counts 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.999
 Percent in progress and one speaks of it 10 20 25% percent percent loss 

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:17.070
 with the bee colonies 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.770
 under normal circumstances these are actually percentages of possible losses 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.510
 So the old landfills Foda have come to nothing 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.659
 worrisome and of course hope that it stays that way 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:30.200
 my question 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.650
 and to work, they have work defended to useful animals 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:34.879
 invest 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.010
 that's the hour of work 10 I'm not really down to that 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.169
 a hobby of mine that makes me happy and 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:44.739
 my heart is on and percent of that's why I've got people there 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.459
 Although a lot of work with it, but viruses like this is not the work again 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.930
 hard and now they go on to their students yes 

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:54.879
 Clearly under control, of course, we started last year 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:58.250
 but we have a priori affairs of other percent what 

00:03:58.249 --> 00:04:02.119
 Percent the government is interested in such at school 

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:06.219
 and we have in recent years will be able to train ten people the holders 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:09.409
 Percent also meanwhile appropriate expertise themselves 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:12.559
 have appropriated already own bee colonies and become 

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:15.129
 Of course somehow also for corresponding inflow over ours 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:17.169
 Percent taken care of in our club 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.779
 thank you first has bad luck that one 

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:22.789
 JAL especially honey bread I do not need on the Lower Rhine 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:26.229
 Thought and as long as the rapeseed flowers are also the commercial 

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:28.429
 Kan thanked Qatar
