it's not free
I<00:00:42.069> took<00:00:42.309> risk<00:00:42.819> if<00:00:43.510> there<00:00:43.749> was<00:00:44.019> no<00:00:44.319> risk<00:00:44.739> than<00:00:45.129> it

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:45.249 
I took risk if there was no risk than it

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:49.860 
I took risk if there was no risk than it
would<00:00:45.370> not<00:00:45.579> be<00:00:45.850> real<00:00:47.850> if<00:00:48.850> life<00:00:49.179> didn't<00:00:49.659> have

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
would not be real if life didn't have

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.119 
would not be real if life didn't have
risk<00:00:50.319> life<00:00:51.039> wouldn't<00:00:51.429> be<00:00:51.550> very<00:00:51.760> real<00:00:52.089> at<00:00:52.239> all

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
risk life wouldn't be very real at all

to<00:00:54.129> live<00:00:54.399> up<00:00:54.579> there<00:00:54.789> on<00:00:54.909> that<00:00:55.059> wall<00:00:55.269> is<00:00:55.629> a<00:00:55.690> trip

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
to live up there on that wall is a trip

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.739 
to live up there on that wall is a trip
it<00:00:56.589> is<00:00:57.010> like<00:00:57.370> nothing<00:00:57.760> else<00:00:59.999> the<00:01:00.999> nose<00:01:01.239> record

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:01.749 
it is like nothing else the nose record

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:06.360 
it is like nothing else the nose record
is<00:01:03.360> thousands<00:01:04.360> of<00:01:04.479> feet<00:01:04.690> of<00:01:04.740> solo<00:01:05.740> if<00:01:05.920> you<00:01:06.040> fall

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370 
is thousands of feet of solo if you fall

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.840 
is thousands of feet of solo if you fall
you're<00:01:07.060> lucky<00:01:07.510> if<00:01:07.659> you<00:01:07.920> if<00:01:08.920> you<00:01:09.219> only<00:01:09.369> get<00:01:09.610> hurt

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
you're lucky if you if you only get hurt

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.219 
you're lucky if you if you only get hurt
um<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.890> brothers<00:01:12.280> are<00:01:12.549> in<00:01:12.880> places<00:01:13.780> where<00:01:14.110> if

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
um the brothers are in places where if

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.920 
um the brothers are in places where if
they<00:01:14.350> fall<00:01:14.649> and<00:01:14.979> it's<00:01:15.880> no<00:01:16.119> different<00:01:16.149> than<00:01:16.630> not

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
they fall and it's no different than not

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.859 
they fall and it's no different than not
having<00:01:17.259> a<00:01:17.500> rope<00:01:17.680> they'll<00:01:18.119> they'll<00:01:19.119> die<00:01:19.840> if

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
having a rope they'll they'll die if

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:26.870 
having a rope they'll they'll die if
they<00:01:20.229> fall<00:01:20.469> in<00:01:20.619> many<00:01:20.829> places<00:01:21.100> on<00:01:21.369> the<00:01:21.460> nose

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.760 

so<00:01:27.880> in<00:01:28.750> speed<00:01:29.230> you<00:01:30.040> don't<00:01:30.250> have<00:01:30.670> that<00:01:31.140> time<00:01:32.140> to

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
so in speed you don't have that time to

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.150 
so in speed you don't have that time to
be<00:01:32.980> super<00:01:33.940> careful<00:01:34.150> and<00:01:34.780> so<00:01:35.140> speed<00:01:35.650> may<00:01:35.920> be<00:01:35.980> the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
be super careful and so speed may be the

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.710 
be super careful and so speed may be the
most<00:01:36.310> dangerous<00:01:36.490> thing<00:01:36.760> there<00:01:37.120> is<00:01:37.240> because

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
most dangerous thing there is because

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:45.810 
most dangerous thing there is because
you<00:01:37.900> have<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.170> illusion<00:01:38.440> of<00:01:38.710> the<00:01:38.860> rope<00:01:44.820> the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
you have the illusion of the rope the

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.710 
you have the illusion of the rope the
speed<00:01:46.330> its<00:01:46.780> zen<00:01:47.650> and<00:01:47.980> the<00:01:48.130> art<00:01:48.310> of<00:01:48.940> climb<00:01:49.210> units

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
speed its zen and the art of climb units

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.650 
speed its zen and the art of climb units
um<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:51.280> speed<00:01:51.580> there's<00:01:51.790> no<00:01:51.910> time<00:01:52.120> to<00:01:52.270> think

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
um the speed there's no time to think

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.810 
um the speed there's no time to think
place<00:01:52.840> my<00:01:53.080> hand<00:01:53.380> here<00:01:53.740> place<00:01:54.040> my<00:01:54.220> foot<00:01:54.460> here

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
place my hand here place my foot here

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.100 
place my hand here place my foot here
hope<00:01:55.180> I<00:01:55.330> don't<00:01:55.390> fall<00:01:56.400> whose<00:01:57.400> speed<00:01:57.820> is<00:01:58.270> the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
hope I don't fall whose speed is the

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.890 
hope I don't fall whose speed is the
most<00:01:59.290> cutting<00:01:59.530> edge<00:01:59.800> is<00:02:00.490> just<00:02:00.550> doing<00:02:01.240> and<00:02:01.840> I

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
most cutting edge is just doing and I

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.570 
most cutting edge is just doing and I
think<00:02:02.140> that's<00:02:02.320> what<00:02:02.620> the<00:02:02.740> attraction<00:02:03.010> my

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
think that's what the attraction my

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.280 
think that's what the attraction my
friends<00:02:04.060> and<00:02:04.210> especially<00:02:05.010> Alex<00:02:06.010> and<00:02:06.220> Thomas

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
friends and especially Alex and Thomas

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.880 
friends and especially Alex and Thomas
we're<00:02:08.290> drawn<00:02:08.740> so<00:02:10.740> powerfully<00:02:11.850> to<00:02:12.850> what<00:02:13.150> we<00:02:13.270> do

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
we're drawn so powerfully to what we do

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.309 
we're drawn so powerfully to what we do
that

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
that

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.759 
that
we<00:02:16.769> almost<00:02:16.950> don't<00:02:17.340> have<00:02:17.459> a<00:02:17.580> choice<00:02:18.200> about<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.590> I

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
we almost don't have a choice about it I

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.890 
we almost don't have a choice about it I
look<00:02:20.400> around<00:02:20.549> the<00:02:21.260> world<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.739> see<00:02:23.069> people<00:02:23.940> who

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
look around the world and see people who

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.300 
look around the world and see people who
aren't<00:02:25.430> aren't<00:02:26.430> living<00:02:26.940> on<00:02:27.180> their<00:02:27.720> dreams<00:02:28.310> and

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
aren't aren't living on their dreams and

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.300 
aren't aren't living on their dreams and
aren't<00:02:29.549> living<00:02:29.730> their<00:02:30.120> passion<00:02:30.360> there

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
aren't living their passion there

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.500 
aren't living their passion there
they're<00:02:32.310> just<00:02:33.290> trying<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.379> survive<00:02:34.849> and<00:02:35.849> I

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
they're just trying to survive and I

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.270 
they're just trying to survive and I
think<00:02:36.989> that's<00:02:37.140> kind<00:02:37.410> of<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.590> most<00:02:37.769> important

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
think that's kind of the most important

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.770 
think that's kind of the most important
thing<00:02:38.849> you<00:02:39.510> know<00:02:39.660> if<00:02:39.810> for<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:42.209> world<00:02:42.420> being<00:02:42.660> a

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
thing you know if for the world being a

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.680 
thing you know if for the world being a
better<00:02:42.930> place<00:02:43.260> would<00:02:43.590> be<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:44.690> encourage

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
better place would be to encourage

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.449 
better place would be to encourage
everybody<00:02:46.680> around<00:02:47.159> you<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.640> live<00:02:48.140> with<00:02:49.140> that

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
everybody around you to live with that

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.180 
everybody around you to live with that
passion<00:02:50.459> and<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.599> love<00:02:52.260> otherwise<00:02:52.709> your<00:02:53.160> life

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
passion and and love otherwise your life

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.759 
passion and and love otherwise your life
is<00:02:53.640> is<00:02:53.910> meaningless<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:55.410> you're<00:02:55.590> going

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769
