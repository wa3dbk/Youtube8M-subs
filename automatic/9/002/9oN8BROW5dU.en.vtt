mites<00:00:10.769> are<00:00:10.980> one<00:00:11.219> of<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.550> two<00:00:11.969> conditions<00:00:12.690> that

mites are one of the two conditions that

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.799 
mites are one of the two conditions that
we<00:00:13.110> see<00:00:13.280> pretty<00:00:14.280> regularly<00:00:14.730> in<00:00:15.059> our<00:00:15.179> patients

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
we see pretty regularly in our patients

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.040
