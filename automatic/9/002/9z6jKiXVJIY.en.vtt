for<00:00:43.200> still<00:00:43.410> gotta<00:00:43.530> live<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:43.920> those<00:00:44.100> are<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
for still gotta live so those are the

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.580 
for still gotta live so those are the
probably<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.239> two<00:00:45.390> biggest<00:00:45.570> surprises<00:00:46.110> I

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
probably the two biggest surprises I

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.770 
probably the two biggest surprises I
actually<00:00:47.280> expected<00:00:47.550> puma<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.360> pull<00:00:48.660> out

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
actually expected puma to pull out

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.360 
actually expected puma to pull out
especially<00:00:49.289> since<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:49.860> knew<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.100> would<00:00:50.219> play

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
especially since I knew you would play

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.439 
especially since I knew you would play
against<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.700> zerg<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.090> round<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.239> four

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
against the zerg in the round of four

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.470 
against the zerg in the round of four
right<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.530> that's<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.640> I'm<00:00:53.789> pretty<00:00:54.239> stable

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
right so that's that I'm pretty stable

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.510 
right so that's that I'm pretty stable
yeah<00:00:55.020> I'm<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.440> little<00:00:55.649> surprised<00:00:56.039> about<00:00:56.219> puma

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520
