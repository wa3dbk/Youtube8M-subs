00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 and how are you my name are welcome to 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.060
 those who ask us 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.799
 christina gacitÃºa says is for a 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.139
 carassius telescope that weeks ago 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.059
 his eyes sank and he's always 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.740
 in the background few times nothing does not 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.599
 could say anything in particular about the 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.190
 sunken eyes of fat telescopes 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.109
 but if I can tell you they are very 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.449
 delicate in that aspect so much for 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.920
 pick mushrooms and zeros as for being 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.840
 so large can be damaged with 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.369
 any sharp object that's why it's very 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.599
 It is recommended that you do not have anything like that in 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.699
 the aquarium but it's also very 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.650
 It is important that you become an 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.140
 make weekly water changes at 30 o 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.550
 50 percent maximum and without chlorine 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.700
 temperature should not exceed 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.980
 the 24 degrees and more besides this does not 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.559
 I could only tell you that they are not 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.239
 along with other muddy angel species 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.680
 says hello thank you for your videos what 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.780
 do you think portland cement in the 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.309
 aquarium and how much should I say clear or is it 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.629
 bad for the aquarium this kind of 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.280
 cement is used many times in 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.809
 aquariums and generally it seems that not 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.550
 make problems although I never have 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.379
 used the case is that it hardens the 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.210
 water and the ph goes up and that's why before 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.859
 put it in the aquarium you should cure it 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.019
 some leave it for months in the water 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.850
 to heal and others keep it 24 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.600
 hours in water with vinegar and then go 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.909
 testing 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.350
 this leaves both ph and gh the 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.630
 cycle of flavors as we have always 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.340
 said should be 30 days for you nitro 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.420
 17 send some pictures of an aquarium and I 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.420
 accounts how are you thanks 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.259
 come it's worth for the size of touching me 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.909
 you have a slight overpopulation and 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.590
 some incompatibilities with beta 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.329
 and the scalars the beta should be in 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.280
 a rather small aquarium of about 20 to 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:29.689
 30 liters that is not too high with a 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.549
 smooth filtration and no currents 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.439
 water 22 scalars must be so 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.299
 less in 60 liters and if possible more 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.219
 but to put other companions 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.840
 they should be at least 100 liters per 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:40.039
 On the other hand, the rest of the fish is also 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.600
 in the aquarium that we have seen in the 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.340
 image where it would be ideal to put more 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.959
 plants and increase the gravel layer if 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.969
 it is possible to put nutritious substrate and 

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:48.829
 yes no rotor fertilizer pads which today 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:50.720
 says hello jose I send you the photo since 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.360
 twitter not let me write everything 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.280
 I need to ask you and say hello jose 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.319
 I'm from Uruguay and I follow your videos and 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.090
 it happened very well I'm new to this and I have 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.280
 a problem or I do not know if it's a problem 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.579
 but if a doubt mountain and aquariums 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.890
 180 liters 15 days ago and the ph is in 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:08.869
 9 more or less I do not think I have a stone 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.180
 calcareous or nothing I chose to use a 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.950
 substrate something singlet but that in these 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.170
 15 days my plants have grown from 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.180
 amazing way red clay sand 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.280
 river which I noticed if it was calcar dian 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.650
 but no and on top the color pebble 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.209
 white I have a pretty big trunk 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.630
 that from what I understand should 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.790
 go down 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.110
 h good thank you wait den 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.060
 an answer soon because it comes 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.030
 I'm really worried I leave you a 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.860
 photo of business greetings from uruguay 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.990
 now uruguay in a cycle is normal that 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.520
 the ph goes up a bit and there are variations in 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.140
 the parameters of the water you will have to 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.030
 wait for the cycle to end and 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.890
 from there the best in these cases is 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.200
 do the simplest thing to test the water of the 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.670
 tap directly and write down the ph and 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.230
 then do it with the water of the 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.000
 aquarium again and if this one has a ph 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.950
 greater than the tap you do not have more 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.110
 remedy that remove rocks and 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.880
 small stones that exposed though 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.260
 you believe that they are not calcareous and 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.210
 from there you will have to make changes 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.640
 of water every week until the 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.500
 ph is more or less similar to the 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.780
 tap water the trunks can help 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.300
 to control or lower a bit of ph 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.400
 but a few tenths that practically not 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.140
 you would notice alfonso says open some 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.880
 problem of burying a deceased fish in 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.810
 the same substrate to pay and meet 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.750
 the cycle of life 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.580
 greeting would be nice a little weird but not 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.830
 you can because it would unbalance the water 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.870
 of the aquarium gonzalo says hello jose I have 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.310
 a 15-liter aquarium with 2 prawns and 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.110
 I asked my mother because she meets three 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.360
 uvis female and a male 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.040
 the case is that the one in the store 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.990
 confused and they have brought me a female and 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.300
 three males there is some problem you are 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.890
 they will make thanks and then make another 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.360
 different question that says hello jose 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.890
 another question could you tell me the 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.850
 main reasons why the 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.310
 plants can puden 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.440
 and he shows us a picture of a plant by 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.660
 so much blurry that I can not appreciate it in 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.460
 15 liters and very sure there will be 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.290
 problems especially for the female that 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.090
 would end up dying you have no other 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.890
 change those males by females is , 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.450
 to assume many plants so that the 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.280
 female can hide and is not very 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.960
 high if each for the other males the 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.610
 that the plants rot depends on 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.890
 which is the one in the picture looks too 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.720
 blurred I'm sorry I can not tell you anything 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.520
 about her and the fact is that if they are very 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.530
 demanding may be for lack of 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.930
 nutrients that the safest subscriber 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.150
 of light and co2 for the rest of the plants 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.130
 easy with a little bit of student body 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.540
 lighting and with the water changes not 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.400
 there should be many problems 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.570
 good you finish this has been everything I hope 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.010
 that you serve a lot the video that 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.720
 you have to like favorites that 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.160
 Share with your friends about everything 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.260
 those who have aquariums that will serve them 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.200
 of a lot at night in the next video 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.090
 do not miss cavero so if I forgot 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.280
 thank you very much to all those who 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.320
 you are sending things for the special 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.210
 for the 5000 kervin special is 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.040
 because every time there is more and we can do 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.480
 a good special thing that was not very 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.760
 happy with the previous special of the 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.620
 4000 because I think I did not make a video 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.139
 too good compared to the 3000 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.060
 shoes 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:52.270
 and I hope to continue improving and see you 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.669
 goodbye this time yes thank you for being there 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.240
 and be the best subscribers in the world
