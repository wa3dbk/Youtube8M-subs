00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello finally finally I am 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.429
 returned after two weeks to do the 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.849
 new video this video to do it has us 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.590
 I used a lot both myself and others 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.710
 people because they helped me others 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.580
 people was a bit of a mess but at the 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.820
 I did it fine 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.789
 then let's start from the 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.310
 preamble as I have already said in several 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.220
 previous videos in my opinion youtube is a 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.230
 a showcase is a showcase where you can 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.110
 see products where you can see everything 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.739
 what tricks mica tabucchi dresses 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.739
 in conclusion 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.809
 in other words a little like a 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:47.719
 how can I say as a center 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.980
 commercial with a department store e 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.570
 for those who worked in a center 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.059
 commercial or at least for those who know 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.960
 the life of shopping centers is one 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.890
 absurd stuff 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.050
 that is, there are enmities between those types 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.789
 maybe that of the perfumery below 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.930
 or to that of the shoe stores of 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.820
 above type of a room or in short 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.600
 there are all these northern dynamics though 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.619
 okay in the end the center that people 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:22.080
 a bit of a microclimate hate on 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:24.180
 microclimate of the in is said of the del 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.180
 human kind in short, there is all of them 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.619
 tastes in there create friendships and 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.270
 enmity in short but okay so I have 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.549
 said yes cabbage is true 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.960
 youtube is like a mall 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.990
 like a department store because anyway 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.590
 on youtube there are the enemies yes and 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.780
 less veiled veiled youtubers 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.540
 in short it is a total mess but not 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.350
 this is not the reason for the video 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.460
 I thought cabbage if we were anyway 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.960
 here on youtube in a big one 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.960
 warehouse in a shopping center 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.570
 table there is see all the youtuber 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:11.140
 united in a single youtube video more 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.209
 famous short Italians united in a 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.130
 only video would be great just that 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.750
 precisely because there are enmities 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:23.739
 michael mario we could see a video 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:26.250
 like that and I'm an Italian trash fan 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:30.940
 I thought about a movie so many years ago 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:34.030
 which was department stores with de sica 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.470
 boldi cockpit and three countries 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.690
 if you've never seen her born to see 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.340
 which makes one die of laughter to say yes 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.140
 they are facts that make people laugh more than others 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.610
 but it makes me laugh, there is also ornella 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.300
 dumb and I told you all ok we leave 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.780
 to lose 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.060
 anyway nothing I said then 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.860
 that film has a very special thing 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.810
 which in my opinion there is no other film 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.269
 made so well that the ending theme 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.540
 I've always loved that ending theme 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:04.360
 the hymn contains the anti-crisis sligo from the user 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.060
 still hypothesis is that the asl 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.660
 ipod as a song and so I thought 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:14.170
 cabbage cabbage cabbage if that acronym 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:17.350
 were made here on youtube with the 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.970
 then youtubers like cabbage would come 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.600
 thinks that you think back I arrived 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.600
 an idea like that 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:30.890
 especially then touching full piedmont 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:30.890
 life participates in the big brother later 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.170
 Easter 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.040

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.540

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.540

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.290
