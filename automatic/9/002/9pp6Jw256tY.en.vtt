 some small mistakes it takes 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.340
 try to erase for the rest otherwise we 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.960

 showed that despite 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.780
 we got to the level there I think 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.030
 that today we had business we could 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.570
 see a progress match from 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.760

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.640
 the team did not let go tried to get 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.040

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.240
