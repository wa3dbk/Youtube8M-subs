00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
tape it together so we have a ring on

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.240 
tape it together so we have a ring on
the<00:01:56.909> inside<00:01:57.290> ring<00:01:58.290> on<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.590> inside<00:01:58.950> then<00:01:59.159> we're

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
the inside ring on the inside then we're

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.760 
the inside ring on the inside then we're
gonna<00:01:59.340> flip<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.670> over<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.290> put<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.380> ring<00:02:01.530> down

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
gonna flip it over and put the ring down

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.990 
gonna flip it over and put the ring down
and<00:02:02.100> make<00:02:02.280> another<00:02:02.729> ring<00:02:03.090> on<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.750> top<00:02:04.020> side<00:02:04.350> a

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
and make another ring on the top side a

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.249 
and make another ring on the top side a
little<00:02:06.000> easier<00:02:06.420> on<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.600> top<00:02:06.840> one<00:02:07.020> then<00:02:07.140> we're

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
little easier on the top one then we're

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.589 
little easier on the top one then we're
only<00:02:07.380> gonna<00:02:07.710> cut<00:02:08.039> about<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:08.910> half<00:02:09.179> an<00:02:09.330> inch<00:02:09.360> of

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
only gonna cut about a half an inch of

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.600 
only gonna cut about a half an inch of
tape<00:02:09.750> just<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:10.050> little<00:02:10.440> teeny<00:02:10.830> tiny<00:02:11.190> bit<00:02:11.459> to

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
tape just a little teeny tiny bit to

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.980 
tape just a little teeny tiny bit to
hold<00:02:11.730> it

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
hold it

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.720 
hold it
together<00:02:13.060> we're<00:02:14.060> gonna<00:02:14.150> flip<00:02:14.300> again<00:02:15.550> put<00:02:16.550> the

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
together we're gonna flip again put the

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:30.910 
together we're gonna flip again put the
tips<00:02:17.090> together<00:02:21.730> again<00:02:23.320> flip<00:02:24.320> it<00:02:24.440> over<00:02:29.800> so<00:02:30.800> we

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
tips together again flip it over so we

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.340 
tips together again flip it over so we
have<00:02:31.100> something<00:02:31.640> looks<00:02:31.910> like<00:02:32.150> this<00:02:32.480> so<00:02:33.230> we

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.730 
have something looks like this so we
have<00:02:33.530> our<00:02:33.860> cuts<00:02:35.140> and<00:02:36.140> we<00:02:36.770> roll<00:02:37.040> them<00:02:37.520> up<00:02:38.740> well

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
have our cuts and we roll them up well

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.960

because if all you need to have is a
square<00:04:01.860> sheet<00:04:02.129> of<00:04:02.280> paper<00:04:02.459> it's<00:04:02.790> good<00:04:02.940> to<00:04:03.090> start

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
square sheet of paper it's good to start

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.300
