all right today I'm going to show you

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.019 
all right today I'm going to show you
how<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.190> make<00:00:17.820> some<00:00:18.710> laminate<00:00:19.710> strips<00:00:20.160> for

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
how to make some laminate strips for

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.599 
how to make some laminate strips for
bending<00:00:21.510> wood<00:00:21.779> this<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.619> actually<00:00:23.189> taken<00:00:23.580> from

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
bending wood this is actually taken from

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.950 
bending wood this is actually taken from
a<00:00:23.939> video<00:00:24.269> that's<00:00:24.600> on<00:00:25.400> my<00:00:26.400> youtube<00:00:26.820> page<00:00:26.849> on<00:00:27.630> how

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
a video that's on my youtube page on how

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.410 
a video that's on my youtube page on how
to<00:00:27.990> make<00:00:28.289> some<00:00:28.650> barstools<00:00:29.090> but<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.119> thought

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
to make some barstools but I thought

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.120 
to make some barstools but I thought
that<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.900> would<00:00:30.990> be<00:00:31.109> worthwhile<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.769> put<00:00:31.980> this

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
that it would be worthwhile to put this

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.940 
that it would be worthwhile to put this
video<00:00:32.340> up<00:00:32.579> showing<00:00:33.420> more<00:00:34.140> in<00:00:34.260> depth<00:00:34.469> how<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.739> do

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
video up showing more in depth how to do

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.180 
video up showing more in depth how to do
the<00:00:35.100> laminating<00:00:35.730> process<00:00:36.200> I<00:00:37.200> know<00:00:37.590> when<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.920> was

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
the laminating process I know when I was

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.290 
the laminating process I know when I was
kind<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.489> looking<00:00:38.640> around<00:00:38.820> on<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.210> internet

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
kind of looking around on the internet

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.130 
kind of looking around on the internet
to<00:00:39.840> see<00:00:40.160> how<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.219> make<00:00:41.700> bent<00:00:42.120> legs<00:00:42.450> for<00:00:42.840> chairs

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
to see how to make bent legs for chairs

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.810 
to see how to make bent legs for chairs
there<00:00:43.829> really<00:00:43.980> wasn't<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.399> whole<00:00:44.430> lot<00:00:44.700> out

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
there really wasn't a whole lot out

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.560 
there really wasn't a whole lot out
there<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.899> video<00:00:46.820> kind<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.210> fill

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
there so this is a video kind of to fill

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.670 
there so this is a video kind of to fill
that<00:00:48.750> void<00:00:48.930> what<00:00:49.739> I'm<00:00:49.829> doing<00:00:50.070> now<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.250> cutting

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
that void what I'm doing now is cutting

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.590 
that void what I'm doing now is cutting
the<00:00:52.680> lumber<00:00:53.070> down<00:00:53.809> in<00:00:54.809> eighth<00:00:55.199> inch<00:00:55.530> strips

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
the lumber down in eighth inch strips

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.660 
the lumber down in eighth inch strips
this<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.840> ash<00:00:58.079> ash<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.890> good<00:00:59.190> wood<00:00:59.370> for

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
this is ash ash is a good wood for

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.599 
this is ash ash is a good wood for
bending<00:01:00.059> it's<00:01:00.390> pretty<00:01:00.719> flexible<00:01:01.430> you<00:01:02.430> can

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
bending it's pretty flexible you can

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.369 
bending it's pretty flexible you can
bend<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.940> quite<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> distance<00:01:03.690> before<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.199> would

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
bend a quite a distance before it would

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.609 
bend a quite a distance before it would
snap<00:01:04.760> so<00:01:05.760> that's<00:01:05.909> why<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.119> chose<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:07.380> rest

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
snap so that's why I chose this the rest

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.880 
snap so that's why I chose this the rest
of<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.860> barstools<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.670> I'm<00:01:08.820> making<00:01:09.750> are<00:01:09.990> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
of the barstools that I'm making are the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.580 
of the barstools that I'm making are the
parts<00:01:11.189> are<00:01:11.400> out<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.299> white<00:01:12.570> oak<00:01:12.600> but<00:01:13.080> ash<00:01:13.320> and

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
parts are out of white oak but ash and

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.980 
parts are out of white oak but ash and
white<00:01:13.770> oak<00:01:13.950> actually<00:01:14.430> look<00:01:14.549> very<00:01:14.760> similar

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
white oak actually look very similar

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.990 
white oak actually look very similar
once<00:01:16.860> they're<00:01:17.070> all<00:01:17.100> finished<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.759> wouldn't

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
once they're all finished you wouldn't

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.039 
once they're all finished you wouldn't
really<00:01:18.150> be<00:01:18.240> able<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.600> tell<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.020> difference

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
really be able to tell the difference

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.450 
really be able to tell the difference
between<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:20.640> two<00:01:21.210> types<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.750> wood<00:01:22.220> so<00:01:23.220> that's

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
between the two types of wood so that's

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.149 
between the two types of wood so that's
kind<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.820> why<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.030> went<00:01:25.020> with<00:01:25.140> ash<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.979> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
kind of why I went with ash is the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.149 
kind of why I went with ash is the
flexibility<00:01:27.229> so<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.290> see<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:28.860> an<00:01:29.009> eighth

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
flexibility so you see this is an eighth

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.520 
flexibility so you see this is an eighth
inch<00:01:29.340> strip<00:01:29.759> here<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.930> have<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.259> remember

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
inch strip here you have to remember

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.350 
inch strip here you have to remember
that<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.920> saw<00:01:32.130> blade<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.640> also<00:01:32.670> an<00:01:33.210> eighth

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
that the saw blade is also an eighth

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.390 
that the saw blade is also an eighth
inch<00:01:33.659> thick<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:34.229> every<00:01:34.500> time<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.829> make<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.040> cut

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
inch thick so every time you make a cut

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.910 
inch thick so every time you make a cut
when<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.060> move<00:01:36.360> your<00:01:36.630> rip<00:01:37.020> fence<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.770> have

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
when you move your rip fence in you have

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.120 
when you move your rip fence in you have
to<00:01:38.070> move<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.460> quarter<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.970> an<00:01:39.060> inch<00:01:39.860> 1/8<00:01:40.860> inch

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
to move it a quarter of an inch 1/8 inch

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.319 
to move it a quarter of an inch 1/8 inch
for<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.400> blade<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.880> then<00:01:41.970> an<00:01:42.119> eighth<00:01:42.299> inch

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
for the blade and then an eighth inch

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.630 
for the blade and then an eighth inch
for<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.200> piece<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:43.860> wood<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.460> you're

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
for the piece of wood that you're

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.230 
for the piece of wood that you're
cutting<00:01:45.740> so<00:01:46.740> if<00:01:47.430> you're<00:01:47.729> trying<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.030> calculate

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
cutting so if you're trying to calculate

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.420 
cutting so if you're trying to calculate
up<00:01:48.689> how<00:01:48.840> much<00:01:48.990> wood<00:01:49.259> you're<00:01:49.439> going<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.649> need<00:01:49.890> to

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
up how much wood you're going to need to

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.170 
up how much wood you're going to need to
make<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:51.710> to<00:01:52.710> make<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.070> laminated<00:01:53.729> pieces

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
make the to make the laminated pieces

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.209 
make the to make the laminated pieces
you<00:01:54.720> need<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.020> actually<00:01:55.320> double<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.680> number

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
you need to actually double that number

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.399 
you need to actually double that number
because<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:57.990> stuff<00:01:58.229> you're

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
because of the this stuff you're

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.920 
because of the this stuff you're
basically<00:01:58.799> just<00:01:59.040> turning<00:01:59.340> into<00:01:59.520> sawdust<00:02:00.090> once

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
basically just turning into sawdust once

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.410 
basically just turning into sawdust once
you<00:02:01.020> get<00:02:01.170> all<00:02:01.259> your<00:02:01.290> pieces<00:02:02.009> cut<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:03.180> you'll

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
you get all your pieces cut that you'll

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.139 
you get all your pieces cut that you'll
need<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:04.290> want<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.590> have<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.710> form<00:02:05.130> um<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.850> put

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
need you want to have a form um I put

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.839 
need you want to have a form um I put
down<00:02:06.329> some<00:02:06.390> paste<00:02:06.899> wax<00:02:07.229> on<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.860> just<00:02:08.640> keeps

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
down some paste wax on that just keeps

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.380 
down some paste wax on that just keeps
the<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.959> leg<00:02:10.289> from<00:02:10.739> glue<00:02:11.099> or<00:02:11.370> from<00:02:11.670> sticking

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
the the leg from glue or from sticking

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.790

itself<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.200> form

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800

to<00:02:14.220> be<00:02:14.430> able<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:14.760> get<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.120> form<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:16.290> legs

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
to be able to get the form and the legs

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.620 
to be able to get the form and the legs
separated<00:02:17.280> much<00:02:17.640> easier<00:02:18.060> if<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:18.210> put<00:02:18.270> down<00:02:18.600> a

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
separated much easier if you put down a

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.120 
separated much easier if you put down a
layer<00:02:18.900> of<00:02:19.020> wax<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:21.030> form<00:02:21.300> I<00:02:21.480> made<00:02:21.750> out<00:02:22.110> of<00:02:22.560> MDF

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
layer of wax the form I made out of MDF

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.910 
layer of wax the form I made out of MDF
board<00:02:23.490> I<00:02:23.760> just<00:02:24.330> cut<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.840> shape<00:02:25.110> for<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.650> the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
board I just cut a shape for the the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.460 
board I just cut a shape for the the
angle<00:02:26.420> that<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.450> wanted<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:27.960> bend<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.320> wood

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
angle that I wanted to bend the wood

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.870 
angle that I wanted to bend the wood
over<00:02:29.780> just<00:02:30.780> used<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.710> router<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.250> made<00:02:32.640> two

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
over just used a router and made two

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.850 
over just used a router and made two
more<00:02:33.090> of<00:02:33.240> those<00:02:33.420> glue<00:02:33.930> them<00:02:34.110> all<00:02:34.170> together<00:02:34.440> and

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
more of those glue them all together and

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.580 
more of those glue them all together and
glue<00:02:35.040> them<00:02:35.160> onto<00:02:35.370> an<00:02:35.610> MDF<00:02:36.030> board<00:02:36.410> which<00:02:37.410> I

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
glue them onto an MDF board which I

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.140 
glue them onto an MDF board which I
found<00:02:37.890> to<00:02:38.100> be<00:02:38.130> pretty<00:02:38.520> good<00:02:40.520> at<00:02:41.520> least<00:02:41.910> for

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
found to be pretty good at least for

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.610 
found to be pretty good at least for
making<00:02:42.420> forms<00:02:42.780> some<00:02:42.990> people<00:02:43.290> like<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.590> use

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
making forms some people like to use

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.550 
making forms some people like to use
birch<00:02:44.070> plywood<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:45.000> if<00:02:45.120> I<00:02:45.180> just<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.840> MDF<00:02:46.290> works

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
birch plywood so if I just the MDF works

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.170 
birch plywood so if I just the MDF works
great<00:02:46.860> for<00:02:46.890> me<00:02:47.130> especially<00:02:47.970> if<00:02:48.060> you're

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
great for me especially if you're

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.630 
great for me especially if you're
putting<00:02:48.360> down<00:02:48.600> wax<00:02:49.070> so<00:02:50.070> now<00:02:50.190> you<00:02:50.280> can<00:02:50.400> see<00:02:50.520> the

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
putting down wax so now you can see the

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.490 
putting down wax so now you can see the
process<00:02:50.850> just<00:02:51.420> kind<00:02:51.630> of<00:02:51.690> begins<00:02:52.050> here<00:02:52.350> you're

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
process just kind of begins here you're

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.500 
process just kind of begins here you're
just<00:02:52.590> going<00:02:52.800> to<00:02:52.890> put<00:02:53.100> down<00:02:53.130> a<00:02:53.280> nice<00:02:53.580> good

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
just going to put down a nice good

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.820 
just going to put down a nice good
coating<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:55.020> glue<00:02:55.430> in<00:02:56.430> between<00:02:56.490> each<00:02:57.180> of<00:02:57.240> these

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
coating of glue in between each of these

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.670 
coating of glue in between each of these
little<00:02:58.830> ash<00:02:59.130> pieces<00:02:59.910> of<00:03:00.030> wood<00:03:00.470> I'm<00:03:01.470> using

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
little ash pieces of wood I'm using

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.310 
little ash pieces of wood I'm using
tight<00:03:02.040> bottom<00:03:02.250> too<00:03:02.930> which<00:03:03.930> will<00:03:04.110> definitely

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
tight bottom too which will definitely

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.740 
tight bottom too which will definitely
do<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:04.710> trick<00:03:05.070> if<00:03:05.100> it<00:03:05.520> wouldn't<00:03:06.420> be<00:03:06.570> bad

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
do the trick if it wouldn't be bad

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:07.880 
do the trick if it wouldn't be bad
though<00:03:06.990> if<00:03:07.140> you<00:03:07.260> wanted<00:03:07.470> to<00:03:07.560> pay<00:03:07.680> a<00:03:07.710> little

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
though if you wanted to pay a little

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.340 
though if you wanted to pay a little
more<00:03:08.130> get<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.430> type<00:03:08.610> bond<00:03:08.820> three<00:03:09.210> that<00:03:10.200> would

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
more get the type bond three that would

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.050 
more get the type bond three that would
do<00:03:10.530> fine<00:03:10.740> too<00:03:11.010> you're<00:03:11.580> just<00:03:11.760> going<00:03:11.910> to<00:03:11.970> put

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
do fine too you're just going to put

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.610 
do fine too you're just going to put
down<00:03:12.180> a<00:03:12.210> nice<00:03:12.390> layer<00:03:12.690> of<00:03:12.720> glue<00:03:12.930> between<00:03:13.200> each

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
down a nice layer of glue between each

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.570 
down a nice layer of glue between each
of<00:03:13.650> these<00:03:14.390> setting<00:03:15.390> one<00:03:15.570> on<00:03:15.720> top<00:03:15.870> of<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.200> other

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
of these setting one on top of the other

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.720 
of these setting one on top of the other
I'm<00:03:17.580> using<00:03:17.850> an<00:03:18.120> ink<00:03:18.360> roller<00:03:19.160> to<00:03:20.160> spread<00:03:20.580> the

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
I'm using an ink roller to spread the

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.940 
I'm using an ink roller to spread the
glue<00:03:20.850> out<00:03:21.120> that's<00:03:21.810> just<00:03:22.110> so<00:03:22.200> I<00:03:22.230> can<00:03:22.470> work<00:03:22.650> fast

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
glue out that's just so I can work fast

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.500 
glue out that's just so I can work fast
and<00:03:23.190> efficiently<00:03:23.730> if<00:03:23.880> I<00:03:23.970> got<00:03:24.120> one<00:03:24.239> of<00:03:24.360> those

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
and efficiently if I got one of those

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.090 
and efficiently if I got one of those
little<00:03:24.690> glue<00:03:24.959> brushes<00:03:25.470> it<00:03:25.620> would<00:03:25.709> just<00:03:25.890> take<00:03:26.040> a

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
little glue brushes it would just take a

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.590 
little glue brushes it would just take a
while<00:03:26.400> to<00:03:27.350> spread<00:03:28.350> it<00:03:28.500> all<00:03:28.590> out<00:03:29.360> as<00:03:30.360> you<00:03:30.540> can

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
while to spread it all out as you can

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.020 
while to spread it all out as you can
see<00:03:30.750> this<00:03:30.930> process<00:03:31.470> you<00:03:31.680> just<00:03:31.820> just<00:03:32.820> keep

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
see this process you just just keep

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.960 
see this process you just just keep
going<00:03:33.360> along<00:03:33.450> and<00:03:34.280> try<00:03:35.280> and<00:03:35.430> move<00:03:35.520> somewhat

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
going along and try and move somewhat

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.880 
going along and try and move somewhat
efficiently<00:03:36.510> you<00:03:36.630> have<00:03:36.810> a<00:03:36.840> little<00:03:37.590> bit<00:03:37.770> of

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
efficiently you have a little bit of

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.840 
efficiently you have a little bit of
time<00:03:38.100> in<00:03:38.910> between<00:03:40.070> this<00:03:41.070> set<00:03:41.310> or<00:03:41.489> for<00:03:41.730> the

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
time in between this set or for the

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.180 
time in between this set or for the
set-up<00:03:42.209> time<00:03:42.420> of<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.870> pieces<00:03:43.140> of<00:03:43.290> wood<00:03:43.560> so<00:03:44.100> you

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
set-up time of the pieces of wood so you

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.650 
set-up time of the pieces of wood so you
know<00:03:44.280> it<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.459> be<00:03:44.489> a<00:03:44.610> huge<00:03:44.940> rush<00:03:45.209> but<00:03:45.450> you<00:03:45.510> don't

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
know it to be a huge rush but you don't

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.820 
know it to be a huge rush but you don't
want<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:45.840> work<00:03:45.959> efficiently

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
want to work efficiently

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.580 
want to work efficiently
any<00:03:47.340> time<00:03:47.580> you're<00:03:47.700> gluing<00:03:47.910> something<00:03:48.270> up<00:03:48.590> for

the clamping process I put one clamp

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.160 
the clamping process I put one clamp

everything is dry and you want to use a

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.990 
everything is dry and you want to use a
lot<00:04:52.080> of<00:04:52.110> clamps<00:04:52.560> as<00:04:52.680> you<00:04:52.830> can<00:04:52.949> see<00:04:53.160> that's<00:04:53.729> just

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
lot of clamps as you can see that's just

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.850 
lot of clamps as you can see that's just
one<00:04:54.410> bar<00:04:55.410> stool<00:04:55.740> leg<00:04:56.039> and<00:04:56.340> I<00:04:56.819> think<00:04:57.210> I<00:04:57.870> can't

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
one bar stool leg and I think I can't

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.020 
one bar stool leg and I think I can't
remember<00:04:58.889> off<00:04:59.190> the<00:04:59.220> top<00:04:59.340> of<00:04:59.520> my<00:04:59.610> head<00:04:59.819> but<00:04:59.970> I

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
remember off the top of my head but I

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.300 
remember off the top of my head but I
believe<00:05:00.300> I<00:05:00.419> used<00:05:00.479> like<00:05:00.930> 12<00:05:01.199> or<00:05:01.410> 13<00:05:01.440> clamps<00:05:02.280> just

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
believe I used like 12 or 13 clamps just

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.480 
believe I used like 12 or 13 clamps just
for<00:05:02.669> one<00:05:02.849> leg<00:05:03.090> and<00:05:03.389> I<00:05:04.169> made<00:05:04.380> six<00:05:04.710> bar<00:05:04.979> stools<00:05:05.310> at

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
for one leg and I made six bar stools at

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.589 
for one leg and I made six bar stools at
the<00:05:05.610> time<00:05:05.820> so<00:05:06.180> you<00:05:06.419> can<00:05:07.050> tell<00:05:07.259> it's<00:05:07.800> a<00:05:08.599> lengthy

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599 
the time so you can tell it's a lengthy

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:11.689 
the time so you can tell it's a lengthy
process<00:05:10.020> to<00:05:10.349> go<00:05:10.680> through<00:05:10.710> to<00:05:11.099> make<00:05:11.130> each<00:05:11.520> of

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
process to go through to make each of

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.029 
process to go through to make each of
these<00:05:11.820> legs<00:05:12.120> but<00:05:12.389> once<00:05:13.020> you're<00:05:13.199> finished<00:05:13.410> you

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 
these legs but once you're finished you

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:16.969 
these legs but once you're finished you
have<00:05:14.430> a<00:05:14.610> great<00:05:14.910> product<00:05:15.289> you<00:05:16.289> can<00:05:16.500> work<00:05:16.710> these

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
have a great product you can work these

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:20.600 
have a great product you can work these
legs<00:05:17.310> just<00:05:17.820> about<00:05:18.120> as<00:05:19.039> rough<00:05:20.039> as<00:05:20.310> you<00:05:20.460> would

it<00:05:46.050> might<00:05:46.229> stick<00:05:46.560> a<00:05:46.590> little<00:05:46.860> bit<00:05:46.979> but<00:05:47.280> it

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
it might stick a little bit but it

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.490 
it might stick a little bit but it
should<00:05:47.550> just<00:05:47.699> pop<00:05:47.789> right<00:05:48.000> off<00:05:48.419> of<00:05:48.449> there<00:05:48.810> you
