S and then be like s and then as you can
see<00:01:25.920> it's<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:27.000> difficult<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.810> get<00:01:28.290> them<00:01:28.470> all

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770

position especially if you're writing

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.850 
position especially if you're writing
out<00:01:34.619> something<00:01:35.159> long<00:01:35.400> like<00:01:36.320> what<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.650> long

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860

an<00:02:29.090> A<00:02:29.270> and<00:02:30.640> then<00:02:31.640> we<00:02:31.760> can<00:02:31.910> copy<00:02:32.210> that<00:02:32.510> again<00:02:32.720> and

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
an A and then we can copy that again and

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.200 
an A and then we can copy that again and
change<00:02:33.080> it<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.380> an<00:02:33.470> M<00:02:36.010> there<00:02:37.010> you<00:02:37.190> go<00:02:37.370> look<00:02:38.030> how

change it to an M there you go look how

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.880 
change it to an M there you go look how
they're<00:02:38.570> all<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.960> same<00:02:38.990> size<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.770> they're

more and more and more and look at that

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.850 
more and more and more and look at that
shadowing<00:03:49.640> look<00:03:50.060> how<00:03:50.209> nice<00:03:50.390> that<00:03:50.420> looks<00:03:50.860> and

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
shadowing look how nice that looks and

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.350 
shadowing look how nice that looks and
put<00:03:52.010> one<00:03:52.190> there<00:03:52.220> and<00:03:52.459> then<00:03:52.760> we're<00:03:52.850> gonna<00:03:52.910> copy
