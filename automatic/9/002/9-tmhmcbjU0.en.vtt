00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:06.610 

so<00:00:02.879> this<00:00:03.030> video<00:00:03.360> is<00:00:04.520> regarding<00:00:05.520> the<00:00:05.640> Samsung

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:06.620 
so this video is regarding the Samsung

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.330 
so this video is regarding the Samsung
and<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.950> clicking<00:00:08.849> noise<00:00:09.030> that<00:00:09.809> it<00:00:09.900> makes

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:10.340 
and the clicking noise that it makes

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.379 
and the clicking noise that it makes
obviously<00:00:11.340> there's<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.610> lot<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.179> money

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
obviously there's a lot of the money

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.900 
obviously there's a lot of the money
internet<00:00:12.780> which<00:00:13.139> or<00:00:14.009> on<00:00:14.160> YouTube<00:00:14.580> that<00:00:14.790> I've

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
internet which or on YouTube that I've

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.660 
internet which or on YouTube that I've
seen<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.389> but<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.410> can't<00:00:16.770> find<00:00:16.980> anything<00:00:17.250> for

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
seen and but I can't find anything for

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:25.009 
seen and but I can't find anything for
the<00:00:17.820> plasma<00:00:18.420> so<00:00:20.990> my<00:00:21.990> model<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.560> plasma<00:00:24.019> 42

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
the plasma so my model is a plasma 42

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:32.089 
the plasma so my model is a plasma 42
inch<00:00:25.230> model<00:00:25.859> number<00:00:26.130> HP<00:00:27.349> t4<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.619> 64<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:31.099> it's

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
inch model number HP t4 to 64 and it's

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.819 
inch model number HP t4 to 64 and it's
suddenly<00:00:33.320> when<00:00:34.320> turned<00:00:34.590> on<00:00:35.480> had<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.719> very<00:00:37.559> loud

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
suddenly when turned on had to very loud

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.910 
suddenly when turned on had to very loud
pops<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.640> then<00:00:39.360> started<00:00:40.170> clicking<00:00:40.530> and

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
pops and then started clicking and

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.240 
pops and then started clicking and
cycling<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:42.660> was<00:00:42.809> ongoing<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.649> just<00:00:43.860> never

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
cycling it was ongoing and it just never

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.369 
cycling it was ongoing and it just never
comes<00:00:44.520> on<00:00:44.700> anymore<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.809> I'll<00:00:45.870> show<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.140> the

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
comes on anymore so I'll show you the

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:59.180 
comes on anymore so I'll show you the
noise<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.890> makes<00:00:57.590> that's<00:00:58.590> coming<00:00:58.980> from

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
noise that it makes that's coming from

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:11.030 
noise that it makes that's coming from
up<00:00:59.489> here<00:00:59.760> somewhere

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.010 

that's<00:01:11.610> it

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.020 

and<00:01:15.020> so<00:01:15.730> many<00:01:16.730> of<00:01:16.850> you<00:01:17.000> have<00:01:18.820> mentioned<00:01:19.820> the

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
and so many of you have mentioned the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.240 
and so many of you have mentioned the
capacitors<00:01:23.110> actually<00:01:24.110> most<00:01:24.320> of<00:01:24.470> you<00:01:24.590> they<00:01:25.100> say

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
capacitors actually most of you they say

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.850 
capacitors actually most of you they say
it's<00:01:25.370> a<00:01:25.400> capacitor<00:01:25.940> issue<00:01:26.150> but<00:01:27.050> I've<00:01:27.500> looked

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
it's a capacitor issue but I've looked

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:34.690 
it's a capacitor issue but I've looked
on<00:01:27.980> my<00:01:28.130> boards<00:01:29.080> and<00:01:30.730> my<00:01:31.730> capacitors<00:01:33.160> look<00:01:34.160> fine

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
on my boards and my capacitors look fine

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.750 
on my boards and my capacitors look fine
the<00:01:35.570> only<00:01:35.930> one<00:01:36.170> that<00:01:36.410> I'm<00:01:36.530> questioning<00:01:37.160> are

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
the only one that I'm questioning are

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.980 
the only one that I'm questioning are
these<00:01:38.630> very<00:01:39.020> large<00:01:39.410> ones<00:01:40.540> which<00:01:41.540> are<00:01:41.750> a<00:01:41.960> very

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
these very large ones which are a very

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.740 
these very large ones which are a very
high<00:01:42.410> voltage<00:01:42.890> and<00:01:45.040> 450<00:01:46.040> volts<00:01:46.250> and<00:01:46.750> I'm

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
high voltage and 450 volts and I'm

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.510 
high voltage and 450 volts and I'm
really<00:01:48.080> not<00:01:48.260> sure<00:01:48.320> it's<00:01:48.740> those<00:01:48.979> I've<00:01:49.280> seen

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
really not sure it's those I've seen

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.270 
really not sure it's those I've seen
other<00:01:49.820> people<00:01:50.060> change

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
other people change

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.390 
other people change
the<00:01:52.910> other<00:01:53.060> capacitors<00:01:53.660> or<00:01:54.380> other<00:01:54.710> capacitors

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
the other capacitors or other capacitors

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.880 
the other capacitors or other capacitors
at<00:01:56.000> a<00:01:56.090> much<00:01:56.300> lower<00:01:56.510> voltage<00:01:56.780> but<00:01:57.200> mine<00:01:59.770> seem<00:02:00.770> to

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
at a much lower voltage but mine seem to

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.430 
at a much lower voltage but mine seem to
be<00:02:01.010> fine<00:02:01.280> and<00:02:01.580> I'm<00:02:02.360> really<00:02:02.630> not<00:02:02.840> sure<00:02:02.900> what

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
be fine and I'm really not sure what

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.169 
be fine and I'm really not sure what
would<00:02:03.590> have<00:02:03.710> made<00:02:03.920> that<00:02:04.160> loud<00:02:04.600> popping<00:02:05.600> noise

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
would have made that loud popping noise

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:10.240 
would have made that loud popping noise
so<00:02:08.179> I<00:02:08.209> don't<00:02:08.510> see<00:02:08.660> anything<00:02:08.899> that's<00:02:09.200> blown<00:02:09.679> or

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
so I don't see anything that's blown or

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.880 
so I don't see anything that's blown or
anything<00:02:10.700> that's<00:02:11.000> out<00:02:11.180> of<00:02:11.209> the<00:02:11.390> ordinary<00:02:11.890> so

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
anything that's out of the ordinary so

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.070 
anything that's out of the ordinary so
if<00:02:13.340> anybody<00:02:13.700> could<00:02:13.850> help<00:02:14.420> me<00:02:14.510> out<00:02:14.570> with<00:02:14.660> that

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
if anybody could help me out with that

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.110 
if anybody could help me out with that
again<00:02:15.620> it's<00:02:15.980> a<00:02:16.130> 42<00:02:16.550> inch<00:02:16.700> plasma<00:02:17.320> model<00:02:18.320> number

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
again it's a 42 inch plasma model number

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.979 
again it's a 42 inch plasma model number
HPT<00:02:20.120> for<00:02:21.160> 264<00:02:22.239> I'd<00:02:23.239> appreciate<00:02:23.720> any<00:02:23.750> help

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
HPT for 264 I'd appreciate any help

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.590 
HPT for 264 I'd appreciate any help
