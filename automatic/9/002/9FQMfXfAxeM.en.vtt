00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.980
 yeah it's this balloon recovery 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.270
 Parisian with verra says he is alone 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.070
 we can deliver mobile this shift towards 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:24.210
 the guard the surface the luca hook 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.210
 savard and nevers pastore 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.240
 good percussion that had resulted in 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.879
 a situation for the paris saint 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.280
 germain and has settled since to the east 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:37.420
 Mom pythie in the really 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.790
 in the truth zone 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.920
 offensively and then actually 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.550
 the extraordinary lukasz work there 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.570
 down on right side and pastore obioma ya 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.160
 a gap class between the two 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.920
 teams but for now on this match 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.989
 the break is not done yet it's going us 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.989
 talk from behind to durban in front of the goal 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.339
 watch out for the greeks the break is done 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.840
 paris won recently here but they have 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.409
 evil and not the insults we 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.010
 actually that's exactly where 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.340
 must work 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.720
 this psg there on this this right expert 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.480
 while at their control banks 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.910
 and it's really very good tonight 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.260
 once again a time of songs of which 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.770
 four against four 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:29.090
 javier pastore with the v10 and radio 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.090
 finally a goal against the goal 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.960
 he was at fault on equalizing 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:42.840
 Girondin was at fault is a moment 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.250
 given where we thought we thought the scene 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.049
 it is pastore who recovers and see 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.840
 when he does not hit back in 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.649
 back we insisted on that since beginning 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.280
 of the meeting 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.530
 this is the first time paris has brought a 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.049
 against the button is useless to 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.280
 rush you have the advantage to score 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.450
 or keep the ball 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.020
 loquacious 80 pastor who is looking for cavani 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.660
 in the surface in madrid and finally 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.929
 it's 3 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.180

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.950

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.670

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.909

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.769
 two riders who wants that m for 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:25.120
