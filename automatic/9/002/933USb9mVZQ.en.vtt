00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.380
 good afternoon dear followers of ours 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.370
 channel today i would like 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:13.309
 tell the legendary model of sneakers 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:15.540
 new balance model ml500 74 cheese 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.300
 because I am an employee 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.230
 trade sphere 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:27.180
 shoes and clothes I would like to highlight this 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.240
 model for its very high qualities in 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.440
 socks 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:38.040
 wear resistance abrasion to the soul 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:40.829
 let's talk about this model first 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.329
 what I would like to say it very much 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:49.140
 soft tanned suede + of this material 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.879
 what's the fact that in negative weather this 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.610
 material when he will be able to 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.850
 wet burst almost can not 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.070
 difference from skin is a very big plus 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.670
 but the minus of this stuff is that they 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.930
 very quickly gets wet further 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.810
 would say separately about the mesh grid here 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.630
 invented for good reason 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.500
 that if there had been inset with leather 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.860
 or suede 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.860
 it is a place of permanent wear that is 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.049
 sooner or later or there was a crack either 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.790
 a hole formed 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:27.750
 Komi in this regard will be even sustainable 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:32.810
 than suede and leather the next thing I wanted 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:36.060
 would mark this nose cross of the 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:39.360
 it is made constructively so many 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.549
 people who are constantly well to find out what 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.729
 us and come off and as a result 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.710
 hooks here constructive what is 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.270
 what to tear off this nose or peel off 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:54.610
 almost impossible but to me it is not 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:57.310
 succeeded in two years further sole 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.820
 the sole is made of very durable 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.770
 puritans how would this be the main material 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.740
 for these sneakers 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.350
 erasability well, that is, the heel I erased where 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.759
 that year 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.450
 active legs and wore them all 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:17.020
 seasons all four seasons 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.810
 I would like to say more about the sole 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:25.690
 it turns out not combined that is 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:27.700
 here the foam goes further polyurethane here 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.520
 in my opinion I don't remember 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:37.239
 or something like that just a little foam 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:41.430
 denser so on would like separately 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.430
 highlight back 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.440
 then here it will show this material it is very 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.980
 a long time not getting enough sleep is a very big 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.290
 a plus 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.480
 when foam shoes get enough sleep 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.480
 overwhelms here it doesn't happen 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:28.640
 I would like to pay attention not 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:32.330
 know now see or not see here 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:37.910
 in this language there where designation 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:39.410
 the letter m is used well, as if it never 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.239
 speak but secretly there is such 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.920
 information about what if this icon 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.310
 enlightened by ultraviolet here this part 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.760
 that other color will glow then 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.080
 there is it says about the authenticity of sneakers 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.340
 at the time of this writing, we have this 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:57.819
 information can not check 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:04:07.250
 UV lamp is not so further 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:13.000
 still highlight what sneakers do in 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:17.329
 vietnam model this 2013 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.350
 I can even say personally from myself 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:23.870
 currently with the current euro rate this 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:28.190
 the model is not cheap enough that is 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.610
 its not 6 7 thousand at old prices you can 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:35.460
 had to buy there 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:42.300
 without syla 45 thousand in general, it was possible for 3 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:44.039
 500 take 4 + than that for this money in 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.439
 really get the quality of new even 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:49.379
 if you have one particular ax 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:51.509
 work and every day wear something real 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:53.400
 term socks continuous but not less than a year 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:55.919
 I personally wore 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.590
 youtube model is two years old 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:03.180
 My shoe model was around a dozen 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.120
 that is, this model and attributed somewhere 2 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.879
 of the year 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:11.669
 you can wash it with a bang 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:13.080
 hanging out on at 20 25 growth washing she 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:14.789
 endures nothing gets unstuck 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.710
 nothing falls off solely at 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:18.300
 I had sneakers 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.340
 I am also a model in the burgundy color 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.139
 It was after washing it slowly 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.139
 begins to brighten that is maroon 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:27.659
 turned light maroon otherwise 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.270
 but everything is fine no complaints 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:33.000
 not 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:35.639
 suede cleaned click suede that is with 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.190
 this problem does not have many 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:40.529
 pushes off just suede well believe it 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.779
 it's better than leather is mine 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:46.349
 subjective opinion it may differ 

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:50.310
 from yours in general, all that I would like
