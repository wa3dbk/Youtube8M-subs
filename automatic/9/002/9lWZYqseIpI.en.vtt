00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.520
 hello again less to another video other 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.779
 good this new one is considered a top 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.270
 Fine and nothing like that 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.610
 good are 7 so stofile person but 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:13.580
 it's not finished, we're just going 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.560
 to talk about the 7 evolution of the seven 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.600
 ways to evolve stranger than 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.060
 there's been in pokemon to date 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.030
 pokemon xiii and well let's give our 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.460
 humble opinion of us who 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.380
 who the pokemon with which 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.700
 good with the ways to evolve more 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.340
 strange I think that many already have 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.340
 some in the mind likewise we are going to 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.920
 start here also watching some that 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.290
 They are stranger than others but good 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.550
 they also know that anything 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.440
 want to say is the section of 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.910
 comments for you to tell us 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.489
 what do you think evolution is? 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.410
 stranger but good let's start 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.420
 talking about the seven evolutions of the 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.240
 seven ways to evolve stranger 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.210
 in pokemon 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.520
 we do not have it 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.410
 so far in fact we have to be 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.329
 here in the same sixth generation for 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.850
 one of the strangest evolutions that 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.280
 We have seen 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.070
 well I think nothing here we can see yet 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.509
 sligo evolved another but for 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.150
 evolve the culture has to be 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.130
 at level 50 which is saying ok ok 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.670
 is a type of dragon evolution to levels 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.009
 high which is normal but we can see 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.289
 here to evolve this pokemon 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.440
 does not have to work exactly in the 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:28.270
 level 50 and it is already evolving but 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.520
 we have to be in a place where 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.979
 raining we have to be in some 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.170
 route not city only route where there 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.909
 rain and there give a rare candy to the 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.900
 level 50 for this pokemon 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.760
 evolve 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.640
 if there is no other way to evolve what 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.790
 does not evolve if there is rain in the 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.440
 combat or anything that only if we're 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.100
 on a route where it rains 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:57.150
 in number 4 we have something in the number 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.500
 6 sorry we have mirotic up to third 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.940
 and fourth generation has a way 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.760
 quite strange of evolution this 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.700
 Pokémon evolved by beauty that is 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.369
 we have to do this live beautiful than 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.960
 he knew that a pretty ugly the truth for 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.450
 that evolves we had to reach 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.580
 in total 170 beauty spots with these 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.890
 few I think it was called I do not know if what 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.570
 remember and then raise a level 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.000
 so that this jersey and so that this 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.520
 fib to evolve to bad our 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.830
 quite strange version since I think that 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.980
 is the only beauty evolution not 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:32.049
 I'm very sure but I think so 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.920
 ok at number 5 we have oak 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:37.140
 one would think that 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.880
 the evolution from the previous good 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.739
 I say the revolutions are crossed in 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.620
 personal opinion I have always believed 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:49.090
 that now plas should evolve 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.769
 to excalibur and vice versa but not and 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.989
 good because this candy is weird is 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.400
 an evolution of exchange and evolution 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.709
 it's exchange there are enough in 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.239
 pokemon but hey this is not a 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.010
 exchange which you only have to 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.170
 send a pokémon that you send another and 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.510
 it evolves directly but rather 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.000
 this one needs exact pokemon to 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:11.190
 that evolve for example every blast and 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.420
 chalmette evolve well I think that 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:18.450
 you really have to give the car blas 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.700
 you have to give this shield that 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.740
 has ace the met and is the one that has 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.200
 write and it's revolution pretty 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.520
 I miss that I do not know what he will think in that 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.920
 fifth generation that the truth is 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.290
 pokemon that I love are pretty 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.720
 well designed and everything and all this but 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.450
 has a very very strange evolution the 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.090
 true and good without more than we follow no longer 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:43.230
 to number four 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:46.819
 blanket and tangerine here you can see what it is 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:50.110
 a pokémon type water a little too normal 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:52.930
 a little still pretty nice the truth 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.760
 but hey this water type pokemon has 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.350
 a small covered in a small 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.000
 curiosity to evolve that 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.980
 we need to bring in the team yet 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.050
 remora because they can see you and your 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.750
 evolution man time always brings with it 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.570
 a robot in the fin then what happens 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.900
 we hit the robot with a glue that 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.550
 I do not understand very well because he is 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.530
 remora is always there in its fin 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.900
 but to evolve regrets to show a 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.480
 rumor is in the team and upload it in a 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.549
 good level and this would be number 4 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:25.030
 now let's see the third evolution 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:27.970
 stranger in personal opinions 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.370
 ok another sixth generation it seems that 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.980
 who sixth generation will be a do 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.270
 a lot of noise with the rare evolutions and 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.510
 well here we have one that evolves 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.730
 thanks to a pokémon of another type here 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.610
 we have patch am a pancho and a pang gold 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.190
 why fight and fight type 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.500
 sinister and to evolve to stain to 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:51.010
 bangor or we have to be at the level 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:53.050
 32 and aside to go up one level and bring a 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.479
 Pokemon of sinister type in the team 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.950
 if we do not have a sinister team, 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.960
 it evolves no matter 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.470
 as long as it's a type pokémon 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.470
 Sinister 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.290
 ok now at number 2 we go pretty 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.650
 back we go to the third generation 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.600
 where we have to kneel in English and so 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.670
 line one of my favorite squabbles with 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.580
 many of you will know and well what 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.000
 happens with these pokemon then at the beginning 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.860
 d 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.740
 never gives ninjas is an evolution 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.350
 normal and ordinary evolves the 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.260
 level 20 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.780
 but so they appear online because 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.520
 in each one you can observe h line 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.920
 reding already appears only for some 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:38.190
 strange way since we have to 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:41.220
 evolve on each line to level 20 and 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.350
 apart bring an empty space in the 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:47.010
 equipment so that nothing is given 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:49.830
 appear this this little reding is from 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:52.440
 a rather strange way of 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.870
 that a pokemon appears but 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.280
 well there it is and it is a pokemon that is 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.990
 the best in personal opinion 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.420
 but good is a version too 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:04.600
 strange since two pokemon come out of one 

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:07.330
 just good but good and good now 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.010
 we are at number one in evolution 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.950
 stranger than other many of you 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:13.960
 you know what it is and before the 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:16.060
 show me like and wait a couple of 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.070
 seconds and let you go to the 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.990
 comment section and write which 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.750
 they think it's going to be the most evolution 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:26.190
 strange here I hope you already comment and 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.190
 then we talk about her 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.640
 Well, I think they could have gone to 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.020
 comment and all this so without more than 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.560
 say to not make this video longer 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.850
 We will show in personal opinions 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.480
 the strangest evolution within 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:42.300
 Pokemon 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:44.130
 and here we have the Inca and loves the sea 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.540
 that a lot of you hit on 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.460
 This answer 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.620
 what is because in the street plus the sea is 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.060
 a strange evolution because so that 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.950
 this evolved pokemon I have to be 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.840
 at level 30 

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:56.940
 give him a weird candy so that 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:00.810
 evolve and apart we have to have it 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:03.480
 of head the tri 10 or the 2 of that solar 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:05.250
 free 10x large but it has to be of 

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.980
 head for some strange reason so that 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:10.320
 this pokemon evolve and I feel sincere 

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:13.380
 the truth does not understand what the 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.510
 of nintendo by doing that I could 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.970
 work only in this way but 

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:20.400
 Well anyway, that's how these were the 

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:22.800
 seven ways to evolve stranger 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.360
 inside pokemon and good remember that 

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.920
 you believe that some more strange 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.870
 comment please leave in the 

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.520
 comments and we will take it into account 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.530
 for some other video or any other 

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.450
 thing but for the time thanks for watching 

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:34.710
