really<00:00:55.290> nice<00:00:55.500> soft<00:00:56.040> consistency<00:00:56.820> just

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
really nice soft consistency just

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.270 
really nice soft consistency just
perfect<00:00:58.260> for<00:00:58.590> printing<00:00:59.130> with<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.910> pin<00:01:00.120> press

perfect for printing with the pin press
I'm<00:01:02.280> going<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.550> add<00:01:02.700> just<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:03.390> little<00:01:03.420> bit<00:01:03.810> of

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
I'm going to add just a little bit of

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.010 
I'm going to add just a little bit of
blending<00:01:04.470> medium<00:01:05.280> which<00:01:05.760> will<00:01:06.180> help<00:01:06.390> loosen

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
blending medium which will help loosen

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.530 
blending medium which will help loosen
the<00:01:07.200> ink<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.560> little<00:01:07.770> more<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.760> does<00:01:09.000> have<00:01:09.510> a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
the ink a little more so it does have a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.090 
the ink a little more so it does have a
more<00:01:09.840> fluid<00:01:10.820> feel<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.120> it<00:01:12.330> once<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.470> get<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.860> ink

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
more fluid feel to it once I get the ink

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.399 
more fluid feel to it once I get the ink
to<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.729> right<00:01:15.030> consistency<00:01:15.510> I'm<00:01:16.229> going<00:01:16.350> to

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
to the right consistency I'm going to

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.550 
to the right consistency I'm going to
use<00:01:16.620> a<00:01:16.650> soft<00:01:17.070> rubber<00:01:17.490> brayer<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.720> application

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
use a soft rubber brayer the application

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.070 
use a soft rubber brayer the application
should<00:01:19.830> be<00:01:20.010> a<00:01:20.040> little<00:01:20.580> heavier<00:01:21.000> than<00:01:21.120> printing

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
should be a little heavier than printing

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.789 
should be a little heavier than printing
with<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.650> edging<00:01:23.430> press<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:24.840> blending<00:01:25.350> medium

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
with a edging press the blending medium

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.880 
with a edging press the blending medium
can<00:01:25.979> also<00:01:26.190> be<00:01:26.580> used<00:01:26.940> to<00:01:27.210> do<00:01:27.900> wash<00:01:28.290> effects

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
can also be used to do wash effects

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.039 
can also be used to do wash effects
instead<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.790> putting<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.270> directly<00:01:30.510> in<00:01:31.020> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
instead of putting it directly in the

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.649 
instead of putting it directly in the
ink<00:01:31.440> I'm<00:01:31.710> going<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.130> put<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.490> side-by-side<00:01:32.760> and

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
ink I'm going to put it side-by-side and

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.350 
ink I'm going to put it side-by-side and
then<00:01:34.140> use<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.380> brush<00:01:34.820> this<00:01:35.820> would<00:01:36.060> be<00:01:36.180> like

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
then use a brush this would be like

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.109 
then use a brush this would be like
using<00:01:36.570> water<00:01:37.049> sort<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.830> softens<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.520> up<00:01:38.549> gives

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
using water sort of softens it up gives

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.840 
using water sort of softens it up gives
you<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.270> little<00:01:39.540> bit<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.690> plate<00:01:40.140> tone<00:01:40.700> or<00:01:41.700> you

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
you a little bit of plate tone or you

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.510 
you a little bit of plate tone or you
could<00:01:42.060> use<00:01:42.299> Akua<00:01:42.840> liquid<00:01:43.560> pigment<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.369> it's

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
could use Akua liquid pigment so it's

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.340 
could use Akua liquid pigment so it's
really<00:01:44.790> important<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.299> before<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.900> use<00:01:46.320> it

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
really important that before you use it

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.670 
really important that before you use it
you<00:01:47.040> shake<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.460> up<00:01:49.640> so<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.700> can<00:01:50.729> get<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.000> nice

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
you shake it up so you can get a nice

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.830 
you shake it up so you can get a nice
kind<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.799> gliding<00:01:53.610> line

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:06.590 

I<00:02:03.710> can<00:02:04.710> feel<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.189> pulling<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.880> little<00:02:06.060> bit<00:02:06.210> and

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
I can feel it pulling a little bit and

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.749 
I can feel it pulling a little bit and
that's<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.929> sign<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:07.259> there's<00:02:07.710> not<00:02:08.250> enough

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
that's a sign that there's not enough

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.270 
that's a sign that there's not enough
lending<00:02:09.330> medium<00:02:09.810> in<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.349> ink<00:02:10.590> so<00:02:11.009> it's<00:02:11.190> a

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
lending medium in the ink so it's a

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.940 
lending medium in the ink so it's a
little<00:02:11.640> dry<00:02:14.750> and<00:02:15.750> now<00:02:16.260> it's<00:02:16.470> more<00:02:16.680> fluid

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
little dry and now it's more fluid

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.490 
little dry and now it's more fluid
there's<00:02:17.459> no<00:02:17.580> pulling<00:02:17.940> you<00:02:18.750> want<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.080> ink<00:02:19.260> to

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
there's no pulling you want the ink to

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.210 
there's no pulling you want the ink to
collide<00:02:19.950> across<00:02:20.610> without<00:02:21.060> any<00:02:21.569> resistance

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
collide across without any resistance

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.150 
collide across without any resistance
I'm<00:02:23.220> going<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.489> use<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.790> lint-free<00:02:24.709> paper<00:02:25.709> towel

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
I'm going to use a lint-free paper towel

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.729 
I'm going to use a lint-free paper towel
and<00:02:27.440> clean<00:02:28.440> up<00:02:28.620> some<00:02:28.920> areas<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:30.380> roll<00:02:31.380> over

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
and clean up some areas and roll over

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:41.479 
and clean up some areas and roll over
them<00:02:37.700> you<00:02:38.700> can<00:02:38.940> clean<00:02:39.209> off<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.540> table<00:02:40.489> before

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
them you can clean off the table before

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.140 
them you can clean off the table before
I<00:02:41.730> print<00:02:42.150> I<00:02:42.360> want<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.810> check<00:02:43.110> how<00:02:43.739> even<00:02:44.370> my

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
table surface is it's very important

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.979 
table surface is it's very important
that<00:02:49.079> the<00:02:49.319> table<00:02:49.860> is<00:02:50.010> totally<00:02:50.640> flat<00:02:50.989> the
