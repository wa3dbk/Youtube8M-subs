00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.400
 [Music] 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.380
 hello to all right now i'll you 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.840
 introduce my friend scooby doo at the wheel 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.970
 of a racing car that seemed incredible 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.310
 indeed I cracked on playing because 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.890
 that he proposes to make antics 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.330
 they will propose the vertical and even 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.950
 even to make light effects 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.080
 it is the brand launched it is for the 6 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.789
 years and older but opens the box all of 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.970
 next to see what is really hiding 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.970
 inside 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.129
 we opened the box and there we 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.260
 found our scooby doo well 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.269
 installed inside his car and 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.010
 his remote control as well as notices that 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:45.390
 explain exactly how to do 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.280
 to install the batteries inside 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.080
 and besides about batteries it does not 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.659
 must not forget that six 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.640
 batteries lr6 4 for the toy 2 for the 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:55.290
 remote control that must be thought of 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.790
 buy at the same time as playing for 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.489
 to be able to operate your cheek 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.720
 obviously novel to offer it and 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.720
 now let's get to the test 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.390
 Lets' go 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.240
 I turn on my car right now 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.960
 see what it's going to give to see with the 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.460
 button on here abel already there are all 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.660
 lights that are flashing just now 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.630
 will test it in the dark to see 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.800
 what it really gives then so I 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.980
 my remote control in hand 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.170
 tpr and scooby doo with my little joystick 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.350
 right the jav is powered that 's okay 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.350
 activate 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.680
 already we see that it is able to do 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.030
 some pretty amazing things she does 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.630
 turned right and that makes 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:43.540
 pirouettes with voice grandmother 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.100
 abrupt opposition forget the fortiches 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.920
 so I still have a track 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.660
 yeah I like to be on the right 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.320
 here and I move with this manna is 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:56.710
 agile light recoil this is putting in 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:04.600
 pushing back here it is 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:08.710
 touch then ready to I got right and 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.240
 I'm going to do it before then it patinates a 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.430
 little bit on a little hungry it's 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.740
 normal because we have a very 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.090
 discreet for the test but it's me 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.770
 it was even noticeable to the green in 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.720
 combining the two good evening my 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:26.340
 opposition to it back there the 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.340
 such attention is gone 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.700
 Well, here we feel that it can do 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.260
 things really really 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:39.430
 interesting and now turning off the 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.350
 lights to see what that gives this 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.340
 side 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.379
 here we go 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.379
 [Music] 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.379
 [Music] 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.030
 and so we've seen that 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:00.280
 could offer plenty of opportunities to 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.530
 2002 cabriole the low light effects 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.510
 it's much more beneficial when he 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.370
 there is a little light at all our c'qui 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.069
 dubai is up to what we 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.230
 could we expect him apparently 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.690
 will listen if you want to see others 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.880
 other toys nice appointments 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:27.029
 on me I see why 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:27.029
