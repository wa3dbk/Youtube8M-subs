00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.370 
that stitch and go into the next one and
kind<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.430> making<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.939> circular<00:01:48.540> motion<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.079> that

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
kind of making a circular motion so that

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.210 
kind of making a circular motion so that
I'm<00:01:49.710> locking<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.820> last<00:01:51.180> stitch<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.869> made

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
I'm locking the last stitch that I made

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.100 
I'm locking the last stitch that I made
so<00:01:53.220> this<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.820> way<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.360> flat<00:01:54.720> faul

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
so this is the way that the flat faul

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.300 
so this is the way that the flat faul
stitch<00:01:55.590> works<00:01:56.060> so<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.390> we<00:01:58.350> are<00:01:58.530> interlocking

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
stitch works so that we are interlocking

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.330 
stitch works so that we are interlocking
all<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.880> our<00:02:00.030> stitches<00:02:00.360> together<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.380> we<00:02:02.130> have

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
all of our stitches together and we have

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.149 
all of our stitches together and we have
minimal<00:02:02.880> waste<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.570> fabric<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.380> then<00:02:04.860> on<00:02:05.040> the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
minimal waste of fabric and then on the

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.630 
minimal waste of fabric and then on the
other<00:02:05.189> side<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:06.180> turn<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.630> inside<00:02:07.020> out<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.640> we

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
other side you turn it inside out and we

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.529 
other side you turn it inside out and we
have<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:08.910> flat<00:02:09.450> edge

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
have a flat edge

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.809 
have a flat edge
on<00:02:10.599> the<00:02:11.049> other<00:02:11.200> side<00:02:11.319> that<00:02:12.010> gives<00:02:12.250> it<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.579> nice

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
on the other side that gives it a nice

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.560 
on the other side that gives it a nice
finished<00:02:13.810> appearance
