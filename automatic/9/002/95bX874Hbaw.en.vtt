back<00:04:42.540> that<00:04:43.080> flip<00:04:43.320> up<00:04:43.470> so<00:04:43.680> you<00:04:43.770> can<00:04:43.860> just<00:04:44.010> kind

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
back that flip up so you can just kind

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.830 
back that flip up so you can just kind
of<00:04:44.460> stand<00:04:44.729> it<00:04:44.850> up<00:04:44.970> it's<00:04:45.389> pretty<00:04:45.510> interesting

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
of stand it up it's pretty interesting

also beside the USB port and the the
cords<00:04:48.600> you'll<00:04:48.750> see<00:04:48.930> a<00:04:49.139> few<00:04:49.500> switches<00:04:49.770> and

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
cords you'll see a few switches and

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.260 
cords you'll see a few switches and
that's<00:04:50.280> going<00:04:50.400> to<00:04:50.490> control<00:04:50.729> your<00:04:50.910> polling

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
that's going to control your polling

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.370 
that's going to control your polling
rate<00:04:51.449> and<00:04:51.630> there's<00:04:51.900> also<00:04:51.990> something<00:04:52.260> called

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
they look at keyboards like this and

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.500 
they look at keyboards like this and

do that before we have to like grab an
old<00:05:03.090> keyboard<00:05:03.360> that's<00:05:03.660> really<00:05:03.900> annoying<00:05:04.320> well

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
old keyboard that's really annoying well

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.440 
old keyboard that's really annoying well
with<00:05:05.130> this<00:05:05.220> one<00:05:05.430> if<00:05:05.940> you<00:05:06.060> have<00:05:06.090> that<00:05:06.330> issue

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
with this one if you have that issue

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.120 
with this one if you have that issue
with<00:05:06.720> any<00:05:06.840> you<00:05:07.260> know<00:05:07.350> new<00:05:07.590> motherboards<00:05:08.070> that

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
with any you know new motherboards that

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.620 
with any you know new motherboards that
come<00:05:08.340> out<00:05:08.490> you<00:05:09.000> could<00:05:09.120> just<00:05:09.150> throw<00:05:09.450> it<00:05:09.510> into

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
come out you could just throw it into

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:10.700 
come out you could just throw it into
BIOS<00:05:09.990> mode<00:05:10.260> and<00:05:10.380> that<00:05:10.470> will<00:05:10.560> ensure

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
BIOS mode and that will ensure

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.440 
BIOS mode and that will ensure
compatibility<00:05:11.100> so<00:05:11.729> that<00:05:11.850> you<00:05:11.940> can<00:05:12.090> do

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
compatibility so that you can do

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:13.430 
compatibility so that you can do
whatever<00:05:12.630> you<00:05:12.780> need<00:05:12.930> and<00:05:13.050> once<00:05:13.200> you<00:05:13.260> go<00:05:13.350> back

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
whatever you need and once you go back

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.260 
whatever you need and once you go back
into<00:05:13.680> Windows<00:05:13.919> just<00:05:13.950> change<00:05:14.910> it<00:05:15.030> back<00:05:15.090> to<00:05:15.150> the

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
into Windows just change it back to the

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.030 
into Windows just change it back to the
polling<00:05:15.570> rate<00:05:15.750> that<00:05:15.930> that<00:05:16.080> you<00:05:16.290> want<00:05:16.440> and

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
polling rate that that you want and

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.510 
polling rate that that you want and
you're<00:05:17.130> good<00:05:17.280> to<00:05:17.310> go

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
you're good to go

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.779 
you're good to go
normally<00:05:18.510> I<00:05:18.540> like<00:05:18.780> ps2<00:05:19.350> and<00:05:19.800> and<00:05:20.280> some<00:05:20.490> some

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:20.789 
normally I like ps2 and and some some

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:22.340 
normally I like ps2 and and some some
USB<00:05:21.030> keyboards<00:05:21.479> out<00:05:21.570> there<00:05:21.690> do<00:05:21.840> have<00:05:21.990> a<00:05:22.020> ps2

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
USB keyboards out there do have a ps2

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.690 
USB keyboards out there do have a ps2
option<00:05:22.889> where<00:05:23.010> you<00:05:23.070> can<00:05:23.220> plug<00:05:23.370> up<00:05:23.490> a<00:05:23.550> little

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
option where you can plug up a little

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.090 
option where you can plug up a little
ps2<00:05:24.150> adapter<00:05:24.600> and<00:05:24.750> then<00:05:25.200> have<00:05:25.350> that<00:05:25.380> option<00:05:25.830> to

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
ps2 adapter and then have that option to

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.860 
ps2 adapter and then have that option to
use<00:05:26.250> ps2<00:05:26.699> and<00:05:26.729> I<00:05:26.910> like<00:05:27.060> it<00:05:27.210> for<00:05:27.360> a<00:05:27.419> few

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
use ps2 and I like it for a few

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.260 
use ps2 and I like it for a few
different<00:05:28.139> reasons<00:05:28.229> but<00:05:29.220> one<00:05:29.970> of<00:05:30.000> the<00:05:30.120> biggest

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
different reasons but one of the biggest

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.090 
different reasons but one of the biggest
headaches<00:05:30.630> is<00:05:30.840> the<00:05:31.169> of<00:05:31.380> course<00:05:31.530> the<00:05:31.740> ghosting

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
headaches is the of course the ghosting

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.400 
headaches is the of course the ghosting
and<00:05:32.760> Enki<00:05:33.360> rollover<00:05:33.810> you<00:05:33.990> know<00:05:34.080> not<00:05:34.229> being

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
and Enki rollover you know not being

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.770 
and Enki rollover you know not being
supported<00:05:34.860> this<00:05:35.520> one<00:05:35.729> does<00:05:35.940> support<00:05:36.270> 20<00:05:36.570> key

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
supported this one does support 20 key

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.590 
supported this one does support 20 key
in<00:05:37.530> key<00:05:37.800> rollover<00:05:38.160> so<00:05:38.250> that<00:05:38.370> means<00:05:38.550> you<00:05:39.240> and<00:05:39.510> a

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
in key rollover so that means you and a

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.969 
in key rollover so that means you and a
friend<00:05:39.750> can<00:05:39.930> both<00:05:40.169> be<00:05:40.320> on<00:05:40.350> the<00:05:40.530> computer<00:05:40.860> at
