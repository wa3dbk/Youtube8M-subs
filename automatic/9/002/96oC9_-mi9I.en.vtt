00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:17.620
 hello let's have a simple sheet let's 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.140
 to start with a slipped knot and we're going 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:28.380
 to make 9 chainlets 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:28.380
 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:35.710
 89 chains we are going to write the 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.579
 pattern let's write our 9 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.179
 cadenetas 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.179
 3 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.579
 nine chains as we are going to knit 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:51.879
 around this chain we are going to do 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:55.300
 what we call a chain of rise and 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:59.320
 then let's leave 1 low point on 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.460
 the first chain 1 point medium high 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.180
 next to 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.350
 1 high point 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:12.130
 and another high point we just weave 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:16.180
 our chain of life and we weave 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.880
 our low point then the medium high 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.300
 that simply throwing strand and pulling 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.909
 all together and now the high point 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:31.729
 we bring on we take out in a 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:35.719
 twice and again another high point 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:39.579
 we come to this part of the pattern 1 we go 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:39.579
 to leave in the center 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.939
 12 triple points 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:53.550
 we take zebras twice 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.550
 we have one 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.000
 and students 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:07.970
 triple point and we continue knitting a 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:12.080
 double point 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:14.590
 a medium high and 1 low point 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.030
 so 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.030
 our high point 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:24.740
 our midpoint high 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:29.630
 and the low point 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:31.220
 with this we already have the form of the 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.190
 first part of the sheet 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.110
 now let's complete this side 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.680
 to make the corner knitting two 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.390
 red points more and we will repeat the 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.590
 other side 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.470
 exactly 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.140
 the same points that we have knit for 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.319
 that my sheet is symmetrical and we're going to 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.950
 finish with a dwarf dot of this 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:59.340
 way we have drawn the pattern and 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.080
 we follow weaving around 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.319
 our chain we are in 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.510
 this point we have to add 2 points 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.319
 low 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:13.379
 then we come here 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.379
 we add the low point of the corner 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:20.690
 and let's turn because we're going to get off the 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:23.500
 another side then we touched 1 point 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.500
 medium high 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.260
 and finally 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.590
 our little dot 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:40.420
 dwarf 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:43.569
 and here we have our little leaves being the 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.470
 pattern that we have drawn I hope that you 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.470
 it has been useful
