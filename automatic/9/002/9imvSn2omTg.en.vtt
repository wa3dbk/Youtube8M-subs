00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
melody that's pretty much

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.769 
melody that's pretty much
self-explanatory<00:00:11.639> I<00:00:12.209> think<00:00:12.389> you<00:00:12.450> can<00:00:12.570> follow

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:12.779

that<00:00:13.020> one<00:00:13.230> after<00:00:13.709> that<00:00:15.529> I'm<00:00:16.529> using<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:17.039> sixths

this<00:03:33.920> we<00:03:34.310> could<00:03:34.459> call<00:03:34.640> it<00:03:34.849> an<00:03:35.480> Augmented<00:03:36.099> F

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
this we could call it an Augmented F

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.280 
this we could call it an Augmented F
sharp<00:03:37.430> seventh<00:03:37.909> augmented<00:03:38.450> with<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:39.049> flat

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
five flat line and then into the F sharp

five flat line and then into the F sharp
minor<00:03:43.099> 7th

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.480 

that's<00:03:46.710> a<00:03:46.800> whole<00:03:46.920> lot<00:03:47.070> of<00:03:47.100> stuff<00:03:47.340> it<00:03:47.460> just

c-sharp<00:03:53.290> minor<00:03:53.769> seventh<00:03:54.310> again<00:03:54.579> I<00:03:54.790> think<00:03:55.000> was

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
c-sharp minor seventh again I think was

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.880 
c-sharp minor seventh again I think was
all<00:03:55.209> straight<00:03:55.480> ahead<00:03:55.659> from<00:03:55.900> there<00:03:56.140> oh<00:03:58.890> I

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
all straight ahead from there oh I

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.530 
all straight ahead from there oh I
changed<00:04:00.250> the<00:04:00.459> melon<00:04:00.819> provides<00:04:01.209> it<00:04:01.359> a<00:04:01.390> little

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
changed the melon provides it a little

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:16.490 
changed the melon provides it a little
bit

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.300 

instead<00:04:17.500> of<00:04:17.620> this<00:04:17.739> ending<00:04:20.039> you<00:04:21.039> could<00:04:21.220> do

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
instead of this ending you could do

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:28.050 
instead of this ending you could do
something<00:04:21.579> bluesy

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:37.090 

you

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.160 

I<00:04:37.160> might<00:04:38.120> be<00:04:38.240> a<00:04:38.270> little<00:04:38.510> bit<00:04:38.600> too<00:04:38.780> far<00:04:39.020> out

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
I might be a little bit too far out

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.750 
I might be a little bit too far out
there<00:04:39.440> but<00:04:39.920> a<00:04:39.950> lot<00:04:40.160> of<00:04:40.190> different<00:04:40.520> things<00:04:40.670> you
