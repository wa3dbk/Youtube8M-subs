hello once again although I've got the

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.090 
hello once again although I've got the
fan<00:00:03.000> controller<00:00:03.449> built<00:00:03.780> and<00:00:04.140> I'm<00:00:04.319> really

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
fan controller built and I'm really

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.070 
fan controller built and I'm really
quite<00:00:05.490> happy<00:00:05.730> with<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.180> temps<00:00:06.569> in<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.960> air

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
quite happy with the temps in the air

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.009 
quite happy with the temps in the air
flow<00:00:07.350> I<00:00:07.470> still<00:00:07.799> think<00:00:08.160> that<00:00:08.840> there's<00:00:09.840> room<00:00:09.960> for

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
flow I still think that there's room for

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.780 
flow I still think that there's room for
improvement<00:00:10.230> with<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.650> fans<00:00:10.950> and<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.759> fans

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
improvement with the fans and the fans

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.169 
improvement with the fans and the fans
that<00:00:12.120> I've<00:00:12.240> got<00:00:13.099> the<00:00:14.099> best<00:00:14.549> fans<00:00:14.790> in<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.059> world

that I've got the best fans in the world
I<00:00:15.360> don't<00:00:15.509> think<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.109> as<00:00:16.830> you<00:00:16.949> probably<00:00:17.130> are

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
I don't think and as you probably are

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.390 
I don't think and as you probably are
aware<00:00:17.430> I'm<00:00:17.850> trying<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.570> get<00:00:19.380> my<00:00:19.500> PC<00:00:19.740> as<00:00:20.039> quiet

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
very good job of cooling the hard drives

and whether running on seven balls
actually<00:00:55.350> it's<00:00:55.949> pretty<00:00:56.280> quiet<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.940> salt

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
shifts a fair bit of air so it's not a

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.610 
shifts a fair bit of air so it's not a
bad<00:00:59.129> fan<00:00:59.460> but<00:01:00.059> obviously<00:01:00.359> acquired<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.230> fan<00:01:01.440> at

shifting about this episode of CFM is

shifting about this episode of CFM is
more<00:01:05.040> desirable<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.610> that's<00:01:05.729> what<00:01:05.850> we've<00:01:05.939> got

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
more desirable so that's what we've got

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.200 
more desirable so that's what we've got
in<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.180> front<00:01:06.360> at<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.630> moment<00:01:06.960> in<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.710> back

in the front at the moment in the back
I've<00:01:09.210> actually<00:01:09.360> got<00:01:09.630> one<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.780> these<00:01:10.310> which<00:01:11.310> is

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
I've actually got one of these which is

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.980 
I've actually got one of these which is
a<00:01:12.330> glacial<00:01:13.170> tech<00:01:13.830> 80<00:01:14.790> millimeter<00:01:15.420> fan<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.930> is

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
a glacial tech 80 millimeter fan this is

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.840 
a glacial tech 80 millimeter fan this is
actually<00:01:16.409> he's<00:01:16.530> not<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.710> bad<00:01:16.920> fan<00:01:17.310> for<00:01:17.520> an<00:01:17.580> 18

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850

so<00:01:19.170> kicks<00:01:19.409> out<00:01:19.530> about<00:01:19.650> 32<00:01:20.189> CFM<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.530> I<00:01:22.530> have

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
so kicks out about 32 CFM and I have

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.850 
so kicks out about 32 CFM and I have

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
that one in the back it's not too loud

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.760 
that one in the back it's not too loud
full<00:01:25.860> speed<00:01:26.220> but<00:01:27.180> loud<00:01:27.360> enough<00:01:27.650> to<00:01:28.650> be<00:01:28.680> heard

full speed but loud enough to be heard

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.590 
full speed but loud enough to be heard
we<00:01:29.310> could<00:01:29.460> probably<00:01:29.549> still<00:01:29.790> do<00:01:30.090> better

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
we could probably still do better

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.300 
we could probably still do better
I've<00:01:31.079> actually<00:01:31.320> got<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:31.740> as<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> replacement

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
I've actually got this as a replacement

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.630 
I've actually got this as a replacement
or<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:33.090> potential<00:01:33.420> replacement<00:01:34.070> annex<00:01:35.070> Islands

92<00:01:36.479> millimeter<00:01:36.930> red<00:01:37.170> wing<00:01:37.380> though<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.130> did

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
92 millimeter red wing though I did

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.819 
92 millimeter red wing though I did
notice<00:01:38.520> looking<00:01:38.970> at<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.619> figures<00:01:40.619> on<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
notice looking at the figures on the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.120 
notice looking at the figures on the
back<00:01:41.100> at<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.520> CFM<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.270> are<00:01:42.360> only<00:01:43.130> 27.45

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
back at the CFM so this are only 27.45

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.990 
back at the CFM so this are only 27.45
so<00:01:44.460> it's<00:01:44.640> actually<00:01:44.729> less<00:01:45.060> CFM<00:01:45.680> than<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:47.040> 80

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
so it's actually less CFM than the 80

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.960 
so it's actually less CFM than the 80
millimeter<00:01:48.450> fan<00:01:48.750> though<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:49.860> will<00:01:50.310> do<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.880> at

millimeter fan though this will do it at

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.899 
millimeter fan though this will do it at
just<00:01:51.149> 18<00:01:51.390> decibels<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.380> tells<00:01:52.590> me<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.100> that

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
just 18 decibels it tells me so that

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.819 
just 18 decibels it tells me so that
could<00:01:54.090> be<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.240> lot<00:01:54.390> quieter<00:01:54.659> though<00:01:55.590> for<00:01:55.799> a

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
could be a lot quieter though for a

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.700 
could be a lot quieter though for a
bigger<00:01:56.009> fan<00:01:56.540> to<00:01:57.540> have<00:01:57.659> less<00:01:57.869> CFM<00:01:58.380> this<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.680> a

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
bigger fan to have less CFM this is a

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.800 
bigger fan to have less CFM this is a
little<00:01:59.040> disappointing<00:01:59.909> but<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.360> still<00:02:00.630> might

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
little disappointing but it still might

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.480 
little disappointing but it still might
be<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.990> good<00:02:01.229> solution<00:02:01.350> so<00:02:02.100> what<00:02:02.219> I'm<00:02:02.310> going<00:02:02.430> to

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
be a good solution so what I'm going to

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.670 
be a good solution so what I'm going to
do<00:02:02.759> is<00:02:03.360> I'm<00:02:03.479> going<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.659> connect<00:02:03.960> some<00:02:04.170> fans<00:02:04.439> up

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
do is I'm going to connect some fans up

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.740 
do is I'm going to connect some fans up
I'm<00:02:05.340> gonna<00:02:05.549> bench<00:02:05.759> test<00:02:06.119> them<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.420> just<00:02:06.600> have

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
I'm gonna bench test them and just have

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.609 
I'm gonna bench test them and just have
a<00:02:06.780> listen<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.200> see<00:02:07.350> what<00:02:07.380> they<00:02:07.590> sound<00:02:07.770> like<00:02:07.920> and

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
a listen to see what they sound like and

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.170 
a listen to see what they sound like and
hopefully<00:02:10.619> from<00:02:10.979> there<00:02:11.280> might<00:02:11.849> be<00:02:11.970> able<00:02:12.060> to

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
hopefully from there might be able to

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.460 
hopefully from there might be able to
make<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.360> decision<00:02:12.870> as

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
make a decision as

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.030 
make a decision as
-<00:02:13.560> what<00:02:13.860> we<00:02:13.980> want<00:02:14.130> to<00:02:14.190> go<00:02:14.280> for<00:02:15.770> okay<00:02:16.770> so<00:02:16.800> we've

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
- what we want to go for okay so we've

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.800 
- what we want to go for okay so we've
got<00:02:17.070> some<00:02:17.310> fans<00:02:17.550> running<00:02:17.760> got<00:02:18.450> three<00:02:18.630> phones

levels I was happy with until that was

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.850 
levels I was happy with until that was
running<00:02:48.330> at<00:02:48.450> low<00:02:48.540> speed<00:02:48.870> but<00:02:49.560> since<00:02:49.770> I'm<00:02:49.830> not

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
running at low speed but since I'm not

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.740 
running at low speed but since I'm not
using<00:02:50.100> pwn<00:02:50.610> anymore<00:02:50.940> that's<00:02:51.150> no<00:02:51.300> good<00:02:51.480> for<00:02:51.630> me

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
using pwn anymore that's no good for me

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.340 
using pwn anymore that's no good for me
this<00:02:54.110> he's<00:02:55.110> a<00:02:55.140> little<00:02:55.410> bit<00:02:55.530> quieter<00:02:55.980> than<00:02:56.430> the

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
this he's a little bit quieter than the

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.750 
this he's a little bit quieter than the
active<00:02:58.350> cooling<00:02:58.500> fan<00:02:58.830> that's<00:02:59.459> not<00:02:59.580> bad<00:02:59.730> for

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
active cooling fan that's not bad for

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.850 
active cooling fan that's not bad for
any<00:02:59.910> 2<00:03:00.060> millimeter<00:03:00.450> fan<00:03:00.630> at<00:03:00.780> all<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.740> I<00:03:01.830> think

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
any 2 millimeter fan at all and I think

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.100 
any 2 millimeter fan at all and I think
that<00:03:02.190> push<00:03:02.520> it<00:03:02.640> up<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.790> same<00:03:03.000> air<00:03:03.209> 30<00:03:03.510> 40<00:03:03.840> ohms

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
that push it up the same air 30 40 ohms

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.050 
that push it up the same air 30 40 ohms
is<00:03:04.320> the<00:03:04.440> same<00:03:04.680> as<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:04.830> active<00:03:05.100> cooling<00:03:05.250> so

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
is the same as the active cooling so

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.270 
is the same as the active cooling so
this<00:03:06.180> leaves<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:07.100> silence<00:03:09.200> which<00:03:10.200> I<00:03:10.590> think<00:03:11.130> on

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
this leaves the silence which I think on

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.540 
this leaves the silence which I think on
balance<00:03:11.400> might<00:03:11.910> just<00:03:12.330> be<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:13.020> quietest

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
balance might just be the quietest

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.410 
balance might just be the quietest
though<00:03:14.550> not<00:03:14.730> by<00:03:14.850> much

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
though not by much

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.080 
though not by much
it<00:03:15.510> really<00:03:15.980> struggles<00:03:16.980> I<00:03:17.160> think<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:17.580> be<00:03:17.730> a<00:03:17.910> lot

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
it really struggles I think to be a lot

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.870 
it really struggles I think to be a lot
quieter<00:03:18.560> than<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.709> Glacial<00:03:20.100> take<00:03:20.340> 18

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
quieter than the Glacial take 18

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.600 
quieter than the Glacial take 18
millimeter<00:03:21.890> and<00:03:22.890> of<00:03:23.040> course<00:03:23.220> this<00:03:23.340> doesn't

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
millimeter and of course this doesn't

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:24.890 
millimeter and of course this doesn't
have<00:03:23.730> quite<00:03:23.820> as<00:03:23.910> much<00:03:24.060> air<00:03:24.330> flow<00:03:24.360> though<00:03:24.750> it's

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
have quite as much air flow though it's

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.460 
have quite as much air flow though it's
difficult<00:03:25.050> to<00:03:25.500> really<00:03:26.780> kind<00:03:27.780> of<00:03:27.840> tell<00:03:28.140> what

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.920 
seven volts at a starting voltage but I
have<00:03:44.610> connected<00:03:44.910> this<00:03:45.150> up<00:03:45.269> to<00:03:45.390> five<00:03:45.570> volts<00:03:45.840> and

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
have connected this up to five volts and

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.229 
have connected this up to five volts and
it<00:03:46.019> still<00:03:46.230> spins<00:03:46.530> so<00:03:47.400> I<00:03:47.430> think<00:03:47.910> that<00:03:48.000> is<00:03:48.120> going

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
it still spins so I think that is going

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.610 
it still spins so I think that is going
to<00:03:48.330> work<00:03:48.360> I'm<00:03:49.019> going<00:03:49.080> to<00:03:49.260> try<00:03:49.380> that<00:03:49.410> as

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
to work I'm going to try that as

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.650 
to work I'm going to try that as
Ireland's<00:03:49.950> anyway<00:03:50.250> I<00:03:50.459> think<00:03:50.940> until<00:03:51.330> we<00:03:51.420> get<00:03:51.510> it

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
Ireland's anyway I think until we get it

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.470 
Ireland's anyway I think until we get it
in<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.810> case<00:03:52.760> we're<00:03:53.760> probably<00:03:53.790> not<00:03:54.239> really

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
in the case we're probably not really

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.670 
in the case we're probably not really
going<00:03:54.570> to<00:03:54.660> notice<00:03:54.930> because<00:03:55.049> these<00:03:55.290> funds<00:03:55.500> do

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
going to notice because these funds do

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.610 
going to notice because these funds do
vibrate<00:03:56.510> they<00:03:57.510> do<00:03:57.570> vibrate<00:03:58.080> in<00:03:58.200> the<00:03:58.290> case<00:03:58.440> of

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
vibrate they do vibrate in the case of

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.110 
vibrate they do vibrate in the case of
course<00:03:58.830> and<00:03:59.010> that<00:03:59.100> does<00:03:59.220> cause<00:03:59.400> more<00:03:59.430> noise<00:03:59.790> so

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
course and that does cause more noise so

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.120 
course and that does cause more noise so
perhaps<00:04:00.870> what<00:04:01.350> we<00:04:01.380> really<00:04:01.650> need<00:04:01.769> to<00:04:01.799> be<00:04:01.920> doing

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
perhaps what we really need to be doing

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.970 
perhaps what we really need to be doing
is<00:04:02.250> getting<00:04:02.580> some<00:04:02.790> proper

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
is getting some proper

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
is getting some proper
rubber<00:04:04.980> mounting<00:04:05.430> grommets<00:04:05.730> for<00:04:05.910> these

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
rubber mounting grommets for these

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.479 
rubber mounting grommets for these
rather<00:04:06.239> than<00:04:06.360> using<00:04:06.540> the<00:04:06.690> screws<00:04:07.019> but<00:04:07.350> so<00:04:07.590> well

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
rather than using the screws but so well

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.400 
rather than using the screws but so well
that's<00:04:08.580> the<00:04:08.790> bench<00:04:08.970> test<00:04:09.299> it<00:04:09.959> really<00:04:10.290> is

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
that's the bench test it really is

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.210 
that's the bench test it really is
difficult<00:04:10.620> to<00:04:10.980> tell<00:04:12.650> there<00:04:13.650> is<00:04:13.709> a<00:04:13.769> fair<00:04:14.040> bit<00:04:14.070> of

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
difficult to tell there is a fair bit of

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.969 
difficult to tell there is a fair bit of
noise<00:04:14.430> a<00:04:14.910> bit<00:04:15.150> of<00:04:15.269> ambience<00:04:15.780> that<00:04:15.959> these<00:04:16.140> kick

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
noise a bit of ambience that these kick

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.240 
noise a bit of ambience that these kick
out<00:04:17.190> I<00:04:18.200> always<00:04:19.200> seemed<00:04:19.500> a<00:04:19.560> lot<00:04:19.680> louder<00:04:19.830> in<00:04:20.160> the

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
out I always seemed a lot louder in the

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.920 
out I always seemed a lot louder in the
case<00:04:20.459> and<00:04:20.820> I<00:04:20.880> can<00:04:21.060> only<00:04:21.150> think<00:04:21.359> that's<00:04:21.599> because

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
case and I can only think that's because

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.810 
case and I can only think that's because
of<00:04:22.049> the<00:04:22.140> vibration<00:04:22.770> and<00:04:23.310> also<00:04:23.520> because<00:04:23.729> I

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
of the vibration and also because I

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.250 
of the vibration and also because I
think<00:04:23.880> the<00:04:24.030> case<00:04:24.240> sometimes<00:04:24.479> acts<00:04:24.840> a<00:04:24.990> bit<00:04:25.020> like

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
think the case sometimes acts a bit like

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.450 
think the case sometimes acts a bit like
a<00:04:25.289> trumpet<00:04:25.770> and

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
a trumpet and

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.969 
a trumpet and
fires<00:04:26.699> and<00:04:26.880> lungs<00:04:27.080> but<00:04:28.080> there<00:04:28.259> we<00:04:28.350> go<00:04:28.470> that's

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
fires and lungs but there we go that's

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.980 
fires and lungs but there we go that's
the<00:04:29.130> bench<00:04:29.430> test<00:04:30.440> inconclusive<00:04:31.490> but<00:04:32.990> possibly

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
the bench test inconclusive but possibly

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.839 
the bench test inconclusive but possibly
the<00:04:34.080> silence<00:04:34.680> the<00:04:34.830> excellent<00:04:35.340> story<00:04:35.520> is<00:04:35.669> going

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:35.849 
the silence the excellent story is going

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:38.390 
the silence the excellent story is going
to<00:04:35.910> be<00:04:35.970> the<00:04:36.800> gonna<00:04:37.800> be<00:04:37.919> the<00:04:38.009> best<00:04:38.160> one<00:04:38.250> to<00:04:38.370> go

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
to be the gonna be the best one to go

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.930 
to be the gonna be the best one to go
for<00:04:38.699> we're<00:04:39.000> gonna<00:04:39.120> try<00:04:39.360> it<00:04:39.419> anyway<00:04:39.780> okay<00:04:43.940> so

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
for we're gonna try it anyway okay so

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.689 
for we're gonna try it anyway okay so
we've<00:04:45.270> got<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:45.630> year<00:04:45.870> silence<00:04:46.699> ninety-two

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
we've got the year silence ninety-two

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.850 
we've got the year silence ninety-two
millimeter<00:04:48.180> fan<00:04:48.389> installed<00:04:48.840> in<00:04:48.990> the<00:04:49.080> back<00:04:49.259> and

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
millimeter fan installed in the back and

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.110 
millimeter fan installed in the back and
I'm<00:04:49.979> very<00:04:50.099> happy<00:04:50.310> with<00:04:50.490> that<00:04:50.639> actually

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
I'm very happy with that actually

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.629 
I'm very happy with that actually
because<00:04:51.449> it<00:04:52.139> certainly<00:04:52.590> is<00:04:52.740> quieter<00:04:53.280> than<00:04:53.310> the

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
because it certainly is quieter than the

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.300 
because it certainly is quieter than the
80<00:04:54.270> millimeter<00:04:54.780> fan<00:04:55.020> we<00:04:55.169> had<00:04:55.349> in<00:04:55.470> there<00:04:55.710> on

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
80 millimeter fan we had in there on

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.939 
80 millimeter fan we had in there on
both<00:04:56.550> speeds<00:04:57.000> on<00:04:57.240> the<00:04:57.419> seven<00:04:57.900> volt<00:04:58.110> and<00:04:58.680> under

00:04:58.939 --> 00:04:58.949 
both speeds on the seven volt and under

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:00.980 
both speeds on the seven volt and under
12<00:04:59.220> volt<00:04:59.520> it's<00:04:59.820> really<00:05:00.030> nicely<00:05:00.240> at<00:05:00.479> 7<00:05:00.690> volt<00:05:00.870> at

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
12 volt it's really nicely at 7 volt at

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.080 
12 volt it's really nicely at 7 volt at
the<00:05:01.080> moment<00:05:01.440> so<00:05:02.070> that<00:05:02.310> was<00:05:02.550> a<00:05:02.610> good<00:05:02.820> decision

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
the moment so that was a good decision

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.540 
the moment so that was a good decision
we'll<00:05:03.509> stick<00:05:03.810> with<00:05:04.020> that<00:05:04.169> and<00:05:04.440> probably<00:05:05.370> turn

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
we'll stick with that and probably turn

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.960 
we'll stick with that and probably turn
our<00:05:05.729> attentions<00:05:06.320> now<00:05:07.320> to<00:05:07.550> the<00:05:08.550> fan<00:05:08.759> in<00:05:08.880> the

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
our attentions now to the fan in the

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.060 
our attentions now to the fan in the
front<00:05:09.240> and<00:05:09.870> see<00:05:10.020> if<00:05:10.110> we<00:05:10.229> can<00:05:10.380> get<00:05:10.620> the<00:05:10.919> better

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
front and see if we can get the better

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.870 
front and see if we can get the better
fan<00:05:11.370> than<00:05:12.060> that<00:05:12.300> spire<00:05:13.160> 12<00:05:14.160> centimeter<00:05:14.669> firm

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
fan than that spire 12 centimeter firm

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.810 
fan than that spire 12 centimeter firm
which<00:05:15.599> is<00:05:15.930> quite<00:05:16.470> nice<00:05:16.620> at<00:05:16.800> 7<00:05:17.070> volts<00:05:17.340> but<00:05:17.580> just

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
which is quite nice at 7 volts but just

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.070 
which is quite nice at 7 volts but just
to<00:05:18.090> allowed<00:05:18.360> it<00:05:18.539> 12<00:05:18.780> thanks<00:05:19.620> for<00:05:19.740> watching
