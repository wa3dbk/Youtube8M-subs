00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.529
 wait a minute 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:32.500
 So 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:35.309
 right here I already build a house but 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:39.790
 decided to tell you all the same secret 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:44.920
 happy life you are gleaming ando so 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:47.339
 next we need to say how do you get it 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.589
 materials but now I ’ll be quick 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:55.050
 so I got myself a little bit 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:55.050
 materials so let's build a house 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.620
 here is such a house 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:07.350
 so yes well, here it comes now we will dig 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.350
 here will be my good 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:23.939
 Now I have to go down, we are doing here. 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.939
 remove 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.960
 so so so so well yes we will immediately dig 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.960
 there is a hole for the floor 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.830
 they are no longer there for the territory 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.830
 out 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:53.350
 here we will fill with pebbles 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:56.350
 with stones like this we shoot here 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.350
 blog post 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:04.509
 tag there does not burn you my take 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:09.720
 here we will have a window here too 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.720
 the cat is so here the window 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:18.540
 on symmetrical to we will do so here 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:22.460
 here we put it and here it’s like this 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:27.020
 then put here such a level here 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:30.720
 such stone is good 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:35.370
 here we spend so I ran out of stone 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:40.920
 so I will take another stone 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:45.240
 all however sticks so here we put 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:48.630
 so so here we also replace 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.430
 sure though no let's let it go 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.000
 Almazikov is probably no better 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.000
 emeralds 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.860
 emerald blocks I roll so here and 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.920
 dug a little emerald blocks 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:03.980
 what prettier it was to make such a bezel 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:07.290
 what toilet there only white here 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.140
 so green 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:14.189
 also we need to drip glasses so where 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.159
 where we dig glass we dig glass with 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:20.879
 desert pretty dug up glass 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:23.939
 more precisely the sand yes now we also drip 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:27.840
 a tree there seems to need a little tree 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:31.500
 take so no this is not the tree that 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:35.400
 we need so we need ordinary wood 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:40.489
 here is so I dug a tree processed 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:48.389
 it also in the sticks will make a workbench so 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:49.310
 We put and land this land with a workbench 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.830
 wanted to do 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:56.870
 will do 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:58.790
 so no no no no we made the cat door 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.590
 here we will have one door for now 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.050
 because on the second and not enough then 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.570
 it will be necessary to still drip 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:08.810
 so here and so we are doing the same in the rim 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:13.160
 we get the stove we shove too 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:16.489
 the floor is no longer allowed to melt 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.830
 glass put a little dose there 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:23.510
 who dug up 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:29.060
 it is already night so let's get more 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:31.790
 wallpaper obovёm our house so here in the corner 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:37.600
 let's put it like this 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.600
 and beautiful will be there we will put a pebble 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.860
 so here 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:48.189
 it's asymmetrical here 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.189
 there are two this here and so all is well 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.250
 my glass is melting my dear which 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:00.259
 dug of course again myself 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:02.860
 no one helped me in anything all by myself 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:02.860
 all by myself 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.750
 so well let me stop recording so 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:13.249
 so we continue here it is like batumi 

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:15.499
 intertwined my glass 

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:19.009
 we here insert so on 

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:22.249
 quick everything's ready here 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:26.270
 still melts I just ran dug 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:29.990
 a stack of sand so let's ka i 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:37.270
 I don’t know what to do with krafchu 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:37.270
 wand slightly make another door 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.630
 farther 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:05.960
 experience from somewhere an attempt came to me 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.210
 very strange 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.780
 okay 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.780
 So 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.310
 let them melt again i'll make the chests 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:27.379
 for storing money and other necessary things 

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:27.379
 also we will make prettier 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.080
 here so we take the land 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:38.970
 let's put there things well, although I won't 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:44.130
 because I will soon go digging again 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:49.530
 here I was again given the experience for something someone 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:52.910
 someone does something to me okay 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.910
 let's build a small roof 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:12.900
 So 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:12.900
 my glass melts so let's 

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:23.309
 try to make something glass 

00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:23.309
 panels of them can be like this 

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:31.610
 I do not even know 

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:34.330
 for now let's not do anything on 

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.330
 second floor 

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:38.979
 little song upstairs 

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:54.890
