00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:09.660
 and today we have two caps in one we're going to 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:13.809
 use zucchini chopped already in round 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.980
 ham slices quince quince and cheese 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.460
 cool 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.289
 First put oil on the iron and 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.070
 pour a few drops of oil 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.660
 well well for the zucchini salt and 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.980
 Pepper 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.619
 and once they have to have it done 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.619
 with its fire how this lid is mounted 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.710
 I've been cutting the slices of bread 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.360
 a slice of tomato 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.930
 the zucchini 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.470
 shortly we are going to turn it around 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.470
 the time has come 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.330
 bread 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.000
 and for me 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.000
 and after the bread we will be able to 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.629
 in ham 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.659
 and all in one 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.659
 I like them are well loaded yes 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.920
 in one we are going to put a sweet 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.260
 with tomatoes 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.630
 from the garden that I have the window 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.630
 and now let's put the zucchini 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.020
 on only one side 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.020
 the next ham 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.700
 another from panama 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.260
 the next will be ham 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.210
 tomato 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.330
 just express 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.380
 a trickle of honey 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.380
 as well as the same video 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:10.149
 where do I get these records from 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.980
 Well, you must support 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.800
 I hope you like it 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.910
 and do it 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.410
 and now let's put some pinchitos 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.460
 so there is one to take together 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.460
 I can not escape what's inside 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.080
 here you have it 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.310
 but you see well and always 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.520
 you can use any ingredient 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.520
 two 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.150
 until next time
