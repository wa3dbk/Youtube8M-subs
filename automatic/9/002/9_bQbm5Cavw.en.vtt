00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
think about horror movie remakes Andrea

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.280 
think about horror movie remakes Andrea
um<00:02:49.890> I<00:02:50.310> think<00:02:50.489> that<00:02:50.910> they're<00:02:51.569> not<00:02:51.750> tied<00:02:52.109> to

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
um I think that they're not tied to

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.809 
um I think that they're not tied to
story<00:02:52.560> as<00:02:52.709> much<00:02:52.829> as<00:02:52.980> Joshua<00:02:53.310> think<00:02:53.579> that<00:02:53.700> they

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
story as much as Joshua think that they

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.630 
story as much as Joshua think that they
are<00:02:54.000> but<00:02:54.569> I<00:02:54.780> think<00:02:54.840> because<00:02:55.769> for<00:02:56.040> me<00:02:56.160> horror

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
are but I think because for me horror

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.759 
are but I think because for me horror
movies<00:02:57.030> are<00:02:57.060> less<00:02:57.420> about<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:58.019> story<00:02:58.349> and<00:02:58.560> more

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
movies are less about the story and more

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.680 
movies are less about the story and more
about<00:02:59.069> the<00:02:59.190> gore<00:02:59.459> and<00:02:59.760> like<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.150> jump<00:03:00.390> scares

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
about the gore and like the jump scares

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.630 
about the gore and like the jump scares
right<00:03:00.989> like<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.200> feeling<00:03:01.620> of<00:03:01.920> being<00:03:01.980> really

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
right like that feeling of being really

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.460 
right like that feeling of being really
scared<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:03.420> most<00:03:03.840> of<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.019> remakes<00:03:04.349> that

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
scared and most of the remakes that

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.589 
scared and most of the remakes that
we've<00:03:04.560> seen<00:03:04.799> from<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.129> horror<00:03:05.400> genre<00:03:05.730> are

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
we've seen from the horror genre are

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.720 
we've seen from the horror genre are
these<00:03:07.170> kind<00:03:07.409> of<00:03:07.470> over-the-top<00:03:07.950> horror<00:03:08.400> movies

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
these kind of over-the-top horror movies

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.339 
these kind of over-the-top horror movies
they're<00:03:08.909> not<00:03:09.120> more<00:03:09.359> intellectual<00:03:10.079> horror

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
they're not more intellectual horror

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.170 
they're not more intellectual horror
movies<00:03:10.650> like<00:03:10.799> you<00:03:11.310> would<00:03:11.430> never<00:03:11.579> see<00:03:11.849> someone

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
movies like you would never see someone

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.220 
movies like you would never see someone
trying<00:03:12.359> to<00:03:12.420> remake<00:03:12.690> Silence<00:03:13.019> of<00:03:13.079> the<00:03:13.140> Lambs

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
trying to remake Silence of the Lambs

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.039 
trying to remake Silence of the Lambs
right<00:03:13.680> because<00:03:13.950> it's<00:03:14.099> just<00:03:14.190> too<00:03:14.730> much<00:03:15.239> of<00:03:15.659> like

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
right because it's just too much of like

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.559 
right because it's just too much of like
it<00:03:16.409> gets<00:03:16.680> in<00:03:16.799> your<00:03:16.829> head<00:03:17.159> kind<00:03:17.519> of<00:03:17.639> scary<00:03:18.150> movie

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
it gets in your head kind of scary movie

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.050 
it gets in your head kind of scary movie
mm-hmm<00:03:19.079> I<00:03:19.410> actually<00:03:20.099> like<00:03:20.609> when<00:03:20.790> thinking

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
mm-hmm I actually like when thinking

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.270 
mm-hmm I actually like when thinking
about<00:03:21.180> remakes<00:03:21.780> I<00:03:22.019> don't<00:03:22.200> automatically<00:03:22.859> jump

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
about remakes I don't automatically jump

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.030 
about remakes I don't automatically jump
to<00:03:23.340> horror<00:03:23.639> movies<00:03:24.590> because<00:03:25.590> most<00:03:25.829> of<00:03:25.919> the

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
to horror movies because most of the

is this pinhead gonna be in it that's
the<00:05:14.460> kind<00:05:14.580> of<00:05:14.669> thing<00:05:14.850> yeah<00:05:15.600> but<00:05:15.780> that's<00:05:15.900> the

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
the kind of thing yeah but that's the

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.330 
the kind of thing yeah but that's the
thing<00:05:16.139> that<00:05:16.350> I<00:05:16.380> think<00:05:16.530> is<00:05:16.770> important<00:05:17.130> to<00:05:17.160> keep

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
thing that I think is important to keep

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.100 
thing that I think is important to keep
in<00:05:17.430> mind<00:05:17.460> when<00:05:17.970> we're<00:05:18.419> talking<00:05:18.510> about<00:05:18.690> remakes

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
in mind when we're talking about remakes

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.379 
in mind when we're talking about remakes
is<00:05:19.320> that<00:05:19.470> Evil<00:05:19.830> Dead<00:05:20.010> was<00:05:20.520> the<00:05:20.580> horror<00:05:20.910> comedy

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
is that Evil Dead was the horror comedy

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:23.120 
is that Evil Dead was the horror comedy
and<00:05:21.570> that's<00:05:21.720> its<00:05:21.930> own<00:05:22.080> entity<00:05:22.380> and<00:05:22.650> the<00:05:22.710> remake

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
and that's its own entity and the remake

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.310 
and that's its own entity and the remake
I<00:05:23.400> thought<00:05:23.910> was<00:05:24.090> you<00:05:24.330> know<00:05:24.449> it<00:05:24.630> rains<00:05:24.930> blood
