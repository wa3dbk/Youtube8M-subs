00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 how about guys the new 2k title of 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.859
 gearbox software in the creators of by 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.349
 Borderlands example are exactly the 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.000
 creators of this batter has passed a 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.580
 little unnoticed before before 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.250
 tear three because he has not appeared 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.779
 at least that I have seen and 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.100
 made to enter the conferences has not 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.869
 appeared none of the conferences of 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.430
 none of the companies however is 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.630
 one of the most outstanding titles the one of 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.920
 Many people have said that it is one of the 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.449
 more fun they have played between three 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.380
 who have had a great time 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.910
 Between battlefront and battle born the thing 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.280
 people are the ones who have spoken the most 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.420
 so I think it's worth it 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.610
 everything also because I interview randy 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.010
 pixel at the maximum of the maximum 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.960
 president of jr by software creator 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.360
 also bite them for example and what 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.149
 it's true that he gave me his 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.719
 passion and I wanted to tell you a little bit about 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.789
 that that is what it's good roll 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.320
 WANT box seems to know do things 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.600
 risky and different things and over 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.059
 well that works not because borderlands 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.370
 if you see it is a game that mix rpg 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.570
 with with first person shooter that are two 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.710
 genres that at first seem 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.570
 confronted but nevertheless 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.720
 finally worked wonders in this 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.760
 brother in borderlands when you risk 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.500
 you have two options or else you get 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.810
 it can go very well what it is that has 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.640
 eye can go very wrong as such 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.140
 sometimes I can have left with 'the in colonel 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.820
 Marines that nobody wants to remember 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.790
 him so let's skip what we're going to 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.440
 pretend that this has not happened and we have 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.940
 been testing by state testing the 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.830
 multiplayer and has many things 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.640
 interesting there's campaign there's all that 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.290
 but he told me they did not want to talk 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.520
 of the entry campaign because if it does not go 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.320
 to think the agent that is another 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.330
 borderlands and it's not what they want 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.880
 well as we said is testing the 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.119
 multiplayer is not the same as in 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.410
 borderlands because the multiplayer you 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.119
 character evolves much faster 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.820
 you also have more characters are 25 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.259
 characters and you have three types three 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.300
 new of the game 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.490
 your character evolves to the roll roll 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.130
 league of legends that within a 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.860
 same game as your character goes from the 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.679
 level 1 to the highest level that reminds us 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.509
 which is good you have three types of 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.830
 game one of the game modes that 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.650
 provides is something similar to what you have 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.189
 in destiny that is good with your friends 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.799
 you make a campaign let's say online or 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:19.510
 dynamic or non-dynamic that you have to 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.220
 first charge yourself to some enemies 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.040
 smaller then bigger enemy and 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.720
 then both final that is the really the 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.790
 hard hard to grind no and then you have 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.530
 something more like what a league is 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.230
 of legends or a dota what you have 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.790
 base of your minions and it's a 4 against 4 or 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.359
 5 to 5 I do not know why we have not 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.250
 seen yet 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:41.319
 and then end the opposite nucleus 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.889
 and then a series will appear 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:48.459
 of turrets plus series of enemies that you 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:50.019
 You can buy with coins or 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.000
 credits left by enemies in 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.560
 the soil and that the truth is that it has 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.079
 very good looking and it seems very interesting 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.109
 and of course if he does it well and 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.760
 it works well on a global level 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:03.280
 is going to be a safe online hit because 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.040
 those games you already know how they work and 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.200
 if they weigh it they petan very hard or they do not put it 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.209
 nothing I think that has a very component 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.120
 differential and it's the look that has to 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:15.250
 it's very special 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.700
 the kind of zaidÃ­n that has borderlands 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.470
 and it's not realistic either, it's kind of 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.730
 comic and the truth that you feel 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.590
 feel very good as you can see in the 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.340
 images as well as you already know good bad 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.760
 as you see 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.720
 at 60 fps and cool pretty cool to me has 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.519
 liked a lot 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.379
 you have as I said 25 characters 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:35.409
 then there is another game mode that is 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:38.049
 it's just a classic death match is 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:41.220
 say your against the other and kill you 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:43.920
 against others to kill or to die and 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.599
 even for yes yes no hot cloths 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.980
 pretty cool maps as I said 25 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.690
 exit characters that I guess that 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.549
 Then there will be many others with a 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.019
 pretty good design and we'll see if it 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:55.750
 they manage to balance a bit because the 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:58.359
 vampire that the balls are very much 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.310
 state at the moment although it does not seem 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:01.780
 has a pretty deep campaign mode 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.180
 according to what Randy has told us 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.590
 picture that still needs to be seen at 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.150
 Borderlands style but with the 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.799
 particularity to carry the 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.930
 character at the highest level is not going to 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.190
 cost in 40 or 50 hours if you're going to 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.640
 can try more more characters 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.100
 different to see and who knows 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.530
 and how good that the level rise more 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.079
 faster light will allow you to use 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.910
 as well as people who know more 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.860
 stories the moment the game is at 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.320
 point to enter beta phase words of 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.090
 radio everything I say today is the word of 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.730
 great rapids so if you have something 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.870
 what to say about israel 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.130
 as I say that now that you interview and 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.380
 that you have below the link with the 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.480
 live interview of ign live and 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.130
 well there will be beta at some time like this 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.020
 that we will have to prove it we hope that 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.450
 be early and with regard to the output 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.060
 as you said then between November 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:51.950
 2015 and February 2016 words of yours until 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.950
 then enjoy the images
