cool-down away and it reduces the

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.310 
cool-down away and it reduces the
channel<00:00:28.920> time<00:00:29.250> down<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.910> three<00:00:30.119> seconds<00:00:30.570> now

the little spell power but if you get is
slightly<00:00:33.510> reduced<00:00:34.020> but<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.590> lasts<00:00:34.770> for<00:00:34.950> a

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
slightly reduced but it lasts for a

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.590 
slightly reduced but it lasts for a
minute<00:00:35.280> so<00:00:35.309> it's<00:00:35.640> just<00:00:35.820> basically<00:00:36.000> balanced

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
minute so it's just basically balanced

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.250 
minute so it's just basically balanced
out<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:37.160> and<00:00:38.160> also<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:39.180> twit<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.540> heel<00:00:40.230> i

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
out and and also the twit the heel i

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.590 
out and and also the twit the heel i
believe<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:41.010> twenty<00:00:41.250> percent<00:00:42.440> this<00:00:43.440> chick

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.510 
the same as it was except is now 90
second<00:01:52.259> golden<00:01:53.119> the<00:01:54.119> next<00:01:54.479> change<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.829> frost

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
second golden the next change is a frost

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.429 
second golden the next change is a frost
ball<00:01:56.700> change<00:01:57.149> by<00:01:57.659> mirror<00:01:57.960> images<00:01:58.259> so

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
ball change by mirror images so

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.469 
ball change by mirror images so
basically<00:01:58.860> if<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.040> customer<00:01:59.369> images<00:01:59.729> they<00:02:00.420> do

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
basically if you customer images they do

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.360 
basically if you customer images they do
fifty<00:02:01.049> percent<00:02:01.259> more<00:02:01.439> frost<00:02:01.680> ball<00:02:01.799> damage

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
fifty percent more frost ball damage

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.350 
fifty percent more frost ball damage
so<00:02:03.880> yep<00:02:04.210> how<00:02:04.810> are<00:02:04.930> you<00:02:05.130> judge<00:02:06.130> yourself<00:02:06.790> and

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
so yep how are you judge yourself and

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.220 
so yep how are you judge yourself and
damage<00:02:07.600> on<00:02:07.750> that<00:02:08.880> okay<00:02:09.880> and<00:02:10.119> another<00:02:11.020> real

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
damage on that okay and another real

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.610 
damage on that okay and another real
nice<00:02:11.440> town<00:02:11.680> I<00:02:11.800> like<00:02:12.010> is<00:02:12.250> a<00:02:13.230> scorch<00:02:14.230> is<00:02:14.500> now

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
nice town I like is a scorch is now

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.280 
nice town I like is a scorch is now
baseline<00:02:15.100> for<00:02:15.310> every<00:02:15.670> speck<00:02:15.940> and<00:02:16.150> you<00:02:16.960> now<00:02:17.110> get

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
baseline for every speck and you now get

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.260 
baseline for every speck and you now get
bit<00:02:17.500> you<00:02:17.740> now<00:02:17.830> get<00:02:17.980> blazing<00:02:18.370> speed<00:02:18.670> in<00:02:18.910> the

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
bit you now get blazing speed in the

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.170 
bit you now get blazing speed in the
first<00:02:19.510> talent<00:02:20.200> place<00:02:20.380> this<00:02:21.310> basically<00:02:21.940> is<00:02:22.060> a

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
first talent place this basically is a

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.750 
first talent place this basically is a
second<00:02:22.600> blink<00:02:22.900> because<00:02:23.800> it<00:02:24.130> does<00:02:24.250> it<00:02:24.370> used<00:02:24.640> to

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
second blink because it does it used to

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.570 
second blink because it does it used to
replace<00:02:25.000> blink<00:02:25.420> but<00:02:26.320> now<00:02:26.470> it<00:02:26.560> isn't<00:02:26.680> so<00:02:27.160> yeah

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
replace blink but now it isn't so yeah

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.300 
replace blink but now it isn't so yeah
you<00:02:27.880> now<00:02:28.030> have<00:02:28.210> blink<00:02:28.600> and<00:02:28.840> you<00:02:29.800> can<00:02:29.980> blazing

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
you now have blink and you can blazing

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.970 
you now have blink and you can blazing
speed<00:02:30.550> both<00:02:31.450> of<00:02:31.690> which<00:02:31.840> remove<00:02:32.230> routes<00:02:32.530> and

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
speed both of which remove routes and

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.640 
speed both of which remove routes and
stuff<00:02:33.460> like<00:02:33.700> that<00:02:33.760> and<00:02:34.200> blatant<00:02:35.200> speed<00:02:35.440> may<00:02:35.590> be

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
stuff like that and blatant speed may be

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.800 
stuff like that and blatant speed may be
cast<00:02:35.980> while<00:02:36.130> you<00:02:36.460> are<00:02:36.640> casting<00:02:36.910> so<00:02:37.570> if<00:02:37.720> you

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
cast while you are casting so if you

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.040 
cast while you are casting so if you
have<00:02:37.960> I<00:02:38.200> see<00:02:38.440> flows<00:02:38.710> and<00:02:39.900> you're<00:02:40.900> in<00:02:40.960> the

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
have I see flows and you're in the

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.300 
have I see flows and you're in the
middle<00:02:41.170> of<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.290> cast<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:41.680> can<00:02:41.800> blazing<00:02:42.130> speed

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
middle of a cast you can blazing speed

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.140 
middle of a cast you can blazing speed
away<00:02:42.520> has<00:02:42.850> 25<00:02:43.270> second<00:02:43.600> cooldown<00:02:44.640> basically<00:02:45.640> 10

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
away has 25 second cooldown basically 10

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.700 
away has 25 second cooldown basically 10
seconds<00:02:46.540> both<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:46.810> bling<00:02:46.990> so<00:02:47.440> you<00:02:47.500> basically

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
seconds both and bling so you basically

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.770 
seconds both and bling so you basically
just<00:02:47.980> get<00:02:48.400> a<00:02:48.610> lot<00:02:48.970> more<00:02:49.000> mobility<00:02:49.300> which<00:02:49.690> is

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
just get a lot more mobility which is

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.580 
just get a lot more mobility which is
really<00:02:49.960> nice<00:02:51.330> flame<00:02:52.330> glow<00:02:52.660> replacing<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.440> old

polymorph<00:05:40.550> target<00:05:41.000> so<00:05:41.270> if<00:05:41.419> this<00:05:41.780> guy's

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
polymorph target so if this guy's

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.290 
polymorph target so if this guy's
polymorphed<00:05:42.500> you<00:05:42.650> can<00:05:42.830> pet<00:05:43.640> freeze<00:05:43.850> on<00:05:43.970> top<00:05:44.150> of

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
polymorphed you can pet freeze on top of

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.120 
polymorphed you can pet freeze on top of
them<00:05:44.419> freezing<00:05:44.780> in<00:05:44.870> place<00:05:45.110> and<00:05:45.410> not<00:05:45.620> actually

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
them freezing in place and not actually

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.930

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
yeah that's basically all the changes

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.140 
yeah that's basically all the changes
have<00:05:53.240> made<00:05:53.480> at<00:05:53.900> the<00:05:53.990> moment<00:05:54.410> as<00:05:54.980> of<00:05:55.820> let<00:05:56.030> me
