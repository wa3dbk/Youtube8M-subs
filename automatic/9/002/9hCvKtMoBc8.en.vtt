00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.309
 what happens goals welcome back to 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.770
 rome 2 to a repetition non-repetition 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:14.559
 very curious because I made a 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:17.080
 army of dogs there you see it against a 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:20.020
 friend of mine who came to be reduced with 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.550
 elephants catapults and cars I do not 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.730
 I expected it I did not expect it at all 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.520
 and well my plan was to simply use 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.860
 the dogs massively flood the 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.140
 field of dogs when loading meters 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.570
 archers and then already if that will win the 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.489
 swordsmen who would have out there with that 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.630
 unit that had measured three points 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:42.040
 of sale or what were these here 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.670
 praetorian or if you have had the 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.530
 super super super z2 pretorians and ones 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.000
 dogs that good that could go to win 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.420
 or sacrificing I do not care 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.010
 sacrifice because he had this 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.890
 unit and step to this cavalry 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.780
 also reinforcement is quite curious 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.220
 this battle because it really does not happen 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.680
 what I expected and is for an army 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.199
 more normal and the enemy was caught here 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.060
 this army of catapults fixed 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.429
 see what piece of army of catapults 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.380
 he started to destroy me from a distance but 

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:12.240
 they really were good for me because with 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.100
 my dogs could 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.680
 perfectly to those catapults the only 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.350
 weak point is that this unit is worth 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.540
 very light very very light 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.890
 but it is not light enough 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.360
 as to walk as fast as the 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.650
 dogs when dogs release them 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.570
 when they are released they are the most 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.090
 fast game but only when we 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.619
 is released at this stage is unity 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.979
 can be perfectly hunted by 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.990
 cavalry and right now is a victim of 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.689
 these shots 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.729
 good and my dogs follow the masters 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:44.740
 of the dogs out there and these units 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.680
 Both my cavalry and my praetorians 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.450
 At this point my enemy is hidden 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.990
 You can not see them, so I advance them 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.990
 little by little 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.390
 then you can only throw the dogs 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.500
 when you are already at a distance like this 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.690
 that what is now the same is 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.530
 doing my set of units is 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.090
 run as fast as you can until the 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.250
 height of the ballista to then launch 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.020
 the dogs you will see that once the 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.020
 hauls are going to be going to be laughter let's go 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.520
 there is an army of dogs they have 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.010
 cars 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.510
 just in case and also elephants what 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.480
 good is going to be that the elephants are not going 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.530
 to last a lot really 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.530
 but well we'll see 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.629
 so I loose the dogs and let's see what 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.629
 it works 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.260
 lets go see it 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.990
 there are those dogs throwing themselves 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.970
 the elephants 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.820
 the first stomp of elephants 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.490
 they charge the dogs but then after 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.830
 of that the dogs came out but well what 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.360
 well here the funny thing is that really 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.060
 the elephants did not kill them with the dogs 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.800
 but with the teachers of the dogs to 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.450
 Priori may seem like a bad lesson 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:04.160
 in throwing the infantry up against 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.160
 armed elephants but historically 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.569
 the elephants were defeated by surrounding them 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.150
 with 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.849
 with infantry are in fact the 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.849
 elephants were going with a company with a 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.650
 skara unit infantry goers 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:20.060
 light behind to protect them and not 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.310
 will be surrounded bony or me right now 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.010
 I have basically fucking infantry 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.319
 but I can surround him if you see them I'm 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.870
 killing then my idea really was 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.340
 come with this reinforcement unit with 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.859
 the praetorians who were in gold level 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.480
 which is a unit to which no other 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.560
 video could have been faced if the 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.349
 elephants face these 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.730
 praetorians die and if their gunners 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.590
 face the two units die 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.469
 all its units would die but what 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.449
 happens that he faces just the worst 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:49.639
 that there may be against this unit that is 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:53.180
 say worse for me that are the cars 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:55.459
 there you see them coming from front and above 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.500
 over in version 1.7 that maybe 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.909
 are weaned but to compensate 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.079
 better they work because they do not work 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:02.079
 well let's see 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.700
 there is a very curious beating that 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.340
 that I 'm taking there but you'll see how the 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.230
 remaining dogs manage to surround him 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.509
 what remains of the enemy army to charge 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.519
 the gunners in the end the mess 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:21.470
 well and here the elephants are dying 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.480
 one after another there is 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.420
 in the end the victory is quite 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.400
 tight but they finally give up their 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:31.580
 troops although here it seems that he will win 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.590
 because the cars really burst 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.420
 ended up paying because they were missing 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.570
 numbers of troops and his general had 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.920
 dead that was the key then I was 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.780
 come some units already 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.900
 but it was a very curious battle about 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.060
 everything with the dogs was a little bad 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.800
 that they attacked me there are those elephants 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.630
 against dogs but the truth is that 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.170
 the teachers of the dogs came that 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.170
 nor the eye 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.020
 and here it puts a tight defeat but 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.600
 really get the victory you see 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.120
 thanks to what I told you is the subject of 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:08.390
 the repetitions of the pilgrims that is 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:11.720
 a little fucked up because they are not realistic 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.610
 be in fact I carry all these were 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.190
 victory battles that I go with 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.740
 so many repetitions but more of the 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:21.290
 half come out as defeats or with that 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.450
 be penn adjusted and change some 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.950
 adjustment in the battle that turns him 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.590
 but good thing is that I charged his 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.690
 general that made a dent in the moral and I 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.880
 gave victory in the battle so now 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.860
 you know that you have me with greater detente and 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.800
 that you also treat the truth the 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.900
 papda you already have the 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.470
 pages of greatest te gaming on tuenti 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:44.240
 and facebook all said saying said said 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.740
 I shit on the whore and I'm going to cut the 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.740
 language and until next time
