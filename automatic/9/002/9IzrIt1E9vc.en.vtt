just put it into oh man yeah no it's
still<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:50.910> dynamic<00:00:51.420> mode<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.629> thought<00:00:51.840> maybe

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
still in dynamic mode I thought maybe

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.880 
still in dynamic mode I thought maybe
defaulted<00:00:53.989> into<00:00:54.989> dynamic<00:00:55.199> mode<00:00:55.649> because

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
defaulted into dynamic mode because

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.540 
defaulted into dynamic mode because
frankly<00:00:57.379> all<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.530> these<00:00:58.680> bikes

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
frankly all of these bikes

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.810 
frankly all of these bikes
or<00:01:01.150> boring<00:01:01.630> as<00:01:01.840> in<00:01:02.620> any<00:01:02.800> other<00:01:02.980> mode

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.730 

and<00:01:06.660> that's<00:01:06.810> just<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.140> way<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.380> is

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.870 

you<00:01:11.740> have<00:01:11.860> to<00:01:11.980> take<00:01:12.160> it<00:01:12.280> a<00:01:12.340> little<00:01:12.370> bit<00:01:12.670> easy

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
you have to take it a little bit easy

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:23.750

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.160 

this<00:01:44.260> road<00:01:44.470> was<00:01:44.620> so<00:01:44.740> awesome<00:01:45.130> just<00:01:45.340> a<00:01:46.060> week<00:01:46.540> ago

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:56.560 

garbage

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.569 

Wow<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:57.840> bike<00:01:58.020> really<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.530> smooth

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.710 

and<00:02:02.579> quick<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.600> does<00:02:03.780> have<00:02:03.990> more<00:02:04.500> bottom<00:02:04.920> in

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
and quick it does have more bottom in

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.570 
and quick it does have more bottom in
it<00:02:07.200> attracts<00:02:07.650> red<00:02:07.830> lights<00:02:08.070> like<00:02:08.310> crazy

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
it attracts red lights like crazy

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.820 
it attracts red lights like crazy
apparently<00:02:09.149> no<00:02:10.050> this<00:02:10.229> babe<00:02:10.440> it's<00:02:10.649> pretty

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
apparently no this babe it's pretty

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.809 
apparently no this babe it's pretty
gnarly

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.110 

smooth<00:02:15.819> I<00:02:16.500> don't<00:02:17.500> want<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.430> like<00:02:18.640> this<00:02:18.849> bike

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
smooth I don't want to like this bike

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.790 
smooth I don't want to like this bike
but

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
but

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.500 
but
not<00:02:21.310> too<00:02:22.050> it's<00:02:23.050> very<00:02:23.290> different<00:02:23.560> from<00:02:23.800> the

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
not too it's very different from the

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.130 
not too it's very different from the
 night<00:02:25.260> masseur<00:02:25.650> there

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.130 

has<00:02:28.770> a<00:02:28.800> lot<00:02:29.069> of<00:02:29.160> flavor<00:02:29.430> but<00:02:30.150> so<00:02:30.870> does<00:02:31.050> this

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
has a lot of flavor but so does this

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.370 
has a lot of flavor but so does this
machine

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
machine

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.350 
machine
I<00:02:33.440> don't<00:02:34.040> think<00:02:34.100> about<00:02:34.340> this<00:02:34.610> bike<00:02:34.850> is<00:02:35.060> having

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
I don't think about this bike is having

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.880 
I don't think about this bike is having
a<00:02:35.390> lot<00:02:35.540> of<00:02:35.570> flavor<00:02:35.870> but<00:02:35.990> it<00:02:36.610> definitely

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:53.380 

definitely<00:02:41.890> does

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.210 

and<00:02:53.600> it's<00:02:53.780> comfortable<00:02:54.170> it's<00:02:55.010> more

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
and it's comfortable it's more

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:07.839 
and it's comfortable it's more
comfortable<00:02:55.580> than<00:02:55.790> I<00:02:55.880> remember<00:02:56.270> it

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:09.759 

in<00:03:08.269> the<00:03:08.480> past<00:03:08.719> last<00:03:09.170> year<00:03:09.499> I<00:03:09.530> would<00:03:09.680> have

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
in the past last year I would have

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.630 
in the past last year I would have
chosen<00:03:10.129> the

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.930 

the<00:03:15.640> 1290<00:03:16.330> hands<00:03:16.600> down<00:03:16.900> over<00:03:17.230> this<00:03:17.350> machine

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
the 1290 hands down over this machine

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.790 
the 1290 hands down over this machine
but

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
but

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:30.580 
but
I<00:03:20.890> feel<00:03:21.520> differently<00:03:21.940> about<00:03:22.090> it<00:03:22.240> now

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:51.920 

it's

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.780 

feels<00:03:52.930> really<00:03:53.260> good

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.399 

the<00:03:57.790> motor<00:03:58.000> feels<00:03:58.299> stronger<00:03:58.870> in<00:03:58.959> the<00:03:59.080> mid<00:03:59.260> and

00:03:59.399 --> 00:03:59.409 
the motor feels stronger in the mid and

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:01.740 
the motor feels stronger in the mid and
low<00:03:59.590> that<00:03:59.799> I<00:03:59.920> remember<00:04:00.370> it<00:04:00.489> I<00:04:00.849> think<00:04:01.510> it<00:04:01.629> was<00:04:01.690> a

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
low that I remember it I think it was a

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.110 
low that I remember it I think it was a
bit<00:04:01.959> biased<00:04:02.170> by<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.590> KTM<00:04:03.190> which<00:04:03.489> I<00:04:03.640> really

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
bit biased by the KTM which I really

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.290 
bit biased by the KTM which I really
love<00:04:04.330> but<00:04:06.420> this<00:04:07.420> is<00:04:07.629> working

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
love but this is working

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:28.860 
love but this is working
very<00:04:09.810> comfortable<00:04:10.170> seating<00:04:10.560> position

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.960 

stop<00:04:29.560> exhaust<00:04:29.980> sounds<00:04:30.250> pretty<00:04:30.460> tough<00:04:30.700> too<00:04:30.940> I

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
stop exhaust sounds pretty tough too I

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.240 

thinking<00:05:28.590> it<00:05:28.680> didn't<00:05:28.920> have<00:05:29.040> as<00:05:29.130> much

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.710 
character as it does this is I can see
why<00:05:32.310> it<00:05:32.400> did<00:05:32.550> so<00:05:32.730> well<00:05:32.880> on<00:05:32.910> the<00:05:33.120> shootouts<00:05:33.480> this

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720

much<00:05:42.790> tougher<00:05:43.000> call<00:05:43.390> than<00:05:43.600> I<00:05:43.690> originally

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
much tougher call than I originally

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.110 
much tougher call than I originally
thought<00:05:44.110> between<00:05:44.440> that<00:05:44.770> and<00:05:44.920> the<00:05:44.980> Super<00:05:45.280> Duke
