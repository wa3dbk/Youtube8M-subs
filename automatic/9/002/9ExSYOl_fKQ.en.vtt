00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
that was recorded with bad audio because

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.789 
that was recorded with bad audio because
I<00:01:13.409> didn't<00:01:13.860> have<00:01:13.979> my<00:01:14.130> microphone<00:01:15.590> cable<00:01:16.590> fully

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
I didn't have my microphone cable fully

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.649 
I didn't have my microphone cable fully
connected<00:01:17.310> completely<00:01:17.790> connected<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.479> it

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
connected completely connected and it

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.960 
connected completely connected and it
caused<00:01:18.900> my<00:01:19.320> computer<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.920> be<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.159> default<00:01:20.340> mic

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
caused my computer to be the default mic

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.850 
caused my computer to be the default mic
so<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.600> was<00:01:21.720> pretty<00:01:21.869> much<00:01:21.960> recording<00:01:22.650> or

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
so I was pretty much recording or

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.420 
so I was pretty much recording or
speaking<00:01:23.640> into<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.000> mic<00:01:25.070> halfway<00:01:26.070> across<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
speaking into a mic halfway across the

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.370 
speaking into a mic halfway across the
room<00:01:26.549> from<00:01:26.729> my<00:01:26.850> computer<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.570> my<00:01:27.990> room's<00:01:28.259> not

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
room from my computer and my room's not

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.840 
room from my computer and my room's not
that<00:01:28.619> big<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.100> it's<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.460> mean<00:01:29.610> it's<00:01:29.729> not<00:01:29.790> that

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
that big so it's I mean it's not that

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.310 
that big so it's I mean it's not that
far<00:01:30.030> but<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.540> was<00:01:30.689> speaking<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.140> mic<00:01:31.290> that

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
far but I was speaking to the mic that

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.749 
far but I was speaking to the mic that
wasn't<00:01:31.710> actually<00:01:31.920> recording<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.640> was

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
wasn't actually recording so it was

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:33.980 
wasn't actually recording so it was
pretty<00:01:32.909> much<00:01:33.000> speaking<00:01:33.420> from<00:01:33.509> across<00:01:33.780> the

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
pretty much speaking from across the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.080 
pretty much speaking from across the
room<00:01:34.170> into<00:01:34.650> my<00:01:34.770> computer<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.790> sounds<00:01:36.030> like

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
room into my computer so it sounds like

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.090 
room into my computer so it sounds like
far<00:01:36.360> away<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.780> stuff<00:01:36.990> it's<00:01:37.140> bad<00:01:37.470> quality<00:01:37.710> and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
far away and stuff it's bad quality and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.740 
far away and stuff it's bad quality and
everything<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:39.299> was<00:01:39.360> just<00:01:39.540> kind<00:01:39.659> of

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
everything and it was just kind of

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.359 
everything and it was just kind of
disappointing<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.290> have<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.770> upload<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.250> but

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
disappointing to have to upload that but

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.980 
disappointing to have to upload that but
the<00:01:41.460> only<00:01:41.610> reason<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.060> did<00:01:42.240> up<00:01:42.360> all<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.720> and

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
the only reason I did up all that and

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.560 
the only reason I did up all that and
didn't<00:01:43.560> redo<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.009> episode<00:01:44.399> was<00:01:45.119> because<00:01:45.540> I

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
didn't redo the episode was because I

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.300 
didn't redo the episode was because I
found<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.470> mob<00:01:46.619> spawner<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.009> took<00:01:47.159> all<00:01:47.280> the

found the mob spawner and took all the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.310 
found the mob spawner and took all the
loot<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.520> stuff<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.750> didn't<00:01:48.960> want<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.200> make

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
eat actually and I really liked the

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.560 
eat actually and I really liked the
movie<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.460> was<00:02:53.550> but<00:02:53.760> it's<00:02:53.880> pretty<00:02:54.240> much<00:02:54.420> about

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
movie it was but it's pretty much about

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.410 
movie it was but it's pretty much about
zombies<00:02:55.110> but<00:02:55.290> instead<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.560> like<00:02:55.710> a<00:02:56.390> like<00:02:57.390> a

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
zombies but instead of like a like a

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.600 
zombies but instead of like a like a
virus<00:02:58.050> it's<00:02:58.290> kind<00:02:58.470> of<00:02:58.500> rabies<00:02:58.800> which<00:02:59.400> is

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
virus it's kind of rabies which is

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.860 
virus it's kind of rabies which is
actually<00:03:00.060> pretty<00:03:00.210> cool<00:03:00.330> is<00:03:00.600> something

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
actually pretty cool is something

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.260 
actually pretty cool is something
different<00:03:01.050> and<00:03:01.430> so<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:02.880> might<00:03:03.030> be<00:03:03.090> like

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
different and so you might be like

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.720 
different and so you might be like
rabies<00:03:03.630> like<00:03:03.870> animal<00:03:04.260> rabies<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.770> kind<00:03:05.430> of<00:03:05.610> I

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
rabies like animal rabies and kind of I

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.640 
rabies like animal rabies and kind of I
guess<00:03:05.790> that's<00:03:06.240> how<00:03:06.300> it<00:03:06.510> is<00:03:06.630> but<00:03:07.290> it's<00:03:07.410> pretty

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
guess that's how it is but it's pretty

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.290 
guess that's how it is but it's pretty
much<00:03:07.830> like<00:03:07.890> they're<00:03:08.610> like<00:03:08.790> foaming<00:03:09.060> at<00:03:09.240> the

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
much like they're like foaming at the

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.460 
much like they're like foaming at the
mouth<00:03:09.360> and<00:03:09.720> stuff<00:03:09.900> and<00:03:09.990> they<00:03:10.080> get<00:03:10.200> bit<00:03:10.350> and

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
mouth and stuff and they get bit and

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.920

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
those in the movie and it was a lot

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.360 
those in the movie and it was a lot
there<00:03:42.810> was<00:03:42.870> a<00:03:42.989> lot<00:03:43.080> of<00:03:43.200> nice<00:03:43.709> scenes<00:03:44.040> and<00:03:44.280> then

there was a lot of nice scenes and then

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.729 
there was a lot of nice scenes and then
a<00:03:44.400> lot<00:03:44.580> of<00:03:44.610> day<00:03:44.790> scenes<00:03:45.090> too<00:03:45.360> and<00:03:45.600> it's<00:03:46.380> pretty

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
a lot of day scenes too and it's pretty

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.280 
a lot of day scenes too and it's pretty
much<00:03:46.860> like<00:03:46.920> rabid<00:03:47.489> zombies<00:03:47.519> and<00:03:48.000> stuff<00:03:48.090> so<00:03:48.570> if

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
much like rabid zombies and stuff so if

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.930 
much like rabid zombies and stuff so if
you<00:03:49.530> count<00:03:49.800> that<00:03:49.860> as<00:03:50.040> horror<00:03:50.250> than<00:03:50.489> yeah<00:03:50.700> that

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
you count that as horror than yeah that

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.360 
you count that as horror than yeah that
is<00:03:51.090> hard<00:03:51.360> but<00:03:51.690> to<00:03:52.019> me<00:03:52.170> it<00:03:52.290> was<00:03:52.410> I<00:03:52.590> thought<00:03:53.250> it

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
is hard but to me it was I thought it

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.460 
is hard but to me it was I thought it
should<00:03:53.400> be<00:03:53.610> like<00:03:53.760> in<00:03:53.880> the<00:03:53.970> action<00:03:54.450> kind<00:03:55.260> of

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
should be like in the action kind of

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.350 
should be like in the action kind of
genre<00:03:56.160> not<00:03:56.310> horror<00:03:56.670> but<00:03:56.940> I<00:03:57.000> guess<00:03:57.209> they

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
genre not horror but I guess they

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.550 
genre not horror but I guess they
classify<00:03:57.900> rabid<00:03:58.380> zombies<00:03:58.410> as<00:03:59.130> as<00:03:59.820> horror<00:04:00.750> so<00:04:01.110> I

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
classify rabid zombies as as horror so I

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.199 
classify rabid zombies as as horror so I
know<00:04:01.830> I've<00:04:02.010> been<00:04:02.100> staring<00:04:02.340> at<00:04:02.459> this<00:04:02.580> like<00:04:02.790> wood

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
know I've been staring at this like wood

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.670 
know I've been staring at this like wood
for<00:04:03.480> like<00:04:03.600> ages<00:04:03.810> because<00:04:04.200> I'm<00:04:04.440> trying<00:04:04.590> to

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680
