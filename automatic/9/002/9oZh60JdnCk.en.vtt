00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.960 
not looked very good lately not at all
like<00:02:21.450> what<00:02:21.480> we'd<00:02:21.870> expect<00:02:22.350> them<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:23.100> I<00:02:23.340> mean

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
like what we'd expect them to so I mean

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.220 
like what we'd expect them to so I mean
I<00:02:24.030> think<00:02:24.090> they'll<00:02:24.390> turn<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.720> around<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:25.170> think

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
I think they'll turn it around I think

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.350 
I think they'll turn it around I think
you're<00:02:25.470> probably<00:02:25.620> right<00:02:25.800> but<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.820> never<00:02:27.090> know

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
you're probably right but you never know

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.100 
you're probably right but you never know
it's<00:02:27.630> not<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.810> sure<00:02:28.080> thing<00:02:29.630> or<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.810> Houston

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
it's not a sure thing or the Houston

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.810 
it's not a sure thing or the Houston

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
Rockets they come in off the wash could

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.360 
Rockets they come in off the wash could
be<00:02:32.910> Utah<00:02:33.210> janitors<00:02:33.750> their<00:02:34.470> shot<00:02:34.740> selection<00:02:35.250> in

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
that loss stood out to me guys too much

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.470 
that loss stood out to me guys too much
one<00:02:37.770> on<00:02:37.800> one<00:02:38.130> play<00:02:38.430> not<00:02:38.760> enough<00:02:39.000> ball<00:02:39.210> movement

it<00:02:40.080> certainly<00:02:40.500> was<00:02:40.710> not<00:02:40.950> an<00:02:41.190> example<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:42.390> team

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
good off the assist from wind and I'm

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.890 
good off the assist from wind and I'm
not<00:02:59.400> really<00:02:59.610> sure<00:02:59.700> that's<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.240> time<00:03:00.540> for<00:03:00.810> the

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
not really sure that's the time for the

and<00:03:05.030> Phoenix<00:03:05.600> I<00:03:05.720> thought<00:03:05.990> was<00:03:06.200> one<00:03:06.440> of<00:03:06.530> the

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
and Phoenix I thought was one of the

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.920 
and Phoenix I thought was one of the
surprise<00:03:07.040> teams<00:03:07.490> in<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.790> Western<00:03:08.060> context<00:03:08.660> a

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
surprise teams in the Western context a

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.710 
surprise teams in the Western context a
year<00:03:09.410> ago<00:03:09.650> and<00:03:09.950> one<00:03:10.250> of<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.430> reasons<00:03:10.820> was<00:03:11.150> that

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
year ago and one of the reasons was that

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.600 
year ago and one of the reasons was that
they<00:03:11.900> really<00:03:12.350> played<00:03:12.650> well<00:03:12.920> within<00:03:13.280> the

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
they really played well within the

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.400 
they really played well within the
conference<00:03:14.120> I<00:03:14.390> think<00:03:14.900> a<00:03:14.930> lot<00:03:15.080> of<00:03:15.170> people

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
conference I think a lot of people

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.590 
conference I think a lot of people
expected<00:03:15.920> them<00:03:16.070> to<00:03:16.100> struggle<00:03:16.730> against<00:03:17.450> that

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
expected them to struggle against that

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.110 
expected them to struggle against that
deep<00:03:17.810> Western<00:03:18.290> Conference<00:03:18.590> could<00:03:19.010> they<00:03:19.490> play

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
deep Western Conference could they play

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.290 
deep Western Conference could they play
well<00:03:20.390> and<00:03:20.540> a<00:03:21.380> much<00:03:21.920> better<00:03:22.130> record<00:03:22.460> than<00:03:22.670> that

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
well and a much better record than that

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.550 
well and a much better record than that
