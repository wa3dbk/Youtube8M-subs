00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
description box now you're just going to

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.090 
description box now you're just going to
take<00:01:00.809> some<00:01:01.020> green<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.469> brown<00:01:01.649> paint<00:01:01.949> and

take some green and brown paint and
randomly<00:01:02.760> paint<00:01:03.180> spots<00:01:03.660> all<00:01:03.930> over<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.320> turtle

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
randomly paint spots all over the turtle

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.750 
randomly paint spots all over the turtle
and<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:04.920> doesn't<00:01:05.189> really<00:01:05.280> matter<00:01:05.519> what<00:01:05.700> it

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
and it doesn't really matter what it

and it doesn't really matter what it
looks<00:01:05.790> like<00:01:06.090> because<00:01:06.270> all<00:01:06.540> turtles<00:01:06.900> are

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
looks like because all turtles are

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.399 
looks like because all turtles are
different<00:01:11.780> then<00:01:12.780> you're<00:01:12.960> going<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.200> want<00:01:13.350> to
