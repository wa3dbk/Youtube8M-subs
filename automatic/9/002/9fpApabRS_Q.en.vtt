like and if I would be repurchasing them
so<00:00:23.259> I<00:00:23.289> thought<00:00:23.499> as<00:00:23.710> I<00:00:23.829> try<00:00:24.159> if<00:00:24.669> you<00:00:24.820> guys<00:00:24.999> like

so I thought as I try if you guys like
this<00:00:25.269> let<00:00:25.749> me<00:00:25.779> know<00:00:26.019> and<00:00:26.289> I<00:00:26.380> can<00:00:26.409> do<00:00:26.710> this<00:00:26.890> I

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189 
this let me know and I can do this I
