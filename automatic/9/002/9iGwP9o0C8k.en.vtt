movement<00:00:19.740> in<00:00:19.859> four<00:00:20.250> dimensions<00:00:20.850> not<00:00:21.660> just

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
movement in four dimensions not just

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.560 
movement in four dimensions not just
three<00:00:22.670> because<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.850> fourth<00:00:24.060> dimension<00:00:24.480> is

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
three because the fourth dimension is

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.470 
three because the fourth dimension is
time<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.199> what<00:00:25.830> this<00:00:25.980> app<00:00:26.189> does<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:27.150> allows

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
time and what this app does it allows

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.450 
time and what this app does it allows
you<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.689> see<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:27.930> symphonic<00:00:28.710> quality<00:00:29.250> of

you to see the symphonic quality of
movement<00:00:30.449> as<00:00:30.689> we<00:00:31.380> change<00:00:31.710> through<00:00:32.099> space<00:00:32.369> and

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
movement as we change through space and

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.950 
movement as we change through space and
time<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:33.390> body<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:34.140> an<00:00:34.500> extraordinary<00:00:35.160> and

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
time the body is an extraordinary and

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
sacred vessel where mere mortals that

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.850 
sacred vessel where mere mortals that
try<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.219> explain<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.600> what<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:43.379> special

try to explain it so what is so special
to<00:00:43.920> me<00:00:44.100> about<00:00:44.489> an<00:00:44.640> app<00:00:44.879> like<00:00:45.210> this<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
to me about an app like this is the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.130 
to me about an app like this is the
opportunity<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.940> think<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.510> bit<00:00:48.780> out<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:48.960> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
opportunity to think a bit out of the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.950 
opportunity to think a bit out of the
box<00:00:49.340> and<00:00:50.340> also<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.700> see<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.090> bit<00:00:51.449> out<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.809> box

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
box and also to see a bit out of the box

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.709 
box and also to see a bit out of the box
and<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:53.250> enables<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.820> appreciate<00:00:54.210> the

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
and that enables you to appreciate the

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.310 
and that enables you to appreciate the
body<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.379> lot<00:00:56.190> more<00:00:56.750> we're<00:00:57.750> at<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.930> point<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.230> our

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
body a lot more we're at a point in our

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.799 
body a lot more we're at a point in our
society<00:00:58.920> where<00:00:59.309> people<00:00:59.340> not<00:01:00.149> only<00:01:00.180> need<00:01:00.629> to

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
society where people not only need to

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.240 
society where people not only need to
learn<00:01:00.930> about<00:01:01.109> their<00:01:01.410> bodies<00:01:01.710> but<00:01:02.160> they

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
learn about their bodies but they

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.130 
learn about their bodies but they
finally<00:01:02.489> want<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.030> learn<00:01:03.300> about<00:01:03.449> their<00:01:03.809> bodies

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
finally want to learn about their bodies

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.289 
finally want to learn about their bodies
so<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.619> think<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.159> best<00:01:05.309> way<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.549> learn<00:01:05.760> Anatomy

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
so I think the best way to learn Anatomy

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.810 
so I think the best way to learn Anatomy
is<00:01:06.390> relationship<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.320> your<00:01:07.500> own<00:01:07.650> self<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.670> your

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
is relationship to your own self to your

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.520 
is relationship to your own self to your
own<00:01:08.970> form<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.510> think<00:01:09.720> can<00:01:09.810> be<00:01:09.900> very<00:01:09.930> helpful<00:01:10.290> in

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
own form I think can be very helpful in

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.050 
own form I think can be very helpful in
a<00:01:10.830> patient's<00:01:11.250> education<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:11.970> their

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
a patient's education and their

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.130 
a patient's education and their
understanding<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.659> their<00:01:12.780> own<00:01:12.869> injury

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
understanding of their own injury

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.630 
understanding of their own injury
because<00:01:13.380> honestly<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:14.189> could<00:01:14.369> give<00:01:14.490> them

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
because honestly you could give them

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.800 
because honestly you could give them
that<00:01:14.790> diagnosis<00:01:15.330> but<00:01:15.479> if<00:01:15.570> they<00:01:15.630> don't

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
that diagnosis but if they don't

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.530 
that diagnosis but if they don't
understand<00:01:16.229> what<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.159> problem<00:01:17.460> is

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
understand what that problem is

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.359 
understand what that problem is
they<00:01:19.170> might<00:01:19.409> not<00:01:19.590> accept<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.009> treatment<00:01:20.340> that

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
they might not accept the treatment that

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.820 
they might not accept the treatment that
you<00:01:20.460> give<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.880> them<00:01:21.080> beautiful<00:01:22.080> images<00:01:22.500> in

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
you give to them beautiful images in

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.950 
you give to them beautiful images in
learning<00:01:23.520> anatomy<00:01:24.000> are<00:01:24.150> really<00:01:24.330> only<00:01:24.450> part<00:01:24.810> of

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
actually show them it a little more

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.140 
actually show them it a little more
dynamic<00:02:14.069> and<00:02:14.250> see<00:02:14.430> what's<00:02:14.640> going<00:02:14.879> on<00:02:15.000> during

instead<00:03:05.310> of<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.489> disconnected<00:03:06.209> way<00:03:06.359> I<00:03:06.480> just

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
instead of a disconnected way I just

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.569 
instead of a disconnected way I just
think<00:03:07.109> it<00:03:07.200> should<00:03:07.349> have<00:03:07.439> been<00:03:07.469> out<00:03:07.919> long<00:03:08.340> time

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
think it should have been out long time

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.129 
think it should have been out long time
ago<00:03:08.819> it's<00:03:09.090> fantastic<00:03:09.599> that<00:03:09.629> somebody's<00:03:10.109> done

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139
