00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.089
 brain destroyer sodium glutamate still 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.940
 always becomes the controversial substance 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.019
 glutamate as mentioned 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.700
 flavor enhancers in countless 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.980
 finished foods and seasonings 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.170
 used though it is 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.390
 this is one of the hardest legal 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.369
 certified brain destroyer acts 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.090
 therefore in sweden for a long time 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.640
 banned is flavor enhancers are 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.439
 no spices but the substances 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.060
 regardless of the roma one 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.340
 an artificial foodstuff 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.200
 Feeling of hunger in the brain simulate the 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.540
 paragraph theoretically taste 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.969
 to enable inedible products 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.940
 because the different ones in use 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.070
 glutamate sodium glutamate carlé um 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.410
 glutamate calcium glutamate and 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.840
 glutamic acid in its effect 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.930
 are almost identical in the following 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.020
 to talk about the winter market 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.280
 glutamate is 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.219
 considered neurologically by one 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.410
 narcotic it is an addictive 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.019
 amino acid compound over the 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.390
 mucous membranes gets into the blood and from there 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.340
 directly into our brain because the 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.470
 quite small molecules of glutamate 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.650
 our protective blood brain barrier to 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.420
 overcome easily 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.400
 unlike the better known 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.190
 drugs do not make glutamate 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.290
 predominantly hey but it produces 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.900
 artificially appetite in which it is under 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.130
 the function of our home for example 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.380
 disturbs the stem biological system 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.340
 governs next to the elementary 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.340
 Body functions our feeling 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.990
 Perception and therefore hunger 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.030
 by the disturbances causing the 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.550
 Glutamate sweats and stress 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.690
 effects such as stomach pain 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.390
 high blood pressure and heart tapping 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.150
 It often leads to sensitive people 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.800
 to migraine the sensory perception becomes 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.040
 clearly restricted and the 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.910
 ability to learn and the general 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.520
 Concentration still take 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.310
 name of glutamate for up to several hours 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.170
 long lasting from allergy sufferers can

 cause or even death immediately 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.380
 lead to respiratory paralysis 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.630
 in animal trying led to glutamate 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.250
 it became severe brain damage 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.690
 pregnant guess about the food in 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.880
 doses administered 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.430
 such as in potato chips 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.350
 or finished soups are quite common 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.320
 so could the embryo in the womb 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.430
 not a fully functioning nervous system 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.250
 develop more 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.220
 the use of such flavor enhancers 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.170
 Depend on billions from june to 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.269
 Example of the intrinsic taste of the bags 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.850
 Cream of asparagus suddenly perceptible 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.830
 so would their after salty mail pampe 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.780
 tasting aroma probably from the 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.910
 majority of people as inedible 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.070
 perceived 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.080
 when shopping for food should 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.590
 you always read the content 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.730
 you do not buy anything with glutamate 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.480
 flavor enhancers or e number of the 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.750
 600 series also e 605 is a

 Nerve poison calais around glutamate calcium 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.350
 glutamate or glutamic acid one is buying 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:06.130
 nothing starts or something 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:09.550
 something contains seasoning becomes salt becomes sauce 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.940
 he also tells the story of net spice 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.680
 Soy sauce is seasoning seasoning is one 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.260
 any substance to the taste 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.430
 usually spice glutamate halt 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.540
 I season as synonymous with 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.310
 must be on 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.480
 will not saucen this extra 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.880
 be expelled 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.430
 you do not buy finished food and 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.830
 unique compositions 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.090
 Ingredients of ingredients must namely 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.300
 not to be named 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.550
 with pizza sushi with salami slices with 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.260
 ketchup and so on here can do it all 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:45.299
 possible be in it 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.299
 So look up at the food purchase
