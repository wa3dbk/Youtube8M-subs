00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:03.590
 any difference between model 9 and the former 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.120
 and safety 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.670
 It's that we gave here that I 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:07.780
 old 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.000
 when the team takes out the pin for example and has contact with the pins 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 and took punches already the new no 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.679
 the new is impossible 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:16.769
 have a contact 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:19.439
 with the metal part 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.119
 so the safety 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.550
 Another advantage is that the new boss helps combat the waste of 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.320
 energy 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.160
 as it does not allow the use of improper adapters to connect 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.809
 with many devices in a single outlet, 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.860
 are very satisfied with the change the clientele is not satisfied with 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.840
 this because 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.810
 can buy new part hope to have a great because all the appliances 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.160
 home electronics of the old 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.710
 by 2011 the process of creating the Brazilian standard of plugs and sockets 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.570
 must be completed and by then four steps will have to be met 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.030
 in January of next year of its deadline for manufacturers of appliances 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.600
 consumer electronics manufacturer and so that the relative importers 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.340
 import 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.630
 equipment with old plugs October next year the limit so that 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.910
 manufacturers and importers to market the products with old plugs that 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.780
 are in stock in January 2011 the deadline for trade to end 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.480
 sale plugs and sockets with the old model in July 2011 the deadline for which 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.030
 the trade selling electronic appliances with the old plug 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.760
 according to inmetro the setut of the national metrology standardization and quality 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:47.570
 industry before the change were 12 deposit says and 8 types of outlets in the 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:48.410
 Brazil 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.530
 with the definition of the Brazilian standard, the market will only have two 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.360
 models after three round pins the flat pin disappears and the third pin 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.570
 plays the role of kicker in these two years until the new model actually inter 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.530
 consumers will be able to use adapters like this, ideally, in the 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.359
 all those who already have at home 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:14.919
 the new outlet 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:18.090
 buy a new audience that will 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.129
 the placement of the new club so that it is put so that it is possible 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.089
 use 

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:29.419
 antoine factor immediately because if you put the adapter 

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:34.339
 you will not get the new user benefit that brings this 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:37.049
 new outlet that is much safer than the old one.
