stuff<00:02:19.709> I<00:02:20.010> I<00:02:20.040> know<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.549> my<00:02:20.670> guys<00:02:20.849> ready<00:02:21.150> to

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
stuff I I know that my guys ready to

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.479 
stuff I I know that my guys ready to
push<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:21.660> past<00:02:21.900> what<00:02:22.410> I<00:02:22.620> know<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:23.129> what<00:02:23.310> most

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
push it past what I know that what most

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.819 
push it past what I know that what most
was<00:02:23.700> capable<00:02:23.940> of<00:02:24.209> holding<00:02:24.810> so<00:02:25.530> i<00:02:25.590> know<00:02:25.680> that

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
was capable of holding so i know that

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.589 
was capable of holding so i know that
once<00:02:26.190> we<00:02:26.400> get<00:02:26.519> out<00:02:26.670> of<00:02:26.700> that<00:02:26.910> those<00:02:27.180> those

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
once we get out of that those those

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.050 
once we get out of that those those
early<00:02:28.099> rounds<00:02:29.099> where<00:02:29.280> I<00:02:29.310> think<00:02:29.549> mostly<00:02:29.790> is

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
early rounds where I think mostly is

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.509 
early rounds where I think mostly is
most<00:02:30.239> dangerous<00:02:30.690> he's<00:02:31.200> gonna<00:02:31.440> I<00:02:31.860> think<00:02:32.069> it'll

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
most dangerous he's gonna I think it'll

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.850 
most dangerous he's gonna I think it'll
it'll<00:02:32.910> be<00:02:33.090> out<00:02:33.209> you<00:02:33.840> know<00:02:33.930> harder<00:02:34.290> inclusion

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
it'll be out you know harder inclusion

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.240 
it'll be out you know harder inclusion
at<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.099> point<00:02:35.340> I<00:02:35.430> think<00:02:35.610> he's<00:02:35.730> gonna<00:02:35.849> stop

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
at that point I think he's gonna stop

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.400 
at that point I think he's gonna stop
