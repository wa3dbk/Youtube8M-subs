it's three and a half inch to start with
they<00:01:03.680> slide<00:01:04.129> right<00:01:04.520> into<00:01:04.760> the<00:01:04.880> system<00:01:05.240> just

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
they slide right into the system just

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.510 
they slide right into the system just
like<00:01:05.960> that<00:01:08.860> now<00:01:09.860> it's<00:01:09.950> turn<00:01:10.160> it<00:01:10.250> around<00:01:10.310> to

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
like that now it's turn it around to

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.880 
like that now it's turn it around to
show<00:01:10.670> you<00:01:10.730> what<00:01:10.910> makes<00:01:11.030> be<00:01:11.270> 1200<00:01:11.720> unique<00:01:12.140> first

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
show you what makes be 1200 unique first

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.260 
show you what makes be 1200 unique first
off<00:01:13.100> you'll<00:01:13.220> see<00:01:13.400> we<00:01:13.520> have<00:01:13.550> a<00:01:13.640> modular

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
off you'll see we have a modular

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.150 
off you'll see we have a modular
architecture<00:01:14.380> it's<00:01:15.380> that<00:01:15.560> way<00:01:15.710> so<00:01:15.770> you<00:01:15.950> can

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
architecture it's that way so you can

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.520 
architecture it's that way so you can
replace<00:01:16.550> components<00:01:17.180> in<00:01:17.660> the<00:01:17.840> field<00:01:18.080> while

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
replace components in the field while

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.290 
replace components in the field while
maintaining<00:01:18.800> your<00:01:19.190> uptime<00:01:19.670> so<00:01:20.000> you<00:01:20.060> have<00:01:20.180> high

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
maintaining your uptime so you have high

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.810 
maintaining your uptime so you have high
availability<00:01:20.480> I<00:01:21.080> took<00:01:21.560> off<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:21.980> panel<00:01:22.670> here

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
availability I took off the panel here

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.100 
availability I took off the panel here
you'll<00:01:22.970> see<00:01:23.090> that<00:01:23.180> we<00:01:23.240> have<00:01:23.390> a<00:01:23.420> fan<00:01:23.780> assembly

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
you'll see that we have a fan assembly

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.100 
you'll see that we have a fan assembly
eight<00:01:24.740> total<00:01:25.250> fans<00:01:25.670> if<00:01:25.970> one<00:01:26.360> of<00:01:26.450> them<00:01:26.570> had<00:01:26.750> a
