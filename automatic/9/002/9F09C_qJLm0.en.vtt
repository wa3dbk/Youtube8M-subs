00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.090

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.859

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.019

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:40.260

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.700
 about libya ai to see this video 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.950
 seems very nice to you just purchased 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.010
 to give an impression of how it is 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.000
 and how it went on the set of saving 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.000
 Sinterklaas watch 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.519
 to 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.920
 The end of Sinterklaas already had the 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.120
 bloopers so today I only have the 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.770
 see little hands for you 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.300
 before I show you that one 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.980
 I thought it would be nice to have one 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.390
 explain what as the 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.040
 very many people are youtube 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.740
 want to make videos and lots of people 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.420
 who are looking for things you can do 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.950
 do new things too i'm very sorry 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.310
 been looking for things that I wanted 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.380
 to do 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.880
 unique new things that have never been before 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.470
 done in the Netherlands 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.150
 saving Sinterklaas as there actually 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.220
 the very first of which I really wanted 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.660
 want to make more about Sinterklaas because 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.360
 Sinterklaas than my opinion very often 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.610
 misused is complete 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.080
 it is because Sinterklaas is not 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.330
 a total call it 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.280
 as he was in st dan thriller film 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.200
 three years ago but in Sinterklaas 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.030
 everyone was murder at a time 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.770
 you think no it's not the whole 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.440
 The idea of ​​Santa Claus is that he is one 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.390
 dear old man and that is how I love him too 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.940
 in my video instead of 100 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.000
 Sinterklaas is the press he is correct 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.770
 Thin the captured princess where everyone else 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.510
 basically everyone wants that 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.040
 Sinterklaas is released 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.080
 that was also the idea with which i got this 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.269
 video made a romantic promotion 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.280
 come that about Sinterklaas where 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.989
 seated and completely abducted 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.220
 to the Zwarte Piet discussion with the 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.560
 United Nations, of course, I had 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.720
 enough enthusiasm to make this entire movie that 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.910
 is also the reason that I could go to him 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.560
 made by the united nations that melts 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.239
 at least it does this mini a lot 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.040
 I put a lot of effort into it 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.350
 I also like the fact that this one 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.820
 Video is quite unique because you have three things 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.800
 very important are very first 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.510
 characters in the film come in second place 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.940
 to tell and in third place the 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.709
 special effects that are three things that 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.570
 you on the dutch language youtube 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.000
 never actually see and I thought so 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.370
 too bad i'm the fuckin we go everything 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.230
 merge into a large epic 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.209
 banjomovies it that has ended 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.680
 Sunday appeared banjo movies you wink 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.150
 for that in the description you go now 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.980
 look at the zenith be right is that 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.750
 video if you pay attention you can do a lot 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.040
 go find nice things that you 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.350
 maybe can start using your own 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.239
 videos makes line bye for wine saint 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.980
 again to look for when something 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.290
 what they would make 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.090

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.769
 chosen pan just sinterklaas elro 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.170
 I see today with other vessels 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:01.550
 down here 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.540
 so not only today I think so too 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.400
 chairman 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.800
 it is it is also without yes we have 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.980
 a 150 euro pact for Sinterklaas every 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.340
 price 775 young and that from now to the 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:19.040
 investment 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:19.850
 so also something i just like you know 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.430

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.260

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:29.060

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:31.040
 blood effects can be placed 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.870
 it is also not very much so this is cunt 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:37.220
 other stubborn collective agreements and donkeys would be more 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.220
 more above if you have those above 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.210
