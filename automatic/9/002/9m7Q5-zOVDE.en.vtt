boy<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:26.970> decided<00:00:27.330> just<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.750> convert<00:00:28.260> what<00:00:28.619> i

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
boy I decided just to convert what i

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.130 
boy I decided just to convert what i
already<00:00:29.970> had<00:00:30.269> which<00:00:31.019> was<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.500> iconic<00:00:32.250> x<00:00:33.140> fpv

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
already had which was the iconic x fpv

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.670 
already had which was the iconic x fpv
train<00:00:34.730> into<00:00:36.710> more<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.739> an<00:00:37.950> aerial<00:00:38.520> videography

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680

platform for this brushless gimbal

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.270 
platform for this brushless gimbal
system<00:00:44.239> basically<00:00:45.239> i<00:00:45.539> set<00:00:45.960> this<00:00:46.110> up<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.950> i

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
system basically i set this up so that i

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.180 
system basically i set this up so that i
can<00:00:48.920> take<00:00:49.920> off<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.579> gimbal<00:00:51.469> the<00:00:52.469> landing<00:00:52.860> gear

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
can take off the gimbal the landing gear

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.470 
can take off the gimbal the landing gear
and<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.850> board<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:55.160> fly<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.190> just<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:57.390> know

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
and the board and fly it just you know

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.840 
and the board and fly it just you know
the<00:00:57.719> regular<00:00:58.199> iconic<00:00:58.969> fpv<00:00:59.969> frame<00:01:00.500> because

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
the regular iconic fpv frame because

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.789 
the regular iconic fpv frame because
it's<00:01:02.930> relatively<00:01:04.339> light<00:01:05.840> more<00:01:06.840> agile<00:01:07.350> and

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
it's relatively light more agile and

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.700 
it's relatively light more agile and
it's<00:01:08.010> fun<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.280> fly<00:01:08.990> so<00:01:09.990> whenever<00:01:10.320> i<00:01:10.409> want<00:01:10.650> to

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
it's fun to fly so whenever i want to

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.399 
it's fun to fly so whenever i want to
take<00:01:10.950> really<00:01:11.700> nice<00:01:12.150> steady<00:01:12.659> aerial

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
take really nice steady aerial

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.620 
take really nice steady aerial
videography<00:01:15.200> images<00:01:16.200> i<00:01:16.439> can<00:01:17.250> just<00:01:17.610> put<00:01:18.509> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
videography images i can just put the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.130 
videography images i can just put the
landing<00:01:18.930> gear<00:01:19.080> back<00:01:19.350> on<00:01:20.509> strap<00:01:21.509> on<00:01:21.720> the

excellent<00:01:25.950> images<00:01:26.960> so<00:01:27.960> i'll<00:01:28.080> just<00:01:28.110> show<00:01:28.470> you

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
excellent images so i'll just show you

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.149 
excellent images so i'll just show you
my<00:01:28.770> set<00:01:29.040> up<00:01:29.189> real<00:01:29.490> quick<00:01:29.729> how<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.270> works<00:01:30.570> and

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
my set up real quick how it works and

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.920 
my set up real quick how it works and
i'll<00:01:32.159> show<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.610> how<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:32.970> just<00:01:33.299> converted<00:01:33.630> that

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
i'll show you how I just converted that

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.840 
i'll show you how I just converted that
quickly<00:01:34.820> to<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.740> just<00:01:37.740> regular<00:01:38.040> fpv<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:38.700> I'm

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
quickly to the just regular fpv so I'm

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.560 
quickly to the just regular fpv so I'm
just<00:01:39.090> initializing<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:41.360> brushless<00:01:42.360> gimbal

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
just initializing the brushless gimbal

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.170 
just initializing the brushless gimbal
here<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.590> can<00:01:43.740> see<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.070> initialize<00:01:46.939> once<00:01:47.939> it's

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
here you can see it initialize once it's

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.670 
here you can see it initialize once it's
said<00:01:48.540> its<00:01:49.409> level<00:01:49.909> light<00:01:50.909> solid<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:52.259> as<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.560> can

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
said its level light solid so as you can

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.960 
said its level light solid so as you can
see<00:01:53.030> it's<00:01:54.030> not<00:01:54.210> initializing

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
see it's not initializing

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.650 
see it's not initializing
here<00:01:56.120> it<00:01:56.210> is<00:01:58.630> as<00:01:59.630> you<00:01:59.810> can<00:01:59.930> see<00:02:00.140> it's<00:02:00.380> rock

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
here it is as you can see it's rock

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.190 
here it is as you can see it's rock
steady<00:02:02.660> I<00:02:03.370> already<00:02:04.370> tested<00:02:05.180> this<00:02:05.300> out<00:02:05.480> and

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
steady I already tested this out and

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.010 
steady I already tested this out and
I'll<00:02:06.350> post<00:02:06.680> videos<00:02:07.190> later<00:02:07.640> of<00:02:08.149> this<00:02:09.110> system

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
I'll post videos later of this system

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.640 
I'll post videos later of this system
it's<00:02:12.020> really<00:02:12.260> good<00:02:13.540> super<00:02:14.540> smooth<00:02:14.810> super

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
it's really good super smooth super

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.010 
it's really good super smooth super
steady<00:02:15.950> you<00:02:16.520> can't<00:02:17.420> see<00:02:17.630> any<00:02:17.780> oscillation

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
steady you can't see any oscillation

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:26.760 
steady you can't see any oscillation
from<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:19.790> quadcopter<00:02:20.780> itself<00:02:21.140> really<00:02:21.950> good

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.520 

so<00:02:27.770> when<00:02:28.040> I'm<00:02:28.430> done<00:02:28.820> recording<00:02:29.360> and<00:02:29.870> I<00:02:29.930> don't

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
so when I'm done recording and I don't

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.490 
so when I'm done recording and I don't
want<00:02:30.709> the<00:02:30.860> gimbal<00:02:31.160> on<00:02:31.280> anymore<00:02:31.580> oh<00:02:32.060> it's<00:02:32.720> a<00:02:33.080> lot

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
want the gimbal on anymore oh it's a lot

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.949 
want the gimbal on anymore oh it's a lot
of<00:02:33.680> additional<00:02:33.920> weight<00:02:34.490> with<00:02:35.240> landing<00:02:35.690> gear

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
of additional weight with landing gear

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.430 
of additional weight with landing gear
the<00:02:36.290> gimbal<00:02:36.680> and<00:02:36.890> then<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.160> extra<00:02:37.550> battery<00:02:37.970> I

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
the gimbal and then the extra battery I

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.920 
the gimbal and then the extra battery I
wish<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:41.590> quadcopter<00:02:42.590> down<00:02:42.800> quite<00:02:43.160> a<00:02:43.190> bit

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
wish the the quadcopter down quite a bit

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.760 
wish the the quadcopter down quite a bit
though<00:02:44.930> it's<00:02:45.140> still<00:02:45.650> relatively<00:02:46.160> stable<00:02:47.770> it's

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
though it's still relatively stable it's

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.970 
though it's still relatively stable it's
just<00:02:49.190> really<00:02:49.490> sluggish<00:02:49.910> to<00:02:50.330> fly<00:02:50.630> and<00:02:51.110> also

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
just really sluggish to fly and also

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.380 
just really sluggish to fly and also
battery<00:02:52.459> life<00:02:52.730> is<00:02:52.760> bad<00:02:53.270> so<00:02:54.760> not<00:02:55.760> too<00:02:56.090> fun<00:02:56.360> to

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
battery life is bad so not too fun to

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.070 
battery life is bad so not too fun to
fly<00:02:56.690> but<00:02:57.230> good<00:02:57.530> for<00:02:57.910> aerial<00:02:58.910> videography<00:02:59.240> so

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
fly but good for aerial videography so

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.630 
fly but good for aerial videography so
what<00:03:00.230> I'm<00:03:00.320> done<00:03:00.530> with<00:03:00.620> it<00:03:00.800> I<00:03:01.010> just<00:03:01.610> unplug<00:03:02.239> this

three wires that connect unplug it lift
and<00:03:22.010> I'm<00:03:22.910> basically<00:03:23.239> just<00:03:23.540> velcro<00:03:24.019> this<00:03:24.650> piece

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
and I'm basically just velcro this piece

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:35.520 
and I'm basically just velcro this piece
on<00:03:25.940> and<00:03:26.620> it<00:03:27.620> just<00:03:28.959> comes<00:03:29.959> right<00:03:31.269> off<00:03:32.269> like<00:03:32.930> that

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.360 

just<00:03:37.330> modify<00:03:38.330> that<00:03:38.540> velcro<00:03:38.780> piece<00:03:39.290> and<00:03:40.160> here's

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
just modify that velcro piece and here's

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.090 
just modify that velcro piece and here's
a<00:03:40.459> gimbal<00:03:40.670> itself<00:03:41.180> just<00:03:42.049> having<00:03:42.380> the<00:03:42.890> motor

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
a gimbal itself just having the motor

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.280 
a gimbal itself just having the motor
the<00:03:43.670> GoPro<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:44.510> gimbal<00:03:44.780> my<00:03:44.900> hand<00:03:45.140> is

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
the GoPro the gimbal my hand is

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.710 
the GoPro the gimbal my hand is
significant<00:03:45.950> weight<00:03:46.130> so<00:03:46.760> that's<00:03:46.910> why<00:03:47.090> I<00:03:47.120> you

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
significant weight so that's why I you

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.570 
significant weight so that's why I you
know<00:03:47.810> when<00:03:48.019> you<00:03:48.560> just<00:03:48.799> want<00:03:48.950> to<00:03:48.980> fly<00:03:49.130> regular

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
know when you just want to fly regular

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.509 
know when you just want to fly regular
ftv<00:03:50.209> you<00:03:51.019> don't<00:03:51.170> need<00:03:51.290> super<00:03:51.860> stable<00:03:52.040> images

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
ftv you don't need super stable images

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.479 
ftv you don't need super stable images
it's<00:03:53.209> much<00:03:53.390> better<00:03:53.570> to<00:03:53.720> have<00:03:53.989> it<00:03:54.049> off<00:03:54.320> so<00:03:54.950> put

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
it's much better to have it off so put

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.640 
it's much better to have it off so put
it<00:03:55.580> aside<00:03:57.130> next

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
it aside next

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.569 
it aside next
just<00:03:59.239> the<00:04:00.470> landing<00:04:01.470> gear<00:04:01.680> that<00:04:02.099> I<00:04:02.129> have<00:04:02.400> on

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
just the landing gear that I have on

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:07.339 
just the landing gear that I have on
here<00:04:04.340> and<00:04:05.340> you<00:04:05.489> can<00:04:05.610> see<00:04:05.879> I<00:04:06.180> just<00:04:06.540> made<00:04:07.019> it<00:04:07.170> out

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
here and you can see I just made it out

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:13.149 
here and you can see I just made it out
of<00:04:07.700> PCP<00:04:08.700> piping<00:04:11.030> hot<00:04:12.030> glued<00:04:12.390> it<00:04:12.569> together

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:13.159 
of PCP piping hot glued it together

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:20.090 
of PCP piping hot glued it together
super<00:04:14.159> solid<00:04:14.610> but<00:04:15.450> once<00:04:15.599> again<00:04:16.729> it's<00:04:17.729> heavy<00:04:19.100> so

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
super solid but once again it's heavy so

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.870 
super solid but once again it's heavy so
I<00:04:20.130> just<00:04:20.310> hold<00:04:20.519> it<00:04:20.579> on<00:04:20.759> these<00:04:21.060> local<00:04:21.539> bands<00:04:22.880> take

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
I just hold it on these local bands take

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:39.469 
I just hold it on these local bands take
them<00:04:24.030> off<00:04:37.010> and<00:04:38.010> as<00:04:38.190> you<00:04:38.400> see<00:04:38.580> this<00:04:38.729> takes<00:04:39.300> no

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
them off and as you see this takes no

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.430 
them off and as you see this takes no
time<00:04:39.720> at<00:04:39.780> all<00:04:40.050> it's<00:04:40.830> a<00:04:40.889> quick<00:04:41.510> setup<00:04:42.510> and

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
time at all it's a quick setup and

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.060 
time at all it's a quick setup and
that's<00:04:43.740> what<00:04:43.949> I<00:04:44.280> designed<00:04:45.000> this<00:04:45.180> for<00:04:45.620> that<00:04:46.620> if

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
that's what I designed this for that if

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.150 
that's what I designed this for that if
I<00:04:47.190> want<00:04:47.400> to<00:04:47.490> shoot<00:04:47.930> something<00:04:48.930> nice<00:04:49.199> and<00:04:50.039> I'll

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:00.980 
add i modified the landing gear a little

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.510 
add i modified the landing gear a little
bit<00:06:01.100> before<00:06:01.520> I<00:06:01.790> had<00:06:02.690> it<00:06:03.100> kind<00:06:04.100> of<00:06:04.130> protruding

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
bit before I had it kind of protruding

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.190 
bit before I had it kind of protruding
out<00:06:04.790> but<00:06:05.090> I<00:06:05.150> want<00:06:05.390> to<00:06:05.450> even<00:06:05.540> now<00:06:05.810> slimmer

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
out but I want to even now slimmer

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.000 
out but I want to even now slimmer
profile<00:06:06.740> as<00:06:07.640> you<00:06:07.850> can<00:06:08.000> see<00:06:08.270> here<00:06:08.540> all<00:06:08.750> I<00:06:08.810> did

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.010 
profile as you can see here all I did

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.410 
profile as you can see here all I did
because<00:06:10.010> I<00:06:10.190> turned<00:06:10.250> the<00:06:10.640> landing<00:06:10.970> gear<00:06:11.090> on<00:06:11.240> its

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:11.420 
because I turned the landing gear on its

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.110 
because I turned the landing gear on its
side<00:06:11.630> and<00:06:11.900> basically<00:06:12.590> just<00:06:13.010> zip<00:06:13.670> tied<00:06:13.850> it<00:06:14.000> on

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
side and basically just zip tied it on

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.270 
side and basically just zip tied it on
so<00:06:14.870> it<00:06:14.990> provides<00:06:15.320> like<00:06:15.650> this<00:06:15.830> nice<00:06:16.070> little
