excited<00:02:13.110> about<00:02:13.170> this<00:02:13.410> book<00:02:13.620> because<00:02:13.770> it's

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.559 
excited about this book because it's
about<00:02:14.459> ghosts<00:02:15.239> and<00:02:16.040> I<00:02:17.120> think<00:02:18.120> this<00:02:18.239> would<00:02:18.420> be

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
about ghosts and I think this would be

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.080 
about ghosts and I think this would be
such<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.989> fun<00:02:19.349> book<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.680> read<00:02:20.010> during<00:02:20.430> October

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
hate each other and I thought that was

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.809

this<00:04:00.299> one<00:04:00.450> this<00:04:00.900> one<00:04:01.170> is<00:04:01.200> the<00:04:01.620> one<00:04:01.799> where<00:04:02.280> I

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
this one this one is the one where I

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.280 
this one this one is the one where I
believe<00:04:03.780> they<00:04:04.680> are<00:04:05.180> descendants<00:04:06.180> of<00:04:06.299> gods<00:04:06.900> and

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
believe they are descendants of gods and

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.229 
believe they are descendants of gods and
the<00:04:07.500> two<00:04:07.680> gods<00:04:08.010> their<00:04:08.340> descendants<00:04:08.790> up<00:04:08.910> hate

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
the two gods their descendants up hate

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.509 
the two gods their descendants up hate
each<00:04:09.359> other<00:04:09.600> so<00:04:09.959> their<00:04:10.620> destiny<00:04:11.130> is<00:04:11.310> to

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
each other so their destiny is to

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.610 
each other so their destiny is to
basically<00:04:11.700> kill<00:04:12.120> each<00:04:12.269> other<00:04:12.450> but<00:04:13.139> they<00:04:13.319> fall

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
basically kill each other but they fall

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.539

it's about like a girl who gets called

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.400 
it's about like a girl who gets called
the<00:05:42.560> Duff<00:05:42.800> which<00:05:43.070> is<00:05:43.250> designated<00:05:43.990> ugly<00:05:44.990> fat

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.180 
the Duff which is designated ugly fat
friend<00:05:45.880> by<00:05:46.880> this<00:05:47.090> guy<00:05:47.360> and<00:05:47.900> then<00:05:48.530> she<00:05:48.890> starts

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
friend by this guy and then she starts

having feelings for the guy or they kiss
or<00:05:52.670> something<00:05:52.880> I<00:05:53.420> think<00:05:53.990> there<00:05:54.170> might<00:05:54.290> be

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.350 
or something I think there might be

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.620 
or something I think there might be
mature<00:05:54.740> content<00:05:55.040> in<00:05:55.400> it<00:05:55.580> I<00:05:55.820> don't<00:05:56.000> really<00:05:56.210> know

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
mature content in it I don't really know

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.530

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.090 
bright I read really great reviews on it
and<00:06:01.720> I<00:06:02.720> don't<00:06:02.930> really<00:06:03.020> mind<00:06:03.350> mature<00:06:03.860> content

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.100
