00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.310
 hello friends scoring 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.230
 national my name is manuel mayor and I am 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.210
 the biology professor of the platform 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.950
 and in this video we are going to give you 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.230
 some tips so they can face 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.030
 correctly to biology of all that 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.920
 it's the university selection itself 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.170
 first let's go into what it is 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.670
 biology biology is one of the 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.779
 three branches of the natural sciences that 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.599
 study all the properties of the 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.400
 living beings is the mother science of the 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.099
 science as ecology as the 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.840
 biochemistry of cell biology and it's 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.189
 very important to evaluate within the 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.649
 own university selection is egg 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.780
 It is also a branch of the second century of 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.910
 school education between seventh grade and 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.170
 fourth half and is one of the sciences 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.510
 questions in the university selection 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.820
 of science 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.260
 and in this as we refer to 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.329
 common module and the estimation module in 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.949
 science is pretty easy when 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.629
 we talk about the common module we 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.430
 we are referring to the subject that is 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.199
 taught in first and second medium 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.600
 also incorporating some concepts 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.309
 of seventh and eighth basic the 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.409
 major cognitive skills that 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.909
 they evaluate the common module are the 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:04.600
 recognition and understanding that 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:06.880
 let's talk at the end 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.340
 however elective he is also 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.930
 component of psv science evaluates 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.700
 matter of the first quarter medium but 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.430
 with emphasis on what is the medium level 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.990
 3 and the average level 4 the main ones 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.670
 cognitive skills that evaluates the 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.920
 lesson module are the recognition 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.060
 understanding and skill does that is 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.060
 the analysis synthesis and evaluation 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.930
 how to face the test if I am a biologist 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.720
 biologist the most comfortable and applicable option 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.480
 is to give biology directive and always 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.310
 a very important and very useful thing is 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.260
 face the matter of the common module 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.660
 very deeply and very seriously 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.510
 since a thorough preparation to 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.670
 common module already ensures 70% of the 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.650
 Task accomplished 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.900
 study the biology of first quarter 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.180
 medium requires a long time so 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.680
 it is not possible to study it with two months 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.330
 in advance a month in advance 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.270
 but it has to be organized 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.799
 correctly and something very important that 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.960
 does all the biologists really tell us 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.789
 forget is to study in advance and 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.100
 chemical depth of the common module and 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.679
 physical of the common module since in 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.149
 many cases the people who prefer in 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.569
 the biological sciences cost you a 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.519
 little physical or it costs a little chemistry 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.819
 how to face the test if I am a physical or 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.349
 physics or chemistry or chemical options 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.719
 comfortable of course are their respective 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.040
 electives and how the 18 face 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:26.109
 questions that will have to yield from 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.180
 ideology the level of the common module 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:29.739
 first of all requires knowledge 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.230
 perfectly what is specified in the 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.569
 temple's agenda and it is recommended 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.879
 deepen the subject so that they do not 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.420
 catch on the psv and of course you have to 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:41.459
 train cognitive skills 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.200
 It is also key to the organization and not 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.540
 they must leave biology by the end post 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.640
 which in itself biology is a lot of matter 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.500
 and it also requires a lot of memory 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.500
 which is again in this 2013 in the 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.569
 biology platform went up 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.040
 different classes and different guides that 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.319
 they cover some topics that had not been 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.470
 in depth such as microbiology 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.370
 vidal bacterial microbiology 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.770
 generalities infectious and contagious 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.120
 antibiotic hematology or what is 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.220
 refers to the dynamic properties of 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.190
 the blood of the locomotor system and 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.260
 cell adaptation and the common module will 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.959
 they raised classes to organization 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.930
 tissue cancer molecular apoptosis and 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.330
 macro of the gene herd I decided his concepts 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.140
 and health during pregnancy 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.090
 fertilization and embryonic development that 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.160
 it is an update and a complement of 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.780
 the class that is already found and ecology 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.130
 1 which is a complement of a 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.700
 update of the class that is already 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.700
 found on the platform 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.390
 how can they organize their time for 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.590
 face the times of science something very 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.110
 important is to make a calendar 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.459
 annual before March is to say that starts 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.640
 in your academic year already with the 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.379
 structuring made establish a 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.989
 system of goals and objectives ie 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:51.940
 for giving them an example for May I want to 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.040
 have already finished digestive system and 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.840
 cardiovascular system for August 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.650
 I want to have Mendelian genetics ready and 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.959
 so on 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.459
 do not leave matter for the last minute and 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.079
 ideally you have to have all the 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.470
 matter studied both chemical physics and 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:07.930
 Biology for the middle of November 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.970
 and remember that the time your science does not 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.740
 it's just that lectivo is a lousy 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.810
 mistake that because they are going to give the version of 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.720
 sciences mention biology are going to study 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.340
 a lot of biology and in the end they are going to 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.660
 study the rest and so respectively 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.760
 It is their selective but must 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.170
 study each of the components that 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.080
 they wonder at the time their science 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.910
 as if it were a priority what are 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.200
 the parameters they require for 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.060
 train cognitive skills in 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.530
 the time its science to train the 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.620
 Recognition skill have to be 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.720
 able to quote describe define 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.930
 list identify and recognize certain 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.190
 concepts and elements in understanding are 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.160
 many the parameters that have to 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.500
 dominate particularly classify power 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.440
 compare being able to differentiate and discriminate 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.510
 different concepts establish power 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.580
 express certain conclusions from 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.950
 of certain data and represent and 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.870
 relate information and one of the 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.900
 more complex skills to train is 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.820
 the skill does analysis teeth and 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.470
 evaluation in which they require by 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.380
 supposed to analyze to be able to deduce 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.000
 discriminate inferring organize 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.249
 information to be able to build schemes 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.679
 be able to design 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:16.989
 methodologies plan to evaluate the 

00:05:14.679 --> 00:05:19.419
 information and in that way judge and 

00:05:16.989 --> 00:05:22.739
 to be able to conclude something that is usually 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:22.739
 the answer to the question 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.830
 I wish you the greatest success in the 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.090
 way we are being undertaken 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.800
 in any of the classes that are 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.960
 recorded on the platform or if we see each other 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.740
 people out there a lot of strength and a lot 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.740
 success chao
