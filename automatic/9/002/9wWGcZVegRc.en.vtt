area that you had to focus on that you

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.930 
area that you had to focus on that you
look<00:00:54.870> at<00:00:55.020> as<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.170> transition<00:00:55.860> from<00:00:56.550> where<00:00:56.730> you

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
look at as a transition from where you

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.400 
look at as a transition from where you
are<00:00:57.059> as<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.480> initial<00:00:57.780> what<00:00:58.140> would<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.379> be

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
are as to the initial what would it be

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.660 
are as to the initial what would it be
like<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:59.010> there<00:00:59.129> really<00:00:59.219> hope<00:00:59.430> one

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
like is there really hope one

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.779 
like is there really hope one

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
specifically probably just for my

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.520 
specifically probably just for my
defensive<00:01:03.239> zone<00:01:03.270> play<00:01:03.629> not<00:01:04.500> letting

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
defensive zone play not letting

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.890 
defensive zone play not letting
awareness<00:01:05.489> or<00:01:05.700> yeah<00:01:06.119> we're<00:01:06.360> honest<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.810> just

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
awareness or yeah we're honest and just

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.620 
awareness or yeah we're honest and just
keeping<00:01:07.320> my<00:01:07.470> guy<00:01:07.820> near<00:01:08.820> me<00:01:09.060> not<00:01:09.299> letting<00:01:09.570> him

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
keeping my guy near me not letting him

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.780 
keeping my guy near me not letting him
drift<00:01:09.900> away<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:11.189> know<00:01:11.280> getting<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.610> shot

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
drift away and you know getting a shot

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.730 
drift away and you know getting a shot
maybe<00:01:12.090> maybe<00:01:12.570> getting<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.960> role<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.409> that's<00:01:13.590> one

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
maybe maybe getting a role so that's one

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.679 
maybe maybe getting a role so that's one
thing<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:14.040> gotta<00:01:14.250> focus<00:01:14.430> on<00:01:14.700> just<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.540> gotta

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
thing I gotta focus on just you gotta

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.090 
thing I gotta focus on just you gotta
have<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.930> right<00:01:15.960> mentality<00:01:16.439> when<00:01:16.890> you're<00:01:17.040> in

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
have the right mentality when you're in

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.830 
have the right mentality when you're in
the<00:01:17.159> defensive<00:01:17.610> zone<00:01:17.640> if<00:01:18.509> you're<00:01:18.720> just

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
the defensive zone if you're just

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.260 
the defensive zone if you're just
thinking<00:01:19.250> offense<00:01:20.250> offense<00:01:20.430> often<00:01:21.030> stand

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
thinking offense offense often stand

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.690 
thinking offense offense often stand
then<00:01:21.619> usually<00:01:22.619> they're<00:01:23.159> going<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.369> score<00:01:23.580> on

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
then usually they're going to score on

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.830 
then usually they're going to score on
you<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.150> you're<00:01:24.299> not<00:01:24.420> going<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.600> put<00:01:24.750> the

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840
