00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
that if your cycles on you know the 23rd

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.109 
that if your cycles on you know the 23rd
to<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.450> 23rd<00:01:39.869> whatever<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:41.340> can<00:01:41.549> put<00:01:42.030> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
billing cycle in there so this thing

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.609 
billing cycle in there so this thing
tracks<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.040> here<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.030> can<00:01:45.060> change<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:46.590> that

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
tracks so here you can change it so that

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.850 
tracks so here you can change it so that
this<00:01:46.950> thing<00:01:47.189> tracks<00:01:47.840> in<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.990> right<00:01:49.140> times<00:01:49.439> for

it off shuts off your data so you don't

it off shuts off your data so you don't
go<00:02:21.290> over<00:02:21.560> it<00:02:21.620> but<00:02:22.520> you<00:02:22.580> can<00:02:22.730> adjust<00:02:22.820> it<00:02:23.210> you

go over it but you can adjust it you

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.660 
go over it but you can adjust it you
just<00:02:23.720> hold<00:02:23.960> down<00:02:24.050> on<00:02:24.380> it<00:02:24.530> promise<00:02:25.280> I'm<00:02:25.520> gonna

say it's gonna alert me at let's say 1.5
gigs<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:31.430> I<00:02:31.490> like<00:02:31.700> you<00:02:31.820> have<00:02:31.940> a<00:02:31.970> two<00:02:32.180> gig<00:02:32.390> data

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
gigs and I like you have a two gig data

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.390 
gigs and I like you have a two gig data
plan<00:02:32.930> then<00:02:33.140> you<00:02:33.290> want<00:02:33.500> to<00:02:33.940> shut<00:02:34.940> off<00:02:36.220> see<00:02:37.220> if<00:02:37.250> I

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
plan then you want to shut off see if I

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.500 
plan then you want to shut off see if I
can<00:02:37.520> get<00:02:37.610> it<00:02:37.730> down<00:02:37.850> there<00:02:38.500> at<00:02:40.120> you<00:02:41.120> know<00:02:41.240> one

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
can get it down there at you know one

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.660 
can get it down there at you know one
point<00:02:41.810> eight<00:02:41.960> gigs<00:02:42.230> just<00:02:43.220> to<00:02:43.310> make<00:02:43.370> sure<00:02:43.490> you

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
point eight gigs just to make sure you

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.980 
point eight gigs just to make sure you
don't<00:02:43.880> go<00:02:44.060> over<00:02:45.550> you<00:02:46.550> this<00:02:47.030> is<00:02:47.210> going<00:02:47.390> to<00:02:47.480> be<00:02:47.750> a

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
don't go over you this is going to be a

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.960 
don't go over you this is going to be a
basically<00:02:48.680> kind<00:02:48.980> of<00:02:49.130> a<00:02:49.190> guesstimate<00:02:49.730> of<00:02:49.850> how

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
basically kind of a guesstimate of how

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.470 
basically kind of a guesstimate of how
much<00:02:50.150> data<00:02:50.330> you<00:02:50.450> used<00:02:51.130> online<00:02:52.130> from<00:02:52.940> verizon

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
much data you used online from verizon

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.270 
much data you used online from verizon
is<00:02:53.570> going<00:02:53.720> to<00:02:53.780> be<00:02:53.900> a<00:02:53.930> better<00:02:54.160> indicator<00:02:55.160> of

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
is going to be a better indicator of

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.760 
is going to be a better indicator of
that<00:02:55.580> but<00:02:56.450> that's<00:02:56.810> why<00:02:56.990> I<00:02:57.020> put<00:02:57.320> that<00:02:57.470> below<00:02:57.710> two

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
that but that's why I put that below two

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.450 
that but that's why I put that below two
gigs<00:02:58.160> just<00:02:58.670> in<00:02:58.820> case<00:02:59.920> so<00:03:00.920> basically<00:03:01.250> if<00:03:01.370> you

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
gigs just in case so basically if you

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.130 
gigs just in case so basically if you
get<00:03:01.580> up<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:01.820> a<00:03:01.850> gig<00:03:02.060> and<00:03:02.240> a<00:03:02.390> half<00:03:02.600> it'll<00:03:02.930> warn

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
get up to a gig and a half it'll warn

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.310 
get up to a gig and a half it'll warn
you<00:03:03.290> I'll<00:03:04.070> give<00:03:04.250> you<00:03:04.370> an<00:03:04.460> alert<00:03:04.670> message

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
you I'll give you an alert message

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.970 
you I'll give you an alert message
probably<00:03:06.320> up<00:03:06.410> here<00:03:06.590> in<00:03:06.650> your<00:03:06.770> notification

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
probably up here in your notification

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.710 
probably up here in your notification
pull<00:03:07.580> down<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:09.620> then<00:03:10.180> if<00:03:11.180> you<00:03:11.270> actually<00:03:11.420> hit

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
pull down and then if you actually hit

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.510 
pull down and then if you actually hit
one<00:03:11.930> point<00:03:12.170> eight<00:03:12.320> gigs<00:03:12.590> in<00:03:12.860> this<00:03:13.280> setting

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
one point eight gigs in this setting

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.000 
one point eight gigs in this setting
it's<00:03:14.180> going<00:03:14.420> to<00:03:14.480> shut<00:03:15.050> off<00:03:15.200> data<00:03:15.620> and<00:03:15.860> this

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
it's going to shut off data and this

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.470 
it's going to shut off data and this
thing<00:03:16.220> will<00:03:16.370> be<00:03:16.490> turned<00:03:16.760> off<00:03:16.940> right<00:03:17.150> here<00:03:17.330> this

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
thing will be turned off right here this

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.480 
thing will be turned off right here this
little<00:03:17.600> toggle<00:03:17.870> so<00:03:18.710> mobile<00:03:19.010> data<00:03:19.190> will<00:03:19.370> be

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
little toggle so mobile data will be

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.700 
little toggle so mobile data will be
shut<00:03:19.760> off<00:03:20.020> that's<00:03:21.020> basically<00:03:21.170> how<00:03:21.440> it<00:03:21.500> works

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 
shut off that's basically how it works

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.500 
shut off that's basically how it works
if<00:03:22.310> you<00:03:22.430> have<00:03:22.640> you<00:03:22.820> know<00:03:22.910> like<00:03:23.030> a<00:03:23.060> four<00:03:23.330> gig

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
if you have you know like a four gig

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.510 
if you have you know like a four gig
plan<00:03:23.780> you<00:03:23.960> could<00:03:24.080> bring<00:03:24.260> this<00:03:24.410> up<00:03:24.620> you<00:03:25.340> could

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
plan you could bring this up you could

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.840 
plan you could bring this up you could
put<00:03:25.670> yourself<00:03:26.120> at<00:03:26.330> you<00:03:26.540> know<00:03:27.460> you<00:03:28.460> know<00:03:28.580> what

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
put yourself at you know you know what

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.330 
put yourself at you know you know what
3.8<00:03:29.720> or<00:03:29.780> something<00:03:30.140> like<00:03:30.200> that<00:03:30.260> and<00:03:30.590> then<00:03:31.250> you

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
3.8 or something like that and then you

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.880 
3.8 or something like that and then you
could<00:03:31.490> have<00:03:31.580> a<00:03:31.610> warning<00:03:32.060> it<00:03:32.440> you<00:03:33.440> know<00:03:33.530> I<00:03:33.680> don't

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
could have a warning it you know I don't

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.590 
could have a warning it you know I don't
know<00:03:34.360> 35<00:03:35.360> if<00:03:35.690> you<00:03:35.810> want<00:03:36.640> and<00:03:37.640> you<00:03:38.240> can<00:03:38.360> work<00:03:38.480> it

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
know 35 if you want and you can work it

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.230 
know 35 if you want and you can work it
like<00:03:38.690> that<00:03:38.900> so<00:03:39.500> now<00:03:40.220> you've<00:03:40.520> got<00:03:40.700> that<00:03:40.850> set<00:03:41.120> in

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
like that so now you've got that set in

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.030 
like that so now you've got that set in
there<00:03:41.420> it's<00:03:41.900> just<00:03:42.140> going<00:03:42.260> to<00:03:42.290> run<00:03:42.500> you<00:03:42.530> can<00:03:42.860> see

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
there it's just going to run you can see

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.650 
there it's just going to run you can see
if<00:03:43.130> we<00:03:43.250> scroll<00:03:43.460> down<00:03:43.520> you<00:03:43.790> can<00:03:43.850> see<00:03:43.940> what<00:03:44.450> apps

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
if we scroll down you can see what apps

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.890 
if we scroll down you can see what apps
you've<00:03:44.930> used<00:03:45.140> that<00:03:45.260> have<00:03:45.470> used<00:03:45.680> a<00:03:45.800> lot<00:03:45.890> of<00:03:46.040> data

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
you've used that have used a lot of data

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.820 
you've used that have used a lot of data
if<00:03:47.900> certain<00:03:48.110> things<00:03:48.320> are<00:03:48.380> using<00:03:48.650> a<00:03:48.680> lot<00:03:48.800> of

if certain things are using a lot of
