00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
self-tapping screws and you can take a

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.590 
self-tapping screws and you can take a
look<00:00:34.440> at<00:00:34.559> those<00:00:34.770> some<00:00:35.520> people<00:00:35.820> use<00:00:35.850> glucose

see the nice silver line on that that
little<00:01:32.340> black<00:01:32.580> or<00:01:33.060> use<00:01:33.270> carbide<00:01:33.840> tip<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.380> what

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
little black or use carbide tip and what

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.770 
little black or use carbide tip and what
he's<00:01:35.070> going<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.310> do<00:01:35.520> now<00:01:35.880> he's<00:01:36.210> going<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.510> cut

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
he's going to do now he's going to cut

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.140 
he's going to do now he's going to cut
to<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.680> metal<00:01:37.920> just<00:01:38.250> above<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.760> silver

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
to that metal just above that silver

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.310 
to that metal just above that silver
line<00:01:39.299> actually<00:01:39.570> because<00:01:40.110> there<00:01:40.200> was<00:01:40.290> a

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
line actually because there was a

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.680 
line actually because there was a
thickness<00:01:40.560> between<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.190> metal<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.700> scribe

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
thickness between the metal and scribe

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.780 
thickness between the metal and scribe
so<00:01:43.320> he's<00:01:43.470> going<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.650> go<00:01:43.740> just<00:01:43.979> above<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.580> and

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
so he's going to go just above that and

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.219 
so he's going to go just above that and
then<00:01:45.240> when<00:01:45.270> he<00:01:45.390> puts<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.750> up<00:01:45.840> there<00:01:46.020> he'll<00:01:46.140> have

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
then when he puts it up there he'll have

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.800 
then when he puts it up there he'll have
a<00:01:46.290> nice<00:01:46.530> but<00:01:46.920> fit<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.729> he<00:01:47.909> can<00:01:48.090> weld<00:01:48.330> to<00:01:48.600> so

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
a nice but fit that he can weld to so

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.420 
a nice but fit that he can weld to so
that<00:01:48.840> when<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.200> go<00:01:49.380> on<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.710> back<00:01:49.920> side<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
that when you go on the back side of the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.520 
that when you go on the back side of the
panel<00:01:50.790> there's<00:01:50.939> no<00:01:51.119> scene<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:52.080> if<00:01:52.229> somebody

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
panel there's no scene so if somebody

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.929 
panel there's no scene so if somebody
looks<00:01:52.710> at<00:01:52.799> inside<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.250> trunk<00:01:53.520> they're<00:01:53.790> not

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
looks at inside the trunk they're not

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.250 
looks at inside the trunk they're not
going<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.090> see<00:01:54.330> like<00:01:54.510> the<00:01:54.630> car<00:01:54.810> has<00:01:54.930> ever<00:01:55.049> been

and here's the quarter panel after
Thomas<00:02:03.960> got<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.260> tacked<00:02:04.979> in<00:02:05.220> as<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:06.360> can<00:02:06.570> see

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
Thomas got it tacked in as you can see

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.070 
Thomas got it tacked in as you can see
that<00:02:07.860> scribe<00:02:08.369> mark<00:02:08.759> makes<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.569> makes<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.899> big

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
that scribe mark makes it makes a big

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.620 
that scribe mark makes it makes a big
difference<00:02:10.140> because<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:11.280> think<00:02:12.120> goes<00:02:12.270> tack

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
difference because I think goes tack

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.600 
difference because I think goes tack
weld<00:02:12.900> zone<00:02:12.990> you<00:02:13.290> can<00:02:13.440> see<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.860> nice<00:02:14.100> little

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
weld zone you can see the nice little

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.300 
weld zone you can see the nice little
razor<00:02:15.569> blade<00:02:15.900> gap<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.530> this<00:02:16.650> is<00:02:16.830> important

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
razor blade gap and this is important

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.610 
razor blade gap and this is important
because<00:02:17.400> if<00:02:17.670> it's<00:02:17.790> tighter<00:02:18.300> than<00:02:18.510> this<00:02:18.750> the

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
because if it's tighter than this the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.820 
because if it's tighter than this the
panel<00:02:20.300> when<00:02:21.300> it<00:02:21.390> gets<00:02:21.569> heated<00:02:21.840> up<00:02:22.050> will<00:02:22.380> expand

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
panel when it gets heated up will expand

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.920 
panel when it gets heated up will expand
and<00:02:23.040> it<00:02:23.130> will<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.610> will<00:02:23.640> either<00:02:23.910> pucker<00:02:24.270> in<00:02:24.569> or

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
and it will it will either pucker in or

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.660 
and it will it will either pucker in or
out<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.380> you<00:02:25.470> don't<00:02:25.650> want<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:25.980> if<00:02:26.310> it's<00:02:26.489> too

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
out and you don't want that if it's too

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.930 
out and you don't want that if it's too
big<00:02:26.940> then<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.239> Maguire's<00:02:27.660> going<00:02:28.140> in<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:28.590> out

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
big then the Maguire's going in and out

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.460 
big then the Maguire's going in and out
and<00:02:29.940> you'll<00:02:30.330> have<00:02:30.510> wire<00:02:30.840> sticking<00:02:31.170> through

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
and you'll have wire sticking through

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.080 
and you'll have wire sticking through
the<00:02:31.560> panel<00:02:31.890> so<00:02:32.040> this<00:02:32.220> is<00:02:32.370> absolutely<00:02:32.850> perfect

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
the panel so this is absolutely perfect

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.740 
the panel so this is absolutely perfect
you<00:02:33.540> can<00:02:33.720> see<00:02:33.930> how<00:02:34.140> consistent<00:02:34.769> it<00:02:34.860> is<00:02:35.600> all<00:02:36.600> the

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
you can see how consistent it is all the

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.000 
you can see how consistent it is all the
way<00:02:36.810> down<00:02:36.989> through<00:02:37.230> there<00:02:37.350> he'll<00:02:37.709> go<00:02:37.830> ahead

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
way down through there he'll go ahead

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.470 
way down through there he'll go ahead
and<00:02:38.160> he'll<00:02:38.310> weld<00:02:38.519> that<00:02:38.670> very<00:02:38.910> carefully<00:02:39.150> and

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
and he'll weld that very carefully and

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.170 
and he'll weld that very carefully and
very<00:02:39.540> slowly<00:02:39.830> he'll<00:02:40.830> work<00:02:41.040> like<00:02:41.280> down<00:02:41.820> on<00:02:41.970> one

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
very slowly he'll work like down on one

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.030 
very slowly he'll work like down on one
end<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.570> then<00:02:43.320> it'll<00:02:43.500> work<00:02:43.680> done<00:02:43.890> on<00:02:43.920> the

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
end and then it'll work done on the

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.860 
end and then it'll work done on the
other<00:02:44.310> end<00:02:44.580> guests<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.420> then<00:02:45.510> they'll<00:02:45.630> cool

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
other end guests and then they'll cool

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.650 
other end guests and then they'll cool
it<00:02:45.989> in<00:02:46.110> between<00:02:46.380> with<00:02:46.530> air<00:02:46.739> blowers<00:02:47.160> so<00:02:47.660> good

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
it in between with air blowers so good

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.240 
it in between with air blowers so good
job<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:50.790> panel<00:02:51.600> it<00:02:51.720> does<00:02:51.900> not<00:02:52.080> fit<00:02:52.440> as<00:02:52.680> you

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
job to a panel it does not fit as you

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.780 
job to a panel it does not fit as you
can<00:02:53.370> see<00:02:53.640> this<00:02:53.820> is<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.030> very<00:02:54.570> large<00:02:54.870> gap<00:02:55.350> about<00:02:56.280> a

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
can see this is a very large gap about a

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.120 
can see this is a very large gap about a
quarter<00:02:57.690> inch<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:58.050> three<00:02:58.440> eighths<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.800> an<00:02:58.950> inch

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
quarter inch to three eighths of an inch

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.250 
quarter inch to three eighths of an inch
and<00:02:59.489> we're<00:02:59.790> going<00:02:59.910> to<00:02:59.940> close<00:03:00.300> that<00:03:00.330> up<00:03:00.630> mom's

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
and we're going to close that up mom's

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.650 
and we're going to close that up mom's
going<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.560> add<00:03:01.769> some<00:03:01.800> wire<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.090> grind

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
going to add some wire to it and grind

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.750 
going to add some wire to it and grind
it<00:03:03.930> down<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:04.500> get<00:03:04.680> that<00:03:04.709> two<00:03:05.010> three<00:03:05.250> sixteenth

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
it down and get that two three sixteenth

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.420 
it down and get that two three sixteenth
which<00:03:06.030> is<00:03:06.180> our<00:03:06.329> standard<00:03:06.920> so<00:03:07.920> let's<00:03:08.190> take<00:03:08.370> a

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
which is our standard so let's take a

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.700 
which is our standard so let's take a
look
