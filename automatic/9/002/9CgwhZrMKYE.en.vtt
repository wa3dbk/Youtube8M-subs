like<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.520> 30<00:00:32.520> extra<00:00:33.000> dollars<00:00:33.300> because<00:00:33.750> or<00:00:34.290> it

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
like the 30 extra dollars because or it

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.350 
like the 30 extra dollars because or it
was<00:00:34.590> like<00:00:34.770> fifty<00:00:35.100> or<00:00:35.130> something<00:00:35.579> because<00:00:36.030> the

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
was like fifty or something because the

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.200 
was like fifty or something because the
one<00:00:36.600> only<00:00:36.780> has<00:00:37.170> one<00:00:37.200> speed<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.850> believe

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
one only has one speed and I believe

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.000 
one only has one speed and I believe
that<00:00:39.239> one<00:00:39.510> was<00:00:39.690> like<00:00:39.719> 120<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:40.800> one's

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
that one was like 120 and this one's

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.639 
that one was like 120 and this one's
like<00:00:41.129> 160<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.780> pretty<00:00:43.020> pricey<00:00:43.260> so

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
like 160 so it is pretty pricey so

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:44.660 
like 160 so it is pretty pricey so
that's<00:00:43.829> why<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:43.980> wanted<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.309> do<00:00:44.399> in<00:00:44.520> first

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
that's why I wanted to do in first

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.819 
that's why I wanted to do in first
impressions<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.420> see<00:00:45.660> like<00:00:45.870> what<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.559> think

ability<00:04:08.700> so<00:04:09.700> I<00:04:10.030> guess<00:04:10.810> I'm<00:04:11.110> going<00:04:11.319> to<00:04:11.440> go<00:04:11.620> try

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
ability so I guess I'm going to go try

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.790 
ability so I guess I'm going to go try
that<00:04:12.310> um<00:04:12.580> I<00:04:13.030> don't<00:04:13.629> know<00:04:13.750> what<00:04:13.930> 2030<00:04:14.349> is<00:04:14.530> she

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:47.980 

am<00:05:37.150> I<00:05:37.270> supposed<00:05:37.539> to<00:05:37.599> be<00:05:37.810> counting

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:17.329

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.670 
because you know when you get like that
cooling<00:06:43.470> sensation<00:06:43.850> but<00:06:44.850> I<00:06:45.440> don't<00:06:46.440> know<00:06:46.650> I

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 
cooling sensation but I don't know I

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.080 
cooling sensation but I don't know I
don't<00:06:46.920> think<00:06:47.190> I<00:06:47.250> can<00:06:47.460> see<00:06:47.610> like<00:06:47.760> I<00:06:47.850> totally

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.090 
don't think I can see like I totally

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:49.820 
don't think I can see like I totally
different<00:06:48.510> right<00:06:48.690> now<00:06:48.750> my<00:06:49.380> skin<00:06:49.590> looks<00:06:49.740> a

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830 
different right now my skin looks a

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.650 
different right now my skin looks a
little<00:06:49.920> redder<00:06:50.250> it<00:06:50.760> does<00:06:51.000> feel<00:06:51.270> a<00:06:51.300> lot

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:51.660 
little redder it does feel a lot

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:58.220 
little redder it does feel a lot
smoother<00:06:52.700> um<00:06:53.720> I<00:06:55.730> can't<00:06:56.730> really<00:06:56.880> tell<00:06:57.330> you<00:06:57.360> if

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:58.230 
smoother um I can't really tell you if

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.730 
smoother um I can't really tell you if
it<00:06:58.410> made<00:06:58.590> that<00:06:58.770> a<00:06:58.800> world<00:06:59.400> of<00:06:59.640> a<00:06:59.700> difference<00:07:00.740> but

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:01.740 
it made that a world of a difference but

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.740 
it made that a world of a difference but
I<00:07:02.100> guess<00:07:02.460> maybe<00:07:02.640> in<00:07:02.940> the<00:07:03.030> close-ups<00:07:03.480> you<00:07:03.570> guys

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:03.750 
I guess maybe in the close-ups you guys

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.810 
I guess maybe in the close-ups you guys
can<00:07:03.960> see<00:07:04.170> a<00:07:04.200> little<00:07:04.440> bit<00:07:04.590> better<00:07:04.740> but<00:07:05.190> it<00:07:05.550> feels

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:05.820 
can see a little bit better but it feels

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.660 
can see a little bit better but it feels
a<00:07:06.180> lot<00:07:06.300> smoother<00:07:06.990> I<00:07:07.380> feel<00:07:08.100> like<00:07:08.220> my<00:07:08.340> pores<00:07:08.580> are

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:08.670

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.550 
a lot smoother I feel like my pores are
open<00:07:08.910> because<00:07:08.970> you<00:07:09.180> know<00:07:09.330> like<00:07:09.990> the<00:07:10.170> chilling
