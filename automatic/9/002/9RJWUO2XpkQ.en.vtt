00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello by this video i will you 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.750
 show how to make a sauce 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.760
 truffle butter 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.820
 to start you need 50 g of 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.280
 truffle butter pink salt 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:19.770
 the himalaya that has much more taste 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:23.550
 the white salt pepper of dimi 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:28.160
 liters of semi-skimmed milk from maize 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:33.050
 sauce line to help bind your sauce 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.940
 and to finish 5 g of flour 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.160
 I start by melting Montbert 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.230
 truffles so as you can see 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.010
 it's a butter with small 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.969
 broken black truffle inside 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.020
 so I found them in my 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.149
 supermarket 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.920
 if you have trouble finding one 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.289
 can do it yourself 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.239
 with truffle and butter 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.879
 just enough to cut 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.100
 very small truffle chips and the 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.100
 mix with your traditional butter 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.540
 once the truffle butter has melted 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:11.900
 I add flour to make one 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.900
 red and I mix 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.320
 and that's when I get them 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.320
 add the semi skimmed milk 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.310
 I mix well high 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:59.170
 and then I add the salt of the Himalayas and the 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:02:02.620
 pepper and to finish and I add 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:06.460
 the equivalent of a tablespoon of 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:16.450
 line is sauce that will help my sauce to 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:19.150
 now link my butter sauce to 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.810
 truffle is over I'm already starting to 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.880
 feel the good flavors of truffles I 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.440
 all I have to do is cut my gas 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.720
 relive in a small ramequin test 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.940
 near there is more than to taste your 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.580
 truffle butter sauce is complete 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.950
 a recipe that I recommend because 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.470
 she is simply delicious and 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.470
 blends perfectly with all 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.680
 meat and all fish 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.680
 good tasting
