00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.930
 My name is Manuel Garza Montemayor 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.720
 we are at the ranch of the rosita 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.540
 located to the west of new laredo 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:22.150
 approximately 40 km is a ranch 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:25.420
 of 4000 hectares that he drives around 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.130
 of 400 animals between boy and big 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.320
 is a ranch that is dedicated to the breeding of 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.380
 won 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.150
 not to grow cattle but to produce 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.800
 produce calves and calves calves 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.590
 for export in livestock 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.730
 record so we try to produce 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.730
 stallions that are active for the 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.769
 commercial rancher brought us here to 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.890
 introduce this product that is called 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.590
 booster range 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.300
 and I think it's a pretty product 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.300
 interesting since he promised 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.720
 to be functioning within the belly of the 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:01.400
 animal for three days 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.140
 and the amount that was going to be given was 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.030
 a minimum thing and the 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.400
 handling costs 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.790
 especially 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:15.370
 and those of food to give to the cattle 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.380
 we treat dry 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.440
 passed between past lives are pure 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.350
 dry with who says 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.140
 and really have been before and 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.000
 looking for and throwing pages and how much 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.610
 we are left with the pure product and quite 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.020
 satisfied 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:36.050
 and well this aside from that well it is well 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:40.180
 comfortable because instead of moving around 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.180
 where the 800 every three days 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.520
 160 kilos I go around the ranch and 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:49.090
 I do not worry about three days 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.740
 I believe that I can definitely recommend 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.869
 this product for all my companions 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.539
 in fact I have done it to the extent that I have 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.030
 could here in the region some already 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.880
 they are using and little by little they are 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:05.950
 convincing of how good the 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:09.539
 product of how efficient it is 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.539
 how costs are lowered 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.340
