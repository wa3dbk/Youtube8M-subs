00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.509
 Hello friends, I 'm going to show you how 

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:09.080
 share the internet they have in their 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.300
 smartphone using bluetooth 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:16.010
 so in this case I have a 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:18.680
 Android device that has internet and 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.910
 I have another device in this case to 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.750
 I'll do it with an example 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.670
 ipod could not be an iphone an ipad 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.580
 tablet 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:32.509
 a pc any device that has 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.520
 bluetooth and can make a connection to 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.610
 Internet 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:40.160
 then we start 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.960
 I'm going to set up the device first 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.960
 who has the internet 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.440
 I'm going 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.400
 activate bluetooth 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.360
 what active 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.630
 Do not make the portable area and anchor 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.420
 net 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:08.480
 in connection to the bluetooth network 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.730
 and he tells me that he deactivated the 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.850
 visibility of my device in the 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:17.200
 bluetooth then now I'm going to the 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.200
 bluetooth configuration here 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.909
 I make it visible then visible my 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.740
 device 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.479
 according to check there but I go to the other 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.409
 device in this case so 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.409
 example is an ipod 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.160
 I'm going to adjustments 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.070
 to bluetooth 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.070
 reagent 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.370
 and here is then 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:00.070

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.490
 link and link here I give to accept 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.490
 here 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:11.760
 and how does it appear it connects us 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:15.660
 or not and on the on the iphone and on the ipad 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:20.210
 a symbol appears that is connected 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:24.890
 to internet not then 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:27.440

 and is loading a page 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.980
 to look for gaps or 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.750

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.590
