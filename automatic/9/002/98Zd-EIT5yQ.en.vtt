00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
they only they did that and I don't

people may not like streaks but they

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.700 
people may not like streaks but they
dumbed<00:02:21.330> it<00:02:21.420> down<00:02:21.480> anyway<00:02:21.960> and<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.440> think<00:02:22.500> if

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
dumbed it down anyway and I think if

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.020 
dumbed it down anyway and I think if
they<00:02:22.830> do<00:02:22.890> that<00:02:23.100> it's<00:02:23.280> really<00:02:23.490> going<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.730> be<00:02:23.790> a

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
they do that it's really going to be a

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.300 
they do that it's really going to be a
failure<00:02:24.600> they<00:02:24.930> need<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.320> incorporate<00:02:25.680> streaks

noobs<00:02:35.910> but<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.270> was<00:02:36.360> still<00:02:36.570> a<00:02:36.600> lot<00:02:36.870> of<00:02:36.990> fun

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
noobs but it was still a lot of fun

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.150 
noobs but it was still a lot of fun
because<00:02:37.500> you<00:02:37.530> were<00:02:37.710> able<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:37.980> get<00:02:38.100> your

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
because you were able to get your

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.770 
because you were able to get your
streaks<00:02:38.490> your<00:02:38.880> friends<00:02:39.180> could<00:02:39.270> get<00:02:39.450> streaks<00:02:39.690> i

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
streaks your friends could get streaks i

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.210 
streaks your friends could get streaks i
also<00:02:39.990> think<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.470> i'm<00:02:40.560> really<00:02:40.650> excited<00:02:40.830> that

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
also think and i'm really excited that

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.470 
also think and i'm really excited that
advanced<00:02:41.490> warfare<00:02:41.820> they're<00:02:41.970> having<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.209> idea

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
advanced warfare they're having the idea

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.420 
advanced warfare they're having the idea
of<00:02:42.570> scorestreaks<00:02:43.500> we're<00:02:43.920> actually<00:02:44.070> you<00:02:44.340> know

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
of scorestreaks we're actually you know

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.860 
of scorestreaks we're actually you know
if<00:02:44.490> you<00:02:44.580> get<00:02:44.730> an<00:02:44.820> assist<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.270> still<00:02:45.510> helps<00:02:45.660> if

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
if you get an assist it still helps if

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.020 
if you get an assist it still helps if
you<00:02:45.959> get<00:02:46.080> an<00:02:46.140> orbital<00:02:46.470> vsat<00:02:46.620> or<00:02:46.980> UAV<00:02:47.280> assist<00:02:47.700> it

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
you get an orbital vsat or UAV assist it

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.250 
you get an orbital vsat or UAV assist it
still<00:02:48.330> helps<00:02:48.450> if<00:02:48.630> you<00:02:48.690> get<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:48.840> kill<00:02:49.050> if<00:02:49.110> you<00:02:49.170> get

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
still helps if you get a kill if you get

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.420 
still helps if you get a kill if you get
a<00:02:49.320> capture<00:02:49.680> kill<00:02:49.860> if<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.010> get<00:02:50.160> stuff<00:02:50.340> like

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
a capture kill if you get stuff like

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.430 
a capture kill if you get stuff like
that<00:02:50.550> it<00:02:50.910> helps<00:02:51.390> out<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.510> ton<00:02:51.600> it<00:02:51.900> gets<00:02:52.140> you<00:02:52.260> up

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
that it helps out a ton it gets you up

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.840 
that it helps out a ton it gets you up
on<00:02:52.620> that<00:02:52.680> little<00:02:52.920> bar<00:02:53.220> that<00:02:53.400> you<00:02:53.459> have<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:53.700> work

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
on that little bar that you have to work

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.460 
on that little bar that you have to work
up<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.060> get<00:02:54.390> your<00:02:54.480> lodestar<00:02:54.900> than<00:02:55.050> your<00:02:55.140> canine

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
play but I do believe that if that if

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.100 
play but I do believe that if that if
advanced<00:03:03.270> warfare<00:03:03.570> can<00:03:03.840> actually

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
advanced warfare can actually

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.630 
advanced warfare can actually
successfully<00:03:04.800> pull<00:03:04.980> off<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.280> fact<00:03:05.520> of

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
successfully pull off the fact of

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.830 
successfully pull off the fact of
bringing<00:03:05.970> back<00:03:06.090> scorestreaks<00:03:06.630> into

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
bringing back scorestreaks into

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.449 
bringing back scorestreaks into
competitive<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.440> pubs<00:03:07.650> I<00:03:07.890> mean<00:03:08.250> they're

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
competitive and pubs I mean they're

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:09.590 
competitive and pubs I mean they're
there<00:03:08.670> already<00:03:08.790> no<00:03:09.030> matter<00:03:09.180> what<00:03:09.360> going<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.540> be

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
there already no matter what going to be

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.790 
there already no matter what going to be
in<00:03:09.690> pubs<00:03:09.900> but<00:03:10.110> if<00:03:10.260> they're<00:03:10.380> actually<00:03:10.620> going<00:03:10.709> to

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
in pubs but if they're actually going to

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.560 
in pubs but if they're actually going to
be<00:03:10.890> dominant<00:03:11.280> pubs<00:03:11.580> on<00:03:11.760> like<00:03:12.150> Call<00:03:12.360> of<00:03:12.390> Duty
