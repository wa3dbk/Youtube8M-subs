a<00:04:36.320> lot<00:04:36.530> of<00:04:36.560> articulation<00:04:37.340> but<00:04:37.550> the<00:04:38.060> movements

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
a lot of articulation but the movements

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.080 
a lot of articulation but the movements

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:12.460 
because they're pretty much the exact
same<00:05:06.160> but<00:05:07.160> it's<00:05:07.460> really<00:05:07.699> cool<00:05:08.500> uh<00:05:10.090> his<00:05:11.470> hands

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
same but it's really cool uh his hands

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.460 
same but it's really cool uh his hands
are<00:05:12.740> are<00:05:13.070> sculpted<00:05:14.060> to<00:05:14.840> fit<00:05:15.050> the<00:05:15.199> blades

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
are are sculpted to fit the blades

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.650 
are are sculpted to fit the blades
perfectly<00:05:16.190> it's<00:05:16.460> just<00:05:16.610> a<00:05:16.849> little<00:05:17.060> circle<00:05:17.479> and

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
perfectly it's just a little circle and

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.740 
perfectly it's just a little circle and
I<00:05:18.229> actually<00:05:18.830> like<00:05:19.130> that<00:05:19.310> a<00:05:19.520> lot<00:05:19.759> since<00:05:20.150> the

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
I actually like that a lot since the

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.390 
I actually like that a lot since the
only<00:05:21.020> thing<00:05:21.289> he's<00:05:21.620> not<00:05:21.800> going<00:05:21.919> to<00:05:21.949> be<00:05:22.009> carrying

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
only thing he's not going to be carrying

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.520 
only thing he's not going to be carrying
any<00:05:22.550> guns<00:05:22.820> or<00:05:23.030> anything<00:05:23.090> so<00:05:23.960> I<00:05:24.020> like<00:05:24.229> it<00:05:24.380> how

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
any guns or anything so I like it how

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.610 
any guns or anything so I like it how
it's<00:05:25.490> nice<00:05:25.880> and<00:05:26.180> a<00:05:26.360> it<00:05:26.930> goes<00:05:26.960> in<00:05:27.320> nice<00:05:27.590> and

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
it's nice and a it goes in nice and

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.390 
it's nice and a it goes in nice and
tight<00:05:27.889> so<00:05:28.720> I'm<00:05:29.720> I<00:05:29.930> am<00:05:30.380> happy<00:05:30.680> they<00:05:30.979> did<00:05:31.159> that

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
tight so I'm I am happy they did that

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.540 
tight so I'm I am happy they did that
but<00:05:31.760> he's<00:05:32.090> got<00:05:32.620> black<00:05:33.620> on<00:05:33.860> the<00:05:33.889> handle<00:05:34.400> on<00:05:34.490> the

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
but he's got black on the handle on the

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:41.730 
but he's got black on the handle on the
low<00:05:34.909> yellow<00:05:35.240> tip<00:05:35.599> so<00:05:37.090> yep<00:05:38.090> it's<00:05:39.050> really<00:05:39.470> cool

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.550 

it's<00:05:42.740> kind<00:05:43.010> of<00:05:43.099> tough<00:05:44.000> to<00:05:44.060> get<00:05:44.270> in<00:05:44.419> but<00:05:44.630> then

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
it's kind of tough to get in but then

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.760 
it's kind of tough to get in but then
you<00:05:45.800> just<00:05:45.830> and<00:05:46.310> it<00:05:46.610> fits<00:05:46.880> really<00:05:47.210> tightly<00:05:47.770> like

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
you just and it fits really tightly like

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.909 
you just and it fits really tightly like
you<00:05:48.979> can<00:05:49.159> wiggle<00:05:49.340> all<00:05:49.820> you<00:05:50.060> want<00:05:50.300> but<00:05:51.289> it<00:05:51.590> stays

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 
you can wiggle all you want but it stays

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:53.820 
you can wiggle all you want but it stays
in<00:05:52.130> there<00:05:52.310> and<00:05:52.490> that's<00:05:53.000> what<00:05:53.180> I'm<00:05:53.270> happy<00:05:53.449> about

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
in there and that's what I'm happy about

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.159 
in there and that's what I'm happy about
because<00:05:54.830> I<00:05:55.250> like<00:05:56.090> it<00:05:56.270> how<00:05:56.419> they<00:05:56.599> didn't<00:05:56.930> just

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.169 
because I like it how they didn't just

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:59.589 
because I like it how they didn't just
make<00:05:57.770> it<00:05:57.830> how<00:05:58.130> you<00:05:58.190> have<00:05:58.490> to<00:05:58.699> how<00:05:59.270> it<00:05:59.479> might

00:05:59.589 --> 00:05:59.599 
make it how you have to how it might

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:03.399 
make it how you have to how it might
drop<00:05:59.960> it<00:06:00.229> I<00:06:00.409> just<00:06:00.949> got<00:06:01.400> it<00:06:01.610> a<00:06:01.729> nice<00:06:02.479> circle<00:06:02.780> so

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:03.409 
drop it I just got it a nice circle so

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:05.230 
drop it I just got it a nice circle so
you<00:06:03.470> can<00:06:03.710> put<00:06:03.889> the<00:06:04.009> blades<00:06:04.250> in<00:06:04.430> perfectly<00:06:04.970> and

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
you can put the blades in perfectly and

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.629 
you can put the blades in perfectly and
that's<00:06:05.750> the<00:06:05.930> only<00:06:05.990> thing<00:06:06.380> you'll<00:06:07.340> probably

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:07.639 
that's the only thing you'll probably

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:11.499 
that's the only thing you'll probably
want<00:06:08.000> to<00:06:08.060> display<00:06:08.539> with<00:06:08.810> cronin<00:06:09.380> so<00:06:10.220> but<00:06:10.699> um<00:06:10.970> a

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:11.509 
want to display with cronin so but um a

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:14.010 
want to display with cronin so but um a
really<00:06:12.259> nice<00:06:12.440> figure<00:06:12.830> and<00:06:13.099> i<00:06:13.699> highly

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
really nice figure and i highly

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.129 
really nice figure and i highly
recommend<00:06:15.020> buying<00:06:15.470> it<00:06:15.740> it's<00:06:15.919> just<00:06:16.300> he's<00:06:17.300> he's

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:18.139 
recommend buying it it's just he's he's

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:20.110 
recommend buying it it's just he's he's
a<00:06:18.169> little<00:06:18.530> rare<00:06:18.800> and<00:06:19.099> if<00:06:19.220> you<00:06:19.340> can't<00:06:19.639> find<00:06:19.880> him

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
a little rare and if you can't find him

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.589 
a little rare and if you can't find him
it'll<00:06:20.389> probably<00:06:20.780> be<00:06:21.050> quite<00:06:21.770> expensive<00:06:21.889> so<00:06:22.610> i

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:23.599 
it'll probably be quite expensive so i

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:25.300 
it'll probably be quite expensive so i
recommend<00:06:24.080> just<00:06:24.440> looking<00:06:24.770> around<00:06:24.919> for

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.310
