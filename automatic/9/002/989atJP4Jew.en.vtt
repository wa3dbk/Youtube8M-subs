00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
see there's quite a large field of

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.200 
see there's quite a large field of
particles<00:00:30.630> if<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.140> walk<00:00:31.349> into<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:32.090> field<00:00:33.090> of

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
particles if you walk into this field of

particles if you walk into this field of
particles<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.809> will<00:00:33.930> get<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.469> potion<00:00:35.280> effect

for that potion that was thrown and
you'll<00:00:39.540> see<00:00:39.690> here<00:00:39.870> it's<00:00:40.170> starting<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.500> run<00:00:40.649> out

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
you'll see here it's starting to run out

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.700

on<00:00:41.010> my<00:00:41.430> my<00:00:42.239> potion<00:00:42.629> timer<00:00:42.809> here<00:00:43.079> but<00:00:43.260> if<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.440> walk

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
on my my potion timer here but if I walk

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.440 
on my my potion timer here but if I walk
into<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:44.129> field<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.550> particles<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.239> get

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
into this field of particles I get

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.990 
into this field of particles I get
another<00:00:45.660> boost<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.440> potion<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.010> this

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
another boost of the potion and this

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.880 
another boost of the potion and this
does<00:00:48.180> work<00:00:48.329> on<00:00:48.510> all<00:00:48.690> entities<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.410> if<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.649> you

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
does work on all entities so if you you

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.950 
does work on all entities so if you you
know<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.039> hit<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.309> cow<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:51.239> cow<00:00:51.449> will<00:00:51.600> get<00:00:51.719> fire

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
know I hit the cow the cow will get fire

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.740 
know I hit the cow the cow will get fire
resistance<00:00:52.530> or<00:00:53.280> whatever<00:00:53.520> other<00:00:54.000> lingering

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
resistance or whatever other lingering

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.990 
resistance or whatever other lingering
potion<00:00:55.110> I've<00:00:55.199> thrown<00:00:55.410> at<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.850> so<00:00:56.850> that's

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
potion I've thrown at it so that's

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.369 
potion I've thrown at it so that's
really<00:00:57.090> cool<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.539> does<00:00:57.690> like<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.870> little<00:00:58.109> area

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
really cool it does like a little area

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.099 
really cool it does like a little area
of<00:00:58.440> effect<00:00:58.800> thing<00:00:59.039> for<00:00:59.430> a<00:01:00.030> fairly<00:01:00.600> significant

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
of effect thing for a fairly significant

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.500 
of effect thing for a fairly significant
amount<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.350> time<00:01:01.559> on<00:01:01.829> some<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.100> these<00:01:02.510> so

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
amount of time on some of these so

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.020 
amount of time on some of these so
that's<00:01:03.690> pretty<00:01:04.080> pretty<00:01:04.650> awesome<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.250> you

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
that's pretty pretty awesome and you

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.719 
that's pretty pretty awesome and you
can't<00:01:06.270> actually<00:01:06.450> brew<00:01:06.840> these<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:08.010> if<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.580> have

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
can't actually brew these so if you have

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.660 
can't actually brew these so if you have
a<00:01:08.810> splash<00:01:09.810> potion<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.530> brewing<00:01:10.680> stand<00:01:10.799> you

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
a splash potion in the brewing stand you

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.460 
a splash potion in the brewing stand you
take<00:01:11.880> another<00:01:12.180> new<00:01:12.360> item<00:01:12.630> called<00:01:12.840> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
take another new item called the

Dragon's<00:01:14.010> Breath<00:01:14.220> which<00:01:15.030> I'll<00:01:15.210> show<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.360> how

to<00:01:15.570> get<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.840> second<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.100> plop<00:01:17.310> that

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
to get in a second and you plop that

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.670 
to get in a second and you plop that
right<00:01:17.549> into<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.939> brewing<00:01:18.270> stand<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.840> then<00:01:19.500> wait

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
right into a brewing stand and then wait

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.999 
right into a brewing stand and then wait
a<00:01:19.710> second<00:01:21.380> eventually<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.530> will<00:01:22.619> end<00:01:22.830> up<00:01:22.950> with

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
a second eventually you will end up with

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.410 
a second eventually you will end up with
some<00:01:23.759> lingering<00:01:24.180> potions<00:01:24.540> just<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:26.420> so

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
some lingering potions just like that so

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.240 
some lingering potions just like that so
a<00:01:27.450> few<00:01:27.720> tidbits<00:01:28.140> about<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.829> lingering

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
a few tidbits about the lingering

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.649 
a few tidbits about the lingering
potions<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:30.000> I'm<00:01:30.119> just<00:01:30.240> gonna<00:01:30.360> go<00:01:30.450> ahead<00:01:30.509> and

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
potions so I'm just gonna go ahead and

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.539 
potions so I'm just gonna go ahead and
throw<00:01:30.810> one<00:01:30.930> on<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.170> ground<00:01:31.350> here<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.890> you'll

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
throw one on the ground here and you'll

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.450 
throw one on the ground here and you'll
see<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.180> potion<00:01:33.840> effect<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.460> basically

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
see the potion effect is basically

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.280 
see the potion effect is basically
covers<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.820> large<00:01:36.090> area<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.540> start<00:01:36.900> off<00:01:37.020> with

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
covers a large area to start off with

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.399 
covers a large area to start off with
and<00:01:37.560> over<00:01:38.400> time<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:39.210> area<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:40.020> effect

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
and over time the area of effect

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.800 
and over time the area of effect
decreases<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:41.850> you'll<00:01:42.000> see<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.240> particles

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
decreases so you'll see the particles

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.679 
decreases so you'll see the particles
become<00:01:43.220> more<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.310> more<00:01:44.369> centralized<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.630> the

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
become more and more centralized in the

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.010 
become more and more centralized in the
center<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.680> where<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.890> threw<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.189> potion<00:01:47.579> and

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
center of where you threw the potion and

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.899 
center of where you threw the potion and
so<00:01:49.020> eventually<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.950> potion<00:01:50.490> totally

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
so eventually the potion totally

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.410 
so eventually the potion totally
dissipates<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.780> completely<00:01:52.350> goes<00:01:52.649> away<00:01:52.950> just

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
dissipates and completely goes away just

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.690 
dissipates and completely goes away just
like<00:01:54.420> it's<00:01:55.290> doing<00:01:55.619> right<00:01:55.770> now<00:01:55.829> there<00:01:56.430> we<00:01:56.549> go

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
like it's doing right now there we go

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.260 
like it's doing right now there we go
but<00:01:57.540> if<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.829> happens<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.520> strike<00:01:59.759> an<00:01:59.909> entity

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
but if it happens to strike an entity

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.780 
but if it happens to strike an entity
number<00:02:01.049> one<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.380> potion<00:02:01.740> can<00:02:01.920> sometimes<00:02:02.340> jump

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
number one the potion can sometimes jump

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.929 
number one the potion can sometimes jump
so<00:02:03.119> if<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.420> throw<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.780> like<00:02:03.899> at<00:02:04.049> this<00:02:04.200> block<00:02:04.500> here

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
so if I throw it like at this block here

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.630 
so if I throw it like at this block here
it'll<00:02:05.939> affect<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.479> cow<00:02:06.719> but<00:02:07.680> whenever<00:02:08.310> an

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
it'll affect this cow but whenever an

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.800 
it'll affect this cow but whenever an
entity<00:02:09.440> gets<00:02:10.440> affected<00:02:10.950> by<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.250> potion<00:02:11.849> the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
entity gets affected by the potion the

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.690 
entity gets affected by the potion the
amount<00:02:14.080> of<00:02:14.170> time<00:02:14.470> that<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:15.010> potion<00:02:15.630> remains

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
amount of time that the potion remains

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.000 
amount of time that the potion remains
decreases<00:02:18.700> so<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.120> potion<00:02:19.450> is<00:02:19.540> sort<00:02:19.750> of

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
decreases so the potion is sort of

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.530 
decreases so the potion is sort of
absorbed<00:02:21.010> if<00:02:21.160> you<00:02:21.250> will<00:02:21.430> by<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.730> mom<00:02:22.000> so<00:02:22.330> I'll

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
absorbed if you will by the mom so I'll

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.930 
absorbed if you will by the mom so I'll
just<00:02:22.660> show<00:02:22.810> you<00:02:22.840> that<00:02:23.130> right<00:02:24.130> here<00:02:24.430> so<00:02:24.670> you<00:02:24.760> see

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
just show you that right here so you see

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.550 
just show you that right here so you see
I<00:02:24.970> threw<00:02:25.300> it<00:02:25.390> there<00:02:25.450> it<00:02:25.810> jumped<00:02:26.110> to<00:02:26.200> him<00:02:26.350> and

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
I threw it there it jumped to him and

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.090 
I threw it there it jumped to him and
now<00:02:27.310> look<00:02:27.850> how<00:02:28.000> fast<00:02:28.300> it<00:02:28.540> goes<00:02:28.690> away<00:02:29.100> that's

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
now look how fast it goes away that's

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.830

over<00:03:33.820> the<00:03:33.910> portal<00:03:34.299> so<00:03:34.600> you<00:03:34.690> actually<00:03:34.810> have<00:03:35.049> to

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
over the portal so you actually have to

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.259 
over the portal so you actually have to
go<00:03:35.260> up<00:03:35.410> and<00:03:35.590> melee<00:03:36.160> it<00:03:36.250> with<00:03:36.400> a<00:03:36.430> sword<00:03:36.790> just

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
go up and melee it with a sword just

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.580 
go up and melee it with a sword just
like<00:03:37.450> this<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:39.239> you<00:03:40.239> can<00:03:40.540> actually<00:03:40.780> get<00:03:41.200> the

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
like this and you can actually get the

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.500 
like this and you can actually get the
end<00:03:41.769> dragon<00:03:42.280> breath<00:03:42.489> from<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:43.000> end<00:03:43.120> dragon

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
end dragon breath from the end dragon

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.160 
end dragon breath from the end dragon

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
directly just like that also the

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.050 
directly just like that also the
textures<00:03:47.620> for<00:03:47.890> the<00:03:48.040> end<00:03:48.250> gateway<00:03:48.730> have<00:03:48.910> been

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
textures for the end gateway have been

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.849 
textures for the end gateway have been
improved<00:03:49.480> and<00:03:49.930> it<00:03:50.109> looks<00:03:50.260> a<00:03:50.380> little<00:03:50.470> bit<00:03:50.650> more

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
improved and it looks a little bit more

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:53.640 
improved and it looks a little bit more

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
legitimately in survival because it now

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.009 
legitimately in survival because it now
