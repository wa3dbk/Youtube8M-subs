important chords I think when you play

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.980 
important chords I think when you play
guitar<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.380> G<00:00:13.380> C<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.460> D<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:15.450> reason<00:00:15.690> those<00:00:15.809> are

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
so if we play them all together it

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:31.970 
so if we play them all together it
should<00:03:24.130> sound<00:03:24.310> like<00:03:24.430> this

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.740 

okay<00:03:32.980> you're<00:03:33.520> going<00:03:33.640> to<00:03:33.700> practice<00:03:33.910> that<00:03:34.240> just

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
okay you're going to practice that just

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.410 
okay you're going to practice that just
like<00:03:34.900> you<00:03:34.990> practice<00:03:35.590> the<00:03:35.740> G<00:03:35.890> chord<00:03:36.490> you<00:03:37.240> play

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
like you practice the G chord you play

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.570 
like you practice the G chord you play
all<00:03:37.600> the<00:03:37.780> notes<00:03:37.980> individually<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.160> then<00:03:39.220> use

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
all the notes individually and then use

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.300 
all the notes individually and then use
strumming<00:03:39.970> okay<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:41.620> last<00:03:41.830> court<00:03:42.100> i'm<00:03:42.190> going

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
strumming okay the last court i'm going

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.580 
strumming okay the last court i'm going
to<00:03:42.370> show<00:03:42.490> you<00:03:42.520> is<00:03:42.820> the<00:03:42.850> D<00:03:43.120> chord<00:03:43.360> this<00:03:44.230> one<00:03:44.410> was

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
to show you is the D chord this one was

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.230 
to show you is the D chord this one was
probably<00:03:44.950> the<00:03:45.160> trickiest<00:03:45.310> one<00:03:45.580> for<00:03:45.910> me<00:03:46.030> when<00:03:46.180> I

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
probably the trickiest one for me when I

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.790 
probably the trickiest one for me when I
was<00:03:46.360> first<00:03:46.510> learning<00:03:46.750> because<00:03:47.410> you<00:03:47.530> got<00:03:47.680> to

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
was first learning because you got to

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.140 
was first learning because you got to
kind<00:03:47.890> of<00:03:48.010> contort<00:03:48.370> your<00:03:48.460> fingers<00:03:48.820> it's<00:03:49.000> not

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
kind of contort your fingers it's not

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.270 
kind of contort your fingers it's not
like<00:03:49.330> it's<00:03:49.540> not<00:03:49.720> nice<00:03:49.930> like<00:03:50.170> the<00:03:50.380> C<00:03:51.040> chord

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
like it's not nice like the C chord

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.480 
like it's not nice like the C chord
where<00:03:51.520> they<00:03:51.640> just<00:03:51.670> kind<00:03:51.970> of<00:03:52.030> fall<00:03:52.300> in<00:03:53.490> you're

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
where they just kind of fall in you're

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.780 
where they just kind of fall in you're
going<00:03:54.610> to<00:03:54.700> put<00:03:54.940> your<00:03:54.970> index<00:03:55.750> finger<00:03:56.530> on<00:03:57.390> the

the this string the D string is played
open<00:04:27.450> okay<00:04:28.450> so<00:04:28.570> when<00:04:28.690> you<00:04:28.750> put<00:04:28.870> all<00:04:28.930> that

open okay so when you put all that
together<00:04:29.290> and<00:04:29.740> remember<00:04:30.190> it's<00:04:30.490> that<00:04:30.580> only

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
together and remember it's that only

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:40.920 
together and remember it's that only
only<00:04:31.120> the<00:04:31.300> bottom<00:04:31.570> four<00:04:31.840> strings<00:04:39.840> remember<00:04:40.840> to

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
only the bottom four strings remember to

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.750 
only the bottom four strings remember to
practice<00:04:41.080> that<00:04:41.320> where<00:04:41.770> you<00:04:42.160> play<00:04:42.370> use<00:04:42.550> note

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
practice that where you play use note

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.920 
practice that where you play use note
individually<00:04:43.330> to<00:04:43.420> make<00:04:43.540> sure<00:04:43.690> you're<00:04:43.810> not

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
individually to make sure you're not

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.470 
individually to make sure you're not
fretting<00:04:44.380> out<00:04:44.620> or<00:04:44.800> missing<00:04:45.160> them<00:04:45.280> node<00:04:46.000> and

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
fretting out or missing them node and

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.510 
fretting out or missing them node and
then<00:04:47.340> strum<00:04:48.340> ok<00:04:49.920> now<00:04:50.920> the<00:04:51.010> last<00:04:51.220> thing<00:04:51.340> you

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
then strum ok now the last thing you

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.040 
then strum ok now the last thing you
want<00:04:51.670> to<00:04:51.700> do<00:04:51.850> is<00:04:52.090> put<00:04:52.330> it<00:04:52.420> all<00:04:52.510> together<00:04:52.660> and

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
want to do is put it all together and

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.330 
want to do is put it all together and
this<00:04:53.170> is<00:04:53.230> this<00:04:53.560> is<00:04:53.710> where<00:04:53.830> you<00:04:53.920> start<00:04:54.130> learning

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
this is this is where you start learning

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.090 
this is this is where you start learning
to<00:04:55.320> Strom<00:04:56.320> and<00:04:56.350> you're<00:04:56.590> going<00:04:56.710> to<00:04:56.770> start

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
to Strom and you're going to start

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.120 
to Strom and you're going to start
learning<00:04:57.250> some<00:04:57.640> timing<00:04:58.890> what<00:04:59.890> I<00:04:59.920> would

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
learning some timing what I would

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.800 
learning some timing what I would
recommend<00:05:00.220> is<00:05:00.820> get<00:05:01.090> your<00:05:01.180> metronomes<00:05:01.600> you've

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
recommend is get your metronomes you've

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.540 
recommend is get your metronomes you've
got<00:05:01.930> a<00:05:01.960> metronome<00:05:02.410> if<00:05:02.740> you<00:05:02.920> don't<00:05:03.130> have<00:05:03.310> one

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
got a metronome if you don't have one

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.280 
got a metronome if you don't have one
yet<00:05:03.760> you<00:05:04.030> can<00:05:04.210> just<00:05:04.390> play<00:05:04.870> along<00:05:04.960> with<00:05:05.230> this

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
yet you can just play along with this

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.620 
yet you can just play along with this
video<00:05:05.470> I'm<00:05:06.400> going<00:05:06.520> to<00:05:06.580> start<00:05:06.790> my<00:05:06.910> metronome<00:05:07.300> at

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
video I'm going to start my metronome at

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.540 
video I'm going to start my metronome at
60<00:05:08.080> beats<00:05:08.290> a<00:05:08.590> second<00:05:09.130> you<00:05:09.220> might<00:05:09.280> need<00:05:09.490> to

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
60 beats a second you might need to

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.610 
60 beats a second you might need to
start<00:05:09.880> it<00:05:09.970> slower<00:05:10.420> than<00:05:10.720> that<00:05:10.900> if<00:05:11.140> you're<00:05:11.560> just

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
start it slower than that if you're just

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.460 
start it slower than that if you're just
starting<00:05:11.950> out<00:05:12.370> and<00:05:12.930> I'm<00:05:13.930> going<00:05:14.110> to<00:05:14.140> show<00:05:14.230> you<00:05:14.380> a

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
starting out and I'm going to show you a

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.400 
starting out and I'm going to show you a
pattern<00:05:14.890> you<00:05:15.010> can<00:05:15.070> use<00:05:15.430> to<00:05:16.360> to<00:05:17.110> get<00:05:17.290> your

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
pattern you can use to to get your

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.710 
pattern you can use to to get your
rhythm<00:05:17.710> down<00:05:18.010> and<00:05:18.430> to<00:05:18.520> be<00:05:18.670> able<00:05:18.730> to<00:05:18.910> transition

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
rhythm down and to be able to transition

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.950 
rhythm down and to be able to transition
between<00:05:20.050> these<00:05:20.290> chords<00:05:20.680> quickly<00:05:21.660> ok<00:05:22.660> so<00:05:22.720> we're

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
between these chords quickly ok so we're

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.210 
between these chords quickly ok so we're
going<00:05:22.990> to<00:05:23.170> start<00:05:23.200> the<00:05:23.470> metronome<00:05:26.040> and<00:05:27.040> then

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
going to start the metronome and then

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.220 
going to start the metronome and then
for<00:05:27.370> every<00:05:27.490> tick<00:05:27.880> i'm<00:05:28.060> going<00:05:28.210> to<00:05:28.270> play<00:05:28.480> i'm

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230 
for every tick i'm going to play i'm

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.160 
for every tick i'm going to play i'm
going<00:05:29.440> to<00:05:29.500> strum<00:05:29.740> down<00:05:29.770> and<00:05:30.540> then<00:05:31.540> i'm<00:05:32.050> going

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.170 
going to strum down and then i'm going

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.510 
going to strum down and then i'm going
to<00:05:32.230> strong<00:05:32.590> saw<00:05:32.860> what<00:05:33.010> i<00:05:33.040> want<00:05:33.160> to<00:05:33.220> do<00:05:33.310> is<00:05:33.340> I'm

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
to strong saw what i want to do is I'm

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.510 
to strong saw what i want to do is I'm
going<00:05:33.550> strong<00:05:33.910> the<00:05:34.390> G<00:05:34.600> chord<00:05:34.840> four<00:05:35.200> times

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
going strong the G chord four times

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.230 
going strong the G chord four times
because<00:05:36.520> there's<00:05:36.670> four<00:05:36.850> beats<00:05:37.060> of<00:05:37.210> a

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
because there's four beats of a

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.120 
because there's four beats of a
measurement<00:05:37.540> play<00:05:37.870> one<00:05:38.050> measure<00:05:38.290> of<00:05:38.410> G<00:05:38.740> and

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
measurement play one measure of G and

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.760 
measurement play one measure of G and
then<00:05:39.880> I'm<00:05:39.970> going<00:05:40.090> to<00:05:40.180> play<00:05:40.360> the<00:05:40.540> C<00:05:40.780> chord<00:05:41.050> four

then I'm going to play the C chord four

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:42.580 
then I'm going to play the C chord four
times

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
times

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.260 
times
and<00:05:43.070> I'm<00:05:43.160> going<00:05:43.310> to<00:05:43.370> play<00:05:43.490> the<00:05:43.580> D<00:05:43.730> chord<00:05:43.970> four

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
and I'm going to play the D chord four

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.840

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
times and I'm going to go back to G okay

00:05:46.850 --> 00:06:11.590 
times and I'm going to go back to G okay
and<00:05:47.950> that<00:05:48.950> would<00:05:49.130> sound<00:05:49.310> like<00:05:49.430> this<00:06:10.090> okay<00:06:11.090> now

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.900 
and that would sound like this okay now
this<00:06:11.720> is<00:06:11.870> really<00:06:11.990> important<00:06:12.530> you<00:06:13.520> want<00:06:13.700> to<00:06:13.820> get

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:13.910 
this is really important you want to get

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.490 
this is really important you want to get
that<00:06:13.970> down<00:06:14.360> to<00:06:14.630> where<00:06:14.870> you<00:06:14.960> can<00:06:15.110> play<00:06:15.320> that

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
that down to where you can play that

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.090 
that down to where you can play that
perfectly<00:06:16.010> don't<00:06:16.760> speed<00:06:17.150> up<00:06:17.740> until<00:06:18.740> you<00:06:18.890> get

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.100 
perfectly don't speed up until you get

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.520 
perfectly don't speed up until you get
it<00:06:19.250> to<00:06:19.520> where<00:06:19.670> there's<00:06:19.850> no<00:06:20.150> extra<00:06:20.750> time<00:06:21.200> in

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
it to where there's no extra time in

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.340 
it to where there's no extra time in
between<00:06:21.820> the<00:06:22.820> strums<00:06:23.240> of<00:06:23.420> the<00:06:23.480> same<00:06:23.780> chord<00:06:24.110> and

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:24.350 
between the strums of the same chord and

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:25.930 
between the strums of the same chord and
strums<00:06:24.650> of<00:06:24.770> the<00:06:24.890> different<00:06:25.190> chords<00:06:25.460> so<00:06:25.640> if

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:25.940 
strums of the different chords so if

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:36.190 
strums of the different chords so if
you're<00:06:26.450> playing<00:06:26.720> like<00:06:26.810> this<00:06:35.080> then<00:06:36.080> you're

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:36.200 
you're playing like this then you're

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.080 
you're playing like this then you're
playing<00:06:36.440> too<00:06:36.590> fast<00:06:36.620> you<00:06:37.520> need<00:06:37.670> to<00:06:37.790> slow<00:06:38.060> it

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.090 
playing too fast you need to slow it

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.120 
playing too fast you need to slow it
down<00:06:38.270> get<00:06:38.960> it<00:06:39.020> as<00:06:39.200> slow<00:06:39.470> as<00:06:39.500> possible<00:06:39.680> and

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130 
down get it as slow as possible and

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.230 
down get it as slow as possible and
don't<00:06:40.400> care<00:06:40.580> if<00:06:40.670> it's<00:06:40.790> one<00:06:40.970> beat<00:06:41.240> a<00:06:41.450> minute<00:06:43.240> you

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 
don't care if it's one beat a minute you

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.550 
don't care if it's one beat a minute you
want<00:06:44.450> to<00:06:44.540> get<00:06:44.630> it<00:06:44.780> to<00:06:44.990> where<00:06:45.200> you<00:06:45.380> can

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:45.560 
want to get it to where you can

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.490 
want to get it to where you can
transition<00:06:46.010> between<00:06:46.370> the<00:06:46.490> chords<00:06:47.500> seamlessly

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:48.500 
transition between the chords seamlessly

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.510 
transition between the chords seamlessly
it<00:06:48.620> doesn't<00:06:48.860> even<00:06:48.920> sound<00:06:49.220> like<00:06:49.280> you're

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 
it doesn't even sound like you're

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.610 
it doesn't even sound like you're
changing<00:06:49.940> chords<00:06:50.660> you<00:06:50.810> just<00:06:51.020> you<00:06:51.170> want<00:06:51.560> to

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:51.620 
changing chords you just you want to

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:52.960 
changing chords you just you want to
make<00:06:51.740> sure<00:06:51.770> that<00:06:52.100> the<00:06:52.190> timing<00:06:52.430> is<00:06:52.730> perfect

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:52.970 
make sure that the timing is perfect

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.150 
make sure that the timing is perfect
once<00:06:53.930> you<00:06:54.020> get<00:06:54.140> that<00:06:54.350> down<00:06:54.410> then<00:06:54.920> you<00:06:55.010> can

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:55.160 
once you get that down then you can

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.480 
once you get that down then you can
start<00:06:55.340> speeding<00:06:55.700> up<00:06:55.910> so<00:06:57.130> hopefully<00:06:58.130> that's

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:58.490 
start speeding up so hopefully that's

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.820 
start speeding up so hopefully that's
enough<00:06:58.610> to<00:06:58.940> get<00:06:59.090> you<00:06:59.180> started<00:06:59.210> with<00:06:59.600> the<00:07:00.110> basic

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:00.830 
enough to get you started with the basic

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.290 
enough to get you started with the basic
three<00:07:01.190> chords<00:07:01.550> that<00:07:01.640> you<00:07:01.760> need<00:07:02.000> and<00:07:02.210> the

three chords that you need and the

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:07.530 
three chords that you need and the
rhythm<00:07:03.100> playing<00:07:04.100> for<00:07:04.400> visa<00:07:04.580> a<00:07:04.910> measure<00:07:05.660> and

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:07.540 
rhythm playing for visa a measure and

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.730 
rhythm playing for visa a measure and
well<00:07:08.540> once<00:07:08.900> you<00:07:08.990> get<00:07:09.110> that<00:07:09.230> down<00:07:09.290> come<00:07:09.710> back

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:09.740 
well once you get that down come back
