00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.090
 dear friends with you again kostyan suet 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.190
 Charlie and I salute you in my first 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.379
 accelerated construction video 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.570
 I confess how the game set came out in 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.109
 hike I just tried it here 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.640
 desire to create a site for camping 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:26.430
 recognizing guys that a really 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.769
 the record was a long time ago so if you 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.579
 see a hike trail 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.020
 please don't throw 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:37.230
 visual can be and you are already tired 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.600
 I understand this one hike that we 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.120
 do it, I just happened so 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.000
 I got sick for a long time and that's why 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.690
 our hike was delayed as they say 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.879
 same actually the idea of â€‹â€‹creating a camping 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.320
 I wanted to create one 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.809
 to land for camping with two or three that 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.329
 tents on the composition I have here I 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.250
 quick success forehead literally items then 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.769
 there is a site oh that is a tent 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.780
 here and here and there found the center 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.970
 quickly that is in principle of placement 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.240
 I did not call any objects there 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.320
 here's the problem, but I liked it better 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.759
 do post 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.220
 Christmas trees are very cool to create 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.049
 forest that is so wanted to do more 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.780
 many many fir trees but that would be 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.840
 Of course, I think a lot, I still 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.900
 did not choose to load the plot because 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.759
 that 0 cassius happens here besides 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.799
 I do not really like overloaded areas 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.360
 also as a small nuance i added he 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.430
 accent to someone not to say so I added 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.520
 car so that it was specifically here 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.550
 camping site 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.160
 car by the way it's just if 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.420
 there are questions about this no 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.320
 the machines are ordinary, that is, they are ordinary 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.660
 toy increased by 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.670
 shift key and the bracket 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.650
 right or left i don't remember on 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.570
 English layout is convenient in principle 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.640
 the most important thing is that all the same yes it is 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.730
 main feature 4 can be increased 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.340
 reduce items but it finally can be straight 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.950
 very very cool as possible 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.170
 use machines using code but i 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.120
 so far at the moment when I built this 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.840
 I still didnâ€™t know where and how 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.550
 respectively 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.830
 what kind of cars to use me quite 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.290
 This machine is arranged very so straight 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.170
 marching with a body in the back where you can 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.660
 place all objects such as 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.640
 tent and so my good ones proper 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.560
 plot i built as you can 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.620
 notice a bit of course very quickly 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.350
 the rest is left over the decor but 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.200
 decor oh my god I drool straight flowed 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.990
 and that's still flowing, I love it here 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.660
 vegetation there flowers and leaves 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.970
 what is the beauty of all these plants here 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.580
 plant placement 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.770
 oh my goodness this is straight in a handful of dreams amni 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.780
 and of course, it remains the case for small 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.800
 this is the placement of small nuances 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:03.290
 such as flashlights and small ones like that 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.320
 embedment site yes by the way can 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.310
 notice what I looked at 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.560
 photos which while saving 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.750
 plot this is done only for the reason 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.790
 that yes all the same here these photos 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.370
 screenshots allows you to take a sober look at 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.739
 the situation that is to see what is not 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.260
 enough from what I noticed that Dag 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:24.260
 plot d fire is not enough yet 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.000
 somehow complement this bushes that people 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.340
 some beautiful plants 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.140
 flower and in the end yes that is here 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.840
 I realized that in the center let's say there 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.360
 somewhere the main part is missing 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.310
 let's say vegetation also decided 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.010
 vegetation shove under the car so 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.290
 as all the same, and I think to create such a kind 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.660
 more realistic for what they came 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.709
 and from put this car straight 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.680
 on flowers 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.989
 Well , not because such vandal 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.640
 but because nature is very 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.290
 rich in vegetation will be so 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.030
 speaks for no reason until that 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.600
 Vandals arrived and right there 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.970
 all decided to spoil the goals and of course 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.240
 The last such stroke is of course 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.390
 guitar will give songs with a guitar in the evening 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.610
 the very after a great day 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.310
 The site can be downloaded from the hashtag of the month. 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.840
 on charlie or origin one month charlie well 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.730
 what good is all this you say 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.980
 I like them and I donâ€™t like them 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.840
 really waiting for me of course puts managed 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.859
 Mindful of the mission on Charlie I have you very 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.859
 love and enjoy watching 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:45.279
 and
