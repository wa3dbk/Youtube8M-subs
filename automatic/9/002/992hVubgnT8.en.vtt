today's<00:00:00.810> how<00:00:01.020> to<00:00:01.079> build<00:00:01.350> is<00:00:01.560> on<00:00:01.650> a<00:00:01.709> horse<00:00:02.040> with

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
today's how to build is on a horse with

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:09.009 
today's how to build is on a horse with
moving<00:00:02.700> legs<00:00:03.650> move<00:00:04.650> move<00:00:04.920> move<00:00:05.190> move<00:00:05.460> move

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:09.019 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:11.839 

so<00:00:10.019> just<00:00:10.410> for<00:00:10.559> comparison<00:00:10.860> here<00:00:11.429> is<00:00:11.460> the

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
so just for comparison here is the

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.640 
so just for comparison here is the
normal<00:00:12.179> Lego<00:00:12.360> horse<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:12.990> then<00:00:13.110> here<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.500> the

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
normal Lego horse and then here is the

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
normal Lego horse and then here is the
horse<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:14.009> I'm<00:00:14.099> going<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.250> be<00:00:14.370> showing<00:00:14.549> you

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
horse that I'm going to be showing you

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.090 
horse that I'm going to be showing you
how<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:14.820> build<00:00:15.030> today<00:00:15.770> somebody<00:00:16.770> asks<00:00:16.949> for<00:00:17.039> a

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
how to build today somebody asks for a

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.120 
how to build today somebody asks for a
horse<00:00:17.279> with<00:00:17.340> moving<00:00:17.699> legs<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.890> got<00:00:19.890> some

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
horse with moving legs and got some

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.349 
horse with moving legs and got some
mobility<00:00:20.580> in<00:00:20.670> there<00:00:20.820> so<00:00:21.000> then<00:00:21.150> you<00:00:21.240> could

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
mobility in there so then you could

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.140 
mobility in there so then you could
actually<00:00:22.070> animate<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.220> horse<00:00:23.490> walking<00:00:23.760> rather

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
actually animate a horse walking rather

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.900 
actually animate a horse walking rather
than<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.630> normal<00:00:25.430> sort<00:00:26.430> of<00:00:26.490> movement<00:00:26.670> like

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
than the normal sort of movement like

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.349 
than the normal sort of movement like
that<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.359> you<00:00:27.449> have<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.599> do<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:29.240> thanks<00:00:30.240> for

asking for this because this is pretty
cool<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.130> might<00:00:32.340> have<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.520> use<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.790> in<00:00:32.880> an

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
cool and I might have to use it in an

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.510 
cool and I might have to use it in an
animation<00:00:33.329> myself<00:00:33.809> sometime<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:34.649> without

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
animation myself sometime so without

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.850 
animation myself sometime so without
further<00:00:35.760> ado<00:00:36.059> let's<00:00:36.360> get<00:00:36.840> on<00:00:37.020> with<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:38.059> so<00:00:39.059> I

further ado let's get on with it so I

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.110 
further ado let's get on with it so I
built<00:00:40.860> this<00:00:41.010> horse<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:41.399> black<00:00:41.610> because<00:00:41.879> it's

built this horse in black because it's

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.850 
built this horse in black because it's
what<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.300> had<00:00:42.540> some<00:00:42.780> pieces<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.110> handily

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
what I had some pieces in handily

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.430 
what I had some pieces in handily
available<00:00:44.280> but<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.270> can<00:00:45.690> do<00:00:45.840> whatever<00:00:46.020> color

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
available but you can do whatever color

available but you can do whatever color
force<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.890> want<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:48.090> start<00:00:48.570> with<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.750> 2<00:00:49.170> by<00:00:49.350> 3

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
force you want so start with a 2 by 3

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.860 
force you want so start with a 2 by 3
plate<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.129> that's<00:00:50.250> going<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.489> be<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.820> sort<00:00:51.809> of

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
plate and that's going to be the sort of

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.170 
plate and that's going to be the sort of
center<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.350> body<00:00:52.530> now<00:00:53.460> flip<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.850> upside

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
center of the body now flip it upside

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.060 
center of the body now flip it upside
down<00:00:54.210> I'm<00:00:54.899> going<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.140> take<00:00:55.289> 1<00:00:55.469> by<00:00:55.649> 2<00:00:55.710> with

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
down I'm going to take 1 by 2 with

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.279 
down I'm going to take 1 by 2 with
handles<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.640> it

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
handles on it

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.110 
handles on it
put<00:00:58.289> one<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.500> those<00:00:58.590> on<00:00:58.770> each<00:00:58.829> side<00:00:59.219> fill<00:01:00.000> out

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
put one of those on each side fill out

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.709 
put one of those on each side fill out
the<00:01:01.010> middle<00:01:02.010> with<00:01:02.100> 1<00:01:02.309> by<00:01:02.460> 2<00:01:02.520> plate<00:01:02.940> now<00:01:03.570> we're

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
the middle with 1 by 2 plate now we're

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:04.759 
the middle with 1 by 2 plate now we're
ready<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.019> build<00:01:04.170> some<00:01:04.379> legs

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
ready to build some legs

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.200 
ready to build some legs
so<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.369> basic<00:01:06.150> leg<00:01:06.390> I've<00:01:06.570> got<00:01:06.780> here<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.640> a<00:01:08.640> one

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
so the basic leg I've got here is a one

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.570 
so the basic leg I've got here is a one
of<00:01:09.299> these<00:01:09.420> little<00:01:09.689> cheese<00:01:09.900> slopes<00:01:10.400> they<00:01:11.400> are

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
of these little cheese slopes they are

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.230 
of these little cheese slopes they are
commonly<00:01:12.240> referred<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.750> one<00:01:13.530> by<00:01:13.680> one<00:01:13.920> with<00:01:14.159> a

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
commonly referred to one by one with a

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.149 
commonly referred to one by one with a
clippie<00:01:15.240> bit<00:01:15.650> off<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.890> side<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:18.560> a<00:01:19.560> 1<00:01:19.950> by<00:01:20.100> 2

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
clippie bit off the side and a 1 by 2

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.249 
clippie bit off the side and a 1 by 2
plate<00:01:20.990> so<00:01:21.990> way<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:22.920> did<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.400> was<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.960> said<00:01:24.960> cheese

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
plate so way I did it was I said cheese

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.020 
plate so way I did it was I said cheese
slope<00:01:25.530> goes<00:01:25.740> on<00:01:25.890> top<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.340> 1<00:01:26.460> by<00:01:26.490> 2<00:01:26.640> plate

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
slope goes on top of the 1 by 2 plate

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.630 
slope goes on top of the 1 by 2 plate
and<00:01:27.990> then<00:01:28.110> every<00:01:28.439> other<00:01:28.500> leg<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:29.159> alternated

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
and then every other leg I alternated

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.340 
and then every other leg I alternated
whether<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.210> clip<00:01:30.420> went<00:01:30.659> on<00:01:30.750> top<00:01:31.049> or<00:01:31.290> on

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
whether the clip went on top or on

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.770 
whether the clip went on top or on
bottom<00:01:31.640> so<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.909> legs<00:01:33.119> would<00:01:33.329> be<00:01:33.360> in

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
bottom so that the legs would be in

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.140 
bottom so that the legs would be in
slightly<00:01:34.020> different<00:01:34.200> positions<00:01:34.860> like<00:01:35.400> the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
slightly different positions like the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.679 
slightly different positions like the
legs<00:01:36.390> on<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.689> official<00:01:37.590> Lego<00:01:37.740> horse<00:01:38.070> so<00:01:39.060> here

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
legs on the official Lego horse so here

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.069 
legs on the official Lego horse so here
you<00:01:39.840> can<00:01:39.990> see<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.799> one<00:01:41.490> leg<00:01:42.119> with<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.659> clip<00:01:42.899> in

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
you can see a one leg with the clip in

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.410 
you can see a one leg with the clip in
the<00:01:43.170> front<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.619> clip<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.460> back<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.909> so

make<00:01:45.960> two<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.350> each<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.500> those<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.130> then<00:01:48.060> on

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
make two of each of those and then on

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.149 
make two of each of those and then on
the<00:01:49.079> front<00:01:49.670> do<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:51.119> one<00:01:51.329> with<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:52.110> if<00:01:53.070> you

- the one with the clip on the back on
that<00:01:57.719> side

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
that side

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.030 
that side
clip<00:01:59.270> in<00:01:59.390> the<00:01:59.450> front<00:01:59.690> on<00:01:59.840> this<00:01:59.990> side<00:02:00.230> so<00:02:00.920> this

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
clip in the front on this side so this

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.190 
clip in the front on this side so this
leg<00:02:01.340> is<00:02:01.640> slightly<00:02:01.910> behind<00:02:02.180> that<00:02:02.450> leg<00:02:02.660> and<00:02:02.900> then

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.980 

do<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.320> opposite<00:02:06.740> back<00:02:06.950> here<00:02:07.570> to<00:02:08.570> that<00:02:08.720> leg

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
do the opposite back here to that leg

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.560 
do the opposite back here to that leg
little<00:02:09.979> forward<00:02:10.490> and<00:02:10.729> that<00:02:11.000> leg<00:02:11.210> is<00:02:11.360> little

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
little forward and that leg is little

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.200 
little forward and that leg is little
back<00:02:11.780> and<00:02:12.110> then<00:02:12.950> you<00:02:13.340> know<00:02:13.460> you'll<00:02:13.790> see<00:02:13.880> that

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
back and then you know you'll see that

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.830 
back and then you know you'll see that
it<00:02:14.330> looks

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
it looks

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.000 
it looks
the<00:02:15.050> legs<00:02:15.290> are<00:02:15.440> sort<00:02:15.620> of<00:02:15.680> in<00:02:15.770> the<00:02:15.830> same

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
the legs are sort of in the same

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.610 
the legs are sort of in the same
position<00:02:16.430> as<00:02:16.580> that<00:02:16.880> one<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.440> it<00:02:18.440> does<00:02:18.590> a

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
position as that one and it does a

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.320 
position as that one and it does a
pretty<00:02:18.770> good<00:02:18.890> job<00:02:19.010> of<00:02:19.190> standing<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.120> legs

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
pretty good job of standing and the legs

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.790 
pretty good job of standing and the legs
have<00:02:21.760> some<00:02:22.760> room<00:02:23.150> for<00:02:23.360> movement<00:02:23.510> not<00:02:24.500> a<00:02:24.530> whole

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
have some room for movement not a whole

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.010 
have some room for movement not a whole
lot<00:02:25.010> but<00:02:25.220> definitely<00:02:25.880> more<00:02:26.060> than<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.720> normal

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
lot but definitely more than the normal

lot but definitely more than the normal
horse<00:02:27.200> does<00:02:27.440> so<00:02:28.480> that's<00:02:29.480> an<00:02:29.660> improvement<00:02:30.940> so

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
horse does so that's an improvement so

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.910 
horse does so that's an improvement so

so looking good so this is 2 2 by 2
plates<00:03:13.760> stacked<00:03:14.299> together<00:03:15.820> then<00:03:16.820> on<00:03:16.940> top<00:03:17.120> of

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
plates stacked together then on top of

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:18.340 
plates stacked together then on top of
that<00:03:17.390> we're<00:03:17.540> going<00:03:17.660> to<00:03:17.720> use<00:03:17.840> some<00:03:18.019> jumper

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
that we're going to use some jumper

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:24.699 
that we're going to use some jumper
plates<00:03:18.880> because<00:03:19.880> they're<00:03:20.090> great<00:03:23.350> so<00:03:24.350> two<00:03:24.410> of

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
plates because they're great so two of

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.970 
plates because they're great so two of
those<00:03:25.000> then<00:03:26.000> you<00:03:26.120> have<00:03:26.299> a<00:03:26.530> decision<00:03:27.530> here<00:03:27.799> I'm

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
those then you have a decision here I'm

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.740 
those then you have a decision here I'm
going<00:03:28.220> to<00:03:28.280> use<00:03:28.459> another<00:03:28.760> jumper<00:03:29.180> plate<00:03:29.420> but

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
going to use another jumper plate but

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.720 
going to use another jumper plate but
you<00:03:29.810> could<00:03:30.260> instead<00:03:30.739> just<00:03:30.799> use<00:03:31.250> a<00:03:31.280> 1<00:03:31.549> by<00:03:31.579> 2

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
you could instead just use a 1 by 2

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.410 
you could instead just use a 1 by 2
plate<00:03:31.910> depending<00:03:32.360> on<00:03:32.660> how<00:03:33.500> you<00:03:33.560> want<00:03:33.920> the<00:03:34.420> head

plate depending on how you want the head

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.440 
plate depending on how you want the head
to<00:03:35.450> be<00:03:35.690> offset<00:03:35.900> from<00:03:36.140> the<00:03:36.320> rest<00:03:36.530> of<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:36.709> body

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
to be offset from the rest of the body

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:43.270 
to be offset from the rest of the body
then<00:03:38.450> for<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.810> head<00:03:39.910> let's<00:03:41.829> take<00:03:42.829> this<00:03:42.950> apart

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
then for the head let's take this apart

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.310 
then for the head let's take this apart
real<00:03:43.459> quick<00:03:43.670> alright<00:03:44.180> so<00:03:44.570> start<00:03:44.810> with<00:03:44.930> a<00:03:44.989> 1<00:03:45.200> by

great piece 1 by 1 brick with stud on 2
sides<00:04:12.790> do<00:04:13.790> a<00:04:14.120> one<00:04:14.930> by<00:04:15.110> one<00:04:15.519> with<00:04:16.519> Clippy<00:04:16.910> on<00:04:17.030> top

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
sides do a one by one with Clippy on top

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.990 
sides do a one by one with Clippy on top
for<00:04:17.660> the<00:04:17.750> ears<00:04:17.989> on<00:04:18.470> top<00:04:18.739> of<00:04:18.859> that<00:04:18.979> and<00:04:19.250> then

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
for the ears on top of that and then

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.510 
for the ears on top of that and then
another<00:04:20.359> cheese<00:04:21.139> slope<00:04:21.380> with<00:04:21.590> 1<00:04:21.889> by<00:04:22.040> 1<00:04:22.220> plate

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
another cheese slope with 1 by 1 plate

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.250 
another cheese slope with 1 by 1 plate
so<00:04:23.510> then<00:04:23.690> take<00:04:23.870> this<00:04:24.050> bit<00:04:24.320> and<00:04:24.669> the<00:04:25.669> head

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
so then take this bit and the head

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.550 
so then take this bit and the head
attach<00:04:27.260> it<00:04:27.440> on<00:04:27.560> front<00:04:28.449> this<00:04:29.449> all<00:04:29.690> goes<00:04:29.930> on<00:04:30.110> here

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
attach it on front this all goes on here

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.740 
attach it on front this all goes on here
and<00:04:31.180> now<00:04:33.970> see<00:04:34.970> what<00:04:35.090> I'm<00:04:35.180> talking<00:04:35.479> about<00:04:35.510> with

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
and now see what I'm talking about with

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.750 
and now see what I'm talking about with
the<00:04:35.960> jumper<00:04:36.410> plate<00:04:36.620> versus<00:04:36.979> the<00:04:37.070> 1<00:04:37.190> by<00:04:37.310> 2<00:04:37.370> so

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
the jumper plate versus the 1 by 2 so

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.909 
the jumper plate versus the 1 by 2 so
this<00:04:37.850> is<00:04:38.000> using<00:04:38.180> the<00:04:38.330> jumper<00:04:38.660> plate<00:04:38.870> reason<00:04:39.830> I

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
this is using the jumper plate reason I

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.460 
this is using the jumper plate reason I
did<00:04:40.070> that<00:04:40.100> is<00:04:40.280> so<00:04:40.550> that<00:04:40.880> the<00:04:41.210> saddle<00:04:41.990> fits<00:04:42.260> on

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
did that is so that the saddle fits on

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.279 
did that is so that the saddle fits on
the<00:04:42.889> horse<00:04:43.389> because<00:04:44.389> it<00:04:44.539> wouldn't<00:04:44.780> fit<00:04:44.930> on<00:04:45.080> if

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
the horse because it wouldn't fit on if

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:49.379 
the horse because it wouldn't fit on if
you<00:04:45.410> use<00:04:45.620> the<00:04:45.800> 1<00:04:45.979> by<00:04:46.100> 2<00:04:46.130> plate<00:04:47.650> but<00:04:48.650> I<00:04:48.949> think

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
you use the 1 by 2 plate but I think

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:53.050 
you use the 1 by 2 plate but I think
when<00:04:50.389> you<00:04:50.510> don't<00:04:50.780> have<00:04:50.900> a<00:04:50.960> saddle<00:04:51.260> on<00:04:51.580> and<00:04:52.580> of

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
when you don't have a saddle on and of

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.610 
when you don't have a saddle on and of
course<00:04:53.300> you<00:04:53.810> know<00:04:53.900> you<00:04:53.960> could<00:04:54.199> always<00:04:54.320> fill

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
course you know you could always fill

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.219 
course you know you could always fill
this<00:04:54.770> in<00:04:54.949> with<00:04:54.979> a<00:04:55.160> 1<00:04:55.280> by<00:04:55.729> 2<00:04:55.789> brick<00:04:56.389> without<00:04:56.660> 1<00:04:57.110> by

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
this in with a 1 by 2 brick without 1 by

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:59.260 
this in with a 1 by 2 brick without 1 by
2<00:04:57.289> tile<00:04:57.680> like<00:04:57.949> they<00:04:58.130> do<00:04:58.190> in<00:04:58.490> the<00:04:58.850> real<00:04:59.000> Lego

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
2 tile like they do in the real Lego

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.040 
2 tile like they do in the real Lego
horses<00:05:00.789> let's<00:05:01.789> do<00:05:02.030> the<00:05:02.120> 1<00:05:02.270> by<00:05:02.419> 2<00:05:02.449> plate<00:05:02.810> I<00:05:02.960> think

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
horses let's do the 1 by 2 plate I think

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.570 
horses let's do the 1 by 2 plate I think
the<00:05:03.440> horse<00:05:05.560> looks<00:05:06.560> a<00:05:06.680> little<00:05:06.770> more<00:05:07.520> natural

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
the horse looks a little more natural

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.200 
the horse looks a little more natural
without<00:05:08.510> the<00:05:08.780> jumper<00:05:09.080> plate<00:05:09.370> but<00:05:10.370> you<00:05:11.030> just

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
without the jumper plate but you just

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.409 
without the jumper plate but you just
can't<00:05:11.450> do<00:05:11.570> the<00:05:11.690> saddle<00:05:12.080> this<00:05:12.770> way<00:05:13.270> looks<00:05:14.270> like

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
can't do the saddle this way looks like

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.900 
can't do the saddle this way looks like
it's<00:05:14.599> sticking<00:05:15.080> its<00:05:15.349> head<00:05:15.590> neck<00:05:16.430> forward<00:05:16.729> a

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
it's sticking its head neck forward a

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:22.140 
it's sticking its head neck forward a
lot<00:05:17.120> this<00:05:18.050> way<00:05:18.289> but<00:05:18.970> minor<00:05:19.970> difference<00:05:20.419> but<00:05:21.169> uh

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
lot this way but minor difference but uh

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:45.700 
lot this way but minor difference but uh
saddle<00:05:23.150> up<00:05:23.300> and<00:05:23.570> ride<00:05:24.490> off<00:05:25.490> into<00:05:25.729> the<00:05:25.820> sunset

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.770
