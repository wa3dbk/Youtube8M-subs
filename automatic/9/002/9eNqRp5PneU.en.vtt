00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
was holistic thinking and to understand

was holistic thinking and to understand
that<00:02:56.430> nothing<00:02:56.880> is<00:02:57.150> independent<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:57.810> it's<00:02:57.990> all

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
connected so we took a lot of theory and

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.860 
connected so we took a lot of theory and
applied<00:03:01.140> it<00:03:01.380> in<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:01.800> very<00:03:02.010> pragmatic<00:03:02.460> way<00:03:03.120> which

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
applied it in a very pragmatic way which
