 ridden by Marco Kutscher is the heard Hans Günter Winkler and the 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.400
 Yesterday, both made a real team effort and 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.650
 have won 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.789
 a year for the first two of the way 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.789
 and already mastered a very difficult task yesterday 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.970

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.560
 while exchanged elsewhere in the year 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.070
 Indeed 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.070
 Owner Hans Günter Winkler 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.850
 Continue Marco Kutscher 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.200

 can win here 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.390
 and I am sure 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.390
 that the Minoan Spanair Sa lives
