history<00:01:12.009> of<00:01:12.310> our<00:01:12.670> profession<00:01:12.880> is<00:01:13.479> this

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
history of our profession is this

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.039 
history of our profession is this
apprenticeship<00:01:15.189> but<00:01:15.609> just<00:01:15.789> because<00:01:15.939> it's<00:01:16.689> an

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
apprenticeship but just because it's an

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:18.749 
apprenticeship but just because it's an
apprenticeship<00:01:17.859> and<00:01:18.130> the<00:01:18.219> time<00:01:18.429> where<00:01:18.609> you're

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
apprenticeship and the time where you're

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:19.770 
apprenticeship and the time where you're
still<00:01:18.969> learning<00:01:19.270> doesn't<00:01:19.450> mean<00:01:19.659> you

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
still learning doesn't mean you

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.160 
still learning doesn't mean you
shouldn't<00:01:20.049> get<00:01:20.200> paid

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
shouldn't get paid

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.740 
shouldn't get paid
I<00:01:21.259> think<00:01:22.100> that<00:01:22.310> being<00:01:22.790> compensated<00:01:23.180> for<00:01:23.600> your

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
I think that being compensated for your

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.899 
I think that being compensated for your
work<00:01:23.930> is<00:01:24.280> important<00:01:25.280> for<00:01:25.610> your<00:01:25.729> future

experience<00:01:29.899> that<00:01:30.140> you<00:01:30.290> need<00:01:30.320> but<00:01:30.860> it<00:01:31.189> gives

experience that you need but it gives

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:32.950 
experience that you need but it gives
you<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:31.670> confidence<00:01:31.820> that<00:01:32.330> you<00:01:32.450> need<00:01:32.600> to<00:01:32.780> keep

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.410 

it's<00:01:36.380> important<00:01:37.130> for<00:01:37.190> the<00:01:37.369> entire<00:01:37.729> profession

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
it's important for the entire profession

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.469 
it's important for the entire profession
that<00:01:38.780> people<00:01:39.110> get<00:01:39.409> paid<00:01:39.710> for<00:01:40.610> their<00:01:40.789> work<00:01:40.820> when

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
right to be paid the reason for that is

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.969 
right to be paid the reason for that is
it<00:02:04.520> actually<00:02:04.909> gives<00:02:05.299> the<00:02:05.630> employers<00:02:06.140> an

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
it actually gives the employers an

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.880 
it actually gives the employers an
unfair<00:02:07.369> advantage<00:02:08.319> there<00:02:09.319> are<00:02:09.380> large<00:02:09.560> firms

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
unfair advantage there are large firms

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.860 
unfair advantage there are large firms
small<00:02:10.039> firms<00:02:10.459> firms<00:02:10.759> all<00:02:11.209> around<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.510> country

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
small firms firms all around the country

who<00:02:11.989> do<00:02:12.170> pay<00:02:12.350> interns

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.030 

I<00:02:14.920> think<00:02:15.730> that<00:02:15.910> if<00:02:16.030> someone<00:02:16.360> is<00:02:16.480> in<00:02:16.690> a

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
I think that if someone is in a

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.380 
I think that if someone is in a
situation<00:02:18.040> where<00:02:18.190> they're<00:02:18.370> needing<00:02:18.700> to<00:02:18.880> argue

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
situation where they're needing to argue

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.330 
situation where they're needing to argue
about<00:02:19.720> whether<00:02:20.170> or<00:02:20.350> not<00:02:20.470> they<00:02:20.770> should<00:02:20.800> be<00:02:21.010> paid

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
about whether or not they should be paid

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.190 
about whether or not they should be paid
my<00:02:21.820> advice<00:02:22.120> would<00:02:22.240> be<00:02:22.300> to<00:02:22.390> walk<00:02:22.660> away<00:02:22.810> from<00:02:23.080> the

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
my advice would be to walk away from the

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.070 
my advice would be to walk away from the
situation<00:02:26.580> if<00:02:27.580> one<00:02:28.030> is<00:02:28.180> found<00:02:28.450> in<00:02:28.720> a<00:02:28.810> position

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
situation if one is found in a position

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.080 
situation if one is found in a position
where<00:02:29.470> they<00:02:30.160> have<00:02:30.340> to<00:02:30.370> make<00:02:30.460> a<00:02:30.640> distinction

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
where they have to make a distinction

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.640 
where they have to make a distinction
between<00:02:31.270> I'm<00:02:31.870> either<00:02:32.020> going<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.320> take<00:02:32.380> this

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
between I'm either going to take this

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.650 
between I'm either going to take this
job<00:02:32.950> that<00:02:33.520> doesn't<00:02:33.730> pay<00:02:33.880> or<00:02:34.360> I'm<00:02:34.510> going<00:02:34.630> to

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
job that doesn't pay or I'm going to

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.350 
job that doesn't pay or I'm going to
take<00:02:34.840> this<00:02:34.960> job<00:02:35.170> that<00:02:35.380> does<00:02:35.530> I<00:02:36.340> think<00:02:36.970> it's

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
take this job that does I think it's

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.630 
take this job that does I think it's
it's<00:02:37.660> a<00:02:38.020> pretty<00:02:38.440> clear<00:02:38.770> distinction<00:02:39.130> to<00:02:39.400> mean

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
it's a pretty clear distinction to mean

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.400 
it's a pretty clear distinction to mean
that<00:02:40.240> you're<00:02:40.630> going<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:40.810> take<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.170> job<00:02:41.380> that

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
that you're going to take the job that

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.170 
that you're going to take the job that
pace

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.580 

well<00:02:46.180> I<00:02:46.209> think<00:02:46.329> somebody<00:02:47.109> who's<00:02:47.230> offered<00:02:47.530> an

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
well I think somebody who's offered an

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.209 
well I think somebody who's offered an
unpaid<00:02:47.950> internship<00:02:49.230> needs<00:02:50.230> to<00:02:50.500> step<00:02:50.709> back<00:02:50.950> and

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:51.219 
unpaid internship needs to step back and

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:53.339 
unpaid internship needs to step back and
really<00:02:51.849> think<00:02:52.239> about<00:02:52.329> their<00:02:52.629> long-term<00:02:52.840> goals

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
really think about their long-term goals

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.699 
really think about their long-term goals
I<00:02:54.090> only<00:02:55.090> think<00:02:55.269> what's<00:02:55.540> key<00:02:55.810> for<00:02:56.019> them<00:02:56.170> is<00:02:56.500> to

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
I only think what's key for them is to

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.459 
I only think what's key for them is to
healthy<00:02:57.010> eating<00:02:57.040> themselves<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.849> really

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:58.469 
healthy eating themselves and really

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:00.750 
healthy eating themselves and really
understand<00:02:59.469> what<00:02:59.560> they<00:02:59.920> always<00:03:00.459> and

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
understand what they always and

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.520 
understand what they always and
sometimes<00:03:01.389> it's<00:03:01.750> all<00:03:01.840> about<00:03:01.870> just<00:03:02.290> speaking

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
sometimes it's all about just speaking

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.449 
sometimes it's all about just speaking
up<00:03:02.739> for<00:03:02.769> yourself<00:03:03.250> I<00:03:04.319> would<00:03:05.319> say<00:03:05.500> don't<00:03:06.219> ever

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
up for yourself I would say don't ever

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.849 
up for yourself I would say don't ever
settle<00:03:07.000> for<00:03:07.209> anything<00:03:07.480> less<00:03:07.870> than<00:03:07.900> what<00:03:08.500> you

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
settle for anything less than what you

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.870 
settle for anything less than what you
expect<00:03:09.639> and<00:03:09.909> what<00:03:10.510> you<00:03:10.629> want
