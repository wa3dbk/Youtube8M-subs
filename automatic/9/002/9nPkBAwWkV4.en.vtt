build<00:00:53.370> but<00:00:54.000> unfortunately<00:00:54.989> I've<00:00:55.110> run<00:00:55.289> out<00:00:55.410> of

attachment<00:00:56.610> unlock<00:00:56.879> tokens<00:00:57.469> so<00:00:58.469> I<00:00:58.530> had<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.859> go

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
attachment unlock tokens so I had to go

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.459 
attachment unlock tokens so I had to go
with<00:00:59.340> my<00:00:59.550> next<00:01:00.239> favorite<00:01:00.600> weapon<00:01:00.989> which<00:01:01.440> is

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.859 
scar but I think in terms of popularity
it's<00:01:08.640> definitely<00:01:09.000> up<00:01:09.090> there<00:01:09.119> at<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.479> top<00:01:09.659> of

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
it's definitely up there at the top of

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.980 
it's definitely up there at the top of
the<00:01:10.049> chart<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:11.549> main<00:01:11.729> advantage<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.479> m27

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
the chart the main advantage of the m27

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.960 
the chart the main advantage of the m27
is<00:01:13.260> despite<00:01:13.590> having<00:01:13.740> quite<00:01:14.159> low<00:01:14.430> power<00:01:14.760> in

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970
