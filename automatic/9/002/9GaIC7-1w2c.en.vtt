the<00:00:36.570> brakes<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:37.260> means<00:00:37.470> you<00:00:37.590> could<00:00:37.740> drop<00:00:37.920> the

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
the brakes that means you could drop the

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.800 
the brakes that means you could drop the
wheel<00:00:38.220> out<00:00:38.400> without<00:00:38.910> having<00:00:39.240> to<00:00:39.480> lose<00:00:39.600> any

wheel out without having to lose any

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.150 
wheel out without having to lose any
pressure<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.350> let<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.530> air<00:00:40.650> at<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.070> air

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
pressure and let the air at that the air

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.520 
pressure and let the air at that the air
at<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.340> tires<00:00:41.780> and<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:43.110> just<00:00:43.230> makes<00:00:43.410> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
at the tires and that just makes the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.260 
at the tires and that just makes the
thing<00:00:43.680> work<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.980> whole<00:00:44.130> lot<00:00:44.250> easier<00:00:44.280> second

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270

in<00:00:49.380> the<00:00:49.470> lowest<00:00:49.860> gear<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.310> you<00:00:50.340> put<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.580> in<00:00:50.640> gear

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
in the lowest gear so you put it in gear

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.210 
in the lowest gear so you put it in gear
number<00:00:51.120> one<00:00:51.320> when<00:00:52.320> it's<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.590> gear<00:00:52.800> number<00:00:52.950> one

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
number one when it's in gear number one

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.410 
number one when it's in gear number one
you'll<00:00:53.430> come<00:00:53.610> around<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.000> back<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.180> the

the next thing to do is to insure the
bike<00:02:06.280> is<00:02:07.280> in<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.490> bottom<00:02:07.880> gear<00:02:08.119> so<00:02:08.479> put<00:02:08.660> the

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
bike is in the bottom gear so put the

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.870 
bike is in the bottom gear so put the
bike<00:02:08.869> into<00:02:09.229> gear<00:02:09.410> number<00:02:09.679> one<00:02:09.890> and<00:02:10.099> then

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
bike into gear number one and then

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.990 
bike into gear number one and then
you're<00:02:11.000> ready<00:02:11.180> to<00:02:11.569> release<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:11.989> gear<00:02:12.140> cable

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
you're ready to release the gear cable

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.580 
you're ready to release the gear cable
so<00:02:14.000> down<00:02:14.180> here<00:02:14.510> you'll<00:02:14.959> find<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.380> gear

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
so down here you'll find the gear

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.320 
so down here you'll find the gear
selector<00:02:16.220> which<00:02:16.400> is<00:02:16.489> a<00:02:16.519> little<00:02:16.730> plastic<00:02:17.120> ring

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
selector which is a little plastic ring

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.590

you<00:02:18.319> turn<00:02:18.560> this<00:02:18.769> anti-clockwise<00:02:20.890> like<00:02:21.890> so<00:02:22.600> see

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
you turn this anti-clockwise like so see

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.140 
you turn this anti-clockwise like so see
the<00:02:23.720> cable<00:02:23.989> goes<00:02:24.110> slack<00:02:24.819> remove<00:02:25.819> it<00:02:25.940> from<00:02:26.030> its

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
the cable goes slack remove it from its

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.009 
the cable goes slack remove it from its
holder<00:02:26.390> and<00:02:26.720> let<00:02:27.440> it<00:02:27.560> go<00:02:28.150> then<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.569> cable<00:02:29.780> is

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
holder and let it go then the cable is

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.680

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
should have a little mark on the frame

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:03.800 
should have a little mark on the frame
that<00:04:03.030> will<00:04:03.150> show<00:04:03.330> you<00:04:03.420> where<00:04:03.630> they<00:04:03.750> were

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
that will show you where they were
