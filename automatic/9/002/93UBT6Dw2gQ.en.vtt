00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.330 
went we went down to the next division
and<00:01:36.210> we<00:01:36.869> were<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.259> really<00:01:37.440> good<00:01:37.560> position<00:01:37.890> to

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
and we were in a really good position to

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.200 
and we were in a really good position to
win<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.700> game

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
win that game

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.109 
win that game
unfortunately<00:01:40.080> we<00:01:40.229> ended<00:01:40.500> up<00:01:40.619> losing<00:01:40.909> but<00:01:41.909> I

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
unfortunately we ended up losing but I

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.960 
unfortunately we ended up losing but I
mean<00:01:42.479> it's<00:01:42.630> part<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.080> game<00:01:43.259> but<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.340> think

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970
