who cannot tolerate high amounts of
carbohydrates<00:00:24.340> now<00:00:25.340> this<00:00:25.550> is<00:00:25.700> known<00:00:25.970> as

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
carbohydrates now this is known as

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.220 
carbohydrates now this is known as
carbohydrate<00:00:27.670> sensitivity<00:00:29.230> such

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
carbohydrate sensitivity such

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.010 
carbohydrate sensitivity such
individuals<00:00:31.130> have<00:00:31.670> problems<00:00:32.330> losing<00:00:32.780> weight

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
individuals have problems losing weight

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.260 
individuals have problems losing weight
and<00:00:33.290> they<00:00:33.410> also<00:00:33.590> have<00:00:34.070> low<00:00:34.280> energy<00:00:34.850> levels

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
and they also have low energy levels

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.210 
and they also have low energy levels
another<00:00:36.230> thing<00:00:36.500> that's<00:00:36.620> important<00:00:37.160> to

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
another thing that's important to

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.790 
another thing that's important to
consider<00:00:37.670> is<00:00:37.879> that<00:00:38.800> carbohydrate

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
consider is that carbohydrate

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.010 
consider is that carbohydrate
sensitivity<00:00:40.460> can<00:00:40.580> actually<00:00:40.940> increase<00:00:41.449> with

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
sensitivity can actually increase with

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:48.500 
sensitivity can actually increase with
advanced<00:00:42.590> age

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.049 

so<00:00:49.170> when<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.440> consider<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:50.460> average

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
so when you consider the average

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.660 
so when you consider the average
American<00:00:51.630> diet<00:00:51.899> what's<00:00:52.559> frightening<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.579> that

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
American diet what's frightening is that

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.030 
American diet what's frightening is that
the<00:00:54.360> average<00:00:54.930> person<00:00:55.680> consumes<00:00:57.410> 160<00:00:58.410> pounds

the average person consumes 160 pounds

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.420 
the average person consumes 160 pounds
of<00:00:59.220> sugar<00:00:59.610> a<00:00:59.970> year<00:01:00.140> now<00:01:01.140> what<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:01.590> can<00:01:01.890> do<00:01:02.129> is

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
of sugar a year now what this can do is

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.509 
of sugar a year now what this can do is
predispose<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.720> person<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.890> not<00:01:05.339> only

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.940 
predispose a person to not only
carbohydrate<00:01:06.300> sensitivity<00:01:06.960> but<00:01:07.410> can<00:01:07.619> also

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
carbohydrate sensitivity but can also

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.859

or carbohydrate cravings so a lot of

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.570 
or carbohydrate cravings so a lot of
people<00:02:12.110> will<00:02:12.260> start<00:02:12.650> with<00:02:12.830> what's<00:02:13.160> considered

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
people will start with what's considered

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.300 
people will start with what's considered
a<00:02:13.820> normal<00:02:14.450> level<00:02:14.990> of<00:02:15.290> carbohydrates<00:02:16.130> which

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
a normal level of carbohydrates which

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.870 
a normal level of carbohydrates which
would<00:02:16.490> be<00:02:16.610> about<00:02:16.730> 140<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.660> 200<00:02:18.020> grams<00:02:18.680> and<00:02:19.220> then

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
would be about 140 to 200 grams and then

for individuals who are extremely
sensitive<00:02:31.160> to<00:02:31.280> carbohydrates<00:02:32.150> it<00:02:32.330> is

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
sensitive to carbohydrates it is

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.530 
sensitive to carbohydrates it is
advisable<00:02:33.050> to<00:02:33.350> start<00:02:33.560> with<00:02:33.860> an<00:02:33.980> even<00:02:34.220> lower

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
advisable to start with an even lower

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.690 
advisable to start with an even lower

grams of carbohydrates per day and then

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.340 
grams of carbohydrates per day and then
you<00:02:39.860> can<00:02:40.070> just<00:02:40.310> increase<00:02:40.940> gradually<00:02:41.750> until

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
you can just increase gradually until

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.770 
you can just increase gradually until
