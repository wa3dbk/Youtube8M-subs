00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 when I was preparing for this webinar to me 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.670
 really wanted you to see that 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.089
 use of accessories is real 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.670
 a game 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.940
 and very interesting and fascinating and 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.889
 but of course like every game she has 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.590
 certain rules about which we 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.050
 let's talk further for now let's see 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.539
 as usual basic things such as 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.750
 culottes pullover blouse 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.269
 jeans can be complemented by bright and 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.859
 interesting accessories and bring your 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.219
 image of individuality and uniqueness 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.520
 and so on the first photo on 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:40.320
 effective booted we see gray 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:43.290
 pants batch file to about color 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.629
 until dark shades a little bit lighter 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.070
 darker 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:50.690
 on the left as in your opinion in my image 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.920
 still quite ascetic boring 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.120
 inexpressively that is, we are of course very 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.559
 you can often meet 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.780
 dressed women for being here and all gray 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.530
 also not to be mistaken black 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.619
 classic 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.780
 coloring bag shoes darkly perfectly 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.110
 Agree with Irina really looks 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.360
 grim what are we doing then am I 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.820
 I go but really hope that after this 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.710
 webinar you first will be awesome 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.990
 motivation so no longer walk secondly 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.830
 appear really knew exactly how 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:27.330
 can change the situation and so we 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:30.500
 added to the ensemble colored shoes bag 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.329
 bright colors are great for gray 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.369
 so we bag took the unexpected 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.030
 bright such as in the picture 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:42.720
 lemon shade and everything immediately began to play 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:46.759
 we already have a more truthful image of creative 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:53.399
 interesting and same time trendy stylish 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:54.149
 no longer so boring agree with me as 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.509
 second image 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:01.649
 but your opinion is already yes if we 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.869
 we will see a girl in such a dress, then she is already 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:08.190
 looks and fashionable thanks to the decoration 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.380
 on the neck thanks to bright colors you can 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.570
 scarf can 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.520
 and the red bag here is good because we have 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.290
 background to take the most neutral 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.810
 maximum universal gray color 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:22.330
 Here you can use various options. 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:26.900
 only as an option offered so 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:29.270
 the next slide is another example that we 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:34.330
 here we see a simple classic white 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:37.300
 blouse complete with straight black skirt 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.130
 I think almost every one of you has 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.320
 these clothes but agree 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.840
 without accessories looks ascetic 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.230
 boring too 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:51.370
 but look as soon as it appears 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:55.070
 bright decoration and color for example 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:59.060
 red bag and after all the image becomes 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:02.660
 already more stylish and unusual but with 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.700
 this is all within the business style ie 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.150
 in general, if not very strict 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.470
 dress code 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:13.310
 it is quite possible to go so and so one more 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:17.660
 an example of dark blue jeans gray 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.850
 pullover principle not bad but agree 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.320
 without raisin 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.500
 zest appears then when you 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:27.890
 add to there way Accessories 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:31.340
 weave handkerchief shoes on us handkerchief with 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.140
 pattern the rest of the accessories are obtained 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.890
 repeats colors 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:39.770
 the handkerchief therefore also looks more than 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.860
 bright and interesting, that is, such 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:46.700
 the example is still very simple but at the same time 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:52.160
 very spectacular such a metamorphosis only 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:55.940
 from adding light that's why how 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:04:00.140
 we had at the beginning said on the slide you 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:03.200
 have seen that we only need two two 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:06.470
 ingredient accessories and skill 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.200
 choose the right accessories and 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.790
 we are able to combine our knowledge with colors 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.459
 harmonious color combinations 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.489

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.010
 and more detail let's talk about the combination 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.820
 colors 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:25.850
 further and the last example 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.570
 about how you can change your outfit and 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.580

 thanks accessories it is the same 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.220
 classic became a small example 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.890
 black dress 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.360
 we all know yes the story of how 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.360
 very little black dress 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.760
 universal and how it can be helped 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.140
 various additions to stylize for 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:47.530
 any situation you have a prime example and 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:50.840
 for day or evening for some 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.640
 parties and for a walk and only 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.530
 thanks to sexual you completely 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:58.180
 we change our image that is, it is the most 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.660
 easiest most effective same time 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.690
 inexpensive option 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.520
 way to change my image for me 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.770
 you one more good news 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.470
 we are lucky that modern sender 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.940
 coupled provides us with practically 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.250
 total freedom when combining 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.230
 women's accessories 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:18.620
 think about another ten years ago 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:20.390
 it was allowed to combine their beads 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.660
 and earrings bracelet just because 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:26.830
 set yes it was considered correct 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:30.500
 or for example shoes of the same color 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.930
 the classic rule now is all this 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.610
 out of date now we can mix 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.990
 absolutely different use 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.970
 accessories 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.910
 seemingly from one style to another 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.520
 for example, a clutch that used to be 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.830
 the subject of the evening wardrobe now we 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.550
 use quite calmly in the daytime 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.450
 and therefore 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:54.520
 use as an accessory to 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.520
 any along at any time of the day 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:01.760
 the bag itself is also not a shoe at all 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.740
 need to search and pick up a bag about 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:07.660
 selected color of one texture as it is 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:10.880
 It was before and so now the most important thing 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:13.190
 Today we will look at 8 major 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:16.100
 rules that are picked up for you which 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.480
 In my opinion the most basic if 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.580
 you will consider you never 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:23.060
 always go wrong with accessories 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:25.030
 correctly imagine your image is 8 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.550
 accessory selection rules 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:30.470
 but first I want to know from you what you are 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.160
 focus primarily on choosing 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.380
 accessories 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:36.050
 the fact is that just 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:39.080
 common mistake is that many 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.730
 when choosing jewelry is guided in 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.120
 first we like dislike 

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:46.730
 to match a trend for cost 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.710
 now about yourself about what you need first 

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.270
 turn to really think about your 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.370
 appearance is repelled by the fact that 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:55.040
 right for you about this somehow not 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:57.110
 thinks about just we will study with you 

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.700
 push away on your appearance and 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:01.850
 pick up accessories that are not easy 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:04.040
 fashionable and not just good at girlfriend 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.440
 exactly those that will decorate you and 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:09.920
 you will be good for you to be a clip 

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:12.560
 what we call we will consider the rules 

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:15.980
 matching color by shape 

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.300
 on style size will learn 

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.870
 keep a sense of proportion 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:24.050
 selection of accessories will learn how 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.430

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.370

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:31.870
 slimmer and like using accessories 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.870
 emphasize the dignity of the figure
