00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.970
 what titanium would you have to your movie 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:19.830
 it's complicated that lord of the rings 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:24.290

 x movies according to you reflect from the 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.369
 reality not at all finally after 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.110
 many young people are inspired by it but 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.600
 in my opinion this name does not reflect the 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.020
 reality finally it's really far from the 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.180
 reality 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.500
 I think late it must be a little bit more 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.060
 hard brings a certain reality to 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.280
 some boys I think so but 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.030
 not for me no because it's 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.649
 necessarily exaggerated but yes because 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.829
 we all hear things like so 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.829
