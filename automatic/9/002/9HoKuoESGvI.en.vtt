been around for that long to have worked

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.999

out<00:01:50.369> all<00:01:51.329> sorts<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.869> different<00:01:52.079> structures<00:01:52.590> so

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
out all sorts of different structures so

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.920 
out all sorts of different structures so
what<00:01:53.189> they<00:01:53.310> do<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.670> they<00:01:53.880> use<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.420> structures

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
what they do is they use the structures

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.959 
what they do is they use the structures
in<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.200> natural<00:01:55.590> environment<00:01:55.969> they
