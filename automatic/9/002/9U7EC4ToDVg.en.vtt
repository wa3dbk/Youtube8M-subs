00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
made two other ones but I made them

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.520 
made two other ones but I made them

quite a while ago and it kind of wasn't
clear<00:00:13.799> on<00:00:13.980> some<00:00:14.160> things<00:00:14.400> so<00:00:15.000> I<00:00:15.330> have<00:00:15.750> hooked<00:00:15.929> up

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
clear on some things so I have hooked up

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.099 
clear on some things so I have hooked up

here is this modded white Nintendo 64
which<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.920> have<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.820> other<00:00:20.970> parts<00:00:21.330> over<00:00:21.449> here

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
which I have the other parts over here

which I have the other parts over here
now<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.160> did<00:00:23.490> mob<00:00:23.670> this<00:00:23.850> myself<00:00:24.300> I<00:00:24.810> actually

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
now I did mob this myself I actually

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.650 
now I did mob this myself I actually
used<00:00:25.619> refrigerator<00:00:26.340> paint<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:27.390> came<00:00:27.510> out

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
used refrigerator paint and it came out

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.029 
used refrigerator paint and it came out
really<00:00:27.779> nice<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.199> hard<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.500> didn't<00:00:28.740> crack<00:00:28.890> or

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
really nice and hard it didn't crack or

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.400 
really nice and hard it didn't crack or
anything<00:00:29.300> the<00:00:30.300> only<00:00:30.539> thing<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:31.320> was

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
anything the only thing that I that was

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.430 
anything the only thing that I that was
kind<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.650> weird<00:00:31.769> about<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.279> was<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:33.440> little

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
kind of weird about this was the little

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.100 
kind of weird about this was the little
is<00:00:34.590> this<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.100> my<00:00:35.250> normal<00:00:35.489> n64<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.840> little

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
is this is my normal n64 the little

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.139 
is this is my normal n64 the little
cover<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.620> goes<00:00:37.800> over<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.489> expansion<00:00:39.030> Bay

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
cover that goes over the expansion Bay

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.479 
cover that goes over the expansion Bay
pack<00:00:39.420> actually<00:00:39.739> discolored<00:00:40.739> for<00:00:41.160> whatever

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
pack actually discolored for whatever

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.910 
pack actually discolored for whatever
reason<00:00:42.000> it's<00:00:42.719> got<00:00:43.290> yellowed

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
reason it's got yellowed

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.410 
reason it's got yellowed
but<00:00:44.040> everything<00:00:44.370> else<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.670> still<00:00:44.879> nice<00:00:45.180> white

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
but everything else is still nice white

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.590 
but everything else is still nice white
so<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.770> open<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.250> n64<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:48.120> will<00:00:48.360> need<00:00:48.570> a

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
so to open the n64 you will need a

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.690 
so to open the n64 you will need a
security<00:00:49.050> bit<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.500> actually<00:00:50.129> swapped<00:00:50.370> out<00:00:50.520> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
security bit I actually swapped out the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.240 
security bit I actually swapped out the
security<00:00:50.940> bits<00:00:51.210> for<00:00:51.390> regular<00:00:51.690> screws<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.710> I

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
security bits for regular screws so I

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.639 
security bits for regular screws so I
would<00:00:53.640> recommend<00:00:53.760> doing<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:54.379> quick<00:00:55.379> little

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
would recommend doing this quick little

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.939 
would recommend doing this quick little
easy<00:00:56.000> swap<00:00:57.109> because<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.230> can't<00:00:58.440> stand<00:00:58.620> using

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
easy swap because I can't stand using

00:00:58.949 --> 00:00:59.660 
easy swap because I can't stand using
the<00:00:59.010> security<00:00:59.309> bits

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
the security bits

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.520 
the security bits
especially<00:01:00.449> since<00:01:00.600> once<00:01:00.840> they<00:01:01.050> strip<00:01:01.350> out

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
especially since once they strip out

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.740 
especially since once they strip out
that's<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.520> you're<00:01:02.699> screwed<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.420> can't<00:01:03.660> do

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
that's it you're screwed you can't do

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.350 
that's it you're screwed you can't do
anything<00:01:03.960> more<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.739> going<00:01:05.339> back<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.729> n64<00:01:06.060> I

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
anything more so going back to the n64 I

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.510 
anything more so going back to the n64 I
have<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.840> big<00:01:07.170> mess<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.590> games<00:01:07.920> over<00:01:08.189> here<00:01:08.369> I

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
have this big mess of games over here I

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.660 
have this big mess of games over here I
got<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.479> n64<00:01:09.930> in<00:01:10.290> between<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.890> saturn<00:01:11.400> and

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
got the n64 in between the saturn and

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.850 
got the n64 in between the saturn and
dreamcast<00:01:11.750> so<00:01:12.750> what<00:01:13.170> better<00:01:13.320> place<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.650> have

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
dreamcast so what better place to have

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.420 
dreamcast so what better place to have

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
creeper so I'm turning on this n64 you

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.539 
creeper so I'm turning on this n64 you
will<00:01:22.229> notice<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.799> power<00:01:23.009> does<00:01:23.340> go<00:01:23.520> on

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
will notice that the power does go on

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.840 
will notice that the power does go on
but<00:01:24.299> my<00:01:24.509> TV<00:01:25.189> continues<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.340> say<00:01:26.549> no<00:01:26.939> signal<00:01:27.630> so

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
but my TV continues to say no signal so

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.450 
but my TV continues to say no signal so
let's<00:01:29.850> uh<00:01:30.320> dig<00:01:31.320> deeper<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:31.829> try<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.250> figure

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
let's uh dig deeper and try to figure

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.450 
let's uh dig deeper and try to figure
out<00:01:32.640> what<00:01:32.850> what<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:34.130> there<00:01:35.130> are<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.280> couple

out what what this is there are a couple

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.890 
out what what this is there are a couple
things<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.820> can<00:01:36.000> be<00:01:36.090> wrong<00:01:36.240> looking<00:01:36.630> at<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
things that can be wrong looking at the

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.380 
things that can be wrong looking at the
cartridge<00:01:37.409> port<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.670> pretty<00:01:38.970> funky

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
cartridge port it is pretty funky

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.440 
cartridge port it is pretty funky
looking<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.979> can<00:01:41.189> try<00:01:41.460> using<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:42.210> credit

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
looking so you can try using a credit

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.300 
looking so you can try using a credit
card<00:01:42.780> with<00:01:43.079> paper<00:01:43.320> wrapped<00:01:43.680> around<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:44.189> and

card with paper wrapped around it and

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.830 
card with paper wrapped around it and
going<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.640> between<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.000> cartridge<00:01:45.540> slots

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
going in between the cartridge slots

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.270 
going in between the cartridge slots
which<00:01:47.090> can<00:01:48.090> help<00:01:48.210> put<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> bit<00:01:48.720> off<00:01:49.560> topic<00:01:49.860> here

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
which can help put a bit off topic here

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.069 
which can help put a bit off topic here
is<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.549> expansion<00:01:51.149> pack<00:01:51.329> that's<00:01:51.509> discolored

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
is the expansion pack that's discolored

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.580 
is the expansion pack that's discolored
I<00:01:52.229> found<00:01:52.880> so<00:01:53.899> cleaning<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.079> cartridge<00:01:55.439> slot

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
I found so cleaning the cartridge slot

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.319 
I found so cleaning the cartridge slot
is<00:01:55.890> one<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.430> biggest<00:01:56.759> things<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.299> I

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329

on the copper green spot there green
spot<00:05:45.250> there<00:05:45.550> so<00:05:46.090> this<00:05:46.810> m6<00:05:47.169> before<00:05:47.500> is<00:05:47.740> actually

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950 
spot there so this m6 before is actually

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.400 
spot there so this m6 before is actually
it<00:05:48.430> did<00:05:48.729> boot<00:05:49.150> up<00:05:49.300> the<00:05:49.330> game<00:05:49.510> actually<00:05:50.110> let<00:05:50.350> me

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
it did boot up the game actually let me

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.920 
it did boot up the game actually let me
see<00:05:50.530> if<00:05:50.590> it'll<00:05:50.680> boot<00:05:50.860> it<00:05:50.979> up<00:05:51.039> again<00:05:51.690> let<00:05:52.690> me<00:05:52.720> try

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
see if it'll boot it up again let me try

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.710 
see if it'll boot it up again let me try
a<00:05:52.960> different<00:05:53.169> game<00:05:53.380> uh<00:05:53.560> Mario<00:05:54.490> 64<00:05:55.330> let<00:05:55.660> me

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
a different game uh Mario 64 let me

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.770 
a different game uh Mario 64 let me
actually<00:05:55.840> focus<00:05:56.260> the<00:05:56.380> camera<00:05:56.770> there<00:05:57.190> we<00:05:57.280> go

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
actually focus the camera there we go

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.090 
actually focus the camera there we go
and<00:05:58.780> let's<00:05:59.139> see<00:05:59.260> if<00:05:59.320> it'll<00:05:59.440> boot<00:05:59.620> this<00:05:59.770> one<00:05:59.979> up

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
and let's see if it'll boot this one up

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.350 
and let's see if it'll boot this one up
oh<00:06:01.800> well<00:06:02.800> you<00:06:02.889> know<00:06:03.010> it<00:06:03.280> boot<00:06:03.460> it<00:06:03.550> up<00:06:03.669> so<00:06:04.180> it<00:06:04.300> is

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 
oh well you know it boot it up so it is

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.620 
oh well you know it boot it up so it is
working<00:06:04.870> but<00:06:05.050> the<00:06:05.680> odds<00:06:05.830> of<00:06:06.010> this<00:06:06.130> n64<00:06:07.120> to

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630 
working but the odds of this n64 to

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.200 
working but the odds of this n64 to
continually<00:06:08.320> work<00:06:08.650> is<00:06:08.889> probably<00:06:09.880> not<00:06:10.060> that

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
continually work is probably not that

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.029 
continually work is probably not that
good<00:06:10.450> so<00:06:10.660> I<00:06:10.690> will<00:06:10.810> go<00:06:11.139> through<00:06:11.410> this<00:06:11.530> fully

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:12.039 
good so I will go through this fully

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:14.879 
good so I will go through this fully
clean<00:06:12.370> it<00:06:12.490> and<00:06:12.780> this<00:06:13.780> will<00:06:13.930> be<00:06:14.020> part<00:06:14.260> one<00:06:14.500> of<00:06:14.740> a

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:14.889 
clean it and this will be part one of a

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:17.190

two-part<00:06:15.100> series<00:06:15.520> I<00:06:15.820> will<00:06:15.910> go<00:06:16.180> in-depth<00:06:16.780> even

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.200 
two-part series I will go in-depth even

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.200 
two-part series I will go in-depth even
