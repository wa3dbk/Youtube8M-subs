 80 000 euros offered to the world currently serving service 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.470
 That's 90 percent of industrial robots 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.730
 and one of the biggest ones is also playing an increasingly important role 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:17.179
 Kakar 500

 Loading weight maximum 500 67 kilos

 For heavy trucks hotel career 500 represents about half of all submarines

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.140
 best series works, therefore, is the largest robot Röttgen of half

 Ton of weight move incredibly fast and place that very accurately 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.670
 can Seitz 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.670
 nobody could look for that before him 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.000
 The 6 1 wins came in 500 has severely hampered the use of robots in the winter 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.990
 raised to a new level

 lie between him and the mini humans in the first industrial robot of 1961 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.410
 worlds 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.250
 Civic leaders who came up with robots were all prophesied many 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.230
 People were afraid that they would replace them with robots QIA represented 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.659
 the view that robots can do all sorts of great things but 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.149
 the early copies still lacked the appropriate computing power as well 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.530
 they worked Federer fails then one reads the hydraulic way of the 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.960
 Drive takes place via servomotors then the first computer-aided 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.819
 Robots on and eventually the computers were capable of the machine too 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:34.479
 Taxes were needed because there was no human rights 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.429
 The robots finally got more powerful and could do the job and "Die 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:40.929
 Humanity had expected from them from the beginning the allegations were over 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:43.500
 the years are limited

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.100
 without any human support went to work 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:09.450
 he is afraid

 Coach Robert Hauser comes from the Karrer CEO of Actano as COO Kagame Karrer 500 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.120
 developed the same track of the group the Boss of the British 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.709
 Branch of it can also be attached to numbers she has always had 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.709
 dreamed of a hood coaster pari 

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:29.469
 After a two-year trial, the oversized robotic arm became in November 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:33.599
 2003 successful for the first phase four submarines of the leisure industry 

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:39.829
 There are seven programmed intensity levels and one comma 4 million 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.089
 possible movements 

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:46.609
 such a ride is certainly a very special neighborhood with a robot 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.669
 I just wanted to re-set the Keiler 500 a year after its introduction 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:03.229
 to overtake 

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:07.399
 just as in the lead, there is already a new house standing that is 

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:11.339
 Without cost risks they are counting too much second generation we have the 

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:13.629
 Squad 500 the fifth and sixth axis exactly 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:16.459
 laying a robot over the heaviest back then we have four 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.799
 Seats screwed to the end and the whole thing on the roller coaster is worse 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.799
 not in March were free 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:29.439
 the case carry off the squad 500 will develop even larger robots 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:33.149
 Percent of the workshop trains or generally instead of machines in people 

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:35.249
 get in for the purpose of getting around 

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:37.689
 Costs become the robot beings 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:40.509
 Mirko Boland observer 

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:43.009
 nevertheless the robots have our world 

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:45.079
 +++ 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.439
 but maybe they are well on their way
