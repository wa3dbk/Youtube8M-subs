00:00:01.509 --> 00:00:03.350
 Theme colors 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.380
 and that should also abruptly and left wants to see something 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.279
 well, that was you, that was form 

00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:12.279
 Copten us at first a bit because the colors built 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:14.039
 we have 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:16.150
 the so-called and eBay colors 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.640
 is missing the foil 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.500
 those of colleagues Veith unwise that Pastor i Wanna at the German red-green 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.339
 believes 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:23.630
 Dawson the woman open 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.019
 this regulation is structured 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.059
 Scrum were represented by three entries through the assumption 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:33.300
 5 There is red but the information 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.450
 VÃ­ctor Green 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.450
 and the v-power blues that blended together 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.520
 if I only act one red now 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.170
 I say red with the maximum maximum prayed means one hundred five oct themselves 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.750
 all others the zero thus comes out Mackenroth 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.560
 I have the maximum number of customers though will be 85 let the other two up 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.580
 Zero critical of a green 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.670
 the same applies of course to Plauen 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.900
 These are our primary colors 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.770
 from now on mix and say 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.770
 maximum Roth maximum 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.330
 quickly negates everything 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.310
 maximum Roth maximum green 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.070
 no clown Compton Yellow out 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.400
 Adit active is not understand 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.680
 same game here also for the woman way 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.620
 ten years ago 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.840
 maximum green maximum blue compensate out that can vary everything 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.890
 we have a wife of 0 is still 85 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.290
 if I also in the station wagon to 16 point something millions form 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.430
 what can car insurers stand with 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.820
 30 o'clock o2 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.620
 80 greens and 50 blue then a woman comes out 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.130
 So have three details 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.130
 my wife wants to insist 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.310
 so to make it a bit more complicated 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.560
 Witcher Decima 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.649
 Computer love numbers give the bee are built 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.280
 01 of course, that's my favorite number of computers 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.869
 MCE also ordered the march relatively fast in the marsh 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.539
 Eighth area in it 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.819
 Accomplice MByte 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.409
 if Mott 2 PByte are taking Rolando 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:17.959
 Simone Mende effect 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.309
 at 16 from 0 to 16 and that's how it is 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:23.289
 at 2 to 15 

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:25.069
 and that's the number 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.249
 can really handle those bills very easily 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:30.339
 That's why there was a lot of information 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:33.009
 Witches are the ten times specified 

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:35.589
 must always be comparison 

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:38.069
 Witcher is the room also 0 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.329
 PC times 1 is also witch Decima 1 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.669
 the 9 is the same but witch Decima means before I move 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:47.599
 not in increments of ten 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.499
 16 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:53.499
 Decima 10 have come here Aaraus 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.439
 at 11 BCGI Fri 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:01.459
 at 16 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.389
 GEZE put shift pointed out to me 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:06.299
 Conti 1 0 off 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.519
 the maximum number of ours though only 5 50 is then 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:13.139
 Witcher Decimals provides Effeff 

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:18.609
 it's great you do not have to expect that 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.280
 only OnNet had to percent 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.669
 Promos increases Saals Sirte or the next ten times 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:24.640
 she pays 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.820
 we know how the woman pulls out of it you have to lay in the high platter 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.819
 is about both the sorcerer and CIMA a value 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.329
 our location in it 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.739
 these numbers will not work 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.659
 Decima stated 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:41.139
 Witcher December 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:43.130
 So I have no quota here 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.260
 4 Green not so blue-eyed, although deteriorating black brick comes 

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:50.079
 CITES Witcher Decima from 0 0 0 0 0 0 

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:54.949
 the front doors the other red I recognize it is prompt 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.559
 the sorcerer decimals 

00:03:57.559 --> 00:04:00.559
 I now have a complete Roth 

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:03.410
 Roth maximum still 85 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.669
 Green 0 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:07.139
 Plauen 0 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.380
 as a witch decimal Paffrath 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.529

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:12.109
 from Active Biotech 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.109
 I always have the order Audi b Red Green Blue 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:21.229
 important to recognize as well as possible that Hannes young witch decimal numbers
