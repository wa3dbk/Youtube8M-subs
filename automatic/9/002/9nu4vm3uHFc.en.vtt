00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:27.630 

but<00:02:07.079> short<00:02:07.590> David<00:02:07.829> Lozano

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.670

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:47.280 

and<00:02:37.180> I<00:02:37.300> was<00:02:37.390> going<00:02:37.600> to<00:02:37.660> do<00:02:37.780> double<00:02:38.200> pirouette

so you know something special is

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.309 
so you know something special is
happening<00:02:51.269> this<00:02:52.269> appeal<00:02:52.689> would<00:02:52.840> actually<00:02:53.230> the

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
left was a little bit better than the

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:59.440 
left was a little bit better than the
one<00:02:54.700> to<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:54.879> right

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.170 

a<00:02:59.480> very<00:03:00.110> steep<00:03:00.530> offense

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:22.640
