I wonder what lies at the end of this
journey

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.220 

the<00:04:56.270> end<00:04:56.540> of<00:04:56.780> the<00:04:56.930> journey<00:04:57.760> hmm<00:04:58.760> well<00:04:59.450> I<00:04:59.780> really

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
the end of the journey hmm well I really

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.440 
the end of the journey hmm well I really
don't<00:05:00.260> know<00:05:00.560> but<00:05:01.130> I'm<00:05:01.580> sure<00:05:01.640> that<00:05:01.940> the<00:05:02.270> road

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
don't know but I'm sure that the road

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.070 
don't know but I'm sure that the road
does<00:05:02.690> lead<00:05:02.990> to<00:05:03.020> somewhere<00:05:04.600> salsa<00:05:05.600> I<00:05:05.780> don't

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
does lead to somewhere salsa I don't

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.870 
does lead to somewhere salsa I don't
think<00:05:06.260> that's<00:05:06.350> what<00:05:06.560> he<00:05:06.710> means<00:05:07.010> I<00:05:09.850> think<00:05:10.850> that

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
think that's what he means I think that

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.580 
think that's what he means I think that
what<00:05:11.120> Frederick<00:05:11.540> is<00:05:11.660> talking<00:05:12.170> about<00:05:12.260> is

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
what Frederick is talking about is

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:19.110 
what Frederick is talking about is
something<00:05:13.370> of<00:05:13.490> a<00:05:13.580> more<00:05:13.790> spiritual<00:05:14.450> nature<00:05:14.750> I

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.810 

believe<00:05:20.530> that<00:05:21.530> this<00:05:21.740> is<00:05:21.980> going<00:05:22.190> to<00:05:22.310> be<00:05:22.550> my

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
believe that this is going to be my

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.080 
believe that this is going to be my
final<00:05:23.390> journey<00:05:24.280> but<00:05:25.280> my<00:05:25.460> final<00:05:25.940> destination

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
final journey but my final destination

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.410 
final journey but my final destination
is<00:05:26.810> shrouded<00:05:27.080> in<00:05:27.410> darkness<00:05:28.030> no<00:05:29.030> matter<00:05:29.210> how

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:29.420 
is shrouded in darkness no matter how

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.090 
is shrouded in darkness no matter how
hard<00:05:29.750> I<00:05:29.900> look<00:05:30.140> I<00:05:30.410> cannot<00:05:31.280> see<00:05:31.580> it<00:05:31.670> at<00:05:31.790> all

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
hard I look I cannot see it at all

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.730 
hard I look I cannot see it at all
what<00:05:33.790> are<00:05:34.000> you<00:05:34.180> talking<00:05:34.750> about<00:05:34.840> the<00:05:35.530> way<00:05:35.680> you

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
what are you talking about the way you

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.890 
what are you talking about the way you
talk<00:05:36.130> you<00:05:36.430> think<00:05:36.670> you're<00:05:36.820> about<00:05:37.030> to<00:05:37.270> die<00:05:37.540> soon

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
talk you think you're about to die soon

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.380 
talk you think you're about to die soon
or<00:05:38.110> something<00:05:38.590> I<00:05:40.170> guess<00:05:41.170> I'm<00:05:41.380> the<00:05:41.410> same<00:05:41.770> way<00:05:41.800> I

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
or something I guess I'm the same way I

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.670 
or something I guess I'm the same way I
can't<00:05:43.390> see<00:05:43.570> where<00:05:43.690> I'm<00:05:43.750> headed<00:05:44.290> in<00:05:44.410> the<00:05:44.530> end

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
can't see where I'm headed in the end

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.520 
can't see where I'm headed in the end
either<00:05:44.950> I<00:05:45.750> don't<00:05:46.750> think<00:05:46.960> anyone<00:05:47.320> can<00:05:47.470> really

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
either I don't think anyone can really

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:53.760 
either I don't think anyone can really
see<00:05:48.010> that<00:05:48.160> except<00:05:48.820> maybe<00:05:49.060> God<00:05:52.500> but<00:05:53.500> the<00:05:53.620> reason

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
see that except maybe God but the reason

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.440 
see that except maybe God but the reason
I<00:05:54.010> can't<00:05:54.310> see<00:05:54.520> it<00:05:54.550> is<00:05:54.730> completely<00:05:55.150> different

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
I can't see it is completely different

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.730 
I can't see it is completely different
from<00:05:55.690> why<00:05:55.930> you<00:05:55.990> can't<00:05:56.410> see<00:05:56.680> it<00:05:58.500> the<00:05:59.500> place

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
from why you can't see it the place

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.740 
from why you can't see it the place
where<00:05:59.950> I'm<00:06:00.100> going<00:06:00.460> is<00:06:00.550> surrounded<00:06:01.210> by<00:06:01.240> light

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
where I'm going is surrounded by light

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.130 
where I'm going is surrounded by light
and<00:06:02.790> because<00:06:03.790> the<00:06:03.970> light<00:06:04.210> i'm<00:06:04.390> heading<00:06:04.750> for<00:06:04.990> is

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.140 
and because the light i'm heading for is

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.500 
and because the light i'm heading for is
so<00:06:05.380> bright<00:06:05.740> I<00:06:06.130> can't<00:06:06.670> make<00:06:06.850> out<00:06:07.000> what's<00:06:07.270> there

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:07.510 
so bright I can't make out what's there

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.840 
so bright I can't make out what's there
either<00:06:07.690> the<00:06:08.260> same<00:06:08.470> as<00:06:08.650> you<00:06:11.100> so<00:06:12.100> you<00:06:12.160> can't<00:06:12.580> see

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:12.850 
either the same as you so you can't see

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:14.340 
either the same as you so you can't see
because<00:06:13.120> it's<00:06:13.420> either<00:06:13.600> too<00:06:13.720> bright<00:06:14.140> or<00:06:14.320> too

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:14.350 
because it's either too bright or too

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.000 
because it's either too bright or too
dark<00:06:14.680> then<00:06:15.840> it's<00:06:16.840> probably<00:06:17.170> better<00:06:17.620> to<00:06:17.740> go

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
dark then it's probably better to go

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.530 
dark then it's probably better to go
with<00:06:18.040> not<00:06:18.400> being<00:06:18.640> able<00:06:18.760> to<00:06:19.060> see<00:06:19.270> you<00:06:19.390> because

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:19.540 
with not being able to see you because

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:24.150 
with not being able to see you because
it's<00:06:19.870> too<00:06:20.080> bright<00:06:20.380> I<00:06:21.750> agree<00:06:22.750> with<00:06:22.780> you<00:06:23.160> after

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 
it's too bright I agree with you after

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.920 
it's too bright I agree with you after
all<00:06:24.190> no<00:06:24.670> one<00:06:24.700> can<00:06:25.030> ever<00:06:25.180> really<00:06:25.450> know<00:06:25.660> what<00:06:25.810> the

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
all no one can ever really know what the

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.600 
all no one can ever really know what the
future<00:06:26.080> will<00:06:26.410> hold<00:06:28.800> the<00:06:29.800> only<00:06:30.100> thing<00:06:30.310> you<00:06:30.430> can

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:30.610 
future will hold the only thing you can

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.890 
future will hold the only thing you can

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:42.970 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:49.500 

the<00:06:43.970> road<00:06:44.440> does<00:06:45.440> lead<00:06:45.860> to<00:06:45.890> somewhere

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:49.510 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.570 

you
