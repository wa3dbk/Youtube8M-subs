whatever or whatever they said I'm not

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.520 
whatever or whatever they said I'm not
quoting<00:01:15.330> anyone<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:18.049> personally<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.080> think

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
quoting anyone and personally I think

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.219 
quoting anyone and personally I think
the<00:01:19.860> first<00:01:20.310> game<00:01:20.549> was<00:01:20.780> infinitely<00:01:21.780> times

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
the first game was infinitely times

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.690 
the first game was infinitely times
better<00:01:24.140> the<00:01:25.140> mechanic<00:01:25.920> just<00:01:26.070> worked<00:01:26.400> way

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
better the mechanic just worked way

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.969 
better the mechanic just worked way
better<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:27.090> mean<00:01:27.420> upgrading<00:01:28.140> graphics<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.740> fun

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
better I mean upgrading graphics is fun

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.249 
better I mean upgrading graphics is fun
and<00:01:29.159> all<00:01:29.250> but<00:01:29.509> when<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.600> change<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.020> core

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
and all but when you change the core

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.890 
and all but when you change the core
gameplay<00:01:31.490> because<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.939> don't<00:01:33.150> like<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.540> even

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
gameplay because you don't like it even

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.160 
gameplay because you don't like it even
though<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.140> fan<00:01:34.650> base<00:01:34.890> licet<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.930> that<00:01:36.930> just

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
though the fan base licet I that just

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.550 
though the fan base licet I that just
makes<00:01:37.380> me<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.650> question<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:39.090> uh<00:01:39.259> that's<00:01:40.259> pretty

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
makes me a question and uh that's pretty

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.649 
makes me a question and uh that's pretty
decent<00:01:40.829> headshot<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.970> this<00:01:42.210> part<00:01:42.479> actually

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
decent headshot this this part actually

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.679 
decent headshot this this part actually
coming<00:01:42.960> up<00:01:43.200> see<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:44.159> guess<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:44.970> missed<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.299> I

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
coming up see I guess I missed that I

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.810 
coming up see I guess I missed that I
figured<00:01:46.350> I'd<00:01:46.470> hurt<00:01:46.680> him<00:01:46.829> or<00:01:47.070> where<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.549> thought

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
figured I'd hurt him or where I thought

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.280 
figured I'd hurt him or where I thought
I<00:01:47.880> shot<00:01:48.180> him<00:01:48.270> in<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.390> head<00:01:48.570> but<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.810> guess<00:01:49.049> not

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
I shot him in the head but I guess not

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.410 
I shot him in the head but I guess not
and<00:01:49.729> then<00:01:50.729> here<00:01:51.030> we<00:01:51.060> go<00:01:51.299> one<00:01:51.840> more<00:01:52.049> time

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
and then here we go one more time

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.539 
and then here we go one more time
I<00:01:52.450> do<00:01:52.540> it<00:01:52.810> and<00:01:53.049> right<00:01:53.680> in<00:01:53.710> the<00:01:53.860> face<00:01:54.070> nothing

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
first two rounds I did pretty good but

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.300 
first two rounds I did pretty good but
the<00:03:06.280> last<00:03:06.430> round<00:03:06.730> just<00:03:06.910> ended<00:03:07.320> terribly<00:03:08.320> for

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
the last round just ended terribly for

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.979 
the last round just ended terribly for
me<00:03:09.549> getting<00:03:09.790> cornered<00:03:10.209> by<00:03:10.359> three<00:03:10.600> people

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
me getting cornered by three people

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.250 
me getting cornered by three people

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
which never ends good at this game and I

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.259 
which never ends good at this game and I
guess<00:03:14.440> it<00:03:14.560> shouldn't<00:03:14.829> because<00:03:15.220> three<00:03:16.180> on

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
guess it shouldn't because three on

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:17.400 
guess it shouldn't because three on
one's<00:03:16.450> you<00:03:16.600> know<00:03:16.720> you're<00:03:16.959> supposed<00:03:17.170> to<00:03:17.290> be<00:03:17.380> the

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
guy there's no reason one guy should he

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.670

bring<00:03:20.560> people<00:03:21.600> um<00:03:22.600> no<00:03:23.079> matter<00:03:23.260> how<00:03:23.380> good<00:03:23.560> he<00:03:23.650> is

apparently and I guess that was a one of

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.370 
apparently and I guess that was a one of
epic<00:03:26.530> epic<00:03:27.160> things<00:03:27.459> that<00:03:27.790> people<00:03:28.780> could<00:03:29.019> train

this<00:05:53.750> is<00:05:53.930> where<00:05:54.080> I'm<00:05:54.319> this<00:05:54.620> is<00:05:54.740> where<00:05:54.919> the<00:05:55.099> the

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
this is where I'm this is where the the

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.309 
this is where I'm this is where the the
awesomeness<00:05:55.819> of<00:05:55.940> Ryan's<00:05:56.240> coming<00:05:56.389> I<00:05:56.750> feel<00:05:57.229> like

awesomeness of Ryan's coming I feel like

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:00.370 
awesomeness of Ryan's coming I feel like
I'm<00:05:57.470> safe<00:05:57.680> in<00:05:57.830> that<00:05:57.949> corner<00:05:58.340> but<00:05:59.300> I<00:05:59.330> wasn't<00:05:59.990> at

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
I'm safe in that corner but I wasn't at

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.670 
I'm safe in that corner but I wasn't at
all<00:06:00.530> as<00:06:00.770> you<00:06:01.190> saw<00:06:01.669> there<00:06:01.699> I<00:06:02.180> was<00:06:03.050> chunked<00:06:03.500> in<00:06:03.590> a

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
all as you saw there I was chunked in a

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.070 
all as you saw there I was chunked in a
second<00:06:04.070> because<00:06:04.220> my<00:06:04.639> teammate<00:06:05.120> just<00:06:05.720> didn't

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
second because my teammate just didn't

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.719 
second because my teammate just didn't
feel<00:06:06.320> like<00:06:06.349> it<00:06:06.560> was<00:06:06.740> necessary<00:06:07.310> to<00:06:07.400> keep<00:06:07.580> me

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:07.729 
feel like it was necessary to keep me

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:10.600 
feel like it was necessary to keep me
alive<00:06:07.970> and<00:06:08.360> you<00:06:08.539> know<00:06:08.660> I<00:06:08.900> mean<00:06:09.380> I<00:06:09.500> guess<00:06:09.710> that's

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
alive and you know I mean I guess that's

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.860 
alive and you know I mean I guess that's
that's<00:06:11.150> a<00:06:11.660> good<00:06:12.110> idea<00:06:12.490> but<00:06:13.490> um<00:06:13.669> I<00:06:14.150> don't<00:06:14.750> know

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:21.289 
he's in a really bad position I would

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:22.899 
he's in a really bad position I would
not<00:06:21.409> want<00:06:21.620> to<00:06:21.650> be<00:06:21.770> in<00:06:21.800> this<00:06:21.979> position<00:06:22.159> even
