let's<00:00:47.700> bump<00:00:48.090> up<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.539> amount<00:00:48.930> -<00:00:49.710> quite<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.039> bit

let's bump up the amount - quite a bit

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.670 
let's bump up the amount - quite a bit
we're<00:00:50.760> going<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.059> sharpen<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.780> barn

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
we're going to sharpen that barn

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.970 
we're going to sharpen that barn
drastically<00:00:53.780> we'll<00:00:54.780> bump<00:00:54.989> up<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.350> amount<00:00:55.710> to

drastically we'll bump up the amount to

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.840 
drastically we'll bump up the amount to
about<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> hundred<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.000> thirty<00:00:57.120> percent<00:00:57.899> and

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
about a hundred and thirty percent and

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.609 
about a hundred and thirty percent and
then<00:00:59.850> click<00:01:00.149> OK<00:01:02.539> we've<00:01:03.539> really<00:01:03.960> sharpened<00:01:04.500> the

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
then click OK we've really sharpened the

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.399 
then click OK we've really sharpened the
barn<00:01:04.890> quite<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> bit<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:06.270> we've<00:01:06.450> also<00:01:06.689> made<00:01:06.930> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
barn quite a bit but we've also made the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.910 
barn quite a bit but we've also made the
trees<00:01:07.740> look<00:01:08.299> really<00:01:09.299> raggedy<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.680> grass

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
trees look really raggedy and the grass

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.550 
trees look really raggedy and the grass
look<00:01:11.250> really<00:01:11.610> raggedy<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.869> sky<00:01:13.200> has

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
look really raggedy and the sky has

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.230 
look really raggedy and the sky has
little<00:01:13.920> blotches<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.850> from<00:01:15.060> our

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
little blotches in it from our

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.160 
little blotches in it from our
sharpening<00:01:16.880> so<00:01:17.880> let's<00:01:18.119> add<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.330> layer<00:01:18.659> mask<00:01:18.750> to

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170

sharpening so let's add a layer mask to
this<00:01:19.439> layer<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:20.460> when<00:01:21.270> we<00:01:21.420> add<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.750> layer

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
this layer and when we add the layer

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.390 
this layer and when we add the layer
mask<00:01:22.970> press<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.210> alt<00:01:24.450> or<00:01:24.900> option<00:01:25.170> key<00:01:25.860> and

where<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:31.950> barn<00:02:32.220> is<00:02:32.490> and<00:02:32.820> that's<00:02:33.570> because<00:02:34.140> the

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
where the barn is and that's because the

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.400 
where the barn is and that's because the
painting<00:02:36.000> we're<00:02:36.180> doing<00:02:36.570> is<00:02:36.750> allowing<00:02:37.110> the

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
painting we're doing is allowing the

painting we're doing is allowing the

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
sharpening to show through I'm not

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.699 
sharpening to show through I'm not
painting<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.680> sky<00:02:40.830> at<00:02:41.220> all<00:02:42.110> let's<00:02:43.110> go<00:02:43.290> back<00:02:43.500> to

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
painting the sky at all let's go back to

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.040 
painting the sky at all let's go back to
the<00:02:43.830> tool<00:02:44.069> options<00:02:44.340> now<00:02:44.819> and<00:02:45.180> we'll<00:02:45.660> work<00:02:45.870> on

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
the tool options now and we'll work on

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.680 
the tool options now and we'll work on
the<00:02:46.200> trees<00:02:46.470> in<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.800> grass<00:02:47.100> I'm<00:02:47.670> going<00:02:48.570> to

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
the trees in the grass I'm going to

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.650 
the trees in the grass I'm going to
change<00:02:49.020> the<00:02:49.260> opacity<00:02:49.380> of<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.160> brushing<00:02:50.880> down

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
change the opacity of the brushing down

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.900 
change the opacity of the brushing down
to<00:02:52.080> 25<00:02:53.070> or<00:02:53.100> 30%<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.950> close<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.130> tool<00:02:56.340> options

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
to 25 or 30% and close the tool options

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.600 
to 25 or 30% and close the tool options
and<00:02:57.209> then<00:02:57.900> start<00:02:58.260> brushing<00:02:58.560> over<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.280> trees

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
and then start brushing over the trees

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.540 
and then start brushing over the trees
and<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.060> grass<00:03:00.470> this<00:03:01.470> will<00:03:01.680> add<00:03:01.920> a<00:03:01.950> smaller

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
and the grass this will add a smaller

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.390 
and the grass this will add a smaller
amount<00:03:03.120> of<00:03:03.239> sharpening<00:03:03.600> back<00:03:04.560> into<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.100> trees

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
amount of sharpening back into the trees

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.940 
amount of sharpening back into the trees
and<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.820> grass<00:03:06.140> will<00:03:07.140> just<00:03:07.350> go<00:03:07.500> around<00:03:07.800> the

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
and the grass will just go around the

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.699 
and the grass will just go around the
edges<00:03:08.130> there<00:03:08.640> you<00:03:09.600> can<00:03:09.780> press<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.350> left

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
edges there you can press the left

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.130 
edges there you can press the left
bracket<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:11.550> reduce<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.300> size<00:03:12.540> of<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.870> brush

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
bracket to reduce the size of the brush

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.330 
bracket to reduce the size of the brush
or<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.650> right<00:03:13.860> bracket<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.550> increase<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.300> and

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
or the right bracket to increase it and

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.680 
or the right bracket to increase it and
just<00:03:17.340> brush<00:03:17.610> in<00:03:17.850> a<00:03:17.940> little<00:03:18.180> bit<00:03:18.299> of<00:03:18.390> sharpening

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
just brush in a little bit of sharpening

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.280 
just brush in a little bit of sharpening
on<00:03:19.019> those<00:03:19.230> trees<00:03:19.590> and<00:03:19.799> grasses<00:03:20.100> if<00:03:21.079> you<00:03:22.079> look

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
on those trees and grasses if you look

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.699 
on those trees and grasses if you look
at<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.560> layer<00:03:22.769> mask<00:03:23.130> you<00:03:24.200> can<00:03:25.200> see<00:03:25.470> that

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
at the layer mask you can see that

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.190 
at the layer mask you can see that
there's<00:03:26.010> all<00:03:26.310> different<00:03:27.209> ranges<00:03:27.450> of<00:03:27.720> grays
