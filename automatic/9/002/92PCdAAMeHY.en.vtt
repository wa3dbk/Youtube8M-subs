00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
removed on said switchblade for me I

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.170 
removed on said switchblade for me I
only<00:00:25.740> have<00:00:25.920> three<00:00:26.250> pins<00:00:26.519> we<00:00:26.730> got<00:00:26.880> one<00:00:27.060> right

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
only have three pins we got one right

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.210 
only have three pins we got one right
there<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:28.170> hear<00:00:28.439> these<00:00:28.619> two<00:00:28.830> just<00:00:28.980> hold

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.460 
there and to hear these two just hold
the<00:00:29.310> outer<00:00:29.849> body<00:00:30.269> casing<00:00:30.689> together<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.380> this

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
the outer body casing together and this

the outer body casing together and this
one<00:00:31.679> actually<00:00:31.910> holds<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.059> pivot<00:00:33.390> for<00:00:34.200> the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
one actually holds the pivot for the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.690 
one actually holds the pivot for the
blade<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:34.890> have<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.130> be<00:00:35.219> careful<00:00:35.370> if<00:00:35.610> you

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
switchblade open using the button there

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.939 
switchblade open using the button there
for<00:00:48.840> releasing<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.649> pressure<00:00:50.180> inside<00:00:51.949> from

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
for releasing the pressure inside from

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.029 
for releasing the pressure inside from
the<00:00:53.070> pin<00:00:53.280> that's<00:00:53.640> hidden<00:00:54.030> inside<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.629> handle

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
in here where it's all oiled up this is

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.190 
in here where it's all oiled up this is
also<00:01:37.649> the<00:01:37.860> way<00:01:38.039> that<00:01:38.219> you<00:01:38.369> would<00:01:38.520> have<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:39.200> open

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
also the way that you would have to open

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.319 
also the way that you would have to open
your<00:01:40.319> knife<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.799> grease<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.159> for<00:01:41.789> instance<00:01:42.090> if

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
your knife to grease it for instance if

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.490 
your knife to grease it for instance if
your<00:01:42.539> knife<00:01:42.689> blade<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.020> not<00:01:43.170> spinning

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
your knife blade is not spinning

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.440 
your knife blade is not spinning
properly<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.490> have<00:01:44.670> not<00:01:44.849> over<00:01:45.090> tightened

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
properly and you have not over tightened

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.589 
properly and you have not over tightened
your<00:01:45.750> pivot<00:01:46.110> screw<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:47.159> basically<00:01:47.729> try<00:01:48.539> to

00:01:48.589 --> 00:01:48.599 
your pivot screw so basically try to

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:50.870 
your pivot screw so basically try to
touch<00:01:48.929> that<00:01:49.170> if<00:01:49.439> it's<00:01:49.679> all<00:01:49.829> dirty<00:01:50.099> and<00:01:50.220> there's

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
touch that if it's all dirty and there's

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.910 
touch that if it's all dirty and there's
not<00:01:51.209> really<00:01:51.450> any<00:01:51.810> shiny<00:01:52.170> oil<00:01:52.409> in<00:01:52.619> there<00:01:52.799> you

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
not really any shiny oil in there you

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.130 
not really any shiny oil in there you
probably<00:01:53.310> need<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.789> oil<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.209> anyways<00:01:54.539> so<00:01:54.990> it's

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
probably need to oil it anyways so it's

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.870 
probably need to oil it anyways so it's
a<00:01:55.200> good<00:01:55.289> thing<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.709> opened<00:01:55.979> them<00:01:56.189> but

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.960 
little bar like this okay this bar in
here<00:02:01.829> gets<00:02:02.579> pushed<00:02:02.909> back<00:02:03.679> like<00:02:04.679> this<00:02:04.890> on<00:02:05.220> the

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
here gets pushed back like this on the

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.550 
here gets pushed back like this on the
other<00:02:06.119> side<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.329> this<00:02:06.539> pin<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:07.020> can't<00:02:07.289> do<00:02:07.439> it

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
other side of this pin I can't do it

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.350 
other side of this pin I can't do it
with<00:02:08.069> my<00:02:08.220> fingers<00:02:08.519> because<00:02:08.789> it's<00:02:08.940> really

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
with my fingers because it's really

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.949 
with my fingers because it's really
really<00:02:09.690> strong<00:02:10.019> so<00:02:10.970> this<00:02:11.970> bar<00:02:12.209> gets<00:02:12.690> clipped

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
really strong so this bar gets clipped

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.199 
really strong so this bar gets clipped
back<00:02:13.140> behind<00:02:13.380> this<00:02:13.739> piece<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.280> when<00:02:15.120> you

spin<00:02:32.040> out<00:02:32.190> so<00:02:33.030> this<00:02:33.510> is<00:02:33.569> what<00:02:33.660> you<00:02:33.720> need<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:33.959> do

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
spin out so this is what you need to do

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.259 
spin out so this is what you need to do
is<00:02:34.290> pull<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:34.680> metal<00:02:35.069> piece<00:02:35.250> out<00:02:35.459> it<00:02:35.910> can<00:02:36.150> be

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
is pull that metal piece out it can be

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:37.670 
is pull that metal piece out it can be
in<00:02:36.359> different<00:02:36.389> locations<00:02:36.959> for<00:02:37.319> different

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
in different locations for different

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.440 
in different locations for different
knives<00:02:37.829> every<00:02:38.250> knife<00:02:38.400> is<00:02:38.579> obviously<00:02:39.060> going<00:02:39.329> to

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
knives every knife is obviously going to

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.410 
knives every knife is obviously going to
be<00:02:39.569> different<00:02:39.870> but<00:02:40.680> for<00:02:41.100> me<00:02:41.220> it's<00:02:42.030> pretty

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
be different but for me it's pretty

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.449 
be different but for me it's pretty
simple<00:02:42.690> and<00:02:42.989> it's<00:02:43.109> right<00:02:43.410> there<00:02:43.620> so<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:44.400> might

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
simple and it's right there so you might

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:45.920 
simple and it's right there so you might
want<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:44.940> use<00:02:45.030> something<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.389> pry<00:02:45.600> this<00:02:45.660> out

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
want to use something to pry this out

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:46.879 
want to use something to pry this out
because<00:02:46.079> it<00:02:46.260> could<00:02:46.440> be<00:02:46.470> in<00:02:46.650> there<00:02:46.739> pretty

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889 
because it could be in there pretty

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.190 
because it could be in there pretty
tight<00:02:47.359> I'm<00:02:48.359> going<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.600> just<00:02:48.720> use<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.019> allen

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
way so we're just going to line the pins

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:29.330 
way so we're just going to line the pins
up<00:03:23.670> like<00:03:23.879> this<00:03:25.340> put<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.459> screws<00:03:26.790> back<00:03:26.819> in<00:03:28.340> be
