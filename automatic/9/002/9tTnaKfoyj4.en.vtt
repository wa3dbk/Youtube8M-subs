hello<00:00:18.710> my<00:00:19.710> name<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:19.890> Claire<00:00:20.160> Skinner<00:00:20.490> in<00:00:20.699> this

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
hello my name is Claire Skinner in this

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.429 
hello my name is Claire Skinner in this
episode<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.510> beyond<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.869> beat<00:00:22.020> I'm<00:00:22.170> going<00:00:22.380> to

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
episode of beyond the beat I'm going to

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.939 
episode of beyond the beat I'm going to
teach<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.160> molar<00:00:23.519> pullout<00:00:24.060> accent<00:00:24.890> so<00:00:25.890> if

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
teach you the molar pullout accent so if

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.710 
teach you the molar pullout accent so if
you're<00:00:26.070> familiar<00:00:26.279> with<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.910> molar<00:00:27.210> pumping

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
you're familiar with the molar pumping

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.620 
you're familiar with the molar pumping
motion<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:29.010> concept<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.760> pullout<00:00:30.000> accent

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
motion the concept of a pullout accent

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.630 
motion the concept of a pullout accent
is<00:00:30.779> just<00:00:31.019> basically<00:00:31.410> like<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.650> continuation<00:00:32.219> of

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
is just basically like a continuation of

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.209 
is just basically like a continuation of
that<00:00:32.989> with<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.110> pumping<00:00:34.469> motion<00:00:34.649> what<00:00:35.070> you're

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
that with the pumping motion what you're

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.549 
that with the pumping motion what you're
doing<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.610> you're<00:00:35.760> constantly<00:00:36.559> you're

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
doing is you're constantly you're

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.190 
doing is you're constantly you're
constantly<00:00:38.270> getting<00:00:39.270> more<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.600> more<00:00:39.660> hits<00:00:39.989> or

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
constantly getting more and more hits or

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.049 
constantly getting more and more hits or
allowing<00:00:41.070> for<00:00:41.280> more<00:00:41.399> annoying<00:00:41.640> hits<00:00:41.820> through

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
allowing for more annoying hits through

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.240 
allowing for more annoying hits through
the<00:00:42.149> movement<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.690> one's<00:00:42.960> limb<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
the movement of one's limb and the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.010 
the movement of one's limb and the
pumping<00:00:44.579> motion<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:45.120> what<00:00:45.270> allows<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.840> to

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
pumping motion is what allows you to

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.790 
pumping motion is what allows you to
continually<00:00:46.649> get<00:00:46.920> those<00:00:47.190> those<00:00:47.789> hits<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.800> with

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
continually get those those hits in with

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.729 
continually get those those hits in with
pull<00:00:50.070> out<00:00:50.219> accent<00:00:50.899> you're<00:00:51.899> going<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.260> actually

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
pull out accent you're going to actually

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.260 
pull out accent you're going to actually
be<00:00:52.949> playing<00:00:53.250> just<00:00:53.550> basically<00:00:53.969> little

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
be playing just basically little

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.470 
be playing just basically little
snippets<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.860> that<00:00:56.719> of<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.199> pumping<00:00:58.620> motion

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
snippets of that of the pumping motion

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.200 
snippets of that of the pumping motion
whereas<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.840> begin<00:01:01.410> with<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.219> pump<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.640> then

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
whereas you begin with the pump and then

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.990 
whereas you begin with the pump and then
you<00:01:03.359> end<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.260> pump<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.769> then<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.670> last

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
you end on the pump and then that last

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.330 
you end on the pump and then that last
hit<00:01:06.479> would<00:01:06.840> be<00:01:06.990> referring<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.680> or<00:01:07.950> would<00:01:08.310> be

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
hit would be referring to or would be

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.719 
hit would be referring to or would be
referred<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.939> as<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.240> pull<00:01:09.420> out<00:01:09.450> accent<00:01:10.729> it's

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
referred to as the pull out accent it's

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.000 
referred to as the pull out accent it's
not<00:01:11.850> it's<00:01:12.360> not<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.780> probably<00:01:13.380> not<00:01:13.500> explaining

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
not it's not a probably not explaining

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.890 
not it's not a probably not explaining
it<00:01:14.040> very<00:01:14.130> well<00:01:14.430> my<00:01:15.150> demonstrations<00:01:15.720> will

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
it very well my demonstrations will

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.260 
it very well my demonstrations will
probably<00:01:16.290> be<00:01:16.439> much<00:01:17.070> more<00:01:17.310> clear<00:01:18.590> yeah<00:01:20.180> so<00:01:21.180> if

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
probably be much more clear yeah so if

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.580 
probably be much more clear yeah so if
you're<00:01:21.390> looking<00:01:21.509> at<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.900> PDF<00:01:22.350> you'll

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
you're looking at the PDF you'll

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.230 
you're looking at the PDF you'll
probably<00:01:22.799> see<00:01:23.310> what<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.520> was<00:01:23.759> talking<00:01:24.180> about

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
probably see what I was talking about

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.679 
probably see what I was talking about
earlier<00:01:25.369> rather<00:01:26.369> than<00:01:26.640> playing<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.060> continuous

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
earlier rather than playing a continuous

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.380 
earlier rather than playing a continuous
stream<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.110> constant<00:01:29.009> hits<00:01:29.250> you're<00:01:30.210> just

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
stream of constant hits you're just

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.630 
stream of constant hits you're just
basically<00:01:30.720> lining<00:01:31.409> up<00:01:31.560> from<00:01:31.860> one<00:01:32.159> say<00:01:32.460> one

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
basically lining up from one say one

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.640 
basically lining up from one say one
quarter<00:01:33.000> note<00:01:33.150> or<00:01:33.270> one<00:01:33.420> eighth<00:01:33.570> note<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.530> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
quarter note or one eighth note to the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.219 
quarter note or one eighth note to the
next<00:01:35.070> while<00:01:35.520> playing<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.720> run<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.020> hits

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
next while playing the the run of hits

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.100 
next while playing the the run of hits
and<00:01:37.439> then<00:01:37.619> stopping<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.369> next<00:01:38.850> note<00:01:39.110> going

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
and then stopping on the next note going

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.289 
and then stopping on the next note going
up<00:01:40.380> in<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.130> particular<00:01:41.490> case<00:01:41.909> that's<00:01:42.150> going

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
up in this particular case that's going

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.109 
up in this particular case that's going
to<00:01:42.390> be<00:01:42.450> quarter<00:01:42.840> notes<00:01:43.159> so<00:01:44.159> for<00:01:44.549> instance<00:01:44.909> the

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
to be quarter notes so for instance the

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.289 
to be quarter notes so for instance the
first<00:01:45.299> exercise<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:46.220> bouncing<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.310> threes<00:01:47.640> and

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
first exercise is bouncing in threes and

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.450 
first exercise is bouncing in threes and
I<00:01:48.659> say<00:01:48.810> about<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.170> get<00:01:49.290> three<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.590> because<00:01:49.710> yes

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
I say about to get three is because yes

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.219 
I say about to get three is because yes
you<00:01:50.490> are<00:01:50.759> using<00:01:51.000> triplets<00:01:51.540> but<00:01:51.689> in<00:01:51.810> some<00:01:51.990> cases

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
you are using triplets but in some cases

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.670 
you are using triplets but in some cases
you<00:01:52.560> may<00:01:52.770> be<00:01:52.829> using<00:01:54.079> sixteenth<00:01:55.079> note<00:01:55.229> triplets

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
you may be using sixteenth note triplets

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.590 
you may be using sixteenth note triplets
you<00:01:55.799> could<00:01:55.950> be<00:01:56.040> using<00:01:56.310> six<00:01:56.520> couplets<00:01:57.000> it's

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
you could be using six couplets it's

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.679 
you could be using six couplets it's
it's<00:01:58.229> varying<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.340> I'm<00:01:59.640> just<00:02:00.000> saying<00:02:00.270> bouncing

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
it's varying so I'm just saying bouncing

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.499 
it's varying so I'm just saying bouncing
in<00:02:00.780> threes<00:02:01.079> just<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.590> make<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.890> easier<00:02:02.509> so

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
in threes just to make it easier so

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.940 
in threes just to make it easier so
what's<00:02:03.750> happening<00:02:04.229> here<00:02:04.439> is<00:02:04.500> you're<00:02:04.710> going<00:02:04.860> to

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
what's happening here is you're going to

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.039 
what's happening here is you're going to
be<00:02:05.130> playing<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.549> run<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:05.969> triplets<00:02:06.630> or<00:02:06.869> are<00:02:06.990> you

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
be playing a run of triplets or are you

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.510 
be playing a run of triplets or are you
going<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.290> be<00:02:07.350> bouncing<00:02:07.740> three<00:02:07.950> times<00:02:08.220> and

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
going to be bouncing three times and

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.360 
going to be bouncing three times and
then<00:02:08.610> ending<00:02:09.179> on<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.709> next<00:02:10.709> quarter<00:02:11.039> note<00:02:11.190> up

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
then ending on the next quarter note up

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.770 
then ending on the next quarter note up
that<00:02:12.270> right<00:02:12.480> there<00:02:12.690> like<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:12.989> said<00:02:13.020> is<00:02:13.500> the

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
that right there like I said is the

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.350 
that right there like I said is the
pullout<00:02:14.050> accent<00:02:14.880> so<00:02:15.880> listen<00:02:16.209> to<00:02:16.270> the

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
pullout accent so listen to the

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.309 
pullout accent so listen to the
demonstration<00:02:17.050> on<00:02:17.260> this<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:18.600> we'll<00:02:19.600> see<00:02:20.230> you

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
demonstration on this and we'll see you

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:46.530 
demonstration on this and we'll see you
in<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.500> next<00:02:20.709> exercise<00:02:45.150> see<00:02:46.150> it's<00:02:46.330> a<00:02:46.390> pretty

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
in the next exercise see it's a pretty

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.530 
in the next exercise see it's a pretty
simple<00:02:46.870> concept<00:02:48.030> remember<00:02:49.030> you're<00:02:49.150> just<00:02:49.330> you

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
simple concept remember you're just you

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.210 
simple concept remember you're just you
start<00:02:49.870> on<00:02:49.989> one<00:02:50.200> quarter<00:02:50.500> note<00:02:50.650> and<00:02:50.860> you<00:02:50.920> end<00:02:51.070> on

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
start on one quarter note and you end on

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.949 
start on one quarter note and you end on
the<00:02:51.370> other<00:02:51.400> quarter<00:02:51.820> and<00:02:52.480> you<00:02:52.540> make<00:02:52.720> sure<00:02:52.930> that

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
the other quarter and you make sure that

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.500 
the other quarter and you make sure that
you<00:02:53.350> hit<00:02:53.920> that<00:02:54.100> accent<00:02:54.610> at<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.790> end<00:02:54.970> now

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
you hit that accent at the end now

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.940 
you hit that accent at the end now
you'll<00:02:55.660> notice<00:02:55.840> though<00:02:56.110> that<00:02:56.140> obviously<00:02:56.769> it

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
you'll notice though that obviously it

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.380 
you'll notice though that obviously it
starts<00:02:57.190> to<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:57.430> next<00:02:57.760> and<00:02:57.880> and<00:02:58.000> ends<00:02:58.239> of<00:02:58.330> the

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
starts to the next and and ends of the

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.559 
starts to the next and and ends of the
next<00:02:58.720> end<00:02:58.870> but<00:02:59.470> it's<00:03:00.040> named<00:03:00.370> after<00:03:00.640> that<00:03:00.910> final

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
next end but it's named after that final

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.410 
next end but it's named after that final
accent<00:03:02.280> there's<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.340> lot<00:03:03.489> of<00:03:03.580> accents<00:03:04.180> in<00:03:04.300> this

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
accent there's a lot of accents in this

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.050 
accent there's a lot of accents in this
room<00:03:04.690> so<00:03:05.380> anyway<00:03:05.769> yeah<00:03:06.459> that's<00:03:06.730> where<00:03:06.970> the

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
room so anyway yeah that's where the

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.020 
room so anyway yeah that's where the
polar<00:03:07.569> pullout<00:03:07.989> accent<00:03:08.470> comes<00:03:08.980> from<00:03:09.040> so<00:03:09.940> in

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
polar pullout accent comes from so in

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.460 
polar pullout accent comes from so in
the<00:03:10.120> next<00:03:10.239> exercise<00:03:10.780> we're<00:03:11.080> going<00:03:11.230> to<00:03:11.319> be

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
the next exercise we're going to be

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.650 
the next exercise we're going to be
bouncing<00:03:11.860> in<00:03:11.950> fours<00:03:12.250> or<00:03:12.550> written<00:03:13.330> out<00:03:13.510> at

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
bouncing in fours or written out at

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.500 
bouncing in fours or written out at
sixteenth<00:03:14.080> notes<00:03:14.319> in<00:03:14.560> this<00:03:14.680> particular<00:03:14.980> case

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
sixteenth notes in this particular case

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.490 
sixteenth notes in this particular case
so<00:03:16.510> we're<00:03:16.630> going<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:16.780> be<00:03:16.900> playing<00:03:17.140> sixteenth

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
so we're going to be playing sixteenth

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.460 
so we're going to be playing sixteenth
notes<00:03:17.890> all<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.250> way<00:03:18.910> until<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:19.930> next<00:03:20.110> quarter

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
notes all the way until the next quarter

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.949 
notes all the way until the next quarter
note<00:03:20.620> so<00:03:21.370> starting<00:03:21.910> on<00:03:22.000> one<00:03:22.209> going<00:03:22.660> all<00:03:22.810> the

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
note so starting on one going all the

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.140 
note so starting on one going all the
way<00:03:22.989> to<00:03:23.110> two<00:03:23.320> stopping<00:03:23.950> on<00:03:24.040> two<00:03:24.250> waiting<00:03:25.000> for

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
way to two stopping on two waiting for

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.060 
way to two stopping on two waiting for
three<00:03:25.450> starting<00:03:26.079> up<00:03:26.200> again<00:03:26.320> on<00:03:26.530> three<00:03:26.860> and

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
three starting up again on three and

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.520 
three starting up again on three and
ending<00:03:27.549> on<00:03:27.640> four<00:03:27.940> it's<00:03:28.810> really<00:03:29.079> quite<00:03:29.290> simple

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
ending on four it's really quite simple

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.800 
ending on four it's really quite simple
the<00:03:30.040> only<00:03:30.310> difficult<00:03:30.760> thing<00:03:30.820> is<00:03:31.150> is<00:03:31.299> actually

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
the only difficult thing is is actually

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.190 
the only difficult thing is is actually
pulling<00:03:32.049> off<00:03:32.350> the<00:03:32.590> movement<00:03:33.870> but<00:03:34.870> if<00:03:34.989> you've

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
pulling off the movement but if you've

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.860 
pulling off the movement but if you've
done<00:03:35.739> the<00:03:35.950> molar<00:03:36.880> pumping<00:03:37.209> motion<00:03:37.360> you<00:03:37.720> should

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
done the molar pumping motion you should

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.080 
done the molar pumping motion you should
have<00:03:37.959> no<00:03:38.079> problem<00:03:38.380> with<00:03:38.470> this<00:03:38.620> so<00:03:39.400> just<00:03:39.940> watch

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
have no problem with this so just watch

00:03:40.090 --> 00:04:08.970 
have no problem with this so just watch
some<00:03:40.269> demonstration

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.140 

the<00:04:09.980> concept<00:04:10.400> behind<00:04:10.489> these<00:04:10.790> is<00:04:10.999> actually

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
the concept behind these is actually

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.849 
the concept behind these is actually
very<00:04:11.599> simple

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:12.859 
very simple

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:14.860 
very simple
it<00:04:13.099> doesn't<00:04:13.430> require<00:04:13.549> hours<00:04:14.329> and<00:04:14.510> hours<00:04:14.780> of

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
it doesn't require hours and hours of

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.870 
it doesn't require hours and hours of
practice<00:04:14.989> to<00:04:15.530> get<00:04:15.650> this<00:04:15.769> down<00:04:16.009> you<00:04:16.549> may<00:04:16.669> want

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
practice to get this down you may want

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.699 
practice to get this down you may want
to<00:04:16.910> try<00:04:17.060> using<00:04:17.329> a<00:04:17.539> metronome<00:04:17.840> just<00:04:18.169> again

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
to try using a metronome just again

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:19.990 
to try using a metronome just again
lining<00:04:19.190> it<00:04:19.310> up

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
lining it up

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.029 
lining it up
they<00:04:20.419> set<00:04:20.660> the<00:04:20.690> metronome<00:04:20.900> to<00:04:21.410> a<00:04:21.440> four<00:04:21.799> count

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
they set the metronome to a four count

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:25.719 
they set the metronome to a four count
and<00:04:22.400> lining<00:04:23.300> up<00:04:23.449> one<00:04:23.990> E<00:04:24.020> and<00:04:24.169> a<00:04:24.500> two<00:04:24.530> three<00:04:25.400> and

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
and lining up one E and a two three and

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.510 
and lining up one E and a two three and
a<00:04:25.880> four<00:04:26.090> or<00:04:26.330> one<00:04:26.660> and<00:04:26.870> debt<00:04:27.080> to<00:04:27.289> three<00:04:27.949> and<00:04:28.099> F<00:04:28.310> or

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
a four or one and debt to three and F or

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.650 
a four or one and debt to three and F or
whatever<00:04:28.849> one<00:04:29.030> if<00:04:29.120> you're<00:04:29.240> bouncing<00:04:29.570> in

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
whatever one if you're bouncing in

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.560 
whatever one if you're bouncing in
threes<00:04:29.900> or<00:04:30.080> fours<00:04:30.729> just<00:04:31.729> practice<00:04:32.240> lining

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
threes or fours just practice lining

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.300 
threes or fours just practice lining
that<00:04:32.690> up<00:04:32.750> practice<00:04:33.680> with<00:04:33.800> both<00:04:33.949> hands

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
that up practice with both hands

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.040 
that up practice with both hands
obviously<00:04:36.009> it's<00:04:37.009> pretty<00:04:37.070> straightforward

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
obviously it's pretty straightforward

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.689 
obviously it's pretty straightforward
