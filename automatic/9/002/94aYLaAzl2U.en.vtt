00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.710
 so the third row after so i linked the 2nd row 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.620
 the number of loops decreased by another 12 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.500
 that is, I have 60 loops left 60 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.369
 divide by 12 is 5, respectively 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.609
 I will reduce the fourth and fifth loop 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.670
 that is, three lifting loops are considered 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.039
 one column with double crochet on the second 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:33.230
 loop is embossed face column with 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:35.940
 crochet 3 purl with crochet and 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.950
 I turn down the fourth fifth 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.570
 attention that I see exactly in the picture as 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.239
 could be seen where there was 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.820
 embossed front knit relief on the front 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.289
 where purl and purl and now 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.850
 doing a decrease I tied 2 columns with 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:53.640
 nakidom here turns relief 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.410
 double crotch and here I have 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.800
 it turns out too embossed facial 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.129
 column with 1 sc in provyazyvayu ie 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.100
 that's where there were two columns in the previous one 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.439
 I wrap them around and knit them 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.250
 on the hook 3 loops grab the worker 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:15.409
 thread and knit all three loops at once 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:21.860
 next again the first column knit facial 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:26.729
 2 purl like a exactly according to figure 3 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:31.020
 facial and 4 5 tying together this 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:37.020
 I do not take a wrong case 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:39.869
 the end and the front without completing it 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.590
 eat and knit together again again by 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:49.610
 picture 1 column getting from me 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:54.960
 purl 2 face 3 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:56.969
 wrong and fourth 5 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.979
 together in this case I had 2 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:05.280
 Facial crochet stitch 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:08.459
 together with a common peak like this 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.590
 way further again I see the face 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:22.640
 double crochet 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:26.580
 wrong face and diminishing 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:33.270
 wrong side of it leave one loop and 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:34.830
 face as we see I see exactly 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.860
 picture accordingly as it was in 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.280
 the previous year so in this only 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.280
