 respect to the environment is placed 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.769
 in practice by a fern artisan 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.510
 which does beautiful works with reuse 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.390
 of scrap 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.869

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.890
 the difference here is that walter is 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.710
 he uses all the free time to do 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.620
 works of art with recyclable materials 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.559
 and put into practice the idea that 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.640
 believe the environment needs to be 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.430
 respected 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.229
 he lives in fern and works alone 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.070
 in a workshop that he set up on his own 

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:48.589
 House 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.680
 the parts are used as 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:54.890
 decoration and most of it is made with 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.019
 of vehicles thrown into our junkyard 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.970

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:01.549
