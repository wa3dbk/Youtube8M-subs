00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:25.910
 the decoration of the house is for 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:30.250
 explain 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:35.070
 in 142 of our minecraft section 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:38.480
 these two blocks came in here 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.480
 because it is one more 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.460
 to eat 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.120
 by language it kills me 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:54.720

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.090
 in some 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.330
 tree 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:18.710
 The materials that we can process for 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.710
 hunt and wait 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.740
 other caravans and the others 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.400
 particularly what we did and I thought 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.400
 yes 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.920
 the flint in that sharp life because 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.460
 I thought we do not have a pearl and it's going to be 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.460
 very bad 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.630
 these stairs I will remove this 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:57.180
 42 the singer 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:59.250
 the description of the video as always and 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.820
 we are going to launch 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.820
 from here 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.010
 Y 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.450
 These guys already know that she is married 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:14.020
 I've been planning for like 30 or 50 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.360
 episodes I say 540 that I have it 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.310
 planned so let's go what 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.250
 first is what males are 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.030
 collected puff pastry 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.030
 efe 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:34.110
 what do you want me to do 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:36.720
 a blog explaining how to do and 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.290
 how variety goes and those things here to 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.270
 Christmas 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.460
 I know you want 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.680
 with children and new ones planting the 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.410
 soleus gas until I run out of some 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.870
 of we will do 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.940
 that is, we will continue to build our 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.960
 house that is the main house here 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.960
 my cat has 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:03.470
 and that 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.720
 for side 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.720
 and I do not like anything like that 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.250
 but this is well spent half 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.250
 so that there is 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.300
 since he was destroying that is going to 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.300
 to choose 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.930
 all right 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.930
 consists 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.000
 let's decorate this also with want 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.480
 in which he liked in love 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.480
 do not go 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:57.000
 If I had ever 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.000
 but we continue with the construction 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.030
 a little more tribal and a braid of 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.880
 white is the policy 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.170
 in a room 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.760
 things 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:11.209
 attributed kill matas 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.209
 i 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:21.450
 because he wants to see them in the torches is 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:25.470
 that I simply want because I want 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:28.630
 make two pumpkin lamps and it 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.230
 I can rain 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.230

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.290

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.639

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.830
 I am already 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:58.169
