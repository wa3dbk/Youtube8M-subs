00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.960
 hello and welcome to this video a 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.450
 boxing from the book the legend of zelda era 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.400
 a story but in Spanish this is 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.990
 the English version to which I already dedicate 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.850
 a video if I'm not mistaken in the beginning 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.250
 of the year we will leave it aside to do 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.050
 then a small comparison because the 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.870
 what 's in here is the one that really 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.750
 we are interested as you are seeing the box 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.489
 it's really huge I did not expect a 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.950
 box so big but I imagine that 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.650
 come well protected so let's go 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.990
 removing the safety seals and 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.579
 let's really see how it comes about 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.829
 you are curious this book is worth 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.020
 currently about thirty euros is not that 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.060
 the truth is very cheap but I imagine 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.700
 that if you're a zelda fan it's a money 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.110
 well invested I personally as 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.820
 You are seeing what I bought in Amazon 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.259
 It is the cheapest place where I have 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.650
 found although I've seen it in 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:11.440
 enough more stores 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.810
 in protection is a bit strange 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.120
 we remove this so it seems 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.380
 they are just papers so let's go 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.420
 set aside the papers 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.110
 and we are going to take the book that really 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.610
 what interests us outside and already 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.159
 I'm going to leave the box aside so here 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.750
 it's really doing us nothing not here to 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.760
 one side would bother me better he threw it at 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.250
 another side of the room 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.140
 and here you have the Spanish edition of 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.390
 hiru the story and now the question is 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.300
 there will be a lot of difference with the version 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.800
 English let's take a look at it 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.570
 you are watching one next to the other 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.790
 it looks practically the same edition 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.350
 simply with the small indifference 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.540
 of the flange that has the edition 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.340
 Spanish the central drawing is also 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.930
 smaller the Spanish edition and by 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.120
 back will put the same 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.580
 no honestly not even something 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.440
 seemed anyway though the text 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.420
 be different as you can see they have 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.800
 saved a similar layout so 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.590
 that really looks like we're in front 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.060
 from the same book I will now leave aside 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.410
 the English version and we will 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.120
 look at the inside pages of the 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.370
 Spanish edition to really see what 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.170
 quality has we will first throw a 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.580
 look at the main pages of 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.280
 go ahead and then we'll take a look 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.709
 quickly throughout the book the quality 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.630
 of the paper is honestly very good and not 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:29.070
 There is no difference with the version 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:31.320
 English actually now looking so by 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.570
 over if it does not become because I'm 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.900
 seeing that it is in Spanish I would not notice 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.340
 no difference between both editions 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.220
 even the layout has been respected 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.650
 original of the English edition sources and 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.100
 everything and I wonder will correspond the 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.650
 pages with the English version 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.640
 we look for this page in this edition a 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.200
 little more forward and look here is 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.870
 as you can see the layout is 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.610
 practically the same a very detail 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.600
 thank you for respecting the 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.000
 maximum in the original edition 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.010
 the translation of this edition I do not know what 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.510
 this will be but I imagine that after 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.910
 so many delays has to be a 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.950
 outstanding translation anyway 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.690
 you know that if you notice something strange weird 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.300
 I would comment much on my page 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.890
 facebook like in my twitter and remember 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.480
 that in the end you will find the manga 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.720
 official adaptation of the last game 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.340
 zelda for wii and here is a box 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.190
