 in the year 2006 I was 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:26.699
 serving as brand manager in 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.140
 a prestigious company and it is that I had 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.599
 the enterprising little bug inside that 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.430
 they planted in san ignacio really and the 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.230
 thing is that he decided to resign and create my 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.910
 own company and that's how I open my mission 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.280

 up to 12 years of treatment 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.220
 can see super playful in that the kids 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.489
 they come to take care of themselves but they also come to 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.489
 happen 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.899
 your company this then all that 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.790
 benefits to her benefits you this 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.920
 store opened in 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:02.679
 and the time where the crisis was 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:06.159
 in 2009 where nobody was betting to open 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:08.560
 business and invest in nothing if not 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.750
 you bet you do not win then what 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.720
 we found in the local we found 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:18.250
 we had the wisdom of knowledge 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:21.119
 of work and we decided we faced what 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.119
 what we came up with 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.500
 in parallel while I was studying 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.520
 and we are putting together the project 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.260
 and this boom of the courts was synthetic 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.900
 it was giving little by little and I just think 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.550
 that we entered the best moment that was 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.600
 two years ago about a year and a half 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:43.920

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:52.060
 In our instalations 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:55.570
 scienceno municipal the boys in this 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:59.140
 complex is an incredible fortress 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.380
 since we are this investment sum 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.660
 public-private due to the terrain 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.860
 then the support of sport here in the 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.340
 Municipality of Surquillo is very 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.340
 important 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.909
 the courses as entrepreneurship 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.950
 arrest have helped us a lot 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:17.470
 about all the experiences of the 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.049
 teachers to know what the market is like 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.870
 itself when doing a market study I 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:25.120
 I noticed that the children's niche for 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.060
 exploit them and it comes out that effectively 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.519
 for they had been unsatisfied demands 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.519

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.500
 this project within hours of class

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.290
 no interest average has us 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.990
 served enough to be able to develop 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.850

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.660
 comparing in terms of when the
