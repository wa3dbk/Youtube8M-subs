00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello friend explosion heroes welcome 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.850
 to a new video this time 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.040
 I bring some traditional skulls of 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.750
 Mexican sugar this is very traditional 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.580
 here where you are going to find her 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.349
 for these dates and for good obviously 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.570
 I will teach them to be but of 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.430
 plasil we start with the video 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.520
 ah 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.520
 to 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.010
 let's start by creating a little ball and 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.439
 then we are going to reform a little egg and 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:33.710
 we are going to press it a bit against the 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:36.850
 table supporting us in this way 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.640
 and since they have something like this 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.809
 let's crush a bit the part of 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.610
 down as well as what am I doing and 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.460
 Here we will mark with our finger 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.620
 thumb 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.199
 and on the other side too 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.690
 Now let's take a little bit of 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.310
 plasticine with this form and we're going to 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.480
 place 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.480
 right here 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.780
 we are going to lend you a little bit of this 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.930
 way and we're going to do the same thing about the other 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.930
 side 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.289
 we will also place the same 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.900
 and now if we are going to join the rest of 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.900
 the word 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:37.130
 since they have something like this we are going to 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:41.350
 mark the holes for the eyes 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.990
 something like that and we're going to create a triangle 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.950
 and we're going to take out the plasticine that 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.930
 be within this great pretty 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.330
 in this way 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.110
 and this is how the 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.930
 basic skull 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.340
 now we are going to occupy the city of many 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.550
 colors because this is the most fun 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.860
 that we are going to decorate our skull to 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.340
 his taste, everyone will decorate it as 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:09.580
 I want to pray to my way and then 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.710
 well what I'm going to do is place three 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.570
 purple line inside the eyes and 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.570
 add some balls around 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.840
 in this way 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.220
 and inside I'm going to add three 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.220
 they have another color 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.760
 now I'm going to add a little heart 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.909
 that right in the forehead 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.069
 and a little triangle that I'm going to place 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.600
 inside where he had the hole 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.480
 analysis 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.520
 Now that I'm doing ovals, I 'm going to 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.860
 make two large two medium and two 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.900
 little ones 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.270
 and we're going to place the biggest ones in the 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.520
 center in this way I'm going to lend it 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.550
 a little bit and I'm going to put the 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.630
 medium in the sides and the most 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.630
 little ones on the banks 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.590
 now we 're just going to mark one 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.590
 line through the center 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.460
 in this way so that you notice the 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.460
 teeth division 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.650
 now I will continue adding 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:28.980
 decorations and I'm just 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.579
 using a slightly twisted band- aid 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.579
 from the tip 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.569
 here on the sides of the heart 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.720
 now I am adding a few dots 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.470
 in orange 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.470
 under 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:56.020
 and a blue one in the middle of this 2 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.020
 I'm also going to add other roses 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.000
 and here I am creating two long drops and 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.890
 I'll put it this way to 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.890
 create a mustache 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.069
 here to the state how I walk well 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.670
 and in this way we already have a skull 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:17.670
 with mustache 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.150
 in the back I'm going to add a 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.150
 very thin band-aid 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:31.289
 and I'm going to put it this way 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.289
 and I'm going to add one from the other side 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.890
 I'm going to add a drop and the 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.890
 I'm going to crush 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.480
 and some thin lines on the sides 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:54.950
 here I am going to add a little ball in the 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:56.720
 center plus little dots on the sides 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.130
