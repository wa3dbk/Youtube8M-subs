00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
prowler with the rest of the facade it's

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.470 
prowler with the rest of the facade it's
now<00:00:50.820> been<00:00:51.030> painted<00:00:53.090> spray-painted<00:00:54.090> I've<00:00:54.270> got

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
now been painted spray-painted I've got

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.319 
now been painted spray-painted I've got
a<00:00:55.250> metallic<00:00:56.250> silver<00:00:56.520> coat<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:59.090> if<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.180> can

a metallic silver coat and if you can

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.110 
a metallic silver coat and if you can
see<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.719> little<00:01:01.050> bit<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.379> black<00:01:02.120> just

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
see it a little bit of black just

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.920 
see it a little bit of black just
splattered<00:01:03.719> over<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:06.530> so<00:01:07.530> at<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.830> point<00:01:08.930> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
splattered over it so at this point the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.359 
splattered over it so at this point the
way<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.229> works<00:01:10.520> which<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:12.890> how<00:01:13.890> it's<00:01:14.070> going<00:01:14.340> to

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
way it works which is how it's going to

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.719 
way it works which is how it's going to
end<00:01:14.460> up<00:01:14.729> working<00:01:15.000> now<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.900> I've<00:01:16.520> looked<00:01:17.520> at

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
end up working now that I've looked at

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.999 
end up working now that I've looked at
it<00:01:17.850> some<00:01:18.030> more<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.479> uh<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:21.020> will<00:01:22.020> have<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.650> spring

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
it some more is uh I will have a spring

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.640 
it some more is uh I will have a spring
get<00:01:26.009> like<00:01:26.189> this<00:01:26.340> easier<00:01:27.020> I'll<00:01:28.020> have<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.200> spring

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
get like this easier I'll have a spring

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.359 
get like this easier I'll have a spring
to<00:01:29.640> holding<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.240> middle<00:01:30.509> piece<00:01:31.250> trying<00:01:32.250> to

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
to holding the middle piece trying to

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.929 
to holding the middle piece trying to
pull<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.700> middle<00:01:32.939> piece<00:01:33.119> back<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:34.729> keep<00:01:35.729> it

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
pull the middle piece back and keep it

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.440 
pull the middle piece back and keep it
in<00:01:36.180> its<00:01:36.329> completely<00:01:37.229> back<00:01:37.470> position<00:01:38.329> and<00:01:39.329> I'll

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
in its completely back position and I'll

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.889 
in its completely back position and I'll
have<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.990> spring<00:01:40.979> which<00:01:41.970> I'm<00:01:42.210> thinking<00:01:42.810> is

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
have a spring which I'm thinking is

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.330 
have a spring which I'm thinking is
going<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.110> be<00:01:43.170> an<00:01:43.259> axial<00:01:43.829> spring<00:01:44.930> kind<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.020> like

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
going to be an axial spring kind of like

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.969 
going to be an axial spring kind of like
the<00:01:47.340> idea<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.820> clothes<00:01:48.060> pin<00:01:48.329> type<00:01:48.600> spring<00:01:49.020> or

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
the idea of a clothes pin type spring or

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.139 
the idea of a clothes pin type spring or
it's<00:01:50.100> going<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.399> sit<00:01:50.899> if<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.729> take<00:01:53.729> off<00:01:53.939> the

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
it's going to sit if I take off the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.050 
it's going to sit if I take off the
blade<00:01:54.950> it's<00:01:55.950> going<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.189> be<00:01:56.280> sitting<00:01:56.549> where

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
blade it's going to be sitting where

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.620 
blade it's going to be sitting where
this<00:01:57.270> little<00:01:57.509> black<00:01:57.810> thing<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:59.630> underneath

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
this little black thing is underneath

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.670 
this little black thing is underneath
and<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.350> will<00:02:01.850> constantly<00:02:02.850> be<00:02:04.340> wanting<00:02:06.680> the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
and it will constantly be wanting the

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.140 
and it will constantly be wanting the
blade<00:02:08.539> to<00:02:09.539> be<00:02:10.310> locked<00:02:11.310> up<00:02:11.520> here<00:02:11.910> in<00:02:12.090> position

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
blade to be locked up here in position

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.990 
blade to be locked up here in position
then<00:02:14.140> I<00:02:14.290> will<00:02:14.439> have<00:02:14.620> a<00:02:14.700> string<00:02:16.110> attached<00:02:18.000> right

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
then I will have a string attached right

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.780 
then I will have a string attached right
to<00:02:19.420> this<00:02:19.599> end<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.920> will<00:02:21.040> go<00:02:21.189> to<00:02:21.250> tip<00:02:21.640> my

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
to this end that will go to tip my

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:30.210 
to this end that will go to tip my
finger<00:02:25.530> so<00:02:26.530> what<00:02:26.709> will<00:02:26.829> happen<00:02:26.860> is<00:02:28.769> if<00:02:29.769> I<00:02:29.859> put

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
finger so what will happen is if I put

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.580 
finger so what will happen is if I put
it<00:02:30.340> back<00:02:30.609> in<00:02:30.760> its<00:02:31.560> hang<00:02:32.560> out<00:02:32.739> position<00:02:34.590> strings

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
it back in its hang out position strings

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.610 
it back in its hang out position strings
can<00:02:35.680> be<00:02:35.769> connected<00:02:36.010> there<00:02:36.340> as<00:02:36.549> I<00:02:37.510> open<00:02:38.140> my<00:02:38.319> hand

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
can be connected there as I open my hand

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.690 
can be connected there as I open my hand
it<00:02:39.519> can't<00:02:40.769> do<00:02:41.769> anything<00:02:42.040> at<00:02:42.340> this<00:02:42.400> point<00:02:42.489> is

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
it can't do anything at this point is

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.360 
it can't do anything at this point is
just<00:02:42.790> pulling<00:02:43.239> cuz<00:02:44.019> I<00:02:44.109> this<00:02:44.590> thing<00:02:44.829> pulling

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
just pulling cuz I this thing pulling

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.300 
just pulling cuz I this thing pulling
won't<00:02:46.030> move<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.810> blade<00:02:47.590> it<00:02:47.739> all<00:02:47.889> at<00:02:48.129> this

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
won't move the blade it all at this

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.420 
won't move the blade it all at this
point<00:02:48.579> pull<00:02:49.480> it<00:02:49.690> it'll<00:02:50.590> come<00:02:50.859> all<00:02:51.099> the<00:02:51.280> way<00:02:51.310> out

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
point pull it it'll come all the way out

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.589 
point pull it it'll come all the way out
to<00:02:52.829> the<00:02:53.829> point<00:02:54.190> where<00:02:54.459> the<00:02:55.209> middle<00:02:55.450> piece

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
to the point where the middle piece

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.160 
to the point where the middle piece
cannot<00:02:56.049> move<00:02:56.260> any<00:02:56.409> farther<00:02:57.870> then<00:02:58.870> I<00:02:58.900> can<00:02:59.139> just

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
cannot move any farther then I can just

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.929 
cannot move any farther then I can just
let<00:02:59.530> go<00:03:01.439> the<00:03:02.439> spring<00:03:02.769> will<00:03:02.950> take<00:03:03.189> this<00:03:03.430> up<00:03:03.730> in

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:03.939 
let go the spring will take this up in

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:06.440 
let go the spring will take this up in
the<00:03:04.239> other<00:03:04.450> spring<00:03:04.930> will<00:03:05.260> take<00:03:05.439> this<00:03:05.650> back

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
the other spring will take this back

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.390 
the other spring will take this back
we'll<00:03:07.450> have<00:03:07.629> the<00:03:07.750> blade<00:03:08.019> I<00:03:08.319> can<00:03:08.829> use<00:03:09.010> in<00:03:09.189> what

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
we'll have the blade I can use in what

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.679 
we'll have the blade I can use in what
not<00:03:09.930> it's<00:03:10.930> not<00:03:11.859> going<00:03:12.069> to<00:03:12.159> be<00:03:12.510> pushed<00:03:13.510> back

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:13.689 
not it's not going to be pushed back

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:16.140 
not it's not going to be pushed back
this<00:03:13.840> is<00:03:14.049> locked<00:03:14.379> in<00:03:14.590> position<00:03:14.879> then<00:03:15.879> what<00:03:16.120> I

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
this is locked in position then what I

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.490 
this is locked in position then what I
want<00:03:16.359> to<00:03:16.659> retract<00:03:17.500> it<00:03:17.799> I<00:03:18.660> open<00:03:19.660> my<00:03:19.810> hand<00:03:20.049> again

want to retract it I open my hand again
this<00:03:21.370> time<00:03:21.699> it'll<00:03:22.449> be<00:03:23.760> this<00:03:24.760> time<00:03:25.060> as<00:03:25.389> I<00:03:25.959> open

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
this time it'll be this time as I open

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.610 
this time it'll be this time as I open
it<00:03:26.500> it<00:03:26.709> will<00:03:26.799> pull<00:03:27.160> this<00:03:28.379> around<00:03:29.379> to<00:03:29.949> there

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
it it will pull this around to there

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.110 
it it will pull this around to there
pull<00:03:32.620> a<00:03:32.650> little<00:03:32.769> farther<00:03:33.870> it'll<00:03:34.870> pull<00:03:36.120> once

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
pull a little farther it'll pull once

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.879 
pull a little farther it'll pull once
it's<00:03:37.329> all<00:03:37.629> the<00:03:37.780> way<00:03:37.810> back<00:03:38.049> it'll<00:03:38.379> pull<00:03:38.650> the

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
it's all the way back it'll pull the

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:41.580 
it's all the way back it'll pull the
rest<00:03:39.069> of<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.400> way<00:03:39.549> pull<00:03:40.329> this<00:03:40.720> middle<00:03:41.409> piece

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
rest of the way pull this middle piece

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.449 
rest of the way pull this middle piece
out<00:03:42.780> that<00:03:43.780> I<00:03:43.810> can<00:03:44.019> release<00:03:44.319> it<00:03:44.379> the<00:03:44.739> whole

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
out that I can release it the whole

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.580 
out that I can release it the whole
mechanism<00:03:46.139> will<00:03:47.139> drop<00:03:47.349> back<00:03:47.769> in<00:03:48.389> so<00:03:49.560> this<00:03:50.560> is

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
mechanism will drop back in so this is

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.199 
mechanism will drop back in so this is
just<00:03:50.919> my<00:03:51.129> half<00:03:51.370> problem<00:03:51.879> a<00:03:53.489> little<00:03:54.489> overview

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
just my half problem a little overview

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.140 
just my half problem a little overview
of<00:03:55.479> why<00:03:55.659> I'm<00:03:55.720> what<00:03:56.260> I<00:03:56.400> improved<00:03:57.400> upon<00:03:57.729> since

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
of why I'm what I improved upon since

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.699 
of why I'm what I improved upon since
last<00:03:58.359> time<00:03:58.659> which<00:03:59.440> is<00:03:59.650> mainly<00:03:59.919> just<00:04:01.199> the<00:04:02.199> strap

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
last time which is mainly just the strap

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.080 
last time which is mainly just the strap
which<00:04:03.220> is<00:04:03.430> can't<00:04:04.389> tell<00:04:04.569> its<00:04:04.720> nike<00:04:05.909> this<00:04:06.909> is<00:04:07.060> a

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
which is can't tell its nike this is a

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.330 
which is can't tell its nike this is a
armed<00:04:07.720> guard<00:04:08.109> from<00:04:08.500> when<00:04:08.620> I<00:04:08.680> played<00:04:09.129> football

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
armed guard from when I played football

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:16.050 
armed guard from when I played football
in<00:04:09.609> seventh<00:04:10.269> grade<00:04:10.359> and<00:04:12.090> then<00:04:13.090> a<00:04:13.419> belt<00:04:14.199> and<00:04:15.060> the

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
in seventh grade and then a belt and the

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.740 
in seventh grade and then a belt and the
belt<00:04:16.239> is<00:04:16.389> actually<00:04:16.780> just<00:04:17.019> I<00:04:17.530> taped<00:04:18.340> it<00:04:18.549> on<00:04:18.729> in<00:04:19.539> a

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
belt is actually just I taped it on in a

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.000 
belt is actually just I taped it on in a
little<00:04:20.680> cross<00:04:21.099> pattern<00:04:21.489> so<00:04:22.450> that<00:04:22.539> it<00:04:23.409> tapes<00:04:23.740> on

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
little cross pattern so that it tapes on

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.800 
little cross pattern so that it tapes on
there<00:04:24.310> and<00:04:24.550> then<00:04:24.760> it<00:04:25.139> goes<00:04:26.139> over

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
there and then it goes over

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.810 
there and then it goes over
section<00:04:27.290> because<00:04:27.800> I<00:04:28.070> tried<00:04:28.310> to<00:04:28.430> put<00:04:28.639> it<00:04:28.669> over

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
section because I tried to put it over

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.400 
section because I tried to put it over
this<00:04:29.060> section<00:04:29.450> it<00:04:29.570> would<00:04:29.690> be<00:04:29.810> holding<00:04:30.230> down

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
this section it would be holding down

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.670 
this section it would be holding down
the<00:04:30.650> blade<00:04:30.910> but<00:04:31.910> since<00:04:32.090> i<00:04:32.210> have<00:04:32.240> this<00:04:32.630> it'll<00:04:33.530> go

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
the blade but since i have this it'll go

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.600 
the blade but since i have this it'll go
across<00:04:33.980> and<00:04:34.430> that<00:04:35.000> is<00:04:35.180> a<00:04:35.419> method<00:04:35.960> for<00:04:36.169> the
