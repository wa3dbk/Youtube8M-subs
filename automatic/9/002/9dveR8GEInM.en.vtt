up<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.100> engine<00:01:26.369> we'll<00:01:27.360> see<00:01:27.570> how<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:27.990> fits

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
up to the engine we'll see how that fits

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:40.709 
up to the engine we'll see how that fits
into<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.950> boat<00:01:30.470> exactly<00:01:33.320> nice<00:01:34.320> little<00:01:34.560> clear

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:40.719 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:02:13.240 

so<00:02:10.750> full<00:02:11.750> pattern<00:02:12.019> that<00:02:12.500> represents<00:02:13.040> all<00:02:13.129> the

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
so full pattern that represents all the

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.750 
so full pattern that represents all the
LS<00:02:13.459> motor<00:02:13.730> bolt<00:02:14.599> patterns<00:02:15.519> the<00:02:16.519> crankshaft

LS motor bolt patterns the crankshaft
for<00:02:17.239> the<00:02:17.299> crankshaft<00:02:17.780> and<00:02:18.019> as<00:02:18.319> you<00:02:18.500> can<00:02:18.650> see

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
for the crankshaft and as you can see

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.600 
for the crankshaft and as you can see
the<00:02:19.549> original<00:02:20.410> coupler<00:02:21.410> does<00:02:22.129> not<00:02:22.310> have<00:02:22.489> the

the original coupler does not have the

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.449 
the original coupler does not have the
same<00:02:22.760> bolt<00:02:23.030> pattern<00:02:23.530> that<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.739> new<00:02:24.890> LS<00:02:25.220> motor

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
same bolt pattern that the new LS motor

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.390 
same bolt pattern that the new LS motor
would<00:02:25.670> integrate<00:02:26.650> or<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.799> eat<00:02:27.950> elect<00:02:28.190> and<00:02:28.370> the

would integrate or the eat elect and the
new<00:02:28.640> LS<00:02:28.910> motor<00:02:29.150> utilizes<00:02:29.780> so<00:02:32.440> instead<00:02:33.440> this

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829

application was for a 2001 VW Jetta I

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.760 
application was for a 2001 VW Jetta I
think<00:04:29.199> with<00:04:29.350> the<00:04:29.500> 3.8<00:04:30.460> v6<00:04:30.610> if<00:04:31.389> I<00:04:31.479> recall<00:04:31.660> it's<00:04:32.650> a

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
think with the 3.8 v6 if I recall it's a

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.159 
think with the 3.8 v6 if I recall it's a

bunch<00:05:26.470> of<00:05:26.620> wires<00:05:26.800> kind<00:05:27.099> of<00:05:27.160> randomly<00:05:27.520> they

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
bunch of wires kind of randomly they

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.460 
bunch of wires kind of randomly they
weren't<00:05:28.210> even<00:05:28.389> cocked<00:05:28.720> off<00:05:28.840> they're<00:05:29.080> just<00:05:29.229> cut

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
weren't even cocked off they're just cut

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.650 
weren't even cocked off they're just cut
and<00:05:29.740> electrical<00:05:30.639> taped<00:05:30.849> and<00:05:31.060> then<00:05:31.180> taped<00:05:31.479> up

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
and electrical taped and then taped up

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.620 
and electrical taped and then taped up
so<00:05:32.470> it's<00:05:32.590> kind<00:05:32.710> of<00:05:32.740> a<00:05:32.830> big<00:05:32.979> mess<00:05:33.190> going<00:05:33.250> on<00:05:33.669> and

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
so it's kind of a big mess going on and

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.180 
so it's kind of a big mess going on and
also<00:05:34.870> we<00:05:35.110> had<00:05:35.199> realized<00:05:35.500> the<00:05:35.680> warning<00:05:36.010> buzzer

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
also we had realized the warning buzzer

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.969 
also we had realized the warning buzzer
from<00:05:36.610> the<00:05:36.699> 16-pin<00:05:37.330> harness<00:05:37.360> to<00:05:37.900> the<00:05:37.949> tit<00:05:38.949> or

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
from the 16-pin harness to the tit or

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:41.040 
from the 16-pin harness to the tit or
nine<00:05:39.430> pin<00:05:39.639> harness<00:05:39.970> was<00:05:40.240> not<00:05:40.419> even<00:05:40.810> connected

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
nine pin harness was not even connected

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.529 
nine pin harness was not even connected
at<00:05:41.349> all<00:05:41.699> and<00:05:42.699> they<00:05:42.789> had<00:05:42.909> a<00:05:42.940> little<00:05:43.090> pigtail

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539 
at all and they had a little pigtail

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:45.029 
at all and they had a little pigtail
coming<00:05:43.840> out<00:05:43.990> and<00:05:44.139> that<00:05:44.349> pigtail<00:05:44.740> is<00:05:44.889> not

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 
coming out and that pigtail is not

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:46.350 
coming out and that pigtail is not
connected<00:05:45.400> to<00:05:45.430> anything<00:05:45.639> either<00:05:45.909> so<00:05:46.030> I<00:05:46.180> just

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
connected to anything either so I just

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.879 
connected to anything either so I just
removed<00:05:46.960> that<00:05:47.169> I'm<00:05:47.320> not<00:05:47.500> sure<00:05:47.620> what<00:05:47.770> it<00:05:47.830> was

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:47.889 
removed that I'm not sure what it was

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.159 
removed that I'm not sure what it was
even<00:05:48.159> for<00:05:48.370> they<00:05:48.639> just<00:05:48.669> had<00:05:48.970> had<00:05:49.630> it<00:05:49.720> electrical

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169 
even for they just had had it electrical

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:52.469 
even for they just had had it electrical
taped<00:05:50.380> in<00:05:50.530> there<00:05:50.710> for<00:05:50.860> some<00:05:51.010> reason<00:05:51.180> so<00:05:52.180> now

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
taped in there for some reason so now

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:53.760 
taped in there for some reason so now
the<00:05:52.539> buzzer<00:05:52.780> is<00:05:53.020> connected<00:05:53.440> through<00:05:53.560> this

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
the buzzer is connected through this

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.529 
the buzzer is connected through this
just<00:05:54.280> like<00:05:54.430> it<00:05:54.520> would<00:05:54.639> be<00:05:54.789> in<00:05:54.940> the<00:05:55.120> volvo<00:05:55.360> penta

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:55.539 
just like it would be in the volvo penta

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:58.080 
just like it would be in the volvo penta
harness<00:05:56.039> I<00:05:57.039> don't<00:05:57.550> have<00:05:57.639> this<00:05:57.729> all<00:05:57.909> blown

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
harness I don't have this all blown

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.950 
harness I don't have this all blown
apart<00:05:58.360> to<00:05:58.479> show<00:05:58.630> you<00:05:58.719> guys<00:05:58.870> but

apart to show you guys but

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.749 
apart to show you guys but
by<00:06:00.229> following<00:06:00.530> the<00:06:00.860> marine<00:06:01.070> power<00:06:01.250> wiring

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:01.759 
by following the marine power wiring

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:03.610 
by following the marine power wiring
diagrams<00:06:02.210> and<00:06:02.570> just<00:06:03.080> kind<00:06:03.229> of<00:06:03.259> looking<00:06:03.470> at

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
diagrams and just kind of looking at

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.409 
diagrams and just kind of looking at
connectors<00:06:04.070> like<00:06:04.190> this<00:06:04.340> you<00:06:04.490> can<00:06:04.639> pretty

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:05.419 
connectors like this you can pretty

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:09.210 
connectors like this you can pretty
easily<00:06:05.509> figure<00:06:05.960> it<00:06:06.169> out<00:06:06.580> this<00:06:07.580> wire<00:06:08.030> here<00:06:08.389> is<00:06:08.690> a

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
easily figure it out this wire here is a

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:14.379 
easily figure it out this wire here is a
10<00:06:10.220> amp<00:06:10.460> it's<00:06:10.850> fused<00:06:11.210> input<00:06:12.169> to<00:06:12.320> the<00:06:12.410> PCM<00:06:13.389> ECM

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:14.389 
10 amp it's fused input to the PCM ECM

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:16.270 
10 amp it's fused input to the PCM ECM
that<00:06:14.630> has<00:06:14.810> to<00:06:14.960> be<00:06:15.050> powered<00:06:15.440> at<00:06:15.560> all<00:06:15.650> times<00:06:15.949> just

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 
that has to be powered at all times just

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.749 
that has to be powered at all times just
connected<00:06:16.729> directly<00:06:16.910> to<00:06:17.090> your<00:06:17.300> battery<00:06:18.759> this

00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:19.759 
connected directly to your battery this

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:21.400 
connected directly to your battery this
here<00:06:20.000> is<00:06:20.090> basically<00:06:20.180> like<00:06:20.539> an<00:06:20.660> OPD<00:06:20.870> two-port

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.410 
here is basically like an OPD two-port

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.930 
here is basically like an OPD two-port
from<00:06:21.530> what<00:06:21.650> I<00:06:21.680> can<00:06:21.800> determine<00:06:21.919> it's<00:06:22.430> a<00:06:22.520> canvas

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:22.940 
from what I can determine it's a canvas

Eylau system whatever you want to call
it<00:06:26.330> and<00:06:26.570> I'm<00:06:26.930> actually<00:06:27.110> going<00:06:27.350> to<00:06:27.410> remove<00:06:27.710> this

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:27.979 
it and I'm actually going to remove this

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:30.040 
it and I'm actually going to remove this
connector<00:06:28.340> I<00:06:28.430> think<00:06:28.639> and<00:06:28.789> connect<00:06:29.060> a<00:06:29.210> regular

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
connector I think and connect a regular

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.900 
connector I think and connect a regular
open<00:06:30.199> ET<00:06:30.530> port<00:06:30.800> so<00:06:30.919> I<00:06:30.949> can<00:06:31.130> connect<00:06:31.370> HP<00:06:31.729> tuners

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:31.910 
open ET port so I can connect HP tuners

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.890 
open ET port so I can connect HP tuners
to<00:06:32.180> this<00:06:32.270> engine<00:06:32.630> and<00:06:33.500> here's<00:06:34.100> the<00:06:34.250> ECM<00:06:34.970> which

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
to this engine and here's the ECM which

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.110 
to this engine and here's the ECM which
I<00:06:36.199> thought<00:06:36.560> may<00:06:36.770> have<00:06:36.949> been<00:06:37.070> proprietary<00:06:37.970> at

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 
I thought may have been proprietary at

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.490 
I thought may have been proprietary at
first<00:06:38.330> and<00:06:38.600> then<00:06:38.690> I<00:06:38.720> realized<00:06:39.110> that<00:06:39.380> that's

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:39.500 
first and then I realized that that's

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.590 
first and then I realized that that's
printed<00:06:39.949> right<00:06:40.100> up<00:06:40.190> here<00:06:40.400> at<00:06:40.460> East<00:06:40.669> 78<00:06:41.210> so<00:06:41.449> it's

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 
printed right up here at East 78 so it's

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:47.080 
printed right up here at East 78 so it's
e<00:06:41.750> 78<00:06:42.289> GM<00:06:42.910> ECM<00:06:44.289> running<00:06:45.289> the<00:06:45.380> ls3<00:06:45.789> so<00:06:46.789> that's

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.090 
e 78 GM ECM running the ls3 so that's

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.600 
e 78 GM ECM running the ls3 so that's
pretty<00:06:47.660> straightforward

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.610 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.959 

too<00:06:51.180> much<00:06:51.360> that<00:06:51.990> sums<00:06:52.259> up<00:06:52.409> the<00:06:53.310> wiring<00:06:53.520> on<00:06:53.819> our

00:06:53.959 --> 00:06:53.969 
too much that sums up the wiring on our

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:59.240 
too much that sums up the wiring on our
