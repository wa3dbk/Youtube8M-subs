00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
won back on the next game so little part

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.399 
won back on the next game so little part
of<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.909> odds<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.270> see<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.570> are<00:01:45.690> twelve<00:01:46.080> point

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
of the odds to see you are twelve point

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.770 
of the odds to see you are twelve point
eight<00:01:46.500> six<00:01:46.799> know<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.640> format<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.479> ought<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.630> be

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
eight six know the format it ought to be

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.070 
eight six know the format it ought to be
two<00:01:49.020> decimals<00:01:49.409> but<00:01:50.060> so<00:01:51.060> basically<00:01:51.420> on<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.630> $10

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
two decimals but so basically on a $10

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.100 
two decimals but so basically on a $10
bet<00:01:52.290> after<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:53.280> fund<00:01:53.490> parlay<00:01:53.909> odds<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.960> can

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
bet after you fund parlay odds you can

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.990 
bet after you fund parlay odds you can
multiply<00:01:56.030> those<00:01:57.030> odds<00:01:57.330> by<00:01:58.260> the<00:01:58.729> amount<00:01:59.729> dating

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
multiply those odds by the amount dating

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.640 
multiply those odds by the amount dating
bet<00:02:00.180> in<00:02:00.659> order<00:02:00.900> to<00:02:00.960> find<00:02:01.140> your<00:02:01.260> potential

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
bet in order to find your potential

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:09.910 
bet in order to find your potential
payout<00:02:02.600> so<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:03.780> B<00:02:04.700> equals<00:02:05.810> ten<00:02:08.119> times<00:02:09.119> this

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
payout so this B equals ten times this

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.960 
payout so this B equals ten times this
so<00:02:10.920> one<00:02:11.009> hundred<00:02:11.069> twenty<00:02:11.519> eight<00:02:11.549> dollars

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
so one hundred twenty eight dollars

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.670 
so one hundred twenty eight dollars
right<00:02:12.180> there

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
right there

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:20.420 
right there
fifty<00:02:13.680> dollars

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:27.160 

one<00:02:21.430> of<00:02:21.610> these

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.820 

so<00:02:27.740> it<00:02:27.830> says<00:02:28.010> $120<00:02:28.940> and<00:02:29.120> 66<00:02:29.600> cents<00:02:29.990> for<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.350> $10

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
so it says $120 and 66 cents for the $10

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.200 
so it says $120 and 66 cents for the $10
bet<00:02:31.480> you'll<00:02:32.480> see<00:02:32.690> here<00:02:32.900> it's<00:02:33.070> $118<00:02:34.070> 57<00:02:34.730> that's

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
bet you'll see here it's $118 57 that's

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.370 
bet you'll see here it's $118 57 that's
because<00:02:35.570> the<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:36.560> win<00:02:36.770> is<00:02:37.700> 118<00:02:38.450> and<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:39.110> total

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
because the to win is 118 and the total

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.320 
because the to win is 118 and the total
stake<00:02:39.590> is<00:02:39.830> $10<00:02:40.220> so<00:02:40.600> equals<00:02:41.600> out<00:02:41.720> to<00:02:42.190> 128<00:02:43.330> 57

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
stake is $10 so equals out to 128 57

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.890 
stake is $10 so equals out to 128 57
overall<00:02:45.070> sometimes<00:02:46.070> the<00:02:46.660> pennies<00:02:47.660> will<00:02:47.810> be

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
overall sometimes the pennies will be

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.380 
overall sometimes the pennies will be
off<00:02:48.020> on<00:02:48.320> these<00:02:48.470> because<00:02:48.820> the<00:02:49.820> sportsbooks

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
off on these because the sportsbooks

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.110 
off on these because the sportsbooks
might<00:02:50.570> use<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.170> American<00:02:51.770> odd<00:02:51.890> format<00:02:52.370> to

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
might use the American odd format to

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.390 
might use the American odd format to
calculate<00:02:53.690> their<00:02:53.840> winnings<00:02:54.110> which<00:02:54.260> can<00:02:54.470> make

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
calculate their winnings which can make

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.850 
calculate their winnings which can make
these<00:02:55.670> decimals<00:02:56.150> like<00:02:56.330> the<00:02:56.630> decimal<00:02:57.230> actually

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
these decimals like the decimal actually

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.380 
these decimals like the decimal actually
goes<00:02:57.980> more<00:02:58.130> than<00:02:58.190> two<00:02:58.430> decimal<00:02:58.730> places<00:02:58.850> so<00:02:59.270> it

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
goes more than two decimal places so it

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.699 
goes more than two decimal places so it
can<00:02:59.680> change<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:01.180> final<00:03:02.180> payout<00:03:02.560> depending<00:03:03.560> on

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
can change the final payout depending on

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:11.590 
can change the final payout depending on
the<00:03:04.580> actual<00:03:05.560> full<00:03:06.560> odds<00:03:10.120> so<00:03:11.120> you<00:03:11.239> can<00:03:11.390> see<00:03:11.510> with
