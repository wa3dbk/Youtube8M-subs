00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
very often that you see that desire is

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.969 
very often that you see that desire is
like<00:01:11.280> don't<00:01:11.670> care<00:01:11.850> they<00:01:12.150> care<00:01:12.540> but<00:01:12.840> maybe<00:01:13.140> they

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
like don't care they care but maybe they

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.580 
like don't care they care but maybe they
also<00:01:14.159> wants<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.790> feel<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> bit<00:01:15.420> safe<00:01:15.750> but<00:01:16.320> my

also wants to feel a bit safe but my

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.460 
also wants to feel a bit safe but my
stuff<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.670> create<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.420> has<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.630> different

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
stuff that I create it has a different

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.490 
stuff that I create it has a different
perspective<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.759> my<00:01:20.939> vision<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.290> way

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
perspective of my vision and in a way

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.210 
perspective of my vision and in a way
has<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.100> functionality<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.720> also<00:01:25.560> like

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
has the functionality that I also like

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.850 
has the functionality that I also like
but<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.850> also<00:01:26.970> it's<00:01:27.720> not<00:01:27.869> like<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.200> most<00:01:28.350> sexy

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
but it also it's not like the most sexy

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.179 
but it also it's not like the most sexy
stuff<00:01:29.600> if<00:01:30.600> I'm<00:01:30.780> doing<00:01:31.020> costume<00:01:31.380> for<00:01:31.650> Oprah

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
stuff if I'm doing costume for Oprah

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.399 
stuff if I'm doing costume for Oprah
whatever<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.640> can<00:01:32.790> be<00:01:32.909> much<00:01:33.150> more<00:01:33.409> complicated

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
whatever it can be much more complicated

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.980 
whatever it can be much more complicated
but<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.979> also<00:01:35.430> has<00:01:35.640> another<00:01:35.909> functionality<00:01:36.780> I

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
but it also has another functionality I

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.840 
but it also has another functionality I
try<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.470> work<00:01:37.770> with<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.130> in<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.280> way<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.640> try<00:01:38.759> to

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
try to work with it in a way to try to

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.300 
try to work with it in a way to try to
work<00:01:39.150> with<00:01:39.360> other<00:01:39.600> new<00:01:39.990> methods<00:01:40.500> or<00:01:40.799> other

work with other new methods or other

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.149 
work with other new methods or other
processes<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.390> using<00:01:42.899> maybe<00:01:43.409> some<00:01:43.680> wood<00:01:43.920> work

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
processes of using maybe some wood work

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.340 
processes of using maybe some wood work
that<00:01:44.490> could<00:01:44.640> actually<00:01:44.850> go<00:01:45.689> into<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.110> paper

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
that could actually go into the paper

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.130 
that could actually go into the paper
cutting<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.920> how<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.280> build<00:01:48.149> architecture

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
cutting of how you build architecture

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.289 
cutting of how you build architecture
it's<00:01:49.680> like<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> 3d<00:01:50.310> architecture<00:01:50.880> for<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.119> body

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
it's like a 3d architecture for the body

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.850 
it's like a 3d architecture for the body
I<00:01:51.479> like<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.869> do<00:01:52.020> my<00:01:52.229> shows<00:01:52.560> definitely

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
I like to do my shows definitely

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.530 
I like to do my shows definitely
more<00:01:54.490> in<00:01:55.650> wider<00:01:56.650> perspective<00:01:57.430> hopefully<00:01:58.330> with

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
more in wider perspective hopefully with

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.230 
more in wider perspective hopefully with
more<00:01:58.810> layers<00:01:59.110> than<00:01:59.350> just<00:01:59.920> a<00:02:00.010> normal<00:02:00.400> cap<00:02:01.210> oh
