00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.630
 patch on the side with relief 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.850
 the truth is very handsome that we are going to 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:33.020

 that only have water, well, good 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.500
 the best is a little chore but I know 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.660

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.180

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.130
 of posing roles because it is very beautiful and 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:05.630
 of camouflage, what I'm going to do is 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:08.510
 a draw for that command and what I had 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.330
 said before is that the draw will I do 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.940

 she 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.840
 in yesterday's streaming it seems to me that 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.030
 yesterday it was yes and so you can see it and 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:43.190

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.170

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.580
 to insurance, sure you're going to like 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.860
 I remember everything I have to remember 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.290
 say but I remember when I did the 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.260
 bat draw 2004 there were many people 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:12.860
 it seriously and I mean there was 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:15.740
 many people that good so good a lot 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:19.580
 A lot of worth is worth as many are not worth ok 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.930
 but there were people that good because we had 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.480
 created because he had not touched the 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.390
 man battlefield you have to think that 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:29.570
 you are a lot then you can touch 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:31.820
 touches whoever it is or is this is not 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.250
 like me that is a rare lottery that there 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.500
 out there and the whole story not here to touch 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:40.820
 touch the only thing of clear 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:43.340
 enough people then clear is 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.490
 difficult to touch you is not clear no 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.220
 but well, surely this time 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:52.400
 ok when I make the video that you will be 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:55.340
 everyone happy and then say in the 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.990
 winning person do not say abel I shit 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.970
 in the host because this is bullshit 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.730
 because it 's that cloth because I do not know what 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.220
 because this is not done this way or it is not 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:06.740
 we are gay because it is something that 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:10.100
 I give free, good and good, it's a 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.050
 draw no and nothing happens either to me 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.330
 I never play the lottery and I will go 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.410
 to state and to put them to me I know a 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:20.210
 pepinazo because all to see us 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:23.660
 you understand me, not me, what I 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:26.240
 obviously I want that is already 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:29.690
 have a channel not that good as some 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.270
 times then on the subject of this 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.370
 meaning then it can benefit you and not 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.410
 so then I think of you I to 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.470
 I want a command because I already have one 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.790
 What I do is sort out what 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.860
 it may have some of you that a 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.460
 they need it the same as the 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.130
 game 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:49.009
 from the fil ree 4 or at least that's what 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:51.770
 I think then that's why I 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:55.340
 I imagine you remember it we see that 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:57.590
 because people would put on but we 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.590
 were there saying goes that 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.210
 it has not touched me that such insulting 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.759
 to me the whole story and what is it 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.009
 one thing that I do for you that 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:09.319
 Well, that's what I tell you, although 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:11.750
 the draws easily what could 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:13.460
 do is catch me those who give less I know 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.789
 I give my cousin a gift, for example, 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:20.000
 have equipment or be me that I know or I sell it 

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:22.190
 or I understand that is not what I want 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.830
 that you understand me and well then nothing 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:27.650
 the game ends that there are almost 50 casualties 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:30.440
 47 or you get a good game inside that 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.810
 It's because they did not move all the time 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.699
 of the house is good the team nothing more 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.229
 that one of the entire team was left 

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:38.630
 there you have it the first one that has been 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:41.030
 of the other team of the opposing team 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.770
 and well, kids, I hope that 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.690
 have a good week that arrives 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.310
 fast the weekend I hope that you 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:49.400
 I liked the news that the draw 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.880
 Well, a damn and I already pointed out tomorrow and 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.740
