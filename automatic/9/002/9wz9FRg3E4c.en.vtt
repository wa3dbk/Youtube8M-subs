 Christians can not live without faith and 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.629

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.379

 in 1980 since then it has grown to more 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.600
 of 120 thousand members he attributes this 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.970
 success to prayer and commitment 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.560
 unbreakable to the historical truths 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.689
 Christian 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.310
 the power of the church comes from the 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:20.470
 bible and the tradition that we inherited 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.180
 of the ancestors we keep those 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.720
 values ​​the world will follow us and we can 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.300
 route to this generation today the 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.729

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.800
 of the cults in the early morning 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:36.370
 Millán Zhang in the Presbyterian Church 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:39.250

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.630
 churches and supports more than 500 missionaries 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.670
 in 63 countries 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.950
 the church also supports a home for 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.479
 children a hospital and other ministries 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.369
 humanitarian 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.380
 the pastor who says that prayer is 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.409
 what has made all this possible 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.570
 ministry and he and his church believe that 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.710
 if they ask him, God will do the same for 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.600
 his brothers in North Korea and Korea 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.759
 the north is in despair but 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.740
 same time is hopeful in Christ 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.899
 Isaiah 9 says the people who walked in 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.550
 darkness saw great light those who dwelt 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.170
 in the shadow of death in light 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.030
 He shined on them 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.099
 I think the gospel should go to them 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.390
 we need prayer to save 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.069
 north korea 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.590
 God will work on them through 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.390
 our prayer he must rid the earth 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.110
 and do the miracle of opening the way in the 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.840
 desert to unify the north and the south 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:32.230
 Ivan Omar North Korea and South Korea have 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.450
 been separated for 65 years from 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.459
 that the South Korean armistice was signed 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.519
 it has become a modern state with 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.370
 economic boom north korea is one of 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.750
 the most isolated nations in the world 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.329
 governed by a dictatorial family 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.560
 repressing people and threatens to 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:50.650
 world with a holocaust 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.569
 or create here on the northern border and 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.819
 from the south people get to see the 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:58.560
 hermit kingdom and leave messages to their 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.560
 families that are on the other side 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:04.159
 dear mom and dad please keep 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.760
 sem peace in the sky his son one soul 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:06.760
 was here 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.200
 there are also several messages that say 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.820
 I hope that Korea from the south and the north will 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.300
 get back together as soon as possible 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.880
 for andréi the best is the bank made in 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.090
 church millán sign people pray 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.800
 passionately for a reunification 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.350
 including a group of refugees 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.570
 North Koreans who now lives in the south to 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.970
 Despite being free, it's hard to escape 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.730
 from the control of a totalitarian regime to 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.590
 another side of the border 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.450
 actually the Korean deserters the 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.820
 north have a trauma by the regime of 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.160
 your country we often have nightmares of 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.140
 be taken north each time when I 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.420
 I wake up in the morning a hundred freedom 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.700
 but it hurts me to think about my family that 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.950
 he continues to live in danger and without freedom 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.990
 these refugees came to Christ 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.270
 after escaping from the north but they 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.280
 they saw first-hand the persecution of 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.410
 Christians by the government 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.600
 that will cross the Christians in the north 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.490
 They will be selected for torture is 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.860
 distinguished by their knees because they 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.350
 they had indicated to pray the Christians 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.530
 they took them to another side like fields 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.690
 of concentration even the church in Korea 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.670
 North continues to grow 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.470
 This is because some North Koreans 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.269
 visit Chinese are converted to 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.030
 Christianity by missionaries in the 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.790
 border despite the risk of jail or 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.820
 death some return to preach the 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.680
 gospel 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.710
 after they return they evangelize others 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.230
 11 in the basement and then these too 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.180
 convert their families or friends from 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.790
 this way the gospel is being 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.190
 spread secretly if this is known 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.050
 the whole family would be killed 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:48.510
 then the churches meet in a 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.510
 basement in a secret but active way 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.050
 meanwhile those who have found a 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.650
 shelter in the south clamor for their 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.540
 northern families 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.790
 where I really pray to god so that 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.180
 take your gospel to the north so that 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:06.100
 people there can live decently 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.320
 enjoying their freedom convinced 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.480
 that these fervent prayers will be 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.200
 of great benefit to many 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.200
 North Koreans
