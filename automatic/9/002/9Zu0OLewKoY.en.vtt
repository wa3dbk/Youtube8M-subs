00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
guess it wasn't good for my texture here

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.290 
guess it wasn't good for my texture here
because<00:05:26.450> it<00:05:27.440> made<00:05:27.770> it<00:05:27.890> hard<00:05:28.190> and<00:05:28.790> it's<00:05:28.970> made<00:05:29.180> it

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
because it made it hard and it's made it

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.880 
because it made it hard and it's made it
kind<00:05:29.510> of<00:05:29.540> fuzzy<00:05:29.780> my<00:05:30.110> curls<00:05:30.440> didn't<00:05:30.680> turn<00:05:30.860> out

as<00:05:31.310> curly<00:05:32.240> as<00:05:32.270> they<00:05:32.510> usually<00:05:32.720> do<00:05:33.080> so<00:05:33.440> I'll

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
as curly as they usually do so I'll

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.710
