00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.400 
to today's youtube video and this is
rupert<00:00:06.029> software<00:00:06.450> well<00:00:06.839> my<00:00:06.990> name<00:00:07.170> is<00:00:07.259> actually

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
rupert software well my name is actually

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.009 
rupert software well my name is actually
rupert<00:00:07.980> but<00:00:08.220> my<00:00:08.400> company<00:00:09.210> that's<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.660> one-man

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
rupert but my company that's a one-man

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.830 
rupert but my company that's a one-man
company<00:00:10.469> is<00:00:10.620> rupert<00:00:10.920> software<00:00:11.309> anyway<00:00:11.880> so

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
company is rupert software anyway so

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.079 
company is rupert software anyway so
that's<00:00:13.019> that<00:00:13.639> another<00:00:14.639> thing<00:00:14.790> i've<00:00:14.910> got<00:00:15.030> to

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
that's that another thing i've got to

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.340 
that's that another thing i've got to
get<00:00:15.210> out<00:00:15.330> of<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.450> way<00:00:15.570> is<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.900> fact<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.170> this

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
get out of the way is the fact that this

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.650 
get out of the way is the fact that this
is<00:00:16.470> my<00:00:16.590> first<00:00:16.920> video<00:00:17.250> so<00:00:17.670> you've<00:00:18.510> probably

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
is my first video so you've probably

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.429 
is my first video so you've probably
noticed<00:00:19.020> already<00:00:20.240> so<00:00:21.240> please<00:00:21.330> don't<00:00:21.779> blame<00:00:22.109> me

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
noticed already so please don't blame me

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.080 
noticed already so please don't blame me
if<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.650> make<00:00:22.830> any<00:00:22.920> mistakes<00:00:23.010> well<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:23.910> is<00:00:23.970> my

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
if I make any mistakes well it is my

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.179 
if I make any mistakes well it is my
fault<00:00:24.150> but<00:00:24.600> it's<00:00:24.840> just<00:00:25.260> I'm<00:00:25.529> not<00:00:25.680> used<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:26.099> this

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
fault but it's just I'm not used to this

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.519 
fault but it's just I'm not used to this
anyway<00:00:26.970> so<00:00:27.029> what<00:00:27.990> I'm<00:00:28.050> gonna<00:00:28.140> be<00:00:28.230> doing<00:00:28.289> today

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
anyway so what I'm gonna be doing today

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.650 
anyway so what I'm gonna be doing today
is<00:00:28.890> I'm<00:00:29.369> gonna<00:00:29.519> be<00:00:29.640> demonstrating<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.359> piece<00:00:30.539> of

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
is I'm gonna be demonstrating a piece of

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.470 
is I'm gonna be demonstrating a piece of
software<00:00:30.960> I've<00:00:31.170> written<00:00:31.439> now<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.790> called

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
software I've written now this is called

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.780 
software I've written now this is called
a<00:00:33.930> cent<00:00:34.890> decent<00:00:35.280> calculator<00:00:36.180> version<00:00:36.750> 1.2

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
a cent decent calculator version 1.2

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.580 
a cent decent calculator version 1.2
this<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.940> for<00:00:39.090> all<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.329> flight<00:00:39.600> summers<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.500> if

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
this is for all you flight summers so if

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.979 
this is for all you flight summers so if
you're<00:00:40.710> not<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.860> flight<00:00:41.040> simulator<00:00:41.540> person<00:00:42.540> and

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
you're not a flight simulator person and

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.690 
you're not a flight simulator person and
you<00:00:43.110> probably<00:00:43.410> aren't<00:00:43.590> on<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.890> right<00:00:44.070> video

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
you probably aren't on the right video

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.850 
you probably aren't on the right video
anyway<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.450> this<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.780> four<00:00:45.930> FS<00:00:46.050> X<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.500> X<00:00:46.620> plane

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
anyway so this is four FS X and X plane

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.740 
anyway so this is four FS X and X plane
and<00:00:47.100> all<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.280> other<00:00:47.399> flight<00:00:47.610> simulators<00:00:48.120> oh<00:00:48.300> I

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
and all the other flight simulators oh I

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.810 
and all the other flight simulators oh I
prefer<00:00:49.050> Flight<00:00:49.590> Simulator<00:00:49.770> X<00:00:50.100> myself<00:00:50.610> it's

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
prefer Flight Simulator X myself it's

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.610 
prefer Flight Simulator X myself it's
just<00:00:51.000> better<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.930> if<00:00:52.020> you've<00:00:52.140> ever<00:00:52.230> if<00:00:52.500> you

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
just better and if you've ever if you

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.100 
just better and if you've ever if you
have<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:53.100> few<00:00:53.520> three<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:53.820> don't<00:00:54.030> know<00:00:54.300> how

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
have a few three I don't know how

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.139 
have a few three I don't know how
realistic<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.770> physics<00:00:56.129> on<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:56.879> I'm<00:00:57.030> not

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
realistic the physics on that so I'm not

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.939 
realistic the physics on that so I'm not
taking<00:00:57.840> sure<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.289> will<00:00:58.379> work<00:00:58.440> for<00:00:58.800> that

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
taking sure this will work for that

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.310 
taking sure this will work for that
anyway<00:00:59.609> so<00:01:00.140> what<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.260> does<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.859> calculates

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
anyway so what it does is it calculates

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.810 
anyway so what it does is it calculates
when<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.439> need<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.619> just<00:01:04.739> start<00:01:05.129> when<00:01:05.729> you

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
when you need to just start when you

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.160 
when you need to just start when you
need<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.060> start<00:01:06.299> your<00:01:06.390> descent<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:06.960> if<00:01:07.020> you're

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
need to start your descent so if you're

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.039 
need to start your descent so if you're
at<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> thirty<00:01:07.500> three<00:01:07.740> thousand<00:01:08.010> feet<00:01:08.810> and<00:01:09.810> then

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
at a thirty three thousand feet and then

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.090 
at a thirty three thousand feet and then
you<00:01:10.140> want<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.350> go<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.500> two<00:01:10.710> thousand<00:01:11.040> five

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
you want to go to two thousand five

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.870 
you want to go to two thousand five
hundred<00:01:11.340> feet<00:01:12.920> and<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.040> can<00:01:14.310> calculate

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
hundred feet and you can calculate

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.090 
hundred feet and you can calculate
distance<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.140> will<00:01:16.470> tell<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.830> when<00:01:16.979> you

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
distance and that will tell you when you

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.440 
distance and that will tell you when you
need<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.280> start<00:01:17.549> your<00:01:17.670> descent<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.240> if<00:01:18.330> you're

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
need to start your descent so if you're

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.810 
need to start your descent so if you're
ninety<00:01:18.810> one<00:01:18.960> point<00:01:19.140> five<00:01:19.350> miles<00:01:19.590> away<00:01:19.820> from

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
ninety one point five miles away from

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.130 
ninety one point five miles away from
the<00:01:21.000> airport<00:01:21.119> that's<00:01:21.540> when<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.900> need<00:01:22.020> to

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
the airport that's when you need to

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.140 
the airport that's when you need to
start<00:01:22.350> your<00:01:22.409> descent<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:23.100> that's<00:01:23.939> how<00:01:24.090> that

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
start your descent so that's how that

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.730 
start your descent so that's how that
works<00:01:24.270> pretty<00:01:24.930> simple<00:01:25.259> if<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.409> don't<00:01:25.590> know

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
works pretty simple if you don't know

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.700 
works pretty simple if you don't know
about<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.869> these<00:01:27.869> are<00:01:27.990> not<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.229> right<00:01:28.380> video

need to be able to go down at Wright
descent<00:01:43.590> right<00:01:43.770> or<00:01:43.950> else<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.250> just<00:01:44.369> won't<00:01:44.610> work

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
descent right or else it just won't work

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:48.170 
descent right or else it just won't work
now<00:01:46.049> if<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.159> enter<00:01:47.399> your<00:01:47.430> ground<00:01:47.759> speed<00:01:47.970> this

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
now if you enter your ground speed this

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.740 
now if you enter your ground speed this
is<00:01:48.240> not<00:01:48.540> your<00:01:48.920> air<00:01:49.920> speed<00:01:50.399> this<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.360> ground

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
is not your air speed this is ground

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.889 
is not your air speed this is ground
speed<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.140> very<00:01:52.320> different<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:53.149> have<00:01:54.149> 440

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
speed it's very different to have 440

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.560 
speed it's very different to have 440
and<00:01:55.049> of<00:01:55.170> boings<00:01:55.500> from<00:01:55.680> 37<00:01:56.149> so<00:01:57.149> calculate

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
and of boings from 37 so calculate

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.420 
and of boings from 37 so calculate
descent<00:01:57.899> rate<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.710> will<00:01:58.799> cancel<00:01:58.860> up

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
descent rate and that will cancel up

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.359 
descent rate and that will cancel up
calculate<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.149> for<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.540> there<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.369> that's

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
calculate that for you there and that's

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.310 
calculate that for you there and that's
how<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.640> need<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:03.149> speed<00:02:03.780> at<00:02:03.899> which<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.200> need

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
how you need a speed at which you need

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.889 
how you need a speed at which you need
to<00:02:04.469> descend<00:02:04.799> no<00:02:05.490> not<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.729> speed<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.240> descent

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
to descend no not the speed the descent

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.800 
to descend no not the speed the descent
rate<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.160> that's<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:09.569> that's

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
rate and so that's that so that's

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.140 
rate and so that's that so that's
basically<00:02:10.229> all<00:02:10.619> about<00:02:11.370> this<00:02:11.489> program<00:02:11.760> except

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
basically all about this program except

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.790 
basically all about this program except
another<00:02:12.330> feature<00:02:12.720> which<00:02:13.020> is<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.500> can

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
another feature which is you can

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.350 
another feature which is you can
coppy<00:02:14.990> like<00:02:15.990> that<00:02:16.170> copy<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.740> number<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.400> if

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
coppy like that copy the number and if

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
coppy like that copy the number and if
we<00:02:18.480> open<00:02:18.780> let's<00:02:18.960> say<00:02:19.140> notepad<00:02:19.710> we<00:02:20.520> can<00:02:20.730> then

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
we open let's say notepad we can then

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.040 
we open let's say notepad we can then
paste<00:02:22.380> that<00:02:22.860> number<00:02:23.580> in<00:02:23.700> there<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:24.840> that's

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
paste that number in there and that's

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.370 
paste that number in there and that's
the<00:02:25.140> same<00:02:25.350> for<00:02:25.410> all<00:02:25.650> of<00:02:25.740> these<00:02:26.070> numbers<00:02:27.380> so

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
the same for all of these numbers so

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.560 
the same for all of these numbers so
that's<00:02:28.620> basically<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.610> for<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.820> program<00:02:30.270> it's

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
that's basically it for the program it's

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.930 
that's basically it for the program it's
very<00:02:31.140> easy<00:02:31.350> to<00:02:31.470> use<00:02:31.620> very<00:02:32.580> self-explanatory

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
very easy to use very self-explanatory

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.660 
very easy to use very self-explanatory
