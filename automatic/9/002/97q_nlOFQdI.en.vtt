00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:10.230
 hello good today I bring you the sigma 28 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.570
 105 spherical 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.360
 and good to tell you that I 'm not going to make a 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:20.009
 a complete review since this is not 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.950
 You can be used in quotes will ride 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:25.650
 in modern cameras 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.170
 and now I will explain why but good 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.060
 As you can see, this has the parasol 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.509
 parasol of the sigma this then it is such 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.969
 that would be that way 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.769
 so it's very cool but well that 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:41.269
 let's remove more than anything has it 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:42.950
 taught by simple curiosity the lid and 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:45.470
 the lid 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.990
 well because it can not be used in some 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.650
 cameras to take pictures 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:53.570
 for example to take videos 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.910
 basically within all 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.650
 objectives there is a kind of drivers 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.590
 with software 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:05.120
 and that helps the camera can 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.840
 understand and in the ancient signs 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.690
 the driver is not the software for 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.390
 the modern canon cameras you will have to 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.130
 mount the goal to sigma and I'll 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.710
 would update 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.259
 but in any case they are objectives that 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.259
 can be used both here to kill 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:26.659
 little older as I'm talking about 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.119
 that for example I have a 700 of but 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.380
 older cameras I could not say 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.880
 exactly what is 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.969
 analog cameras 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.549
 and also for video this goal comes 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:42.759
 very good for video especially to me that 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.229
 is for the use that I would give it would be 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.509
 basically to live since you can 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.420
 ride and it would not give us error if 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.360
 we mount and shoot will give us error 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.729
 01 is to say that the camera does not find out 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.110
 very good of what is happening but 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:04.560
 good the subject part I'm going to teach 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.560
 so you can see how it is 28 105 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.660
 the goal would be so nearly extended 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.890
 well that would be long approach where 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:19.140
 these 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.140
 he taught us this would be to focus it 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.180
 there is little travel that I like since 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.720
 you do not have to be thinking about the 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.750
 objective to focus 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.730
 let's put little one 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.060
 and this is the manuel auto-focus button 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.060
 own 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.230
 how was it done 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.420
 you have that it is simple the number of 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.420
 series 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.280
 and little spherical I'll teach 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.280
 in front 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:56.670
 of 72 millimeters between 284 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.909
 and basically that's why I have it 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.519
 because it 's a boss 28 has an entrance 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:04.889
 of incredibly good light and if you go to 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.019
 make video because you will need a lot 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:09.569
 light so you get better quality 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:13.879
 video and good nothing metallic ring 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.879
 and a little more 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.170
 so you can see how it is 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.420
 and well that 's the objective what I'm going to 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.000
 do is mount it in the camera and we're going to 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.530
 record a tad with him so you can see 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.950
 the qualities that you have that are very 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.950
 good 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.920
 As you can see we have assembled we will 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.120
 do some tests we are going to blur 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:48.159
 the 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.159
 and now for example let's focus on 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.670
 to the objective 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.500
 I do not know if better now to the computer 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.300
 again to the objective 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.190
 so you can see that it focuses perfectly 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.770
 works perfectly worth in video 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.000
 we are recording with him in photography 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.890
 error but in video it works 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.900
 you see perfectly that the qualities are 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.290
 very good approaches are very fast 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.720
 let's focus again on the computer 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.270
 As you can see, they are practically instantaneous 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:28.250
 and the video quality you see is very 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.250
 good let's try to focus a manual 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.449
 if the hand is not focused but I do not think 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.169
 you see that the qualities are very good 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.169
 they are very good 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.320
 and you see that with the manual approach that 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.480
 is what I told you that I love 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.390
 focus on the manual because I always like 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.760
 that we focus much faster though 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.400
 as the goal is this, almost the 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:54.169
 speed is the same as that of the target 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.389
 but I'm going to dismantle it 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:05:00.650
 Before dismantling it, I will show you a 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:04.720
 little how is the zoom that is that would be in 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.070
 28 and now let's put it on 105 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.510
 the approach also works 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.550
 perfectly is to say that it continues 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.180
 focusing perfectly we're going to 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:15.180
 end to see the speed 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.180
 automatic 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:24.290
 As you can see, it is super fast, it focuses great 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.290
 let's lower it 28 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.430
 and well the truth is very well 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.920
 qualities are 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.110
 they are very good and how we have that 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:38.920
 little mistake, they are cheaper 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:40.409
 the objectives but as I told you to be 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.199
 28 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:45.649
 we have a goal 28 as we have this 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:50.069
 problem that gives us error in photography 

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:52.860
 They are very cheap so 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:55.319
 want to buy one for video are more 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:58.080
 what a great addition to being the spherical 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:06:01.949
 So we have an angle of vision more 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:04.199
 big apart from having then a 28 105 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:06.980
 which video is always very good 

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:09.230
 to get certain types of video 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.820
 so I do not expect anything that has served you 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:14.050
 of help and that you subscribe to my channel 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.050
 a greeting
