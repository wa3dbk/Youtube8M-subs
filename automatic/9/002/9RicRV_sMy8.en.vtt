fairly<00:04:41.629> nice<00:04:41.990> it's<00:04:42.469> kind<00:04:42.740> of<00:04:42.830> short<00:04:43.039> it<00:04:43.249> would

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
fairly nice it's kind of short it would

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.709 
fairly nice it's kind of short it would
have<00:04:43.669> been<00:04:43.729> nice<00:04:43.909> if<00:04:43.939> it<00:04:44.180> was<00:04:44.270> a<00:04:44.330> little<00:04:44.539> bit

00:04:44.709 --> 00:04:44.719 
have been nice if it was a little bit

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:47.409 
have been nice if it was a little bit
longer<00:04:44.990> not<00:04:45.619> that<00:04:45.830> dr.<00:04:46.369> fate<00:04:46.550> has<00:04:46.819> a<00:04:46.849> hugely

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
longer not that dr. fate has a hugely

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.719 
longer not that dr. fate has a hugely
long<00:04:47.719> case<00:04:48.319> and<00:04:48.619> this<00:04:49.039> would<00:04:49.279> have<00:04:49.369> been<00:04:49.399> cool

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
long case and this would have been cool

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.109 
long case and this would have been cool
I<00:04:50.539> think<00:04:51.199> a<00:04:51.589> lot<00:04:51.710> of<00:04:51.979> times<00:04:52.279> you<00:04:52.399> see<00:04:52.550> dr.<00:04:52.909> fate

00:04:53.109 --> 00:04:53.119 
I think a lot of times you see dr. fate

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:54.639 
I think a lot of times you see dr. fate
like<00:04:53.330> that<00:04:53.539> way<00:04:53.719> and<00:04:53.779> have<00:04:53.960> escaped<00:04:54.349> draped

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:54.649 
like that way and have escaped draped

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:56.980 
like that way and have escaped draped
over<00:04:54.830> him<00:04:55.219> and<00:04:55.520> kind<00:04:55.909> of<00:04:56.119> cover<00:04:56.419> up<00:04:56.569> his<00:04:56.719> body

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
over him and kind of cover up his body

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.269 
over him and kind of cover up his body
but<00:04:57.770> whatever<00:04:59.379> on<00:05:00.379> a<00:05:00.439> hold<00:05:00.800> the<00:05:00.889> figure<00:05:01.159> it's

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:01.279 
but whatever on a hold the figure it's

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:04.389 
but whatever on a hold the figure it's
tough<00:05:01.460> it's<00:05:02.119> an<00:05:02.300> okay<00:05:02.629> figure<00:05:03.110> I'm<00:05:04.099> a<00:05:04.369> little

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:04.399 
tough it's an okay figure I'm a little

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:06.670 
tough it's an okay figure I'm a little
disappointed<00:05:04.909> by<00:05:05.449> it<00:05:05.479> maybe<00:05:06.110> I<00:05:06.229> need<00:05:06.319> to<00:05:06.499> get

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
disappointed by it maybe I need to get

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.409 
disappointed by it maybe I need to get
the<00:05:06.800> modern<00:05:07.099> version<00:05:07.129> to<00:05:07.459> see<00:05:07.639> how<00:05:07.789> that<00:05:08.029> is<00:05:08.059> I

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
the modern version to see how that is I

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:11.290 
the modern version to see how that is I

but<00:05:14.809> that's<00:05:14.990> something<00:05:15.319> just<00:05:15.770> feel<00:05:16.189> off<00:05:16.430> about

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:16.849 
but that's something just feel off about

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:18.760 
but that's something just feel off about
it<00:05:17.089> maybe<00:05:17.659> you<00:05:17.839> could<00:05:18.050> have<00:05:18.169> had<00:05:18.379> a<00:05:18.409> little<00:05:18.619> bit

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
it maybe you could have had a little bit

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.339 
it maybe you could have had a little bit
more<00:05:19.039> pizzazz<00:05:19.369> or<00:05:19.909> detail<00:05:20.330> to<00:05:20.599> it<00:05:20.719> another

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
more pizzazz or detail to it another

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:23.799 
more pizzazz or detail to it another
thing<00:05:21.499> is<00:05:21.619> a<00:05:21.649> bad<00:05:21.889> figures<00:05:22.459> by<00:05:22.969> far<00:05:23.330> not<00:05:23.360> it's

00:05:23.799 --> 00:05:23.809 
thing is a bad figures by far not it's

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:25.510 
thing is a bad figures by far not it's
definitely<00:05:24.199> more<00:05:24.379> good<00:05:24.649> than<00:05:24.680> bad<00:05:25.069> it's

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
definitely more good than bad it's

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.399 
definitely more good than bad it's
definitely<00:05:26.119> a<00:05:26.389> nice<00:05:26.569> figure<00:05:26.839> if<00:05:27.080> I<00:05:27.199> had<00:05:27.319> to

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:27.409 
definitely a nice figure if I had to

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:28.659 
definitely a nice figure if I had to
give<00:05:27.559> it<00:05:27.649> ready<00:05:27.919> it<00:05:28.099> would<00:05:28.219> definitely<00:05:28.399> be<00:05:28.610> a

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
give it ready it would definitely be a

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.730 
give it ready it would definitely be a
solid<00:05:28.999> seven<00:05:29.449> but<00:05:30.080> it's<00:05:30.169> nothing<00:05:30.319> spectacular

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
solid seven but it's nothing spectacular

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.339 
solid seven but it's nothing spectacular
it<00:05:31.369> doesn't<00:05:31.729> really<00:05:31.909> stand<00:05:32.270> out<00:05:32.539> I<00:05:32.809> think<00:05:33.199> one

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:33.349 
it doesn't really stand out I think one

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:34.749 
it doesn't really stand out I think one
of<00:05:33.379> the<00:05:33.529> great<00:05:33.680> things<00:05:33.830> about<00:05:34.099> this<00:05:34.459> big<00:05:34.639> in

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:34.759 
of the great things about this big in

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:36.579 
of the great things about this big in
the<00:05:34.879> thing<00:05:35.089> that<00:05:35.270> saves<00:05:35.539> it<00:05:35.749> it's<00:05:36.020> because<00:05:36.289> it

00:05:36.579 --> 00:05:36.589 
the thing that saves it it's because it

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:39.009 
the thing that saves it it's because it
is<00:05:36.770> dr.<00:05:37.219> fated<00:05:37.550> the<00:05:37.610> closet<00:05:38.059> character<00:05:38.599> is<00:05:38.930> a

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:39.019 
is dr. fated the closet character is a

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:40.929 
is dr. fated the closet character is a
very<00:05:39.229> well-known<00:05:39.469> character<00:05:40.309> and<00:05:40.639> it's<00:05:40.879> a

00:05:40.929 --> 00:05:40.939 
very well-known character and it's a

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:42.969 
very well-known character and it's a
very<00:05:40.969> loved<00:05:41.479> the<00:05:41.659> character<00:05:42.110> so<00:05:42.349> I<00:05:42.559> think<00:05:42.680> that

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:42.979 
very loved the character so I think that

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:45.309 
very loved the character so I think that
along<00:05:43.490> with<00:05:43.519> the<00:05:43.699> doctor<00:05:44.120> fate<00:05:44.330> look<00:05:44.659> save

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:45.319 
along with the doctor fate look save

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:47.320 
along with the doctor fate look save
this<00:05:45.529> figure<00:05:45.740> but<00:05:46.339> if<00:05:46.399> it<00:05:46.519> wasn't<00:05:46.849> dr.<00:05:47.029> fate

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
this figure but if it wasn't dr. fate

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.119 
this figure but if it wasn't dr. fate
and<00:05:47.599> all<00:05:47.689> the<00:05:47.839> detailing<00:05:48.379> and<00:05:48.740> the<00:05:48.800> molds

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:49.129 
and all the detailing and the molds

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:51.070 
and all the detailing and the molds
itself<00:05:49.219> was<00:05:49.580> on<00:05:49.729> another<00:05:49.819> figure<00:05:50.209> I<00:05:50.509> think<00:05:50.990> it

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
itself was on another figure I think it

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.749 
itself was on another figure I think it
would<00:05:51.199> be<00:05:51.229> less<00:05:51.649> appealing<00:05:52.099> than<00:05:52.309> what<00:05:52.580> it<00:05:52.729> is

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:52.759 
would be less appealing than what it is

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:55.970 
would be less appealing than what it is
the<00:05:53.419> figure<00:05:53.689> itself<00:05:53.839> is<00:05:54.319> pretty<00:05:54.529> good

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:55.980 
the figure itself is pretty good

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.460 
the figure itself is pretty good
but<00:05:56.190> it's<00:05:56.400> not<00:05:56.460> fantastic<00:05:57.180> you<00:05:57.900> can<00:05:58.080> put<00:05:58.350> them

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 
but it's not fantastic you can put them

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.280 
but it's not fantastic you can put them
into<00:05:58.620> some<00:05:58.890> nice<00:05:59.070> poses<00:05:59.640> the<00:06:00.120> accessory<00:06:01.050> there

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:01.290 
into some nice poses the accessory there

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.680 
into some nice poses the accessory there
with<00:06:01.500> his<00:06:01.680> magic<00:06:02.130> is<00:06:02.310> pretty<00:06:02.670> nice<00:06:02.850> I<00:06:03.180> do<00:06:03.240> like

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
with his magic is pretty nice I do like

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.960 
with his magic is pretty nice I do like
that<00:06:03.960> but<00:06:04.620> on<00:06:04.800> a<00:06:04.830> whole<00:06:05.100> the<00:06:05.280> figure<00:06:05.580> is<00:06:05.700> dis

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
that but on a whole the figure is dis

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.150 
that but on a whole the figure is dis
okay<00:06:06.480> at<00:06:06.630> fact<00:06:06.960> I<00:06:07.200> think<00:06:07.560> people<00:06:07.860> aren't<00:06:08.040> going

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160
