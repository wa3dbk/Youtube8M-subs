you have to pretty much just fry it you

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.290 
you have to pretty much just fry it you
wanted<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.380> keep<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.649> to<00:01:19.800> say<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:19.979> way<00:01:20.300> since

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
wanted to keep it to say that way since

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.200 
wanted to keep it to say that way since
my<00:01:21.539> thing<00:01:22.100> and<00:01:23.100> even<00:01:23.340> if<00:01:23.460> your<00:01:23.550> hair<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.759> relax

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
my thing and even if your hair is relax

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.400 
my thing and even if your hair is relax
I<00:01:24.450> think<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.690> might<00:01:24.780> look<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.080> up<00:01:25.140> for<00:01:25.289> that

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
I think it might look it up for that

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.889 
I think it might look it up for that
moment<00:01:25.619> but<00:01:26.039> i<00:01:26.310> think<00:01:26.610> when<00:01:26.850> we<00:01:26.880> turn<00:01:27.210> 80<00:01:27.509> we're

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
moment but i think when we turn 80 we're

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:29.810 
moment but i think when we turn 80 we're
still<00:01:28.050> going<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.259> be<00:01:28.320> five<00:01:28.560> like<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.310> heavy<00:01:29.550> air

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
still going to be five like a heavy air

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.530 
still going to be five like a heavy air
so<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:31.170> might<00:01:31.320> look<00:01:31.470> at<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.680> now<00:01:31.890> but<00:01:32.360> like<00:01:33.360> the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
so you might look at it now but like the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.320 
so you might look at it now but like the
cost<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.140> long<00:01:34.409> run<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.400> know<00:01:35.520> the

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
cost of the long run I you know the

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.480 
cost of the long run I you know the
color<00:01:36.510> back<00:01:37.260> on<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.740> love<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.310> really

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
color back on I love this is really

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.969 
color back on I love this is really
natural<00:01:39.090> literal<00:01:39.360> point<00:01:39.600> but<00:01:39.900> i<00:01:40.140> guess<00:01:40.619> the

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
natural literal point but i guess the

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.590 
natural literal point but i guess the
thickness<00:01:41.340> over<00:01:41.729> here<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.119> don't<00:01:42.360> know<00:01:42.450> that

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
thickness over here I don't know that

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.969 
thickness over here I don't know that
that's<00:01:42.750> something<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.140> I've<00:01:43.290> missed<00:01:43.830> a<00:01:43.950> lot

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
that's something that I've missed a lot

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.469 
that's something that I've missed a lot
when<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.400> was<00:01:44.430> relaxing<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.090> don't<00:01:45.390> really

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
when I was relaxing that I don't really

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.910 
when I was relaxing that I don't really
have<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.840> take<00:01:46.020> care<00:01:46.200> like<00:01:46.409> my<00:01:46.560> hair<00:01:46.710> started

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
have to take care like my hair started

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.550 
have to take care like my hair started
to<00:01:47.100> thin<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.580> so<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.270> guess<00:01:48.509> um<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:49.080> guess<00:01:49.350> with

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
to thin and so I guess um I guess with

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.560 
to thin and so I guess um I guess with
natural<00:01:49.979> hair<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.460> have<00:01:50.790> more<00:01:51.090> healthy<00:01:51.420> hair

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
natural hair you have more healthy hair

natural hair you have more healthy hair

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
let's not saying that you can you can't

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.359 
let's not saying that you can you can't
be<00:01:53.670> relax<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.060> have<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:55.020> what<00:01:55.890> else<00:01:56.100> they<00:01:56.250> want

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369

be relax and have a what else they want
healthy<00:01:56.579> hair<00:01:56.939> but<00:01:57.540> it's<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.780> lot<00:01:57.900> easier<00:01:57.960> when

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
healthy hair but it's a lot easier when

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.890 
healthy hair but it's a lot easier when
