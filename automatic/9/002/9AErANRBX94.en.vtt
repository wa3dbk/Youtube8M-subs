00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:30.659 
for everything I liked about it that I

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:33.469 
for everything I liked about it that I
liked<00:05:30.959> more<00:05:31.589> than<00:05:31.829> I<00:05:31.889> did<00:05:32.099> Windows<00:05:32.459> 7<00:05:32.879> there's

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 
liked more than I did Windows 7 there's

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:36.219 
liked more than I did Windows 7 there's
a<00:05:33.659> handful<00:05:34.139> of<00:05:34.199> other<00:05:34.439> things<00:05:34.529> that<00:05:35.009> really

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
a handful of other things that really

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:38.839 
a handful of other things that really
pissed<00:05:37.229> me<00:05:37.379> off<00:05:37.499> about<00:05:37.829> it<00:05:38.189> as<00:05:38.489> far<00:05:38.729> as

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:38.849 
pissed me off about it as far as

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:41.449 
pissed me off about it as far as
installation<00:05:39.149> goes<00:05:39.629> it<00:05:39.899> installed<00:05:40.459> pretty

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:41.459 
installation goes it installed pretty

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:44.089 
installation goes it installed pretty
quickly<00:05:41.819> it<00:05:42.149> did<00:05:42.329> not<00:05:42.479> take<00:05:42.749> long<00:05:42.779> at<00:05:43.169> all<00:05:43.259> do

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:44.099 
quickly it did not take long at all do

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:47.179 
quickly it did not take long at all do
15<00:05:44.610> minutes<00:05:44.909> to<00:05:45.029> a<00:05:45.059> half<00:05:45.299> an<00:05:45.419> hour<00:05:45.649> and<00:05:46.649> it<00:05:47.039> does

00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:47.189 
15 minutes to a half an hour and it does

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:49.489 
15 minutes to a half an hour and it does
start<00:05:47.339> up<00:05:47.639> very<00:05:48.119> quickly<00:05:48.449> at<00:05:48.929> least<00:05:49.110> I<00:05:49.259> thought

00:05:49.489 --> 00:05:49.499 
start up very quickly at least I thought

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:52.399 
start up very quickly at least I thought
after<00:05:50.279> I<00:05:50.309> installed<00:05:50.729> it<00:05:50.879> I<00:05:51.059> found<00:05:51.599> pretty<00:05:52.079> much

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:52.409 
after I installed it I found pretty much

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:54.979 
after I installed it I found pretty much
all<00:05:52.679> the<00:05:52.979> drivers<00:05:53.279> that<00:05:53.699> there<00:05:53.969> were<00:05:54.269> to<00:05:54.689> find

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:54.989 
all the drivers that there were to find

00:05:54.989 --> 00:05:59.659 
all the drivers that there were to find
for<00:05:55.529> this<00:05:55.679> computer<00:05:57.559> scored<00:05:58.559> a<00:05:58.619> 3.8<00:05:59.309> on<00:05:59.459> the

for this computer scored a 3.8 on the
Windows<00:06:00.029> Experience<00:06:00.449> Index<00:06:00.869> I<00:06:01.489> believe<00:06:02.489> that

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:02.849 
Windows Experience Index I believe that

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:09.739 
Windows Experience Index I believe that

that<00:06:09.929> my<00:06:10.319> lowest<00:06:10.649> score<00:06:10.919> was<00:06:11.069> actually<00:06:11.759> the

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:12.289 
that my lowest score was actually the

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:16.369 
that my lowest score was actually the
graphics<00:06:13.289> card<00:06:13.559> obviously<00:06:14.129> enough<00:06:14.839> and<00:06:15.839> I'm

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:16.379 
graphics card obviously enough and I'm

actually planning on doing another video

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:24.799 
actually planning on doing another video
about<00:06:21.659> it<00:06:21.989> at<00:06:22.319> a<00:06:22.379> later<00:06:22.739> time<00:06:23.239> but<00:06:24.239> just<00:06:24.629> so<00:06:24.719> you

about it at a later time but just so you
guys<00:06:24.899> kind<00:06:25.229> of<00:06:25.409> you<00:06:25.739> know<00:06:25.860> see<00:06:26.729> what<00:06:26.759> it's<00:06:26.969> like

00:06:27.489 --> 00:06:27.499 
guys kind of you know see what it's like

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:30.319 
guys kind of you know see what it's like
but<00:06:28.499> that's<00:06:28.709> pretty<00:06:28.889> much<00:06:29.009> the<00:06:29.159> setup<00:06:30.149> there

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:30.329 
but that's pretty much the setup there

00:06:30.329 --> 00:06:33.229 
but that's pretty much the setup there
that's<00:06:30.509> the<00:06:30.779> windows<00:06:31.709> 8<00:06:31.889> Pentium<00:06:32.339> 4<00:06:32.639> so<00:06:32.969> called

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:33.239 
that's the windows 8 Pentium 4 so called

00:06:33.239 --> 00:06:37.909 
that's the windows 8 Pentium 4 so called
sandbox<00:06:33.899> computer<00:06:34.589> I<00:06:35.549> mean<00:06:35.939> it's<00:06:36.869> not<00:06:37.019> a<00:06:37.079> it's

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 
sandbox computer I mean it's not a it's

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:40.339 
sandbox computer I mean it's not a it's
not<00:06:38.039> like<00:06:38.099> a<00:06:38.249> main<00:06:38.489> computer<00:06:38.879> or<00:06:39.119> anything<00:06:39.349> but

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:40.349 
not like a main computer or anything but

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:42.589 
not like a main computer or anything but
it<00:06:40.469> gets<00:06:40.589> the<00:06:40.739> job<00:06:40.919> done<00:06:40.979> for<00:06:41.549> basic<00:06:42.149> browsing

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:42.599 
it gets the job done for basic browsing

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:45.139 
it gets the job done for basic browsing
and<00:06:42.719> stuff<00:06:42.929> so<00:06:43.259> if<00:06:44.219> any<00:06:44.399> of<00:06:44.489> you<00:06:44.579> guys<00:06:44.759> have<00:06:44.999> an

and stuff so if any of you guys have an
old<00:06:45.299> Pentium<00:06:45.689> 4<00:06:45.929> machine<00:06:46.459> hanging<00:06:47.459> around

old Pentium 4 machine hanging around
that<00:06:47.849> you<00:06:47.939> want<00:06:48.149> to<00:06:48.469> try<00:06:49.469> something<00:06:49.709> new<00:06:49.979> with

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:50.009 
that you want to try something new with

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:52.069 
that you want to try something new with
I<00:06:50.399> would<00:06:50.610> actually<00:06:50.759> recommend<00:06:51.089> trying

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:52.079 
I would actually recommend trying

00:06:52.079 --> 00:06:53.179 
I would actually recommend trying
Windows<00:06:52.589> 8<00:06:52.799> on<00:06:52.979> it

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:53.189 
Windows 8 on it

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:55.669 
Windows 8 on it
although<00:06:53.909> I<00:06:54.119> wasn't<00:06:54.749> terribly<00:06:55.169> impressed

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:55.679 
although I wasn't terribly impressed

00:06:55.679 --> 00:06:57.589 
although I wasn't terribly impressed
with<00:06:55.860> it<00:06:55.949> it<00:06:56.069> did<00:06:56.279> have<00:06:56.489> some<00:06:56.759> strong<00:06:57.059> points

00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:57.599 
with it it did have some strong points

00:06:57.599 --> 00:07:01.609 
with it it did have some strong points
which<00:06:58.199> will<00:06:58.379> like<00:06:59.219> I<00:06:59.369> said<00:06:59.610> will<00:06:59.789> cover<00:07:00.059> in<00:07:00.619> my

00:07:01.609 --> 00:07:01.619 
which will like I said will cover in my

00:07:01.619 --> 00:07:04.519 
which will like I said will cover in my
actual<00:07:01.919> Windows<00:07:02.339> 8<00:07:02.549> 2<00:07:02.819> or<00:07:02.969> video<00:07:03.239> of<00:07:03.479> it<00:07:03.629> anyway

00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:04.529
