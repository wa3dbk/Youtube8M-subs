00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
usually tend to go down I find that it's

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.569 
usually tend to go down I find that it's
easier<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.599> go<00:03:33.750> down<00:03:33.780> like<00:03:34.230> from<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:34.859> top<00:03:35.099> I<00:03:35.310> go

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
easier to go down like from the top I go

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.059 
easier to go down like from the top I go
down<00:03:36.389> from<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:37.079> if<00:03:37.260> anything<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.709> autumn
