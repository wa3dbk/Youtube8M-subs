00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.420
 this weekend we went to watch 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.180
 the little prince's movie and maybe 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:13.559
 It was the movie I spent the most 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:16.420
 rage in the movies since the movie of noé 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.400

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.940
 machine gun at the end and then everyone 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:25.119
 will win that cinema of so much the 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.279
 movie was now that little movie 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.980
 Prince is of chipping 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.439
 This movie is flaky if you like it. 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.199
 this movie is because you never read a 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.390
 or because you never understood the 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:40.000
 book or why you have connected to 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.100
 some isolated scene from the movie and made a 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.199
 parallel with your personal life 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.870
 these are the three ways of you 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:49.780
 like this movie are three stories 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.729
 within a single film. 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.489
 first is the story of a little girl 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:56.110
 who have separated parents who have a 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.150
 super controlling mother who was 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.430
 abandoned by the father and creates a 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.080
 paternal figure bond with an aviator 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.740
 who almost ripped out her head with 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:08.229
 propeller of an airplane 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.310
 you can not create a link at all 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.689
 with none of the characters 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.009
 If you watch a movie, tell me what it is. 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:17.950
 the little boy's name 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:20.259
 What is the name of the little girl's mother? 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:24.250
 what is the name of the aviator you do not 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:25.570
 can create any link with any 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.159
 of the characters 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.969
 they tried to do this first 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:33.520
 first idea of ​​the film a parallel with 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:35.590
 the film an adventure in the heights only 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.840
 the op is fantastic and wonderful that is 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.719
 Wonderful wonderful animation 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.880
 where you create bond with each of the 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:45.460
 Each character's characters have different 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.920
 importance and you are thrilled with 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.420
 that story in the little prince is 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.530
 completely different you do not create 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.140
 bond 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.569
 you do not create a patio with any of the 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.479
 characters the script is horrible despite 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:00.369
 the animation is very well done 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.479
 in the second part of the movie you have a 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:06.880
 stop motion animation is talking about 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.979
 respect of the little prince the second 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.929
 part of the movie is the little prince 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.519
 only they picked up isolated fragments 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.780
 of the book that would not fill a page and 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.060
 try to do this 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:26.430
 do you feel any empathy for the small 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:29.650
 Prince is very one is horribly one 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.709
 do not have a book page 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.110
 in the film a page are only texts 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:38.620
 isolated and try to make with what 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.230
 these texts 5 these detached texts 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.270
 that do not fill a page 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.440
 they try to make these texts 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.330
 creates in you 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.360
 some empathy with the story of the little 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.580
 prince is an outbreak for those who have 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.220
 understood the book as a child 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.260
 when I was a teenager when I was an adult 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.350
 when I was old it's an insult to anyone 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.760
 saw and how bad it is of a child 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.010
 eight years in the cinema when people 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.110
 He saw the eight year old does 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.150
 no sense what's breaking is this 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.030
 shouting in the middle of the movie a child 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.890
 8 years nor for children this 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.690
 Does any movie have some kind of attraction 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.000
 attraction 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.600
 the third part of the movie the worst of everything 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.540
 that's when they make this 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.440
 little girl live the stories of little 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.640
 Prince 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.019
 in a completely turpe 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.200
 completely distorted than the 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:35.350
 little prince and what does it mean 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.570
 the image of the film is just a world of 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.480
 adults is very annoying and they work 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:43.090
 other and live that neither the hubs an encore 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:47.709
 are embedded in a worldview 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:52.359
 too stupid is not it is not only that that a 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:55.060
 book deals with how film is mediocre not 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:58.150
 should not even call himself a little prince and 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.180
 if you call the idiot girl and the aviator right? 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.160
 the uncontrolled mother and the girl always 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.140
 anything of the smallest type 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.940
 Prince not for you 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.920
 truly understand the history of 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.769
 little prince 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.299
 You can read of course at any stage. 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.250
 of your life but for courses and 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:19.079
 truly understand it is necessary 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:22.840
 Do you know the biography and bibliography? 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:25.330
 from the year to those open because the small 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.780
 Prince is not a fiction. 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.889
 he is an allegory of life itself 2 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.990
 Danger 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:35.590
 he puts it so truthfully with 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:38.800
 so much honesty reflects in the very 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:42.099
 personal experiences of each person who 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.169
 reading that book by importing the age 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:46.449
 importing time is a timeless book 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:49.870
 and not conditioned the age because he 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:53.080
 speak directly with some a book is 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.330
 absolutely great a masterpiece 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:59.800
 of humanity try to lessen this 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:02.409
 book is from miss and from there abia the book 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.229
 of dilma and of the largest 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:08.729
 scoundrels of the world is the bible you go 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:12.310
 take the value of the bible because of it 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:14.500
 one of the greatest books of the humanity 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.750
 of the greatest books in history 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.090
 humanity 's synthesis of the soul of a 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:22.889
 man who reflects on the souls of others 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:29.080
 men turned into a movie 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:31.330
 absolutely mediocre and the bad any 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.539
 another animation is better than this 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.669
 movie hotel transylvania anp 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:39.909
 toy story 3 toy story 3 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:42.339
 which is wonderful but even cars 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:46.029
 cars are better cars the better 

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:46.839
 my advice do not watch the little 

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:49.210
 Prince 

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:51.849
 Did you like this movie? Because you? 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.370
 Did not read it because you did not understand it. 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:57.599
 because you connect some isolated scene 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.599
 with your personal life
