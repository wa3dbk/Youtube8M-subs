at<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.760> BCS<00:00:45.450> rankings<00:00:45.890> because<00:00:46.890> that's<00:00:47.190> all

at the BCS rankings because that's all

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.979 
at the BCS rankings because that's all
that<00:00:47.700> matters<00:00:48.090> right<00:00:48.149> now<00:00:48.360> let's<00:00:48.750> make<00:00:48.960> sure

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
that matters right now let's make sure

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.170 
that matters right now let's make sure
we're<00:00:49.350> still<00:00:49.620> third<00:00:49.980> there<00:00:50.399> as<00:00:50.610> well<00:00:50.910> and

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
we're still third there as well and

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.930 
we're still third there as well and
we're<00:00:51.899> not<00:00:52.140> we're<00:00:52.469> fourth<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.250> we're<00:00:53.489> right

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
we're not we're fourth and we're right

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.470 
we're not we're fourth and we're right
behind<00:00:54.180> Texas<00:00:54.960> A&amp;M<00:00:55.730> so<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.090> going<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.329> be

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
behind Texas A&amp;M so this is going to be

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.750 
behind Texas A&amp;M so this is going to be
a<00:00:57.510> very<00:00:57.629> very<00:00:58.170> tough<00:00:58.530> road<00:00:58.739> decline<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.579> get

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
a very very tough road decline to get

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.779 
a very very tough road decline to get
into<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.210> top<00:01:00.449> two<00:01:00.780> all<00:01:01.770> three<00:01:02.280> teams<00:01:02.520> ahead

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
into the top two all three teams ahead

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.690 
into the top two all three teams ahead
of<00:01:02.910> us<00:01:03.120> don't<00:01:03.420> really<00:01:03.809> play<00:01:04.110> anybody<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:05.189> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
of us don't really play anybody in the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.880 
of us don't really play anybody in the
top<00:01:05.909> 25<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.720> that's<00:01:06.930> not<00:01:07.140> good<00:01:07.409> we<00:01:07.590> got<00:01:07.740> to

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
top 25 so that's not good we got to

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.300 
top 25 so that's not good we got to
really<00:01:08.070> hope<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.640> am<00:01:09.119> ohio<00:01:09.960> state<00:01:10.080> or<00:01:10.470> tcu<00:01:10.650> or

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
really hope that am ohio state or tcu or

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.679 
really hope that am ohio state or tcu or
two<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.479> three<00:01:12.780> lose<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> game<00:01:13.710> i<00:01:14.689> believe

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
two of the three lose a game i believe

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.100 
two of the three lose a game i believe
that<00:01:16.530> if<00:01:16.860> we<00:01:16.890> do<00:01:17.759> win<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.180> game<00:01:18.420> we<00:01:18.689> will<00:01:18.900> get

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
that if we do win this game we will get

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.929 
that if we do win this game we will get
into<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.470> Big<00:01:19.619> Ten<00:01:19.860> championship<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:20.729> that

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
into the Big Ten championship so that

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.510 
into the Big Ten championship so that
would<00:01:21.090> give<00:01:21.119> us<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.540> chance<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:22.110> knock<00:01:22.799> off<00:01:23.100> ohio

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
would give us a chance to knock off ohio

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.410 
would give us a chance to knock off ohio
state<00:01:24.380> and<00:01:25.380> texas<00:01:25.799> A&amp;M<00:01:26.159> should<00:01:26.700> probably<00:01:27.180> be

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
state and texas A&amp;M should probably be

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.800 
state and texas A&amp;M should probably be
in<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.860> SEC<00:01:28.860> Championship<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.850> tcu<00:01:30.600> should

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
in the SEC Championship and tcu should

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.600 
in the SEC Championship and tcu should
probably<00:01:31.140> be<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.409> Big<00:01:31.590> Ten<00:01:31.619> championship

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
probably be in the Big Ten championship

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.740 
probably be in the Big Ten championship
so<00:01:33.420> those<00:01:33.630> are<00:01:33.659> both<00:01:33.990> basically

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
so those are both basically

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.480 
so those are both basically
possibilities<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.780> them<00:01:37.140> losing<00:01:37.650> so<00:01:37.860> we<00:01:38.009> still

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
possibilities of them losing so we still

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.120 
possibilities of them losing so we still
have<00:01:38.549> hope<00:01:39.259> we<00:01:40.259> still<00:01:40.530> keeping<00:01:40.860> hope<00:01:41.009> alive

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
have hope we still keeping hope alive

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.600 
have hope we still keeping hope alive
but<00:01:41.640> those<00:01:41.820> two<00:01:42.060> losses<00:01:42.270> really<00:01:42.869> did<00:01:43.049> hurt<00:01:43.200> us

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
but those two losses really did hurt us

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.190 
but those two losses really did hurt us
let's<00:01:44.610> just<00:01:44.790> take<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.000> look<00:01:45.149> at<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.659> Heisman

maybe would be in the Rose Bowl at this
point<00:02:33.819> projected<00:02:34.600> know<00:02:34.750> they'd<00:02:34.930> have<00:02:35.140> us<00:02:35.170> in

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
more better players but unfortunately we

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.370

anybody's<00:05:34.449> heart<00:05:34.750> but<00:05:35.080> my<00:05:35.199> guess<00:05:35.259> is<00:05:35.530> that<00:05:36.009> and

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
anybody's heart but my guess is that and

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.760 
anybody's heart but my guess is that and
this<00:05:36.820> isn't<00:05:37.180> set<00:05:37.360> in<00:05:37.449> stone<00:05:37.479> but<00:05:38.320> my<00:05:38.500> guess<00:05:38.560> is

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
this isn't set in stone but my guess is

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.649 
this isn't set in stone but my guess is
that<00:05:38.979> the<00:05:39.250> third<00:05:39.460> season<00:05:39.759> will<00:05:40.120> be<00:05:40.300> the<00:05:40.449> last

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:40.659 
that the third season will be the last

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:42.270 
that the third season will be the last
season<00:05:41.139> but<00:05:41.259> we'll<00:05:41.440> see<00:05:41.650> i<00:05:41.680> don't<00:05:41.830> know<00:05:42.070> if<00:05:42.190> you

number<00:05:58.150> one<00:05:58.360> in<00:05:58.630> the<00:05:58.659> rushing<00:05:59.229> and<00:05:59.710> rushing<00:06:00.219> in

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
number one in the rushing and rushing in

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.420 
number one in the rushing and rushing in
the<00:06:00.550> NCAA's<00:06:01.270> pretty<00:06:02.229> far<00:06:02.500> behind<00:06:02.650> this<00:06:03.069> league

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
the NCAA's pretty far behind this league

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.980 
the NCAA's pretty far behind this league
I<00:06:03.639> from<00:06:03.909> Air<00:06:04.120> Force<00:06:04.389> so<00:06:04.569> that's<00:06:04.719> going<00:06:04.870> to<00:06:04.930> be

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
I from Air Force so that's going to be

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.480 
I from Air Force so that's going to be
tough<00:06:05.289> but<00:06:05.469> I<00:06:05.530> think<00:06:05.800> that's<00:06:05.979> a<00:06:06.069> team<00:06:06.280> that

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
tough but I think that's a team that

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.879 
tough but I think that's a team that
proudly<00:06:06.729> runs<00:06:07.060> the<00:06:07.240> ball<00:06:07.409> ninety<00:06:08.409> percent<00:06:08.560> of

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:08.889 
proudly runs the ball ninety percent of

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:10.499 
proudly runs the ball ninety percent of
the<00:06:09.009> time<00:06:09.219> so<00:06:09.520> I<00:06:09.550> doubt<00:06:09.849> we'll<00:06:10.000> be<00:06:10.060> able<00:06:10.240> to<00:06:10.389> get

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:10.509 
the time so I doubt we'll be able to get

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:13.170 
the time so I doubt we'll be able to get
the<00:06:10.659> rushing<00:06:11.319> title<00:06:11.530> you<00:06:12.190> see<00:06:12.400> Youngblood<00:06:12.909> not
