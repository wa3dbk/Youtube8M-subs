down on the cap I slide the cap out it's

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.470 
down on the cap I slide the cap out it's
as<00:00:45.980> if<00:00:46.160> I'm<00:00:46.309> holding<00:00:46.489> the<00:00:46.699> part<00:00:46.940> in<00:00:47.059> my<00:00:47.090> hand

as if I'm holding the part in my hand
and<00:00:47.930> by<00:00:48.530> doing<00:00:48.739> that<00:00:48.890> half<00:00:49.730> of<00:00:49.850> the<00:00:49.940> mouse

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
and by doing that half of the mouse

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.389 
and by doing that half of the mouse
movement<00:00:50.420> gets<00:00:50.809> deployed<00:00:51.199> over<00:00:51.800> to<00:00:52.280> the

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
movement gets deployed over to the

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.509 
movement gets deployed over to the
device<00:00:53.019> which<00:00:54.019> is<00:00:54.170> a<00:00:54.199> comfort<00:00:54.620> factor<00:00:54.800> the

it<00:02:41.640> works<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.060> say<00:02:42.390> what<00:02:42.630> like<00:02:42.810> if<00:02:42.989> you<00:02:43.110> pan

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
it works and say what like if you pan

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.340 
it works and say what like if you pan
the<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.970> parts<00:02:45.390> or<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:45.660> move<00:02:45.930> it<00:02:46.050> up<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.290> down

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
the the parts or you move it up and down

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.259 
the the parts or you move it up and down

the<00:02:51.600> easiest<00:02:51.840> way<00:02:52.019> to<00:02:52.050> describe<00:02:52.530> it<00:02:52.950> is<00:02:53.569> think

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
the easiest way to describe it is think

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.199 
the easiest way to describe it is think
of<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.870> cap<00:02:55.110> as<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:56.040> part<00:02:56.310> you're<00:02:56.550> actually

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
of the cap as the part you're actually

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.930 
of the cap as the part you're actually
almost<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.600> same<00:02:57.840> as<00:02:58.019> reaching<00:02:58.260> on<00:02:58.620> screen<00:02:59.100> so

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
almost the same as reaching on screen so

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.809 
almost the same as reaching on screen so
if<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.180> lived<00:03:00.420> up<00:03:00.630> lift<00:03:00.989> up<00:03:01.200> on<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.620> cap<00:03:01.830> my

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
if I lived up lift up on the cap my

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.890 
if I lived up lift up on the cap my
parts<00:03:03.150> gonna<00:03:03.299> go<00:03:03.480> up<00:03:03.630> push<00:03:04.590> down<00:03:05.480> my<00:03:06.480> partner

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
parts gonna go up push down my partner

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.600 
parts gonna go up push down my partner
assembly<00:03:07.319> or<00:03:07.410> model<00:03:07.709> is<00:03:07.830> gonna<00:03:07.980> go<00:03:08.160> down<00:03:08.340> right

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
assembly or model is gonna go down right

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.170 
assembly or model is gonna go down right
if<00:03:09.420> I<00:03:09.630> slide<00:03:09.959> it<00:03:10.110> out<00:03:10.260> like<00:03:10.799> I'm<00:03:11.120> closing<00:03:12.120> a

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
if I slide it out like I'm closing a

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.440 
if I slide it out like I'm closing a
drawer<00:03:12.590> you<00:03:13.590> can<00:03:13.739> see<00:03:13.980> that<00:03:14.910> it's<00:03:15.090> zooming<00:03:15.360> out

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
drawer you can see that it's zooming out

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.630 
drawer you can see that it's zooming out
right<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:16.200> do<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.650> opposite<00:03:17.100> I<00:03:17.310> pull<00:03:17.549> it

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
right I do the opposite I pull it

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.190 
right I do the opposite I pull it
towards<00:03:17.970> me

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
towards me

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.979 
towards me
I'm<00:03:20.200> finding<00:03:20.500> it<00:03:20.709> mm-hmm<00:03:21.459> you<00:03:22.030> can<00:03:22.150> see<00:03:22.360> it's

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
I'm finding it mm-hmm you can see it's

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.809 
I'm finding it mm-hmm you can see it's
very<00:03:23.260> little<00:03:23.769> motion<00:03:24.040> very<00:03:24.430> little<00:03:24.670> effort

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
very little motion very little effort

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:31.050 
very little motion very little effort
now<00:03:25.690> I<00:03:25.720> can<00:03:26.140> also<00:03:26.349> tilt<00:03:27.220> rotate<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:30.640> same<00:03:30.879> way

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
now I can also tilt rotate the same way

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.910 
now I can also tilt rotate the same way
that<00:03:31.209> is<00:03:31.360> this<00:03:31.480> works<00:03:31.750> with<00:03:32.019> many<00:03:32.590> many
