00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:13.759
 hello to all according to today we will set up cut the tax on a 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.130
 blog that is to say to be able to generate additional income 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.179
 thanks to advertisements offered by the service so the cost of the dough 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:25.119
 so to do this one must first have created an account under 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.759
 the blow of disappointment and to access to put you these enough 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:34.229
 for example to type axel 6% the bar so in the beard of the ffr evocative 

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:35.270
 that acta 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.380
 and you that this so the first so on which the pico 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.530
 so I stop right now on a page 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.660
 that you should not have right now if you do not have any 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.380
 account but we'll jump it's from see what make a little gain 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.780
 of time then once you are on this page you have several tabs 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.370
 the English report will allow me to have one on a detailed plan on the 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.370
 earnings 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.270
 so you can view by period for the time again by banners with 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.450
 advanced reports the current configuration what is the case 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.920
 subscribed kate 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.710
 the part of my account that will allow us to 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.070
 save your personal details passwords eq it was 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.220
 rare and then resources that will allow us to access the difference this 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.820
 service offered by google then the break interests us today is 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.820
 obviously rolling configuration did he say 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.080
 so once we are on this page 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.440
 we have the possibility to add several types of stimulus 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.000
 that I will let you discover for yourself such as the attractions for 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.660
 mobile the nine wise for the domains for the data flows and so the 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.890
 RSS feed 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.310
 for the searches will still be able to lepage 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.420
 content that will interest us immediately so we will click on 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.370
 axel sport the content pages 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.210
 so if you have the option to choose between two types of blocks of 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.400
 thematic blocks ie blocks will follow 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.660
 to feed according to the content side of your blog for opting 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.160
 ads relevant to their development this with ads 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.590
 random that is generated also depending on your content 

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:14.259
 then we here we will select a thematic block fits 

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:16.809
 little importance for the tutorial 

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:20.089
 I'll let you discover the advertiser block 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.849
 and I click appreciate continue so I had on my heart the page of 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.930
 configuration of the other advertisement which consisted for example to choose the school 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.349
 of color as you see here 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.219
 or the size then to note here that for this type of advertised ads 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:36.339
 themes 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:38.499
 you have less choice 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:40.929
 but for ads so 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:42.759
 classical 

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:46.339
 so once I chose my size and therefore take a small white square 

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:50.409
 then grape varieties to flood the voter advertising but well 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:54.600
 firstly that a clever fish advertising places the service 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.410
 to voters but also to generate a small income 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.899
 additional 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:01.929
 then select the number of links 

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:03.419
 4 5 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:06.419
 and then the level of the color I advise you to use 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.869
 so colors that are getting very close 

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:12.289
 of all the colors of your blog 

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:14.820
 and for that I suggested you useful for example 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.089
 of colaursud which is a tool 

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:20.819
 so we have two color captures while I do not know how to be saber 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.219
 already the download is free and to use it just slide 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:27.159
 the pipette on any color 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:31.239
 to get here the valuable code that will serve you so feed 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.889
 the axel field what is here 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.250
 so once this is achieved it is enough 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.530
 you are going to fight not throwing click so sure continue 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.069
 So this part of it does not interest us at the moment do not you 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.989
 will serve for example make a detailed analysis 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.049
 so we have money back will bring each ad according to 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.049
 its location so I let you discover it in this part 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:01.589
 so stung on continue 

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:05.699
 and then the last part is to select the title of our advance 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:09.009
 that it will go to the distinguished among the others 

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:11.269
 pitiful 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:15.769
 and then I finally click to finish on not sent they have a soul code 

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:20.599
 here and so I hold this code that will allow us to insert 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:22.759
 advertisements on our blog 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:27.319
 I'm going to copy this civil code so I'm going to talk directly about 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.760
 teenager platform bloggers case that will allow us to change our 

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:34.480
 kraft point 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.330
 close bloggers like then I'm going to select for the block I'm going 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.330
 come edit layout 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.210
 see there is already a beautiful catch that I will delete 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:50.979
 why start 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:52.249
 here 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:55.029
 and I will proceed in two ways 

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:58.029
 plug the first way a little bit a teen 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:01.569
 from scratch add a gadget 

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:05.189
 html javascript 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:06.190
 here 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.730
 and I come collar the code that I just generated in the atlantic people the 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.789
 block advertising 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:15.559
 recorded 

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:18.559
 you see here the ad came on the right 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:22.139
 and now I can visualize the blog 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:27.069
 with my English publicity here that has come to add 

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:32.009
 so here we do not see it yet for the moment because it takes a certain 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:32.650
 time 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.050
 afp so that google can generate content in the code that is all fresh 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:41.819
 so this is for the method a little bit to a current stiffen 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.360
 like to add lives 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.599
 pub on your blog 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:50.749
 if you ever have apple manage by the blogger platform you have a way 

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:53.020
 even simpler 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.710
 so I'm going to close this page 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.810
 killer to access the monetization part so the platform 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.020
 bloggers 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.690
 and then 2 9% so have to then click on the panties you want 

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:08.719
 we will put in place when you have the opportunity to put a pub under 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:11.889
 their tickets on the side I'm on the side the judges on the articles 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.280
 or no new ads at all 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.499
 he could choose a pub on the side 

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:20.910
 so before you get to that age you need 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.330
 have first 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.949
 create an axel springer account in touch that you can do it directly to 

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:29.740
 from bloggers it's very simple you'll see 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.750
 so here is enough to say so waits but he had accepted the 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.309
 Terms of use 

00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:37.509
 and then you will be able to go directly to this page so it's 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:38.479
 quick 

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:41.830
 once I selected the team for several days who is she on 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.830
 the side I click on next 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:50.029
 and no service is enabled for your blog then accepted is enabled and 

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:51.810
 so you see very quickly 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.770
 much faster than using the classical method 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.490
 only we have a part left 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.180
 c configure the ad 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.029
 because if I go to the open blog and that the cub 

00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:05.119
 it's actually already there 

00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:09.139
 that I can configure by clicking here on this little one there 

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:13.110
 I configure and especially the size 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:16.029
 and the colors 

00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:19.029
 once i did that i board street 

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:23.289
 and you see the colors paris ive 

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:25.599
 goal adoption on my new ad 

00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:29.819
 so after that you have the opportunity so let's go straight on 

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:33.119
 blogger if you used the second method 

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:35.909
 in business targeted 

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:37.250
 in reports 

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.399
 sure 

00:07:39.399 --> 00:07:40.590
 on the amount 

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:42.419
 of vogue 

00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:46.360
 if you ever used the classic method you could you could 

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.469
 obviously access it 

00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:52.809
 by going on the report part here you have the estimated income of the day 

00:07:53.819 --> 00:07:57.539
 So that's the end of this election, which is the basis of 

00:07:57.539 --> 00:07:57.599
 soon
