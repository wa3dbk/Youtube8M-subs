00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
after laying the filled tiles we'll need

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.800 
after laying the filled tiles we'll need
to<00:00:02.490> take<00:00:02.669> the<00:00:02.790> measurements<00:00:03.330> for<00:00:03.510> your<00:00:03.629> hip

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
to take the measurements for your hip

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.530 
to take the measurements for your hip
cuts<00:00:04.640> I'm<00:00:05.640> labeling<00:00:05.940> this<00:00:06.390> hip<00:00:06.690> RH<00:00:07.529> number<00:00:08.130> one

cuts I'm labeling this hip RH number one

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.339 
cuts I'm labeling this hip RH number one
meaning<00:00:09.540> it's<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.690> first<00:00:09.990> set<00:00:10.230> of

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
down the ground and cut it you know

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.010 
down the ground and cut it you know
we're<00:00:58.270> going<00:00:58.420> to<00:00:58.480> take<00:00:58.600> all<00:00:58.809> these

we're going to take all these

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.479 
we're going to take all these
measurements<00:00:59.650> and<00:00:59.739> then<00:00:59.830> go<00:00:59.950> cut<00:01:00.160> them<00:01:00.309> all<00:01:00.400> at

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
measurements and then go cut them all at

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.939 
measurements and then go cut them all at
the<00:01:00.520> same<00:01:00.670> time<00:01:00.730> I<00:01:01.470> take<00:01:02.470> each<00:01:02.680> of<00:01:02.860> these

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
the same time I take each of these

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.070 
the same time I take each of these
measurements<00:01:03.550> right<00:01:03.699> up<00:01:03.850> to<00:01:03.940> this<00:01:04.089> line<00:01:04.360> which

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
measurements right up to this line which

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.920 
measurements right up to this line which
we'll<00:01:05.290> call<00:01:05.440> the<00:01:05.500> lap<00:01:05.860> line<00:01:06.510> because<00:01:07.510> the<00:01:07.660> next

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
we'll call the lap line because the next

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.930 
we'll call the lap line because the next
tile<00:01:08.200> is<00:01:08.590> going<00:01:08.830> to<00:01:08.890> overlap<00:01:09.340> this<00:01:09.550> two-inch

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.199 
piece that's going to try to fall down
and<00:03:57.049> make<00:03:57.079> it<00:03:57.379> more<00:03:57.650> difficult<00:03:57.709> to<00:03:58.220> cut<00:03:58.519> so<00:03:59.180> you

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
and make it more difficult to cut so you

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.719 
and make it more difficult to cut so you
want<00:03:59.510> the<00:03:59.599> larger<00:04:00.019> piece<00:04:00.230> of<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:00.590> tile<00:04:00.889> on<00:04:01.250> the

I've<00:05:17.550> set<00:05:17.789> the<00:05:17.909> cutter<00:05:18.150> and<00:05:18.509> the<00:05:18.900> bender<00:05:19.259> who

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
I've set the cutter and the bender who

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.680 
I've set the cutter and the bender who
close<00:05:19.710> proximity<00:05:20.190> to<00:05:20.430> where<00:05:21.090> I'm<00:05:21.210> marking<00:05:21.599> the

tile<00:05:27.300> and<00:05:28.259> I<00:05:28.380> stack<00:05:28.680> the<00:05:28.830> tiles<00:05:29.070> down<00:05:29.419> pretty

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
tile and I stack the tiles down pretty

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:32.540 
tile and I stack the tiles down pretty
much<00:05:30.509> right<00:05:30.900> back<00:05:31.110> where<00:05:31.349> I<00:05:31.409> started<00:05:31.550> marking

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
much right back where I started marking

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.089 
much right back where I started marking
the<00:05:32.639> next<00:05:32.880> tile<00:05:33.320> that<00:05:34.320> way<00:05:34.470> there's<00:05:34.680> not<00:05:34.800> a<00:05:34.860> lot

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:35.099 
the next tile that way there's not a lot

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:37.600 
the next tile that way there's not a lot
of<00:05:35.130> wasted<00:05:35.820> motion<00:05:36.110> running<00:05:37.110> back<00:05:37.320> and<00:05:37.500> forth

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
of wasted motion running back and forth

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.010 
of wasted motion running back and forth
stacking<00:05:38.610> up<00:05:38.729> stuff<00:05:39.000> cutting<00:05:39.419> on<00:05:39.539> one<00:05:39.780> side

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
stacking up stuff cutting on one side

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.779 
stacking up stuff cutting on one side
and<00:05:40.289> then<00:05:40.380> walking<00:05:40.590> over<00:05:40.800> to<00:05:41.009> the<00:05:41.039> bender<00:05:41.580> and

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:41.789 
and then walking over to the bender and

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:44.510 
and then walking over to the bender and
bending<00:05:42.630> it<00:05:42.990> and<00:05:43.199> walking<00:05:43.710> back<00:05:43.889> all<00:05:44.310> the<00:05:44.490> way

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
bending it and walking back all the way

00:05:44.520 --> 00:06:21.179 
bending it and walking back all the way
back<00:05:44.610> to<00:05:44.940> my<00:05:45.060> cuts

00:06:21.179 --> 00:06:21.189 

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:24.519 

little<00:06:22.189> tip<00:06:22.430> on<00:06:22.669> getting<00:06:23.360> this<00:06:23.509> cut<00:06:23.930> started

00:06:24.519 --> 00:06:24.529 
little tip on getting this cut started

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:27.129 
little tip on getting this cut started
on<00:06:24.710> an<00:06:24.949> angle<00:06:25.340> is<00:06:25.669> to<00:06:25.909> kind<00:06:26.270> of<00:06:26.449> start<00:06:26.779> it<00:06:26.960> on<00:06:27.080> a

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:27.139 
on an angle is to kind of start it on a

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:29.200 
on an angle is to kind of start it on a
right<00:06:27.439> angle<00:06:27.919> and<00:06:28.129> then<00:06:28.189> roll<00:06:28.819> it<00:06:28.999> into

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.210 
right angle and then roll it into

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.989 
right angle and then roll it into
position<00:06:29.810> to<00:06:30.199> cut<00:06:30.409> along<00:06:30.650> the<00:06:30.889> cut<00:06:31.819> line

00:06:31.989 --> 00:06:31.999 
position to cut along the cut line

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:33.939 
position to cut along the cut line
that's<00:06:32.659> going<00:06:32.810> to<00:06:32.870> make<00:06:33.050> for<00:06:33.319> a<00:06:33.349> much<00:06:33.560> cleaner

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:33.949 
that's going to make for a much cleaner

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:37.930 
that's going to make for a much cleaner
entry<00:06:34.430> make<00:06:34.849> the<00:06:34.969> cut<00:06:35.180> it<00:06:35.300> easier<00:06:35.539> to<00:06:35.659> start
