00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.129
 hi girls today we get 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.880
 found for a new video 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:20.860
 I hope you are well and I will 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.390
 today shows my routine care of 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.730
 nails this is a video that has been 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.660
 a lot of demand and so I hope 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.490
 you will like it 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.230
 we start right away with the game 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.930
 the simplest that is cleaning so 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.059
 I take a lambda solvent and 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.399
 so I take off my nail polish which is very 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.140
 very dark in general it really does 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.579
 result not terrible I showed you 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.100
 a little trick that will allow you to 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:45.399
 better clean your hands after having 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:49.660
 removed the dark polishes so I remove 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:51.690
 everything and then I pass so I go 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.460
 especially my nails of course 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.890
 roughly the result looks like 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.199
 these and to perfect his pass 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.269
 under the tap with toothpaste is 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.460
 an old toothbrush for place 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.950
 clean my nails and that's it 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.780
 let's go now to polishing 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.310
 so I hills the angles I know that 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.590
 tell you it's not good of the 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.870
 do it but it works very very 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.820
 well now I do not know my 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.969
 nails until it bleeds either 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.920
 wherever it's finished far from there 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:22.750
 the idea is simply to iron 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.579
 a little the surface of the nail and also of 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.770
 smooth the parts where there have been some 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:28.719
 small duplication because in 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.170
 general when we clean it turns 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:33.520
 too hot with vinegar 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.869
 here it is here so I police to noeux 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.380
 police is not like a sick person either 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:41.289
 a course and the idea is really 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.659
 just read you a little bit the surface of 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.640
 the nail so avoid taking a 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.619
 polisher very very aggressive at least 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.600
 things so I took mine 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.820
 at near marks you're day 2 for 1 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.159
 euro is the result 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.350
 going on to the next one and here I'm going 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.579
 feed my nails because yes the 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.649
 angles need to be fed so 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:02.710
 I apply castor oil on 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:05.079
 each nail I am currently full 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.890
 period of crazy love with the oil of 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.420
 castor would like to understand 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.160
 I will put two videos in the 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.330
 info bar that talks about that if it can 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.550
 to interest you and kind I come back to the 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.130
 current video and so I spend my 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.430
 fingers the idea is so to do 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.260
 penetrate the castor oil from angles info 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.240
 and also on the periphery of which everything 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.500
 which is cuticles and small skins 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.730
 which surround at the angles it is necessary 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.820
 absolutely feed them 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.160
 of course that does not stop you from 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.330
 feed them daily 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.830
 now I moved to a party that 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.170
 everyone finally that a lot of 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.330
 world does not advise too but for me 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.100
 it works very well so I remove 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.450
 my cuticles I do not repel them 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.370
 because I do not like that I think that 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.260
 they world but everyone does what he wants 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.600
 so here we will ask my routine so 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.489
 I do not show it to you with great pleasure 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.769
 so I removed a little bit what 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.360
 Exceeds of course I'm not abducting no 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.190
 more like a crazy story than that 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.200
 bleeds no when the righteous what 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.260
 exceeds a little bit because I'm 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.690
 maniacal about it and the result pleases me 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.950
 pretty little trick that we take you if 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.080
 you remove cuticles like me 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.180
 first really a very sharp tool 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.470
 like that it does not see you doing the 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.049
 little skins they take off this 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.730
 that they will have been a little bad on the nose 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:19.280
 here we are 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.200
 let's move on to the lim part so I 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.900
 take a file against you take the 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.600
 moon that you want and so I go 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.760
 to file the end of the house so 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.049
 give a shape and also to remove 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.269
 a little bit the parts that feel 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:34.489
 and forget because that day well 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:38.600
 heard I was doing to make 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:40.420
 house so of course the advice it's from 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.670
 always do the same thing 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.650
 I try to do it, I assure you 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.610
 but sometimes I'm so appreciated 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.500
 than 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.450
 listen I give in to the temptation to do 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.980
 a round trip with but I you 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.740
 advises to really do that in the 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.630
 same meaning to preserve your nails and 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.780
 especially if you have 400 angles 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.040
 sensitive to others and avoid limay 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.530
 in every way and try to 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.740
 respect a single France to file your 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.450
 little thing nails also a remark do not 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.100
 never cut your nails to the guilty 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.440
 it's the best way to break 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.840
 now I'm applying a care that is going 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.660
 also serve me as a basis on the whole 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.480
 of house so it is a care hardener 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.580
 of the essence mark it was barely costing 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.800
 2 euros I think I have something like 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.110
 it's pretty good I do not use 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.660
 necessarily often but the house he 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.270
 was really dirty condition so I 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.130
 decided to use this one so as I 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.380
 said it will serve me as a base 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.970
 polish do not forget to always put 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.950
 a tarpaulin regardless of the color of 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.390
 your nail polish since it protects that 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:46.790
 makes screen between nail polish and your nails 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.680
 that's the result will not hurt and for 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.090
 finish I get a polish from the 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.550
 mark to looting I would put you the 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.900
 reference in the info bar that 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.760
 I'm applying on house so it's a 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.919
 little bit of a season varnish so that's 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.750
 a kind of very milky gray very 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:02.300
 clear but I also find it going on 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.669
 everywhere I apply them so on leaving 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.380
 from the center of by first filling the 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.510
 nail center 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.100
 then I make the terminals that I do not you 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.860
 learn it not frozen already done in a 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.800
 other video that I would put you if I 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.790
 do not forget in the info bar 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.500
 so I make a first layer that 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.850
 is not very opaque to my taste I you 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.500
 always advise to put two 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.200
 layers because in general it's not 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.000
 very opaque and voila here I am doing my 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.910
 second layer nothing very very very 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.310
 complicated I proceed exactly from the 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:34.250
 same way as I did with 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:37.070
 the first layer and here you are 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:40.040
 I hope you will enjoy it result 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:42.140
 looks like this I invite you of course 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.150
 to subscribe to hats and share 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.890
 the video is on this I do you all 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.970
 lots of kisses and I'll meet 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.150
 you in an upcoming video 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:54.700
 it happens almost right at half 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:57.980
 of my chest so just above the 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.450
 from the cua france press I put you 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:04.390
 still a photo that I took 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.390
 precisely yesterday who interned me a little
