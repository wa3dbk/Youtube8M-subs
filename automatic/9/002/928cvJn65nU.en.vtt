I couldn't tell I thought it was

I couldn't tell I thought it was
possible<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.070> maybe<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:27.740> you<00:02:28.740> know<00:02:28.860> my

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
possible that maybe the you know my

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.820 
possible that maybe the you know my
conic<00:02:30.090> characters<00:02:30.630> were<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.110> ones<00:02:31.290> that<00:02:31.560> shot

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
conic characters were the ones that shot

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.370 
conic characters were the ones that shot
it<00:02:31.980> down<00:02:32.390> but<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:33.660> doesn't<00:02:33.960> seem<00:02:34.050> to<00:02:34.110> be<00:02:34.290> the

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
it down but that doesn't seem to be the

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
it down but that doesn't seem to be the
case<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:34.830> seems<00:02:34.860> like<00:02:36.770> they<00:02:37.770> were<00:02:37.830> just<00:02:38.130> they

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
case it seems like they were just they

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.710 
case it seems like they were just they
were<00:02:38.430> watching<00:02:38.850> so<00:02:39.330> they<00:02:39.480> were<00:02:39.570> probably

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
were watching so they were probably

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.990 
were watching so they were probably
saying<00:02:40.170> you<00:02:40.620> know<00:02:40.740> waving<00:02:41.100> by<00:02:41.250> with<00:02:41.640> everyone

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
saying you know waving by with everyone

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.810 
saying you know waving by with everyone
else<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.540> then<00:02:43.320> we<00:02:43.560> don't<00:02:43.680> know<00:02:43.980> I<00:02:44.250> didn't<00:02:44.700> see

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
else and then we don't know I didn't see

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:51.320 
else and then we don't know I didn't see
a<00:02:44.850> cannon<00:02:45.390> I<00:02:45.570> didn't<00:02:45.960> see<00:02:46.760> like<00:02:49.370> what<00:02:50.370> what

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
a cannon I didn't see like what what

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.120 
a cannon I didn't see like what what
shot<00:02:51.600> it<00:02:51.750> down<00:02:51.900> but<00:02:52.200> we<00:02:52.320> did<00:02:52.530> see<00:02:52.770> Bram

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
shot it down but we did see Bram

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.450 
shot it down but we did see Bram
attacking<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.380> golem<00:02:55.380> a<00:02:55.760> red<00:02:56.760> golem<00:02:57.270> so<00:02:57.750> that

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
attacking a golem a red golem so that

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.640 
attacking a golem a red golem so that
that<00:02:59.460> makes<00:02:59.700> me<00:02:59.880> think<00:03:00.060> that<00:03:00.180> this<00:03:00.510> is<00:03:00.690> going

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
that makes me think that this is going

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.850 
that makes me think that this is going
to<00:03:01.770> involve<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:02.340> inquest<00:03:03.290> possibly<00:03:06.530> no<00:03:07.530> no

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
to involve the inquest possibly no no

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.940 
to involve the inquest possibly no no
