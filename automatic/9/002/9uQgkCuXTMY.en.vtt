electricity<00:00:23.420> juice<00:00:24.260> is<00:00:24.410> another<00:00:24.680> word<00:00:24.860> for

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
electricity juice is another word for

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.490 
electricity juice is another word for
electricity<00:00:25.490> oh<00:00:28.810> where<00:00:29.810> does<00:00:30.020> lectricity

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
electricity oh where does lectricity

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.970 
electricity oh where does lectricity
come<00:00:30.950> from<00:00:32.320> well<00:00:33.320> it<00:00:33.379> mostly<00:00:33.620> comes<00:00:33.710> from

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
come from well it mostly comes from

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.180 
come from well it mostly comes from
something<00:00:34.220> moving<00:00:34.699> water<00:00:36.129> wind<00:00:37.420> steam

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
something moving water wind steam

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.080 
something moving water wind steam
anything<00:00:40.190> that<00:00:40.309> moves<00:00:40.489> can<00:00:40.670> create

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
anything that moves can create

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.770 
anything that moves can create
electricity<00:00:41.660> what<00:00:42.410> about<00:00:42.620> me<00:00:43.510> what<00:00:44.510> about<00:00:44.600> you

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
electricity what about me what about you

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.250 
electricity what about me what about you
I<00:00:45.140> move<00:00:45.920> can<00:00:46.309> I<00:00:46.339> make<00:00:46.550> electricity<00:00:46.989> well<00:00:47.989> like

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
I move can I make electricity well like

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.820 
I move can I make electricity well like
I<00:00:48.410> guess<00:00:48.620> a<00:00:48.650> little<00:00:48.949> I<00:00:49.309> don't<00:00:49.729> know<00:00:49.850> oh<00:00:50.769> how<00:00:51.769> do

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:51.830 
I guess a little I don't know oh how do

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.479 
I guess a little I don't know oh how do
they<00:00:52.100> make<00:00:52.309> electricity<00:00:53.559> well<00:00:54.559> there's<00:00:55.040> water

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
they make electricity well there's water

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.579 
they make electricity well there's water
power<00:00:55.820> that's<00:00:56.239> where<00:00:56.420> water<00:00:56.809> is<00:00:56.930> rushing<00:00:57.260> down

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
power that's where water is rushing down

00:00:57.589 --> 00:00:59.560 
power that's where water is rushing down
a<00:00:57.619> big<00:00:58.040> river<00:00:58.339> and<00:00:58.460> it<00:00:58.699> turns<00:00:58.970> these<00:00:59.210> big

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
a big river and it turns these big

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.189 
a big river and it turns these big
machines<00:00:59.750> that<00:01:00.379> create<00:01:00.860> electricity<00:01:01.519> oh<00:01:02.199> and

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
machines that create electricity oh and

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:04.660 
machines that create electricity oh and
then<00:01:03.320> there's<00:01:03.500> wind<00:01:03.710> power<00:01:03.979> that's<00:01:04.369> where<00:01:04.549> the

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
then there's wind power that's where the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.460 
then there's wind power that's where the
wind<00:01:04.850> blows<00:01:05.000> those<00:01:05.479> windmills<00:01:05.930> like<00:01:06.229> the<00:01:06.320> ones

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
wind blows those windmills like the ones

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.719 
wind blows those windmills like the ones
we<00:01:06.590> see<00:01:06.710> on<00:01:06.799> the<00:01:06.890> way<00:01:06.979> to<00:01:07.040> uncle<00:01:07.310> Pete's<00:01:07.520> house

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
we see on the way to uncle Pete's house

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.899 
we see on the way to uncle Pete's house
ah<00:01:09.040> and<00:01:10.040> then<00:01:10.159> there's<00:01:10.310> nuclear<00:01:10.520> energy

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
ah and then there's nuclear energy

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.390 
ah and then there's nuclear energy
that's<00:01:11.900> where<00:01:12.049> they<00:01:12.170> split<00:01:12.530> atoms<00:01:12.710> to<00:01:13.159> create

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
that's where they split atoms to create

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.630 
that's where they split atoms to create
electricity<00:01:13.970> oh

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.420 

then<00:01:17.979> yeah<00:01:18.979> it's<00:01:19.909> an<00:01:20.030> atom

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
then yeah it's an atom

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:28.500 
then yeah it's an atom
wow<00:01:22.030> it's<00:01:22.450> like<00:01:23.410> this<00:01:23.830> little<00:01:24.930> um<00:01:27.420> it's<00:01:28.420> like

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
wow it's like this little um it's like

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:35.120 
wow it's like this little um it's like
it's<00:01:28.780> like<00:01:28.840> a<00:01:28.960> little<00:01:29.170> thing<00:01:30.160> that<00:01:32.610> it's<00:01:33.610> um

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
it's like a little thing that it's um

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.940 
it's like a little thing that it's um
