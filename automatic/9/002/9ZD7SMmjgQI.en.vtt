00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
doing all these combos is because we've

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.249 
doing all these combos is because we've
learned<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:11.580> lot<00:00:11.759> of<00:00:11.820> basic<00:00:12.450> openings<00:00:13.019> and

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
learned a lot of basic openings and

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.560 
learned a lot of basic openings and
basic<00:00:13.920> closings<00:00:14.429> over<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.880> past<00:00:15.089> year<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:15.509> a

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
basic closings over the past year and a

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.800 
basic closings over the past year and a
half<00:00:15.599> or<00:00:15.990> so<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:17.119> those<00:00:18.119> are<00:00:18.300> all<00:00:18.480> great

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810

half or so and those are all great
things<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.410> learn<00:00:19.590> but<00:00:19.949> what's<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.310> point<00:00:20.520> if

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
things to learn but what's the point if

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.790 
things to learn but what's the point if
we<00:00:20.850> can't<00:00:21.000> connect<00:00:21.900> them<00:00:22.109> into<00:00:22.529> our<00:00:22.560> own

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
we can't connect them into our own

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.670 
we can't connect them into our own
combos<00:00:23.310> or<00:00:23.550> our<00:00:23.699> own<00:00:23.850> free<00:00:24.119> styles<00:00:24.600> so<00:00:25.170> in

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
like my red one is because it was kind

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.679 
like my red one is because it was kind
of<00:01:21.810> like<00:01:21.960> unique<00:01:22.500> Calvin<00:01:23.040> nation<00:01:23.450> not<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.509> whole

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
of like unique Calvin nation not a whole

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.510 
of like unique Calvin nation not a whole
lot<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.869> people<00:01:25.020> did<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.439> red<00:01:25.650> but<00:01:26.310> with<00:01:26.430> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
lot of people did the red but with the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.310 
lot of people did the red but with the
black<00:01:26.790> there's<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.450> lot<00:01:27.630> more<00:01:27.750> focus<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.259> the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
black there's a lot more focus on the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.890 
black there's a lot more focus on the
hands<00:01:28.829> it's<00:01:29.009> probably<00:01:29.340> easier<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.850> see<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.390> to

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
hands it's probably easier to see and to

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.740 
hands it's probably easier to see and to
follow<00:01:31.110> along<00:01:31.500> but<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:33.270> know<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.390> think<00:01:33.689> I

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
follow along but you know I think I

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.990 
follow along but you know I think I
actually<00:01:33.869> like<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.350> black<00:01:34.560> better<00:01:34.860> but<00:01:35.250> it's

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
actually like the black better but it's

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.289 
actually like the black better but it's
not<00:01:36.210> original<00:01:37.220> but<00:01:38.220> anyway<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.610> guys<00:01:38.880> decide

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
we're going to be holding the bow song

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.690 
we're going to be holding the bow song
in<00:02:13.410> this<00:02:13.530> position<00:02:14.040> we're<00:02:14.220> going<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.370> have<00:02:14.460> our

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
in this position we're going to have our

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.090 
in this position we're going to have our
palm<00:02:14.910> down<00:02:15.240> bite<00:02:15.870> handle<00:02:16.200> up<00:02:16.380> safe<00:02:16.800> handle

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
palm down bite handle up safe handle

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.460 
palm down bite handle up safe handle
down<00:02:17.280> so<00:02:17.610> we<00:02:17.730> are<00:02:17.970> starting<00:02:18.270> with<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:19.230> bite

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
down so we are starting with the bite

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.350 
down so we are starting with the bite
handle<00:02:19.860> instead<00:02:20.160> of<00:02:20.520> our<00:02:20.700> typical<00:02:20.910> safe

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
handle instead of our typical safe

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.210 
handle instead of our typical safe
handle<00:02:21.780> now<00:02:22.320> from<00:02:22.530> here<00:02:22.740> we<00:02:22.980> are<00:02:23.010> basically

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
handle now from here we are basically

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.180 
handle now from here we are basically
going<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.760> be<00:02:23.940> doing<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.480> index<00:02:24.960> rollover<00:02:25.590> but

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
going to be doing a index rollover but

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.610 
going to be doing a index rollover but
instead<00:02:26.460> of<00:02:26.520> doing<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:27.210> typical<00:02:27.620> vertical

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
instead of doing the typical vertical

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.350 
instead of doing the typical vertical
rollover<00:02:29.130> we<00:02:29.310> would<00:02:29.400> be<00:02:29.490> doing<00:02:29.670> the

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
rollover we would be doing the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.840 
rollover we would be doing the
horizontal<00:02:31.230> one<00:02:31.380> so<00:02:32.100> what<00:02:32.430> that's<00:02:32.580> going<00:02:32.730> to

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
horizontal one so what that's going to

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.790 
horizontal one so what that's going to
look<00:02:33.000> like<00:02:33.030> is<00:02:33.360> this<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:34.320> can<00:02:34.470> see<00:02:34.650> that

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
look like is this and you can see that

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.530 
look like is this and you can see that
it<00:02:34.920> did<00:02:35.100> not<00:02:35.130> come<00:02:35.490> all<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.850> way<00:02:35.880> back<00:02:36.240> up

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
it did not come all the way back up

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.500 
it did not come all the way back up
nor<00:02:37.200> did<00:02:37.410> I<00:02:37.560> do<00:02:37.880> rollover<00:02:38.880> around<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.300> thumb

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
nor did I do rollover around the thumb

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.270 
nor did I do rollover around the thumb
what<00:02:40.290> you're<00:02:40.410> going<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.560> do<00:02:40.800> after<00:02:41.100> that

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
what you're going to do after that

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.100 
what you're going to do after that
initial<00:02:41.850> rollout<00:02:42.300> is<00:02:42.590> you're<00:02:43.590> going<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:45.110> let

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
initial rollout is you're going to let

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.620 
initial rollout is you're going to let
the<00:02:46.580> bite<00:02:47.580> handle<00:02:47.970> in<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.180> spine<00:02:48.390> of<00:02:48.420> the

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
the bite handle in the spine of the

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.990 
the bite handle in the spine of the
blade<00:02:48.810> move<00:02:49.560> towards<00:02:50.010> your<00:02:50.130> thumb<00:02:50.370> but<00:02:50.820> as

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
blade move towards your thumb but as

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.750 
blade move towards your thumb but as
they<00:02:51.210> get<00:02:51.330> closer<00:02:51.660> you're<00:02:52.080> going<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.290> reduce

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
they get closer you're going to reduce

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.600 
they get closer you're going to reduce
your<00:02:53.760> grip<00:02:54.600> on<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:55.140> safe<00:02:55.440> handle<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.070> what's

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
your grip on the safe handle and what's

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.010 
your grip on the safe handle and what's
that<00:02:56.790> what<00:02:57.060> that's<00:02:57.210> going<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:57.480> do<00:02:57.690> is<00:02:57.840> it's

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
that what that's going to do is it's

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.710 
that what that's going to do is it's
going<00:02:58.110> to<00:02:58.170> allow<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.970> bite<00:03:00.210> handle<00:03:00.570> in

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
going to allow the the bite handle in

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.380 
going to allow the the bite handle in
the<00:03:00.810> blade<00:03:01.080> to<00:03:01.410> pass<00:03:01.860> between<00:03:02.130> your<00:03:02.460> wrist<00:03:02.700> so

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
what that's going to look like is this

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.580 
what that's going to look like is this
and<00:03:05.930> you're<00:03:06.930> going<00:03:07.050> to<00:03:07.080> land<00:03:07.320> in<00:03:07.470> this

the thumb that's exactly what we're

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.410 
the thumb that's exactly what we're
going<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:25.620> do<00:03:25.830> so<00:03:26.459> let<00:03:26.640> it<00:03:26.730> roll<00:03:26.880> over<00:03:27.180> around

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
going to do so let it roll over around

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.520

catching the bite handle now you can see

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.199 
catching the bite handle now you can see
that<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.709> edge<00:03:31.860> is<00:03:32.190> moving<00:03:32.790> towards<00:03:33.120> your

behind the 8-ball the last two rollovers
and<00:04:46.199> then<00:04:46.380> the<00:04:46.740> finishing<00:04:47.150> wrist<00:04:48.150> pass<00:04:48.360> so

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
again here just simply rollover around

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.120 
again here just simply rollover around
the<00:04:52.320> wrist<00:04:52.560> you've<00:04:53.370> caught<00:04:53.639> the<00:04:53.760> bite<00:04:53.970> handle

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
the wrist you've caught the bite handle

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.550 
the wrist you've caught the bite handle
wrist<00:04:56.130> pass<00:04:56.400> and<00:04:56.760> catch<00:04:57.330> up<00:04:57.630> in<00:04:57.780> this<00:04:57.990> position

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
wrist pass and catch up in this position

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.480 
wrist pass and catch up in this position
so<00:04:59.190> again<00:04:59.580> just<00:04:59.820> to<00:05:00.419> break<00:05:00.660> it<00:05:00.810> down<00:05:00.960> once<00:05:01.350> more

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
so again just to break it down once more

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:07.370 
so again just to break it down once more
bite<00:05:02.490> handle<00:05:02.940> wrist<00:05:03.600> pass<00:05:05.240> rollover<00:05:06.380> wrist

roll over wrist pass and catch

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.320 
roll over wrist pass and catch
so<00:05:15.270> basically<00:05:16.229> wrist<00:05:17.039> passed<00:05:17.310> and<00:05:17.580> rollovers

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330

so basically wrist passed and rollovers
that's<00:05:18.599> all<00:05:18.840> it<00:05:18.960> is<00:05:19.139> it's<00:05:19.830> a<00:05:20.010> lot<00:05:20.250> easier<00:05:20.520> if

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
that's all it is it's a lot easier if

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.580 
that's all it is it's a lot easier if
you<00:05:21.240> know<00:05:21.479> behind<00:05:21.810> the<00:05:21.960> 8-ball<00:05:22.349> so<00:05:22.560> I

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
you know behind the 8-ball so I

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.850 
you know behind the 8-ball so I
definitely<00:05:22.889> suggest<00:05:23.220> checking<00:05:23.580> that<00:05:24.030> out
