00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:15.139
 the novel that I am going to tell you is a science fiction story 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.630
 of the master of the genre isaac asimov 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.750
 edited by espasa in 1956 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.279
 it is titled I do not vote 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:26.220
 the topic 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.630
 of course they are 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.960
 this word of Czech origin 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.440
 that was introduced is given in all languages 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.060
 It was used for the first time in 1920 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.060
 by the playwright karel capek 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.370
 gary thomas word that isaac asimov and with that base the word is created 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.510
 robotics 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.540
 that years later it was quickly accepted and if they were fools 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.140
 this great novel you start with an anthology of short stories all 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.450
 with a robotic theme 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.640
 it's really a single novel 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.710
 composed of nine stories 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.480
 who tell the story 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.760
 from the beginnings of the hoop 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.630
 In the not too distant future 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.930
 in the form of a report to the largest probos and colors of all 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:19.750
 time 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.260
 susan calvin 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.700
 they are telling us a series of significant meanings adventures 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
 falk ken were given in the history of robotics 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.510
 the study of the first 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.750
 in this novel 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.870
 also appear for the first time that the three laws of robotics 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.560
 created by asimo 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.540
 remember the 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.120
 the first law says 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.030
 that a robot 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.920
 it can not harm a human being 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.500
 nor allow a human being to suffer harm due to his inaction 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.680
 the second law says that a robot 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.200
 must obey the orders of a human being 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.390
 as long as 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.250
 this does not contradict the first law 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.530
 the third law 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.520
 says that the robots 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.519
 protect your physical integrity always when this does not enter opposition 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.519
 with the first olesen 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:15.889
 It's very important 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:17.729
 consider 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:21.929
 that every story or novel about robots written by isaac asimov 

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:25.789
 if it passes and resolves intelligently 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.040
 It is also very important 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.109
 consider 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:33.349
 that this novel 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.009
 I robot those mother novels 

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:38.549
 of the rest of the novels 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.679
 why do I say this 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:44.039
 because these stories are basically simple 

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:46.749
 and the conflicts that arise 

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:48.270
 based on trends 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.099
 they are also without 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.329
 this way we're going to go 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.289
 surpassing the subtleties 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:58.779
 that may arise later with respect to the species 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:02.149
 let's get to understand the nation 

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:04.599
 all its breadth 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.599
 and it is the world this first novel your robot 

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:13.159
 one has the necessary understanding of the three laws to follow you 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:14.509
 gradual way 

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:17.350
 wishing the whole series of robot novels 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.279
 10th 

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:21.749
 that are becoming increasingly complex 

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:22.769
 I do not vote 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.269
 despite being a robbery novel it is not about cybernetics 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.449
 but of psychology 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:32.659
 that for this author is the most important part of the clothes 

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:35.379
 and we do not just talk 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:36.970
 on the other side psychology 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.549
 human psychology 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.779
 with a fundamental role in this 

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:43.029
 awareness 

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:44.119
 in a robbery 

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:46.139
 that central theme of the year 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.279
 morality ethics 

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:53.349
 that, from the east, there are interpretations that lead to 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:58.069
 the different characters when facing situations of all kinds 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.379
 dangerous comics 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:01.409
 tiermes 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:02.539
 drastic 

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:06.019
 paradoxical disturbing 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.919
 with isaac asimov the resolution of riddles never stays out 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:12.219
 In summary 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:15.789
 this student the early days of robotics 

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:18.539
 since the robberies could not even talk 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:22.109
 and until they interposed between soul unity and its destruction 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.580
 in these times when you could still sign that the whole conflict 

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:31.419
 they could be preventable 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.409
 if we continue in that world 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:35.499
 the flowers that follow 

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:39.639
 10ยบ we will check that in the tournament conflicts can be avoided 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:42.810
 and what is needed is not even more 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.810
 powerful to protect germany the cimi 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.030
 and maybe the worst thing that can happen to a human being is to have immigration
