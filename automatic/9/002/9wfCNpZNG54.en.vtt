00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
sadness do you think the awareness squad

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.140 
sadness do you think the awareness squad
by<00:03:50.440> who<00:03:50.500> killed<00:03:50.920> left<00:03:51.190> a<00:03:51.280> car<00:03:51.490> will<00:03:51.910> have<00:03:52.030> any

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
by who killed left a car will have any

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.370 
by who killed left a car will have any
difference<00:03:52.540> I<00:03:53.250> hope<00:03:54.250> so<00:03:54.550> I<00:03:54.730> mean<00:03:55.020> you<00:03:56.020> know<00:03:56.140> I

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380

it's<00:04:29.410> not<00:04:29.590> something<00:04:29.860> like<00:04:30.130> the<00:04:30.220> hybrid<00:04:30.430> or

we<00:04:37.389> could<00:04:37.539> ever<00:04:37.750> imagine<00:04:37.930> using<00:04:38.710> it<00:04:38.830> it's<00:04:39.310> not

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
we could ever imagine using it it's not

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.779 
we could ever imagine using it it's not
is<00:04:39.940> it<00:04:39.970> more<00:04:40.270> expensive<00:04:40.780> than<00:04:41.080> gas<00:04:41.229> oh<00:04:41.789> yeah

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
is it more expensive than gas oh yeah

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:44.939 
is it more expensive than gas oh yeah
hydrogen<00:04:43.539> right<00:04:43.690> now<00:04:43.840> hydrogen<00:04:44.110> is<00:04:44.500> not<00:04:44.770> an

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:44.949 
hydrogen right now hydrogen is not an

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:47.879 
hydrogen right now hydrogen is not an
option<00:04:45.430> hydrogen<00:04:46.389> the<00:04:46.780> hydrogen<00:04:46.810> option<00:04:47.680> is

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
option hydrogen the hydrogen option is

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.790 
option hydrogen the hydrogen option is
is<00:04:48.130> an<00:04:48.280> excuse<00:04:48.699> to<00:04:48.849> prolong<00:04:49.360> to<00:04:49.599> put<00:04:49.900> off<00:04:50.080> the

is an excuse to prolong to put off the

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.790 
is an excuse to prolong to put off the
options<00:04:51.310> of<00:04:51.930> to<00:04:52.930> put<00:04:53.139> off<00:04:53.259> change

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
options of to put off change

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.800 
options of to put off change
it's<00:04:53.979> a<00:04:54.099> these<00:04:54.849> are<00:04:55.000> people<00:04:55.210> who<00:04:55.330> don't<00:04:55.569> want

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
it's a these are people who don't want

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.629 
it's a these are people who don't want
this<00:04:55.990> to<00:04:56.139> change<00:04:56.169> in<00:04:56.620> the<00:04:56.710> short<00:04:56.889> run<00:04:57.130> because

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
this to change in the short run because

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.760 
this to change in the short run because
there's<00:04:57.970> too<00:04:58.180> much<00:04:58.300> money<00:04:58.599> to<00:04:58.750> be<00:04:58.870> made<00:04:58.900> on<00:04:59.289> the

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
there's too much money to be made on the

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.980 
there's too much money to be made on the
status<00:05:00.130> quo<00:05:00.310> so<00:05:01.120> hydrogen<00:05:01.449> is<00:05:01.599> a<00:05:01.690> way<00:05:01.780> to<00:05:01.840> say

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
status quo so hydrogen is a way to say

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.990 
status quo so hydrogen is a way to say
yeah<00:05:02.139> I'm<00:05:02.289> green<00:05:02.620> and<00:05:02.919> I'm<00:05:03.370> really<00:05:03.610> gonna<00:05:03.759> put

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
yeah I'm green and I'm really gonna put

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.129 
yeah I'm green and I'm really gonna put
a<00:05:04.030> lot<00:05:04.180> of<00:05:04.300> effort<00:05:04.509> and<00:05:04.599> time<00:05:04.810> into<00:05:04.870> this

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:05.139 
a lot of effort and time into this

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:07.080 
a lot of effort and time into this
hydrogen<00:05:05.380> thing<00:05:05.560> but<00:05:05.680> it's<00:05:05.800> it's<00:05:06.370> it<00:05:06.669> best

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
hydrogen thing but it's it's it best

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.330 
hydrogen thing but it's it's it best
estimates<00:05:07.569> 15<00:05:07.870> years<00:05:08.050> away<00:05:08.289> you're<00:05:09.130> so
