00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.310
 parsing for the project Sung time point ru 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.230
 Hello everyone, let's go straight to 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:05.620
 parsing and so we hold the fifth on the second 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.620
 4 on 4 and third on fourth 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:15.090
 playing 5 4 3 4 next 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.640
 hold the third string on the third fret 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.340
 middle finger let go of the little finger 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:28.540
 and pull the third string and then do 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:32.040
 hummer on 4 frets little finger play 5 4 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:36.320
 third fourth doing hamster 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.320
 then play 4 3 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:47.260
 5 4 3 4 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.260
 number 4 3 again 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.680
 and 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.540
 you 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.450
 go further index finger hold 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.310
 the sixth string in the second fret 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:08.649
 We play the same thing only in bass 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:11.340
 we are now the sixth string note 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.340
 first chord 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.879
 2 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.020
 Further, the third chord is essentially we need 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.350
 just press 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.060
 the sixth string on the fourth fret but it 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.700
 inconvenient to make the index finger 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.400
 so we will change a few fingers q 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.330
 that is, we will hold the sixth string on 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.480
 fourth fret 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.340
 middle finger but at this moment with 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.730
 Hammer third string, we will keep 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.820
 forefinger and play all too 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.820
 the most 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.530
 let's connect part 1 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.930
 2 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.450
 the third 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.349
 further 4 let go of the middle finger he we 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.209
 we will play the sixth open 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:07.360
 and with the index we press the second string 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:11.820
 on the second fret we play like this 6 4 3 4 2 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.820
 3 2 3 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:21.220
 6 4 3 4 2 3 4 3 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.400
 again 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:39.099
 and go again then goes the bridge between to 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.400
 so at the first we clamp barre on 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:44.010
 fourth fret and we clamp 3 and 4 strings 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.330
 on the sixth fret 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.930
 play the same sort as we play 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:54.870
 The last part of the verse is this one 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.870
 only 5 strings and play twice 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.150
 further we shift all this in the seventh mode 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.150
 play again 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.940
 and then play a chord e and on it 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.480
 spend 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.480
 all times bridge 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:27.060
 next comes the refrain the refrain is played on 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:30.190
 such chords chord already fps gillies 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.770
 minor and chord e 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.790
 play three hits and then so little 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.790
 knocking two blows 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:59.020
