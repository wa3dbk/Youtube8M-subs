00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
so this was one of our major

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.929 
so this was one of our major
announcements<00:00:19.800> at<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.070> at<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.699> show

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
announcements at the at the show

announcements at the at the show
yesterday<00:00:21.769> this<00:00:22.769> is<00:00:22.890> something<00:00:23.010> called<00:00:23.250> the

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
yesterday this is something called the

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.259 
yesterday this is something called the
meisler<00:00:23.880> module<00:00:24.300> it's<00:00:24.869> named<00:00:25.170> after<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:26.269> camera

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
meisler module it's named after a camera

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.000 
meisler module it's named after a camera
assistant<00:00:27.660> who<00:00:27.779> actually<00:00:27.990> was<00:00:28.890> the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
assistant who actually was the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.859 
assistant who actually was the
inspiration<00:00:29.310> for<00:00:29.849> building<00:00:30.330> something<00:00:30.630> that

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
inspiration for building something that

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.959 
inspiration for building something that
would<00:00:30.990> be<00:00:31.140> really<00:00:31.470> really<00:00:31.650> streamlined<00:00:32.250> to

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
would be really really streamlined to

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.910 
would be really really streamlined to
handle<00:00:33.600> all<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.110> things<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.680> used

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
handle all of the things that you used

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.620 
handle all of the things that you used
to<00:00:35.040> have<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.340> deal<00:00:35.550> with<00:00:35.760> four<00:00:36.300> or<00:00:36.450> five

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
to have to deal with four or five

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.410 
to have to deal with four or five
different<00:00:37.020> systems<00:00:37.469> for<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:38.340> know<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
different systems for you know the the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.270 
different systems for you know the the
focus<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.840> resume<00:00:40.200> control<00:00:40.440> had<00:00:40.860> all<00:00:41.100> these

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
stuff the external time code box was an

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.720 
stuff the external time code box was an
external<00:00:46.860> piece<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.280> had<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.489> put<00:00:47.640> on

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
external piece that you had to put on

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.150 
external piece that you had to put on
the<00:00:47.850> camera<00:00:48.149> if<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.230> wanted<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.559> do<00:00:49.739> any<00:00:49.980> kind

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
the camera if you wanted to do any kind

of video transmission a live HD video
feed<00:00:53.070> while<00:00:53.309> you're<00:00:53.460> shooting<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.820> raw<00:00:53.969> that

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
feed while you're shooting the raw that

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.910 
feed while you're shooting the raw that
was<00:00:54.600> an<00:00:54.719> extra<00:00:54.960> piece<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.440> before<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.739> knew

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
was an extra piece and before you knew

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.310 
was an extra piece and before you knew
it<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.579> small<00:00:56.910> little<00:00:57.090> epic<00:00:57.449> started<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.170> turn

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
it the small little epic started to turn

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.959 
it the small little epic started to turn
into<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.649> giant<00:00:59.280> thing<00:00:59.309> with<00:00:59.609> all<00:00:59.820> these

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
into this giant thing with all these

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.639 
into this giant thing with all these
cables<00:01:00.420> around<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:01.020> what<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.350> see<00:01:01.620> right

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
cables around it so what you see right

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.770 
cables around it so what you see right
now<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:02.070> this<00:01:02.609> system<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.090> actually<00:01:03.270> feeding

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
now is this system is actually feeding

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.890 
now is this system is actually feeding
and<00:01:04.019> wireless<00:01:04.589> HD<00:01:05.489> HD<00:01:06.180> signal<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.720> this

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
and wireless HD HD signal to this

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.200 
and wireless HD HD signal to this
display<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:08.040> there's<00:01:08.220> no<00:01:08.369> physical<00:01:08.670> cable

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
display so there's no physical cable

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.850 
display so there's no physical cable
going<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:10.170> can<00:01:10.320> see<00:01:10.439> there<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.650> no

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
going and you can see there is no

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.160 
going and you can see there is no
latency<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.820> instant<00:01:12.330> right<00:01:12.960> it's<00:01:13.110> a

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
latency this is instant right it's a

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.050 
latency this is instant right it's a
true<00:01:13.470> video<00:01:13.830> monitor<00:01:14.250> but<00:01:14.430> wireless<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.939> can

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
true video monitor but wireless it can

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.940 
true video monitor but wireless it can
run<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.210> hundred<00:01:15.509> feet<00:01:15.540> away<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:16.530> can<00:01:16.680> go<00:01:16.830> over

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
run a hundred feet away it can go over

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.090 
run a hundred feet away it can go over
HD<00:01:17.400> IO<00:01:17.490> SDI<00:01:17.939> or<00:01:18.060> HDMI<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:19.409> also<00:01:19.560> has<00:01:19.740> wireless

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
HD IO SDI or HDMI it also has wireless

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.719 
HD IO SDI or HDMI it also has wireless
timecode<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.509> becomes<00:01:22.080> your

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
timecode so this becomes your

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.399 
timecode so this becomes your
centralized<00:01:23.729> master<00:01:24.540> time<00:01:24.810> code<00:01:25.080> for<00:01:25.380> a

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
centralized master time code for a

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.580 
centralized master time code for a
double<00:01:25.830> system<00:01:26.130> sound<00:01:26.340> shoot<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.590> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
timecode that's feeding into the world

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.390 
timecode that's feeding into the world
is<00:01:30.720> feeding<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.380> our<00:01:31.500> sound<00:01:31.740> recorder<00:01:32.130> feeding

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
is feeding to our sound recorder feeding

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.670 
is feeding to our sound recorder feeding
to<00:01:32.490> our<00:01:32.579> camera<00:01:32.970> it's<00:01:33.360> hyper<00:01:33.720> hyper<00:01:34.079> accurate

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
to our camera it's hyper hyper accurate

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
raw which of course shoots on our mag we

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.219 
raw which of course shoots on our mag we
are<00:01:46.350> also<00:01:46.590> now<00:01:47.009> doing<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.430> proxy<00:01:48.210> recording<00:01:49.049> on

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
are also now doing a proxy recording on

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.230 
are also now doing a proxy recording on
this<00:01:49.470> miser<00:01:49.680> module<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.250> this<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.549> little

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
this miser module so this is a little

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.460 
this miser module so this is a little
miniature<00:01:51.659> version<00:01:52.049> which<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.200> called<00:01:52.380> the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
miniature version which is called the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.109 
miniature version which is called the
mini<00:01:52.619> mag<00:01:52.799> we'll<00:01:53.399> also<00:01:53.549> build<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:54.000> little

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
mini mag we'll also build a little

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.420 
mini mag we'll also build a little
adapter<00:01:54.420> for<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.649> go<00:01:55.740> into<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.070> larger

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
adapter for this to go into the larger

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.459 
adapter for this to go into the larger
reader<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.909> then<00:01:57.570> there's<00:01:57.719> modes<00:01:58.110> in<00:01:58.380> the

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
reader and then there's modes in the

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.069

would normally slate and that's how you

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:37.620 
would normally slate and that's how you
slayed<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.550> image<00:02:36.790> now<00:02:37.120> what's<00:02:37.330> even<00:02:37.599> more

exciting is I'm actually connected to

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.380 
exciting is I'm actually connected to
the<00:02:41.440> camera<00:02:41.890> via<00:02:42.099> the<00:02:42.250> ipad<00:02:42.610> so<00:02:43.209> I<00:02:43.239> have

used to do on all my menus right I have
control<00:02:48.400> of<00:02:48.430> it<00:02:48.670> from<00:02:48.880> the<00:02:49.030> iPads<00:02:49.390> I<00:02:49.569> can<00:02:49.810> also

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
control of it from the iPads I can also

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.550 
control of it from the iPads I can also
go<00:02:51.310> into<00:02:51.610> a<00:02:51.760> look<00:02:52.030> menu<00:02:52.450> so<00:02:52.900> while<00:02:53.350> I'm

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
go into a look menu so while I'm

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
shooting or when I'm setting up a shot I

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.630 
shooting or when I'm setting up a shot I
can<00:02:56.260> go<00:02:56.410> through<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.680> sliders<00:02:57.160> and<00:02:57.190> you<00:02:57.489> can

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
can go through the sliders and you can

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.830 
can go through the sliders and you can
see<00:02:57.790> that<00:02:57.819> i'm<00:02:58.030> actually<00:02:58.180> changing<00:02:58.660> that<00:02:58.720> in

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
see that i'm actually changing that in

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.140 
see that i'm actually changing that in
real<00:02:58.959> time<00:02:59.200> see<00:02:59.349> how<00:02:59.440> that's<00:02:59.620> moving<00:03:00.060> so<00:03:01.060> i'm

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
real time see how that's moving so i'm

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.720 
real time see how that's moving so i'm
actually<00:03:01.330> recording<00:03:01.840> that<00:03:01.900> in<00:03:02.049> real<00:03:02.170> time<00:03:02.730> so

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
actually recording that in real time so

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.280 
actually recording that in real time so
i<00:03:03.790> should<00:03:03.910> have<00:03:04.000> a<00:03:04.030> curve<00:03:04.360> editor<00:03:04.630> right<00:03:05.049> in

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
i should have a curve editor right in

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.140 
i should have a curve editor right in
the<00:03:05.380> ipad<00:03:05.620> app<00:03:05.799> too<00:03:05.980> so<00:03:06.459> you<00:03:06.549> get<00:03:06.700> very<00:03:07.000> very

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
the ipad app too so you get very very

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.000 
the ipad app too so you get very very
sophisticated<00:03:07.420> color<00:03:07.930> control<00:03:08.260> right<00:03:08.530> you

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
sophisticated color control right you

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.009 
sophisticated color control right you
actually<00:03:09.130> have<00:03:09.400> individual<00:03:10.150> color<00:03:10.390> curves<00:03:10.690> I

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
actually have individual color curves I

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.720 
actually have individual color curves I
can<00:03:11.440> change<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:11.830> gamma<00:03:12.040> space<00:03:12.370> a<00:03:12.400> lot<00:03:12.610> of

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
can change the gamma space a lot of

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.430 
can change the gamma space a lot of
people<00:03:13.000> in<00:03:13.239> our<00:03:13.690> world<00:03:13.750> like<00:03:14.170> to<00:03:14.290> actually

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
people in our world like to actually

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.099 
people in our world like to actually
either<00:03:14.890> review<00:03:15.489> or<00:03:15.730> work<00:03:16.060> in<00:03:16.269> a<00:03:16.360> red<00:03:16.540> log<00:03:16.720> film

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.410 
either review or work in a red log film
mode<00:03:17.470> so<00:03:18.100> we<00:03:18.220> have<00:03:18.310> a<00:03:18.340> log<00:03:18.549> space<00:03:18.880> mode<00:03:19.120> for<00:03:19.359> the

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
mode so we have a log space mode for the

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.910 
mode so we have a log space mode for the
camera<00:03:19.690> so<00:03:19.810> I<00:03:19.870> can<00:03:19.900> just<00:03:20.049> hop<00:03:20.290> in<00:03:20.560> and<00:03:20.709> out<00:03:20.769> of

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.080 
just say import the look into the system
and<00:03:34.690> once<00:03:35.470> the<00:03:35.680> once<00:03:36.040> i<00:03:36.190> import<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:36.730> look<00:03:36.910> i

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
and once the once i import the look i

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.849 
and once the once i import the look i
just<00:03:37.120> hop<00:03:37.420> back<00:03:37.450> in<00:03:37.780> there<00:03:37.959> and<00:03:38.079> it<00:03:38.470> just<00:03:38.650> shows

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
just hop back in there and it just shows

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:41.990 
just hop back in there and it just shows
up<00:03:38.890> so<00:03:39.790> that's<00:03:40.060> like<00:03:40.329> the<00:03:40.600> warm<00:03:40.810> red<00:03:41.049> look<00:03:41.260> that

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.830 
up so that's like the warm red look that
