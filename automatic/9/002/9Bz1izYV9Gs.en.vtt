00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
because it's too much too intense so

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.470

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
that their threshold for thrill three

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.180 
that their threshold for thrill three
children<00:03:48.329> thrill<00:03:48.569> is<00:03:48.989> a<00:03:49.049> lot<00:03:49.409> lower<00:03:49.680> than<00:03:49.829> the

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
children thrill is a lot lower than the

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.809 
children thrill is a lot lower than the
u.s.<00:03:50.489> is<00:03:50.700> like<00:03:51.030> every<00:03:51.329> ride<00:03:51.540> is<00:03:51.780> very<00:03:52.379> tame
