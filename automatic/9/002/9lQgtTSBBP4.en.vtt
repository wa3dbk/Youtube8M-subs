if<00:00:01.740> you're<00:00:01.890> anything<00:00:02.159> like<00:00:02.429> is<00:00:02.790> our<00:00:03.120> van

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
if you're anything like is our van

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.450 
if you're anything like is our van
hasn't<00:00:04.200> got<00:00:05.270> heating<00:00:06.270> as<00:00:06.690> such<00:00:07.200> so<00:00:08.099> we<00:00:08.130> need<00:00:08.370> to

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
hasn't got heating as such so we need to

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.100 
hasn't got heating as such so we need to
take<00:00:08.610> some<00:00:08.849> kind<00:00:09.030> of<00:00:09.210> heating<00:00:09.599> with<00:00:09.780> us<00:00:09.929> when

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
take some kind of heating with us when

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.890 
take some kind of heating with us when
the<00:00:10.230> weather<00:00:10.380> is<00:00:10.469> cold<00:00:11.090> but<00:00:12.090> you<00:00:12.330> obviously

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
the weather is cold but you obviously

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.400 
the weather is cold but you obviously
need<00:00:13.410> electrical<00:00:14.309> so<00:00:15.150> this<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:16.049> what<00:00:16.230> we've

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
need electrical so this is what we've

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.740 
need electrical so this is what we've
bought<00:00:16.680> it's<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.520> little<00:00:17.850> oil<00:00:18.150> filled<00:00:19.400> radiator

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
bought it's a little oil filled radiator

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.160 
bought it's a little oil filled radiator
we've<00:00:21.750> got<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:21.990> from<00:00:22.140> Argos<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.640> was<00:00:24.170> 24

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
we've got it from Argos and it was 24

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.830 
we've got it from Argos and it was 24
pound<00:00:25.590> nineteen<00:00:26.369> nine<00:00:26.670> I<00:00:26.699> think<00:00:27.090> nearly<00:00:27.359> 25

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
pound nineteen nine I think nearly 25

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.830 
pound nineteen nine I think nearly 25
pound<00:00:28.279> it's<00:00:29.279> ideal<00:00:29.730> really<00:00:30.060> for<00:00:30.240> what<00:00:30.480> we<00:00:30.630> want

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
pound it's ideal really for what we want

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.410 
pound it's ideal really for what we want
with<00:00:30.990> Troy<00:00:31.230> detail<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:32.579> it's<00:00:32.759> it's<00:00:33.239> quite

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
with Troy detail and it's it's quite

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.319 
with Troy detail and it's it's quite
good<00:00:33.510> it's<00:00:33.930> 800<00:00:34.530> walks<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.730> for<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.030> size

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
good it's 800 walks and for this size

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.530 
good it's 800 walks and for this size
van<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:37.170> will<00:00:37.410> get<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.829> van<00:00:38.010> quite<00:00:38.340> warm<00:00:38.670> last

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
van it will get the van quite warm last

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.940 
van it will get the van quite warm last
night<00:00:39.809> he<00:00:39.960> got<00:00:40.110> down<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.530> minus<00:00:40.890> 2.5<00:00:41.610> degrees

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
night he got down to minus 2.5 degrees

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.110 
night he got down to minus 2.5 degrees
and<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.219> was<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:44.969> was<00:00:45.030> ideal<00:00:45.719> really

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
and that was and this was ideal really

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.450 
and that was and this was ideal really
it<00:00:48.120> kept<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.690> van<00:00:48.840> nice<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.379> warm<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:49.980> even<00:00:50.370> at

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
it kept the van nice and warm so even at

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.369 
it kept the van nice and warm so even at
those<00:00:50.610> temperatures<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.420> does<00:00:51.600> keep<00:00:51.840> nice<00:00:52.110> and

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
those temperatures it does keep nice and

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:52.760 
those temperatures it does keep nice and
warm

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
warm

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.860 
warm
we've<00:00:53.309> got<00:00:53.520> on<00:00:54.239> here<00:00:54.539> there's<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.789> thermostat

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
we've got on here there's a thermostat

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.689 
we've got on here there's a thermostat
which<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:58.020> can<00:00:58.199> turn<00:00:58.440> up<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.949> minimum<00:00:59.550> and

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
which you can turn up to minimum and

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.580 
which you can turn up to minimum and
maximum<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.449> if<00:01:00.809> you're<00:01:00.899> feeling<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.230> bit<00:01:01.379> cold

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
maximum so if you're feeling a bit cold

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.399 
maximum so if you're feeling a bit cold
turn<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.579> up<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.480> will<00:01:03.629> heat<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.989> room<00:01:04.170> up

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
turn it up and it will heat the room up

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.100 
turn it up and it will heat the room up
to<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> certain<00:01:05.549> temperature<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.540> then<00:01:06.990> it

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
to a certain temperature and then it

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.859 
to a certain temperature and then it
will<00:01:07.229> switch<00:01:07.380> itself<00:01:07.680> off<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.570> sort<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.630> saves

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
will switch itself off so sort of saves

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.929 
will switch itself off so sort of saves
energy<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.470> way<00:01:10.680> little<00:01:11.400> on-off<00:01:11.670> switch

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
energy that way little on-off switch

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.380 
energy that way little on-off switch
there<00:01:12.330> it's<00:01:13.290> not<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.500> convector<00:01:14.100> radiator<00:01:15.030> so

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
there it's not a convector radiator so

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.480 
there it's not a convector radiator so
it<00:01:15.479> doesn't<00:01:15.720> throw<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:15.960> heat<00:01:16.259> out<00:01:16.530> but<00:01:17.400> it

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
it doesn't throw the heat out but it

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.940 
it doesn't throw the heat out but it
just<00:01:17.700> heats<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.270> actual<00:01:18.600> radiator<00:01:19.110> itself<00:01:19.350> up

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
just heats the actual radiator itself up

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.499 
just heats the actual radiator itself up
at<00:01:20.790> which<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.330> turn<00:01:21.780> eat<00:01:22.170> see<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:23.490> room<00:01:23.670> up<00:01:23.909> or

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
at which in turn eat see the room up or

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.499 
at which in turn eat see the room up or
the<00:01:24.689> van<00:01:24.900> in<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.439> case<00:01:25.680> it's<00:01:26.670> about<00:01:26.970> what

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
the van in this case it's about what

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.899 
the van in this case it's about what
would<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.780> say<00:01:28.110> well<00:01:28.829> there's<00:01:29.040> my<00:01:29.189> hand<00:01:29.549> so

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
would you say well there's my hand so

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.359 
would you say well there's my hand so
you<00:01:30.000> can<00:01:30.030> see<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.479> it's<00:01:31.049> really<00:01:31.380> small<00:01:31.829> so<00:01:32.189> it's

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
you can see it it's really small so it's

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.210 
you can see it it's really small so it's
just<00:01:32.520> nice<00:01:32.790> for<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.210> small<00:01:33.570> van<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.200> would<00:01:35.009> say

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
just nice for a small van I would say

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.690 
just nice for a small van I would say
it's<00:01:35.430> about<00:01:35.520> eighteen<00:01:36.119> inches<00:01:36.299> across<00:01:36.930> and

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700

it's about eighteen inches across and
probably<00:01:39.170> 18<00:01:40.170> inches<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.650> as<00:01:40.890> well<00:01:41.070> no<00:01:41.250> no<00:01:41.400> it's

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
probably 18 inches I as well no no it's

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.080 
probably 18 inches I as well no no it's
not<00:01:42.479> very<00:01:42.630> big<00:01:42.930> anyway<00:01:43.350> it's<00:01:43.829> 800<00:01:44.040> watts<00:01:44.759> and

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
not very big anyway it's 800 watts and

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.730 
not very big anyway it's 800 watts and
it<00:01:45.450> was<00:01:45.770> 24<00:01:46.770> pound<00:01:47.540> 95<00:01:48.540> from<00:01:48.899> Argos<00:01:49.350> but<00:01:49.590> I'm

only thing we have found about it is
this<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.560> only<00:02:01.680> negative<00:02:01.890> point<00:02:02.369> really

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
this is the only negative point really

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.690 
this is the only negative point really
on<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.630> end<00:02:03.930> here<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.799> gets<00:02:05.070> really<00:02:05.520> really

on this end here it gets really really

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.169 
on this end here it gets really really
hot<00:02:06.060> what<00:02:06.450> we<00:02:06.540> all<00:02:06.659> think<00:02:06.960> it's<00:02:07.200> hot<00:02:07.409> but<00:02:08.190> if

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
hot what we all think it's hot but if
