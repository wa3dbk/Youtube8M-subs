I'm from leafy gills and today we're
talking<00:00:09.420> about<00:00:09.780> running<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.769> aquaponic<00:00:11.429> system

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
talking about running a aquaponic system

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.970 
talking about running a aquaponic system
in<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:12.389> previous<00:00:12.750> video<00:00:12.900> we<00:00:13.259> told<00:00:13.590> you<00:00:13.740> what<00:00:13.950> a

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
in a previous video we told you what a

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.829 
in a previous video we told you what a
chop<00:00:14.400> system<00:00:14.849> is<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.240> now<00:00:15.389> I'm<00:00:15.509> going<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.660> let

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
chop system is and now I'm going to let

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.480 
chop system is and now I'm going to let
you<00:00:15.960> know<00:00:16.109> what<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.379> simple<00:00:16.949> flood<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.340> drain

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
you know what a simple flood and drain

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.240 
you know what a simple flood and drain
system<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.330> is<00:00:18.930> probably<00:00:19.859> one<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.160> most

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
system is it is probably one of the most

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.519 
system is it is probably one of the most
common<00:00:20.670> systems<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.570> do-it-yourself

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
common systems that a do-it-yourself

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.679 
common systems that a do-it-yourself
grower<00:00:22.800> will<00:00:23.100> do<00:00:23.279> or<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.640> home<00:00:24.000> grower<00:00:24.269> will<00:00:24.480> do

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
grower will do or a home grower will do

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.660 
grower will do or a home grower will do
because<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.740> works<00:00:25.890> really<00:00:26.070> well<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.519> it's

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
because it works really well and it's

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.609 
because it works really well and it's
very<00:00:26.730> very<00:00:27.119> simple<00:00:27.390> basically<00:00:28.320> what<00:00:28.529> you're

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
very very simple basically what you're

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.439 
very very simple basically what you're
going<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.769> have<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.279> grow<00:00:29.670> bed<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.269> grow

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
going to have is a grow bed and a grow

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.880 
going to have is a grow bed and a grow
bit<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.750> where<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:31.019> have<00:00:31.170> your<00:00:31.199> media<00:00:31.619> or<00:00:31.769> your

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
bit is where you have your media or your

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.530 
bit is where you have your media or your
plants<00:00:32.219> growing<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.910> grow<00:00:33.090> bed<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.360> going<00:00:33.480> to

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
plants growing the grow bed is going to

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.959 
plants growing the grow bed is going to
be<00:00:33.690> set<00:00:33.989> up<00:00:34.110> on<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.320> stand<00:00:34.680> now<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.489> stand<00:00:35.820> is

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
be set up on a stand now the stand is

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.150 
be set up on a stand now the stand is
going<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.149> be<00:00:36.270> tall<00:00:36.600> enough<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.140> fit<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.829> fish

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
going to be tall enough to fit a fish

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.400 
going to be tall enough to fit a fish
tank<00:00:38.430> below<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:39.120> okay<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.290> have<00:00:40.379> your

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
tank below it okay so you have your

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.139 
tank below it okay so you have your
stand<00:00:40.800> up<00:00:40.980> here<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.760> have<00:00:41.879> your<00:00:42.000> fish

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
stand up here and you have your fish

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.479 
stand up here and you have your fish
tank<00:00:42.360> down<00:00:42.600> below<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.860> fish<00:00:44.040> tank<00:00:44.070> of

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
tank down below in the fish tank of

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.430 
tank down below in the fish tank of
course<00:00:44.700> there<00:00:44.879> are<00:00:44.969> fish<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.480> there's<00:00:45.989> also<00:00:46.260> a

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
course there are fish and there's also a

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.770 
course there are fish and there's also a
water<00:00:46.770> pump<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.730> water<00:00:48.000> pump<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.539> going<00:00:48.690> to

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
water pump that water pump is going to

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.930 
water pump that water pump is going to
be<00:00:48.960> pumping<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.680> water<00:00:49.860> up<00:00:50.129> into<00:00:50.579> your<00:00:50.730> grow

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
be pumping the water up into your grow

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.850 
be pumping the water up into your grow
bed<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.360> filling<00:00:51.899> up<00:00:52.020> your<00:00:52.050> grow<00:00:52.410> beds<00:00:52.649> and

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
bed and filling up your grow beds and

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.100 
bed and filling up your grow beds and
then<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.340> siphon<00:00:54.000> something<00:00:54.600> like<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> bell

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
then a siphon something like a bell

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.240 
then a siphon something like a bell
siphon<00:00:56.899> also<00:00:57.899> maybe<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.199> loop<00:00:58.440> siphon<00:00:58.859> other

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
siphon also maybe a loop siphon other

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.889 
siphon also maybe a loop siphon other
people<00:00:59.609> will<00:00:59.730> just<00:00:59.910> have<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.059> stand<00:01:00.390> pipe<00:01:00.629> and

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
people will just have a stand pipe and

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.810 
people will just have a stand pipe and
they<00:01:00.960> call<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.260> constant<00:01:01.710> flood<00:01:01.890> but<00:01:02.760> a

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
they call it a constant flood but a

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.939 
they call it a constant flood but a
siphon<00:01:03.329> will<00:01:03.899> then<00:01:04.019> take<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.409> water<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.830> has

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
siphon will then take the water that has

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.160 
siphon will then take the water that has
filled<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.430> grow<00:01:05.580> beds<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.390> will<00:01:06.540> drain

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
filled the grow beds and it will drain

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.810 
filled the grow beds and it will drain
them<00:01:07.380> out<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.740> grow<00:01:07.890> beds<00:01:08.100> back<00:01:08.369> down<00:01:08.610> into

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
them out of the grow beds back down into

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.609 
them out of the grow beds back down into
your<00:01:08.909> fish<00:01:09.150> tank<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.900> water<00:01:10.140> pumps<00:01:10.470> up

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
your fish tank so the water pumps up

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.200 
your fish tank so the water pumps up
then<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.250> water<00:01:11.430> gets<00:01:11.610> drained<00:01:11.820> back<00:01:12.000> down

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
then the water gets drained back down

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.630 
then the water gets drained back down
pumps<00:01:12.869> up<00:01:13.020> gets<00:01:13.350> drain<00:01:13.590> back<00:01:13.740> down<00:01:13.979> that's<00:01:14.490> a

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
pumps up gets drain back down that's a

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.880 
pumps up gets drain back down that's a
