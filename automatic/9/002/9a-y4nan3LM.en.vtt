00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
four pockets I do know there are

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.950 
four pockets I do know there are
supposed<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.070> be<00:00:38.160> more<00:00:38.399> in<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:39.270> pool<00:00:39.480> table<00:00:39.809> but

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
supposed to be more in a pool table but

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.600 
supposed to be more in a pool table but
I<00:00:40.020> just<00:00:40.320> didn't<00:00:40.620> have<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.860> right<00:00:41.010> pieces<00:00:41.250> to

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
I just didn't have the right pieces to

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.970 
I just didn't have the right pieces to
make<00:00:41.730> them<00:00:41.940> over<00:00:42.210> here<00:00:42.420> too<00:00:42.660> but<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.530> think<00:00:43.620> it's

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
make them over here too but I think it's

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.180 
make them over here too but I think it's
fine<00:00:44.539> so<00:00:45.539> I'm<00:00:46.440> just<00:00:46.590> going<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.800> take<00:00:46.980> one<00:00:47.160> of

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
fine so I'm just going to take one of

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.319 
fine so I'm just going to take one of
these<00:00:47.280> pool<00:00:47.610> balls<00:00:47.789> off

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
these pool balls off

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.410 
these pool balls off
and<00:00:49.079> take<00:00:49.530> one<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.829> these<00:00:49.890> pool<00:00:50.250> cues<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:51.059> you

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
and take one of these pool cues and you

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.000 
and take one of these pool cues and you
can<00:00:51.510> just<00:00:51.690> easily<00:00:51.899> hit<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.379> into<00:00:52.559> one<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:52.949> the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
can just easily hit it into one of the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.720 
can just easily hit it into one of the
pockets<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:54.030> then<00:00:54.149> if<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.449> just<00:00:55.699> you<00:00:56.699> just

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
pockets and then if you just you just

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.680 
pockets and then if you just you just
hit<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.120> out<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:58.280> that<00:00:59.280> pushes<00:00:59.550> this<00:01:00.329> piece

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
hit it out and that pushes this piece

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.200 
hit it out and that pushes this piece
out<00:01:01.070> so<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.129> can<00:01:02.250> easily<00:01:02.370> get<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.850> pool<00:01:03.030> ball

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
out so you can easily get the pool ball

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.590 
out so you can easily get the pool ball
out<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:04.019> then<00:01:04.559> just<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:05.189> just<00:01:05.400> sets<00:01:05.700> right

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
out and then just it just sets right

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.719 
out and then just it just sets right
back<00:01:06.869> in<00:01:07.500> there<00:01:08.240> so<00:01:09.240> let's<00:01:09.720> get<00:01:09.960> started

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729
