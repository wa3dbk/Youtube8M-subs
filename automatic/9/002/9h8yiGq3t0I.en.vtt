00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello girls welcome to the channel 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.319
 Today what I bring to you is this hairstyle is 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.940
 a braid that comes from here and 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.099
 then he's taking the hair trail 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.500
 is to take it aside but if 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.690
 you have longer hair you could also 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.119
 try to take it to the other side or 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.100
 even make you after here some 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.810
 collected is worth as I will a 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.100
 I liked very much how it looks like that 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.580
 I leave you with the step by step of how 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.580
 do what 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.909
 Y 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.909
 Y 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.070
 Y 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.070
 i 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.499
 i 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.700
 i 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.070
 i 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.270
 i 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.579
 i 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.800
 i 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.940
 i 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.890
 i 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.890
 Y 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.250
 i 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.430
 to 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.850
 i 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.329
 to 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.890
 good girls and for which you asked me 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.989
 the hairstyle that it carries in the video makes 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.280
 2 days 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.890
 I tried to do it again 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.110
 happens that the bows so casual is 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.879
 very difficult that they remain the same and being a 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.590
 bun so so so so easy because 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.840
 really the only thing that I was a rubber 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.359
 I was not even wearing hairpins 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.130
 complicated that I stay the same besides that 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.930
 day had the tips a little more 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.260
 wavy because I'm going to leave my hair 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.940
 air dry today I have a little more 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.770
 smoother then there is a little more 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.660
 fired is a little different worth 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.000
 but the steps to follow were the 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.430
 themselves is just to catch a rubber band and 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.580
 give it a couple of laps is much more 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.050
 easy when you see it maybe requires 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.240
 some practice that you try 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.010
 how many times do I so that I stay like this 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.570
 I had to try two or three 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.220
 times because I did not fit like I wanted 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.600
 Anyway also what you 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.090
 I comment that I do not have the same hair 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.150
 that would also be to tell you that for 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.289
 doing it is better to be on the same day 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.090
 that you cut your hair if not the second 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:00.540
 because if it happens to you as someone who 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.280
 you have finite and smooth 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.760
 happen more and it will not hold us 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.640
 up is it worth if it's the second day of 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.020
 for example the hair because today you are going to 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.360
 tell much more and it will also be 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.050
 nicer and better will win and will 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.050
 look much better 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:09.460
 all right 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.550
 yes 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.550
 i 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.130
 i 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.150
 Y 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.480
 Y 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.690
 i 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.870
 i 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:04.140
 I'm going to teach you a little but how do you 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:06.120
 I say the look is a bit different to 

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.560
 the other day because I have more hair 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.990
 smooth and the back I have more wavy 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.990
 but this is how it has been 

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:17.819
 and good as I said it is a very year 

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.229
 basic is the typical bun that you make 

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:21.809
 when you are going to give yourself the make-up for the 

00:07:19.229 --> 00:07:24.119
 night to go to bed but good what 

00:07:21.809 --> 00:07:24.629
 You asked for it, I show it to you and it's good 

00:07:24.119 --> 00:07:26.339
 girls 

00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:28.469
 this has been all for today I hope that you 

00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:30.059
 have liked it if you have suggestions 

00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:31.529
