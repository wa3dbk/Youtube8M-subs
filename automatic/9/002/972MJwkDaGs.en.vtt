00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.010
 we are back with a delicious 

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:11.930
 sushi roll that is very simple 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.240
 do you can also make a million 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.820
 in ways in this case I will choose 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.840
 very simple ingredients a little bit of 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:24.520
 rice that is going to be steamed we are going to 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:28.700
 put shrimp quesito the smoked salmon 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.410
 carrot cucumber a bit of vinegar 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.899
 rice also sesame and a little 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.800
 sugar this kind of snacks to me 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:39.340
 they love it is a sushi rice and if I said 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.340
 I did not say 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:47.050
 I said roll since it 's Friday and it's 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.050
 that's my birthday 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.230
 is a transformer is a transformer 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.399
 well this is very easy to do 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.140
 basically you have to have a little bit of 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.910
 steamed rice sometimes the rice is the 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.909
 problem but they already sell it too 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.890
 of these microwave have seen them the 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.869
 steam rice microwave 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.149
 If you have not seen them, I think if I 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.330
 you make yours until the coconut says good 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:17.850
 to do good first let's take the 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.910
 we're going to wet it with a little bit of 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.280
 vinegar with your hand and this is with the 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.860
 purpose of giving a flavor to the 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.850
 rice and that the hands do not stick 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:34.840
 then let's take everything gets wet 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:37.630
 vinegar hand vinegar rice 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.810
 vinegar then we already did the first 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.340
 layer of rice you with your hands and 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.560
 with a little vinegar they can give you the 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.590
 Perfect way to get down well 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.230
 well the thread and since they have the 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.390
 height that you want will put you 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.440
 with which we started with a little bit of 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.440
 shrimp is fine 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.350
 we are going to put shrimp 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.630
 it's worth we're going to put a little bit of 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.630
 grated carrot 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.500
 ok now we are going to put a little bit of 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.290
 cucumber that is also scratched that I 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.350
 I recommend you squeeze a little 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.240
 so that the rice is not so wet and 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.750
 its thread is fine they can not leave 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.760
 dripping one night before 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.680
 so that the water of the 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.300
 cucumber the cucumber is very high 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.550
 a lot of water has a lot of fiber 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:39.570
 then let's put it like that 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:42.330
 you can get in and do with the little machine 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.610
 this wonderful d 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.800
 yes that's great in two kicks already 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.800
 you have done, I do not like that 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.510
 not a few and we can say that 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:58.220
 in the bullet 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.220
 new because it also has other names 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.690
 then if the culete and 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:13.120
 and he says that how easy is good and now what 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.120
 that we are going to put is a bit of salmon 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.020
 now in the house there are algae 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.840
 with desire also as a layer not 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:25.300
 you can put a cap of algae this 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.460
 smoked salmon 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:31.120
 Y 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:33.460
 what not to look for is you have to look for a parakeet 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.670
 parrot do not look for anything 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.590
 that left this parrot good to me 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.960
 like this kind of snacks because 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.510
 they also serve as for you already know a 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.030
 Sunday that gives lazy cooking but 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.610
 that brings a sushi craving that's 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.680
 almost every Sunday in my house 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:57.010
 Exactly with a Japanese Chilean 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.010
 or not because it can also be with a 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.819
 but it is not less contained than in a 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.769
 home 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:08.510
 I believe that I believe that if there is little 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.510
 green equal with a little tequila more 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:16.709
 a month about doing because the serve 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.209
 people get a strong bracelet is that 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.870
 good also has like graduations 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.250
 but 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:26.100
 I do not know let's put some cheese 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:30.370
 as well 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:33.000
 and after putting 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.110
 almost there is almost 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.480
 go he 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.360
 let's continue putting some cheese 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.860
 now for me for example I do not like the 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.320
 cheese in the sushi then what I'm going to 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.360
 to do is that I'm going to leave these two 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.710
 corners without cheese to touch me 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.750
 eat 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.750
 because this stream is very good 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:58.860
 exactly for me alone and well let's go 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:01.230
 to put the next layer of rice as 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.060
 to close our thread and I 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.040
 I recommend tightening the super well 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.780
 so that when you leave no 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.480
 have problems in unmolding the 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.669
 we already have here an 'appointment and 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.020
 Now I'm going to show you nothing 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:18.940
 I will ask you to accompany me to see the 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:21.040
 next information and we return to 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.320
 change my thread 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.670
 hey certainly need to send some 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.450
