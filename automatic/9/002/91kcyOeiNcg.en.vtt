version then also if you are on a

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.520 
version then also if you are on a
Windows<00:00:42.300> machine<00:00:42.450> you'll<00:00:42.989> notice<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.379> there

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
Windows machine you'll notice that there

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.830 
Windows machine you'll notice that there
is<00:00:43.559> an<00:00:43.770> installer<00:00:44.309> version<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.300> dot<00:00:45.539> zip

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
is an installer version and a dot zip

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.170 
is an installer version and a dot zip
archive<00:00:46.320> now<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.280> because<00:00:47.610> blender<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.149> a

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
archive now this is because blender is a

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.150 
archive now this is because blender is a
portable<00:00:48.780> application<00:00:49.379> which<00:00:49.649> means<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.070> it

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
portable application which means that it

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.369 
portable application which means that it
can<00:00:50.280> be<00:00:50.399> run<00:00:50.579> from<00:00:50.820> anywhere<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.110> doesn't

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
can be run from anywhere so it doesn't

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.900 
can be run from anywhere so it doesn't
require<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.190> be<00:00:53.219> installed<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.879> a

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
you could run it from an external hard

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.670 
you could run it from an external hard

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.859 
drive or even a jump drive if you want
to<00:01:07.770> say<00:01:07.950> use<00:01:08.400> blender<00:01:08.790> on<00:01:08.939> multiple<00:01:09.510> machines

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
to say use blender on multiple machines

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.450 
to say use blender on multiple machines
or<00:01:10.170> on<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.409> machine<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.950> you're<00:01:11.040> not<00:01:11.159> able<00:01:11.340> to

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
or on a machine that you're not able to

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.030 
or on a machine that you're not able to
install<00:01:12.030> anything<00:01:12.270> on<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:13.170> generally<00:01:13.770> my

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
install anything on so generally my

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.530 
install anything on so generally my
personal<00:01:14.460> preference<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:14.939> use<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.390> zip

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
personal preference is to use the zip

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.060 
personal preference is to use the zip
archive<00:01:15.689> because<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.380> just<00:01:16.470> allows<00:01:16.740> me<00:01:16.950> to

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
archive because that just allows me to

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.980 
archive because that just allows me to
put<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.310> wherever<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.729> want<00:01:17.820> but<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.720> can<00:01:18.840> also

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
put it wherever I want but you can also

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.590 
put it wherever I want but you can also
use<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.439> Installer<00:01:19.799> with<00:01:20.189> no<00:01:20.369> problem<00:01:20.790> if<00:01:21.540> you

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
use the Installer with no problem if you

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.660 
use the Installer with no problem if you
have<00:01:22.020> multiple<00:01:22.470> versions<00:01:22.590> installed<00:01:23.220> then

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
have multiple versions installed then

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.649 
have multiple versions installed then
there's<00:01:23.909> no<00:01:24.060> need<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.390> worry<00:01:24.570> about

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
there's no need to worry about

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.469 
there's no need to worry about
overwriting<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.680> previous<00:01:26.159> release<00:01:26.490> blender

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
overwriting the previous release blender

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.630 
overwriting the previous release blender
it<00:01:27.810> will<00:01:28.020> install<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.590> as<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.740> secondary
