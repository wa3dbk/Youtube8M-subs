flat<00:02:39.110> here<00:02:41.170> now<00:02:42.170> that's<00:02:42.350> a<00:02:42.560> b-flat

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
flat here now that's a b-flat

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.300 
flat here now that's a b-flat
on<00:02:43.460> the<00:02:43.700> fifth<00:02:43.940> string<00:02:44.150> a<00:02:44.690> C<00:02:45.350> on<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:45.830> second

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
on the fifth string a C on the second

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.980 
on the fifth string a C on the second
string<00:02:46.520> both<00:02:46.790> of<00:02:47.000> those<00:02:47.120> are<00:02:47.330> first<00:02:47.600> fret

quickly<00:02:49.870> and<00:02:50.870> that<00:02:51.680> final<00:02:52.220> chord<00:02:52.550> is<00:02:52.820> an

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
quickly and that final chord is an

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.530 
quickly and that final chord is an
e-flat<00:02:54.020> on<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.920> fourth<00:02:55.190> string<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:55.820> an<00:02:56.150> open

actually does a little back and forth

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.320 
actually does a little back and forth
between<00:03:22.160> the<00:03:22.459> G<00:03:22.730> sharp<00:03:22.760> and<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.300> open<00:03:23.720> G<00:03:25.330> which

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
between the G sharp and the open G which

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.170 
between the G sharp and the open G which
I<00:03:26.510> do<00:03:26.570> a<00:03:26.720> pull<00:03:27.050> off<00:03:27.260> on<00:03:27.709> and<00:03:28.070> I<00:03:28.489> just<00:03:28.760> leave<00:03:28.970> the

I do a pull off on and I just leave the
bass<00:03:29.390> note<00:03:29.720> because<00:03:29.959> it's<00:03:30.230> just<00:03:30.350> too<00:03:30.530> much

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
bass note because it's just too much

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.550 
bass note because it's just too much
bass<00:03:31.010> to<00:03:31.280> kind<00:03:31.489> of<00:03:31.550> fill<00:03:31.820> that<00:03:31.970> in<00:03:34.360> okay<00:03:35.560> again

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
and then I jump up quickly to a full bar

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.970 
and then I jump up quickly to a full bar
chord<00:03:45.760> this<00:03:45.909> is<00:03:46.060> a<00:03:46.090> full<00:03:46.450> a-flat<00:03:47.260> barred<00:03:48.510> and

have to get to it quickly so double bar
might<00:04:17.169> be<00:04:17.289> recommended<00:04:17.639> here<00:04:18.639> I'm<00:04:18.880> playing

that<00:04:26.199> sequence<00:04:26.919> again<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.789> a<00:04:27.820> flat<00:04:31.320> it's

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
that sequence again the a flat it's

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.430 
that sequence again the a flat it's
exact<00:04:32.740> same<00:04:32.949> thing<00:04:33.250> here<00:04:33.780> ring<00:04:34.780> finger<00:04:35.259> middle

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440

then<00:04:39.490> the<00:04:39.789> C<00:04:40.090> chord<00:04:40.509> that<00:04:40.780> he<00:04:40.900> ends<00:04:41.050> up<00:04:41.320> on<00:04:41.500> this

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:42.009 
then the C chord that he ends up on this

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:44.010 
then the C chord that he ends up on this
is<00:04:42.250> this<00:04:42.460> is<00:04:42.610> kind<00:04:42.820> of<00:04:42.849> sweet<00:04:42.940> because<00:04:43.539> he<00:04:43.750> does

is this is kind of sweet because he does

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.240 
is this is kind of sweet because he does
actually<00:04:44.410> a<00:04:44.440> C<00:04:44.740> ad<00:04:44.979> nine<00:04:45.870> and<00:04:46.870> so<00:04:47.199> to<00:04:47.260> make<00:04:48.039> that

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
actually a C ad nine and so to make that

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.890 
actually a C ad nine and so to make that
happen<00:04:48.460> we<00:04:50.430> do<00:04:51.430> that<00:04:51.580> cute<00:04:51.849> little<00:04:52.000> cutesy

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
happen we do that cute little cutesy

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.930 
happen we do that cute little cutesy
little<00:04:53.229> finger<00:04:53.889> picking<00:04:54.070> pattern<00:04:54.550> that's<00:04:54.699> so

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
little finger picking pattern that's so

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.270 
little finger picking pattern that's so
common<00:04:55.389> and<00:04:55.780> what<00:04:55.960> that<00:04:56.169> is<00:04:56.470> it's<00:04:56.740> a<00:04:56.830> little

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
common and what that is it's a little

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.589 
common and what that is it's a little
bit<00:04:57.430> complicated<00:04:57.849> so<00:04:58.060> I'm<00:04:58.150> gonna<00:04:58.240> try<00:04:58.389> to<00:04:58.449> go

00:04:58.589 --> 00:04:58.599 
bit complicated so I'm gonna try to go

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:00.779 
bit complicated so I'm gonna try to go
to<00:04:58.750> it<00:04:58.870> slow<00:04:59.020> I'm<00:04:59.139> basically<00:04:59.470> holding<00:04:59.860> down<00:05:00.070> C

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
to it slow I'm basically holding down C

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:05.100 
to it slow I'm basically holding down C

but I've got a D here with my pinky on

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.909 
but I've got a D here with my pinky on
the<00:05:05.940> second<00:05:06.940> string<00:05:07.120> third<00:05:07.150> fret<00:05:07.690> okay<00:05:08.440> and

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
the second string third fret okay and

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.159 
the second string third fret okay and
what<00:05:09.340> I'm<00:05:09.460> doing<00:05:09.820> is<00:05:09.940> I'm<00:05:10.090> first<00:05:10.389> plucking<00:05:10.990> the

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
what I'm doing is I'm first plucking the

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:17.790 
what I'm doing is I'm first plucking the
thumb<00:05:11.560> and<00:05:11.860> the<00:05:12.370> middle<00:05:12.400> finger<00:05:13.889> sorry

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:24.429 

followed<00:05:18.800> by<00:05:18.830> the<00:05:19.040> opened<00:05:19.970> first<00:05:20.480> string

00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:24.439 

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:27.219 

and<00:05:24.559> then<00:05:25.069> I<00:05:25.189> bounced<00:05:25.489> off<00:05:25.819> the<00:05:25.879> open<00:05:26.869> third

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
and then I bounced off the open third

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:30.369 
and then I bounced off the open third
string<00:05:27.459> to<00:05:28.459> change<00:05:28.879> that<00:05:29.300> D<00:05:29.689> on<00:05:30.050> the<00:05:30.169> third

00:05:30.369 --> 00:05:30.379 
string to change that D on the third

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:33.129 
string to change that D on the third
fret<00:05:30.679> back<00:05:31.039> to<00:05:31.489> the<00:05:31.969> C<00:05:32.239> on<00:05:32.419> the<00:05:32.539> first<00:05:32.809> fret

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:33.139 
fret back to the C on the first fret

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:35.799 
fret back to the C on the first fret
again<00:05:33.379> I'm<00:05:33.889> gonna<00:05:34.039> do<00:05:34.129> that<00:05:34.279> slowly<00:05:35.089> watch<00:05:35.599> my

00:05:35.799 --> 00:05:35.809 
again I'm gonna do that slowly watch my

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:41.269 
again I'm gonna do that slowly watch my
fingers<00:05:36.169> closely

00:05:41.269 --> 00:05:41.279 

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:43.159 

okay<00:05:42.119> that's<00:05:42.749> probably<00:05:42.959> the<00:05:43.049> most

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
okay that's probably the most

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:44.779 
okay that's probably the most
complicated<00:05:43.619> little<00:05:44.099> finger-picking<00:05:44.519> me

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:44.789 
complicated little finger-picking me

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:49.039 
complicated little finger-picking me
I've<00:05:45.029> got<00:05:45.739> and<00:05:46.789> then<00:05:47.789> after<00:05:48.119> that<00:05:48.239> to<00:05:48.479> conclude

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:49.049 
I've got and then after that to conclude

00:05:49.049 --> 00:05:51.979 
I've got and then after that to conclude
it<00:05:49.289> I<00:05:49.529> do<00:05:49.889> basically<00:05:50.699> what<00:05:51.209> is<00:05:51.299> an<00:05:51.419> F<00:05:51.659> minor

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:51.989 
it I do basically what is an F minor

00:05:51.989 --> 00:05:54.829 
it I do basically what is an F minor
seven<00:05:52.679> but<00:05:53.099> I<00:05:53.129> add<00:05:53.459> this<00:05:53.879> note<00:05:54.329> here<00:05:54.629> on<00:05:54.749> the

00:05:54.829 --> 00:05:54.839

fourth fret second string as a melody

00:05:57.269 --> 00:06:01.669 
fourth fret second string as a melody
note<00:05:58.399> and<00:05:59.399> again<00:06:00.119> I'm<00:06:00.299> just<00:06:00.509> plucking<00:06:00.779> ring

the bass note on the downbeat and then

00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:14.389 
the bass note on the downbeat and then
from<00:06:13.139> there<00:06:13.349> I<00:06:13.589> wanted<00:06:13.949> to<00:06:14.069> create<00:06:14.369> a

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:14.399 
from there I wanted to create a

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:17.479 
from there I wanted to create a
counterpoint<00:06:15.209> so<00:06:15.899> I<00:06:15.929> moved<00:06:16.559> to<00:06:16.769> a<00:06:16.799> G<00:06:17.189> minor

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:17.489 
counterpoint so I moved to a G minor

00:06:17.489 --> 00:06:22.279 
counterpoint so I moved to a G minor
seven<00:06:18.179> essentially<00:06:19.019> here<00:06:20.719> but<00:06:21.719> I<00:06:21.749> moved<00:06:22.110> my

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:22.289 
seven essentially here but I moved my

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:25.129 
seven essentially here but I moved my
melody<00:06:22.829> note<00:06:23.039> actually<00:06:23.519> back<00:06:23.759> one<00:06:24.419> fret<00:06:24.899> to

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:25.139 
melody note actually back one fret to

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:27.259 
melody note actually back one fret to
the<00:06:25.199> third<00:06:25.559> fret<00:06:26.039> so<00:06:26.369> it's<00:06:26.519> an<00:06:26.639> easy<00:06:26.939> bar

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:27.269 
the third fret so it's an easy bar

00:06:27.269 --> 00:06:29.119 
the third fret so it's an easy bar
actually<00:06:27.629> straight<00:06:28.289> flat<00:06:28.679> all<00:06:28.979> the<00:06:29.009> way

00:06:29.119 --> 00:06:29.129 
actually straight flat all the way

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:30.919 
actually straight flat all the way
across<00:06:29.489> the<00:06:29.639> third<00:06:29.819> fret<00:06:30.119> and<00:06:30.329> what<00:06:30.809> I'm

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:30.929 
across the third fret and what I'm

00:06:30.929 --> 00:06:32.779 
across the third fret and what I'm
playing<00:06:31.199> is<00:06:31.469> the<00:06:31.619> bass<00:06:31.829> note<00:06:32.129> on<00:06:32.159> the<00:06:32.399> sixth

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:32.789 
playing is the bass note on the sixth

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:37.339 
playing is the bass note on the sixth
string<00:06:32.999> at<00:06:33.779> the<00:06:33.869> same<00:06:34.259> time<00:06:34.849> the<00:06:35.959> ring<00:06:36.959> finger

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:37.349 
string at the same time the ring finger

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:38.869 
string at the same time the ring finger
I<00:06:37.379> keep<00:06:37.649> wanting<00:06:38.009> to<00:06:38.099> call<00:06:38.159> that<00:06:38.399> a<00:06:38.549> finger

00:06:38.869 --> 00:06:38.879 
I keep wanting to call that a finger

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:40.609 
I keep wanting to call that a finger
because<00:06:39.119> that's<00:06:39.479> what<00:06:39.659> it<00:06:39.779> is<00:06:39.899> in<00:06:40.049> classical

00:06:40.609 --> 00:06:40.619 
because that's what it is in classical
