 Pokemon was seen and good this time 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.410
 I bring another video information of the 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.660
 remakes of pokemon ruby omega and sapphire 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.759
 alpha as much as a little information 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.860
 of pokemon x and iu but good friends 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.540
 before continuing with this video that 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.480
 he says they think we can get to the 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.369
 less to 400 I like like goal for 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.230
 this video the support we hope to get to 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.420
 this small figure and we're going to start 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.119
 give him with this video well the day 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.699
 today he was surrounded quite a lot 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.949
 that would look cv / pam as it was revealed 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.380
 well I kind of know if it was revealed by 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.750
 so to say it and it was found that now 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.579
 can be exchanged something is so 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.829
 if you have occupy you can already 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.329
 can already exchange the rest 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.399
 people which makes us 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.379
 aware that at any time 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.809
 the safest thing is that inside pokemon 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.050
 blond me and sapphire alpha or maybe even 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.059
 inside pokemon xy will be able to be this 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.550
 pokemon will begin to be spread over 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.800
 events on behalf of nintendo now 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.539
 knows when or how or I know 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.940
 really if it will be then pokemon x 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.220
 and zeda de pokemon ruby ​​or mega and sapphire 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.450
 alf so friends if you have your passion 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.979
 you can share 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.840
 although obviously these faults are going to be 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.570
 Illegals are going to be created with the power 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.149
 save but nevertheless the koopas are already 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.640
 can give out friends another thing that 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:20.490
 it was also revealed today is the 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.649
 alternative way to occupy we already have 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.220
 a little bit more clearly in 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.960
 colors a little better the image of this 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.030
 just in its alternative form and now already 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.939
 we know that this pokemon is going to be able to 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.130
 change shape with the prison bottle 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.319
 we still do not know how to be able to 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.090
 get this bottle to prison and 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:41.520
 really where the sample can 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.319
 get and still do not know if fault goes 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.509
 to be a pokémon available for 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:48.270
 capture that walks wild inside 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.619
 pokemon x 6 o has been distributed by event 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.500
 it is safer that has been distributed by 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.649
 event since as I told you apart already 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.750
 I say today only today 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.360
 I what I wanted to comment this pokemon 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.099
 it was discovered that it can already be 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.390
 exchanged friends so the most 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:05.130
 certain is that at any time 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.439
 are going to start distributing this 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.479
 pokemon and when we go to transfer 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.039
 a pokemon ruby or mega sapphire alpha or 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.379
 some strange way 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.299
 will be that they can grant this object 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.709
 called a prison bottle but good 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.609
 friends will be all for this video I hope 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.030

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:22.560

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.390
