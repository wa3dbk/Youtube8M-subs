00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.400
 trainings that I said would go up like this 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.800

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.730
 penalties 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.730
 OK yes 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.720
 cheated boxes I totally have 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:24.230

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.650

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.990
 Victor Víctor 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.170
 is prepared 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.580
 because nothing at all that every time 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.330
 it is better to relate the last 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.520
 second 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:02.540
 for xavi the princes of asturias were 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:05.320
 face in the other chut to xavi 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.320

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.250
 goal 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.350
 so that we see the following and we are going to 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:31.600
 try another penalty shootout 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.600
 match let's try corner kicks 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.120
 it's about the corner kicks 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.180
 and even friends is already there is it 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.120

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.129
 they are old actions 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.319
 the rest 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.319
 everything is a contest of 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.270
 I take the training off because it's a 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.490
 shame 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.850
 was by two corner kicks shot 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.850
