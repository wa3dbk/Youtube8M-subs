Windows workstation or server for
example<00:00:28.109> let's<00:00:28.650> say<00:00:28.830> we're<00:00:29.010> installing<00:00:29.609> the

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
example let's say we're installing the

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.260 
example let's say we're installing the
HP<00:00:30.840> management<00:00:31.529> agents<00:00:32.009> for<00:00:32.160> ESX<00:00:32.759> well<00:00:33.149> we

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
HP management agents for ESX well we

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.660 
HP management agents for ESX well we
actually<00:00:33.570> need<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.750> copy<00:00:34.020> those<00:00:34.380> agents<00:00:35.010> to

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
actually need to copy those agents to

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.540 
actually need to copy those agents to
our<00:00:35.850> ESX<00:00:36.420> server<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:37.140> run<00:00:37.710> them<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.190> install

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
our ESX server to run them and install

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.000 
our ESX server to run them and install
them<00:00:38.610> another<00:00:39.570> really<00:00:39.840> common<00:00:39.989> use<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.620> if<00:00:40.829> we

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
them another really common use is if we

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.610 
them another really common use is if we
have<00:00:41.219> ISO<00:00:41.670> images<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.420> let's<00:00:42.870> say<00:00:43.020> our<00:00:43.200> Windows

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
have ISO images of let's say our Windows

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.459 
have ISO images of let's say our Windows
installation<00:00:44.239> CDs<00:00:45.239> or<00:00:45.570> something<00:00:46.320> like<00:00:46.410> a

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
installation CDs or something like a

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.160 
installation CDs or something like a
sequel<00:00:46.860> server<00:00:47.160> installation<00:00:47.940> CD<00:00:48.329> we<00:00:48.930> need<00:00:49.079> to

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
sequel server installation CD we need to

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.319 
sequel server installation CD we need to
copy<00:00:49.379> those<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.800> ESX<00:00:50.340> server<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:50.879> we<00:00:51.149> can

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
copy those to ESX server so that we can

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.840 
copy those to ESX server so that we can
use<00:00:51.600> them<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:51.930> our<00:00:52.199> virtual<00:00:52.649> machines<00:00:53.070> instead

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
use them in our virtual machines instead

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.500 
use them in our virtual machines instead
of<00:00:54.000> using<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.449> actual<00:00:54.780> CD<00:00:55.289> or<00:00:55.500> dvd-rom<00:00:56.510> to

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
of using the actual CD or dvd-rom to

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.110 
of using the actual CD or dvd-rom to
copy<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.870> file<00:00:58.170> from<00:00:58.199> Windows<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:59.250> Linux<00:00:59.760> which

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
copy a file from Windows to Linux which

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.970 
copy a file from Windows to Linux which
is<00:01:00.270> what<00:01:00.420> ESX<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.170> we<00:01:01.350> can<00:01:01.500> use<00:01:01.530> something

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
is what ESX is we can use something

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.880 
is what ESX is we can use something
called<00:01:02.160> SCP<00:01:03.149> or<00:01:03.300> secure<00:01:03.690> copy<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.710> good

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
called SCP or secure copy and a good

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.660 
called SCP or secure copy and a good
program<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.700> use<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.510> winscp<00:01:07.549> so<00:01:08.549> let's

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
program to use that is winscp so let's

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.149

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
though and the directory will include

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.280 
though and the directory will include
the<00:04:01.950> file<00:04:02.220> and<00:04:03.180> over<00:04:03.450> here<00:04:03.690> I<00:04:03.720> select<00:04:04.080> where<00:04:04.260> I

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
the file and over here I select where I

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.530 
the file and over here I select where I
want<00:04:04.350> to<00:04:04.650> copy<00:04:04.860> it<00:04:05.070> to<00:04:05.100> so<00:04:05.940> I'll<00:04:06.060> just<00:04:06.209> scroll

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
want to copy it to so I'll just scroll

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.660 
want to copy it to so I'll just scroll
down<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:07.110> a<00:04:07.950> lot<00:04:08.070> of<00:04:08.100> times<00:04:08.310> we're<00:04:08.489> going<00:04:08.610> to

down and a lot of times we're going to

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.720 
down and a lot of times we're going to

folder over to our ESX server and it can
take<00:04:37.710> some<00:04:37.860> time<00:04:38.070> depending<00:04:38.280> on<00:04:38.610> how<00:04:38.820> large

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
take some time depending on how large

take some time depending on how large
the<00:04:39.150> file<00:04:39.510> was<00:04:39.780> this<00:04:39.960> one<00:04:40.170> was<00:04:40.290> about<00:04:40.440> two<00:04:40.770> and

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
the file was this one was about two and

the file was this one was about two and
a<00:04:40.950> half<00:04:40.980> gigs<00:04:41.490> so<00:04:41.910> it's<00:04:42.090> going<00:04:42.240> to<00:04:42.300> take<00:04:42.480> a<00:04:42.510> few

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
a half gigs so it's going to take a few

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:49.130 
a half gigs so it's going to take a few
minutes<00:04:43.110> to<00:04:43.290> copy<00:04:43.530> over<00:04:47.960> okay<00:04:48.960> and<00:04:49.050> it

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
minutes to copy over okay and it

minutes to copy over okay and it
successfully<00:04:49.950> copied<00:04:50.160> over<00:04:50.550> we<00:04:50.670> could<00:04:50.790> drill

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
successfully copied over we could drill

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.760 
successfully copied over we could drill
in<00:04:51.270> and<00:04:51.450> take<00:04:51.630> a<00:04:51.660> look<00:04:51.780> that<00:04:52.170> all<00:04:52.350> the<00:04:52.530> files

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770

go ahead and login and we'll just go

go ahead and login and we'll just go
ahead<00:05:11.310> and<00:05:11.490> browse<00:05:11.670> to<00:05:11.700> the<00:05:11.970> directory<00:05:12.090> that

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
ahead and browse to the directory that

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:22.370 
ahead and browse to the directory that
we<00:05:12.540> copied<00:05:12.870> it<00:05:13.110> to<00:05:20.480> and<00:05:21.480> there<00:05:21.750> it<00:05:21.840> is<00:05:21.930> Windows

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
we copied it to and there it is Windows

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
we copied it to and there it is Windows
seven<00:05:22.770> so<00:05:22.980> if<00:05:23.070> I<00:05:23.160> just<00:05:23.310> go<00:05:23.520> to<00:05:23.580> it<00:05:25.190> see<00:05:26.190> there's

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
seven so if I just go to it see there's

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:35.090 
seven so if I just go to it see there's
our<00:05:26.520> 32-bit<00:05:27.270> directory<00:05:32.420> and<00:05:33.420> there<00:05:33.900> it<00:05:33.990> is<00:05:34.140> now

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
our 32-bit directory and there it is now

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.070 
our 32-bit directory and there it is now
this<00:05:35.250> works<00:05:35.520> both<00:05:35.700> ways<00:05:35.970> so<00:05:36.270> we<00:05:36.420> can<00:05:36.600> actually

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
this works both ways so we can actually

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.310 
this works both ways so we can actually
copy<00:05:37.530> a<00:05:37.680> file<00:05:37.950> from<00:05:37.980> our<00:05:38.400> ESX<00:05:39.000> server<00:05:39.300> to<00:05:40.080> our

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
copy a file from our ESX server to our

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.290 
copy a file from our ESX server to our
Windows<00:05:40.650> desktop<00:05:41.160> and<00:05:41.370> this<00:05:41.520> is<00:05:41.670> handy<00:05:42.060> when

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
Windows desktop and this is handy when

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.000 
Windows desktop and this is handy when
we<00:05:42.450> have<00:05:42.570> things<00:05:42.750> like<00:05:42.900> log<00:05:43.260> files<00:05:43.590> that<00:05:43.890> we

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
we have things like log files that we

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.130 
we have things like log files that we
have<00:05:44.040> to<00:05:44.280> get<00:05:44.460> off<00:05:44.640> to<00:05:44.850> take<00:05:44.970> a<00:05:45.030> look<00:05:45.330> at<00:05:45.540> or

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
have to get off to take a look at or

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.330 
have to get off to take a look at or
possibly<00:05:46.920> send<00:05:47.490> to<00:05:47.760> VMware<00:05:48.740> for<00:05:49.740> example

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
possibly send to VMware for example

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.630 
possibly send to VMware for example
let's<00:05:50.700> say<00:05:50.880> if<00:05:51.000> I<00:05:51.120> go<00:05:51.360> all<00:05:52.110> the<00:05:52.290> way<00:05:52.320> back<00:05:52.640> to

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
let's say if I go all the way back to

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.030 
let's say if I go all the way back to
the<00:05:53.760> root<00:05:54.030> and<00:05:54.420> let<00:05:55.050> me<00:05:55.110> go<00:05:55.230> to<00:05:55.290> the<00:05:55.740> VAR

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.040 
the root and let me go to the VAR

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.800 
the root and let me go to the VAR
directory<00:05:56.700> and<00:05:57.680> then<00:05:58.680> the<00:05:58.860> log<00:05:59.100> directory

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
directory and then the log directory

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.350 
directory and then the log directory
let's<00:06:00.810> say<00:06:01.020> for<00:06:01.320> example<00:06:01.400> I<00:06:02.400> need<00:06:02.820> to<00:06:02.880> copy<00:06:03.150> off

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
let's say for example I need to copy off

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.710 
let's say for example I need to copy off
this<00:06:03.600> ESX<00:06:04.350> underscore<00:06:04.920> installed<00:06:05.430> log<00:06:05.700> I<00:06:06.030> can

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
this ESX underscore installed log I can

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.710 
this ESX underscore installed log I can
just<00:06:06.840> highlight<00:06:07.050> it<00:06:07.380> click<00:06:07.620> and<00:06:07.860> drag<00:06:08.720> click

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 
just highlight it click and drag click

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:15.190 
just highlight it click and drag click
copy<00:06:10.050> and<00:06:11.240> there<00:06:12.240> it<00:06:12.330> is<00:06:12.390> it's<00:06:12.660> on<00:06:12.750> my<00:06:12.900> desktop

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:15.200 
copy and there it is it's on my desktop

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.720 
copy and there it is it's on my desktop
so<00:06:16.200> if<00:06:16.380> I<00:06:16.440> wanted<00:06:16.680> to<00:06:16.770> take<00:06:16.950> a<00:06:16.980> look<00:06:17.220> at<00:06:17.430> it<00:06:17.580> I

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:17.730 
so if I wanted to take a look at it I
