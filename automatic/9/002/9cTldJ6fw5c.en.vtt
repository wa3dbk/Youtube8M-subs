gutting them and i guess when you play
people<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:38.009> aren't<00:01:38.280> all<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.490> good<00:01:38.850> i<00:01:38.880> can

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.760 
thing I come I don't like is that when
you<00:01:50.579> lose<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.689> know<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.840> lose<00:01:52.020> 150<00:01:52.590> points

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
you lose you know you lose 150 points

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.350 
you lose you know you lose 150 points
but<00:01:53.070> when<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.250> win<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.490> only<00:01:53.759> gain<00:01:53.939> like<00:01:54.119> 10

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
but when you win you only gain like 10

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.030 
but when you win you only gain like 10
points<00:01:54.780> that's<00:01:55.290> after<00:01:55.500> your<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.890> know<00:01:56.009> your

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
points that's after your you know your

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.600 
points that's after your you know your
bonuses<00:01:56.579> or<00:01:56.729> whatever<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.530> I<00:01:58.530> think<00:01:59.460> it's<00:01:59.549> a

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
bonuses or whatever and I think it's a

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.300 
bonuses or whatever and I think it's a
little<00:01:59.700> dumb<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.630> only<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.979> only<00:02:02.040> play

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
little dumb that you only you only play

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.670 
little dumb that you only you only play
like<00:02:02.490> four<00:02:02.759> or<00:02:02.880> five<00:02:02.909> maps<00:02:03.299> it's<00:02:03.689> it's<00:02:03.960> really

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
like four or five maps it's it's really

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.310 
like four or five maps it's it's really
annoying<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.490> can't<00:02:05.939> stand<00:02:06.270> playing<00:02:07.170> the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
annoying and I can't stand playing the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.749 
annoying and I can't stand playing the
same<00:02:07.500> laps<00:02:07.740> over<00:02:07.860> an<00:02:08.039> hour<00:02:08.099> it's<00:02:08.459> not<00:02:08.550> even

the<00:04:10.599> reaction<00:04:10.840> time<00:04:11.199> is<00:04:11.229> so<00:04:12.159> much<00:04:12.310> greater

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
the reaction time is so much greater

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.520 
the reaction time is so much greater
than<00:04:12.669> that<00:04:12.849> of<00:04:12.969> this<00:04:13.239> because<00:04:13.599> you<00:04:14.349> know<00:04:14.439> you

head<00:04:20.229> glitching<00:04:20.500> it's<00:04:20.769> about<00:04:21.549> reaction<00:04:22.000> time

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:22.029 
head glitching it's about reaction time

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:23.550 
head glitching it's about reaction time
it's<00:04:22.300> about<00:04:22.360> skills<00:04:22.779> about<00:04:22.990> how<00:04:23.110> you<00:04:23.169> build

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560
