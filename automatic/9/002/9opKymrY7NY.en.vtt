take good low-light pictures in a dark
environment<00:00:17.359> we<00:00:18.359> started<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.779> lot<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.230> fifty

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
environment we started a lot that fifty

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.700 
environment we started a lot that fifty
percent<00:00:20.520> so<00:00:20.820> half<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.539> billions<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.500> billions

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
percent so half of billions of billions

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.340 
percent so half of billions of billions
of<00:00:22.859> pictures<00:00:23.160> taken<00:00:23.850> every<00:00:24.180> day<00:00:24.359> are<00:00:24.720> actually

of pictures taken every day are actually

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.189 
of pictures taken every day are actually
captured<00:00:25.920> in<00:00:26.130> inviting<00:00:26.970> like<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:27.900> in<00:00:28.019> low

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
captured in inviting like this so in low

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.470 
captured in inviting like this so in low
light<00:00:28.410> situations<00:00:28.619> like<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.849> it's<00:00:30.390> a

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
light situations like this and it's a

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
stretch my heart to understand that half

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.510 
stretch my heart to understand that half
of<00:00:32.910> those<00:00:33.149> who<00:00:33.540> have<00:00:34.020> all<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.829> bits<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.130> want

agribusiness so comparing against the
iphone<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:28.920> actually<00:01:29.130> very<00:01:29.400> typical

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
iphone so this is actually very typical

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.080 
iphone so this is actually very typical
very<00:01:30.420> normal<00:01:31.020> how<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.500> pictures<00:01:32.070> come<00:01:32.340> up<00:01:32.549> so

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
very normal how the pictures come up so

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.859 
very normal how the pictures come up so
it<00:01:33.180> kind<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.509> record<00:01:33.960> shapes<00:01:35.270> and<00:01:36.270> noise

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
it kind of record shapes and noise

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.780 
it kind of record shapes and noise
basically<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.680> don't<00:01:37.829> really<00:01:38.130> get<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.700> enjoy

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
basically you don't really get to enjoy

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.940 
basically you don't really get to enjoy
that's<00:01:39.329> not<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.570> memory<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:40.200> want<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.650> share

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
that's not a memory you want to share

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.160 
that's not a memory you want to share
and<00:01:42.259> install<00:01:43.970> whereas<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.149> one<00:01:45.210> it's<00:01:45.810> nice

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
and install whereas this one it's nice

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.100 
and install whereas this one it's nice
it<00:01:46.380> has<00:01:46.409> colors<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.880> has<00:01:47.939> details<00:01:48.659> image

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
it has colors in it it has details image

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.590 
it has colors in it it has details image
and<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.680> also<00:01:49.860> preserves<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.729> nice<00:01:50.909> ambient

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
and it also preserves the nice ambient

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.470 
and it also preserves the nice ambient
atmosphere

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
atmosphere

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.000 
atmosphere
so<00:01:53.480> really<00:01:53.840> that<00:01:54.110> is<00:01:54.230> the<00:01:54.350> picture<00:01:54.740> you<00:01:54.770> want

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
so really that is the picture you want

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.520 
so really that is the picture you want
to<00:01:55.190> cherish<00:01:55.430> store<00:01:56.240> and<00:01:56.570> maybe<00:01:57.080> share<00:01:57.350> with

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
to cherish store and maybe share with

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
to cherish store and maybe share with
your<00:01:57.680> friends<00:01:58.300> can<00:01:59.300> we<00:01:59.390> do
