00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219 
would shuffle the back like so

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:39.030 
would shuffle the back like so
well<00:01:36.670> except<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.149> best<00:01:37.360> face<00:01:37.630> up<00:01:37.930> but<00:01:38.799> yeah<00:01:39.009> I

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
would shuffle it that like so right and

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.289 
would shuffle it that like so right and
then<00:01:42.390> seemingly<00:01:43.710> cut<00:01:44.710> to<00:01:45.130> eight<00:01:45.340> on<00:01:45.850> a<00:01:45.880> random

then seemingly cut to eight on a random
card<00:01:46.630> and<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:48.759> would<00:01:49.000> turn<00:01:49.390> out<00:01:49.509> to<00:01:49.689> be<00:01:49.719> of

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
card and it would turn out to be of

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.749

things<00:02:29.830> I<00:02:30.069> just<00:02:30.280> thought<00:02:30.549> maybe<00:02:31.450> thought<00:02:31.780> of<00:02:31.900> a

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
things I just thought maybe thought of a

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.250 
things I just thought maybe thought of a
solution<00:02:32.140> it's<00:02:33.129> it's<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.940> old<00:02:34.150> rubbing<00:02:34.900> the

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
solution it's it's the old rubbing the

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.850 
solution it's it's the old rubbing the
card<00:02:36.129> and<00:02:36.569> bringing<00:02:37.569> the<00:02:37.690> face<00:02:37.930> back<00:02:38.230> yeah

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
card and bringing the face back yeah

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.539 
card and bringing the face back yeah
that's<00:02:39.750> who<00:02:40.750> and<00:02:41.080> if<00:02:41.860> I<00:02:41.980> did<00:02:42.190> it<00:02:42.310> right<00:02:42.489> I

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
that's who and if I did it right I

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.170 
that's who and if I did it right I
should<00:02:42.940> get<00:02:43.090> I<00:02:43.660> get<00:02:44.019> all<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.380> faces<00:02:44.860> that<00:02:45.180> in

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
should get I get all the faces that in

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.839 
should get I get all the faces that in
fact<00:02:46.450> I<00:02:46.840> think<00:02:46.989> I<00:02:47.739> think<00:02:48.190> this<00:02:48.340> might<00:02:48.549> work

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
fact I think I think this might work

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.110 
fact I think I think this might work
if<00:02:49.360> I<00:02:49.450> just<00:02:49.630> rub<00:02:49.989> this<00:02:50.349> card<00:02:50.920> over<00:02:51.220> it<00:02:51.610> on<00:02:51.819> the

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
if I just rub this card over it on the
