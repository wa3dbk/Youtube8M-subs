the hope is that they're connecting with

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.730 
the hope is that they're connecting with
characters<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:57.990> they<00:01:58.110> know<00:01:58.290> from<00:01:58.470> the<00:01:58.590> other

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740

characters that they know from the other
films<00:01:59.220> and<00:01:59.430> we've<00:02:00.000> hopefully<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.900> know<00:02:00.990> made

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
films and we've hopefully you know made

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.140 
films and we've hopefully you know made
a<00:02:01.170> story<00:02:01.440> that<00:02:01.770> has<00:02:02.220> a<00:02:02.280> progression<00:02:02.760> from<00:02:03.060> the

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
a story that has a progression from the

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.510 
a story that has a progression from the
first<00:02:03.450> two<00:02:03.720> and<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.590> think<00:02:04.620> you<00:02:04.980> see<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.250> growth

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
first two and I think you see the growth

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.430 
first two and I think you see the growth
of<00:02:05.790> these<00:02:05.880> characters<00:02:06.420> over<00:02:06.690> the<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:07.320> know

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
of these characters over the you know

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.109 
of these characters over the you know
nine<00:02:07.620> or<00:02:07.800> ten<00:02:07.980> years<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.460> the<00:02:08.610> stories

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
nine or ten years that the stories

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.220 
nine or ten years that the stories
taking<00:02:09.360> place
