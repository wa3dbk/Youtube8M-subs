00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.349
 Yes, this time, I will bring the frontier back to foster and 7th. 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:16.230
 4 This is the finest choebyeongguk foster yirang 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:17.160
 Chilsung gun carriage and look back once pioneering as others do in two Miller 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.119
 I'll do it. 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.100
 4 Miller is in such a lull state, and Gogi is now synthesizing 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.660
 Trying thus to the quarter-finals 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:33.859
 But somehow reinforced resin 9 groups still far ahead Chilsung Stacy wonak 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.859
 I 'll leave it like this and get my frontier back. 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:41.660
 Because the frontier is cultivated, I usually use this map again. 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.660
 I'll take a look. 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.320
 Oh, I'll see Miller as a big screen. 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:59.489
 But the fact that Miller was raised in the first place, 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:02.280
 And the supply is a little bit faster, but if I have damage to the flag, 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.920
 I do not know if it makes such a big difference. 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.920
 I guess the ball is definitely faster than before. 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:13.580
 Now , when the profanity is increasing, 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:18.970
 Time 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.970
 And even though it seems a little different. 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:35.450
 Now the old cowboy in training so when you see the speed pyeongta 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.450
 It was very fast like the other one in the flat can that I used to blow up . 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.659
 I am sure that the degree of speed when I am now growing in this way is usually vacant 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.939
 Ramen 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.939
 It looks like Miller German is going to be over. 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.530
 Ah, the speed seems to be a little faster than nine . 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:09.300
 If this year is like this because even grilled dwaetgi to a nearly similar skill level 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.860
 When you compare with Chilseong Hatta 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.860
 It looks like it's not nearly alike. 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:27.580
 Milo critical passive case is almost always usually once every year once 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:31.330
 It looks like it's sagging, so once it's triggered, it's going to be awesome. 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:34.630
 I feel a little tired already. 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:39.110
 It's 60 seconds cooldown for 15 seconds 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:41.110
 It sounds like a good fairy requirements haejuneunge little more reduced 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.110
 U 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.870
 m The score area arrived almost identically 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:00.590
 Stamina seems a bit expensive. 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:02.830
 So look foster finals yirang Tanabata no-direction is almost similar to the performance of these 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.830
 It looks like 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:14.800
 Place the insane ride compared Maybe you will be much difference nagetjiman 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:20.200
 Yoon Young-ae So it seems to be the mainstream 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.400
 9th When the boiler when the composite has a feel-finals 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.640
 I think it's sad. 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.640
 Yes The completion rate is almost the same 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:34.130
 It's a normal map now, but it seems a bit difficult to turn around by yourself. 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:43.110
 4 strengthen dwaetneunde Although the upward like ingeo andoeseo grungy yet by some 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.110
 I'll do the video on here.
