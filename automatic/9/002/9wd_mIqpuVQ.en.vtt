00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
startup however we tested it here on two

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.459 
startup however we tested it here on two
different<00:00:56.489> iPad<00:00:56.910> 1<00:00:57.120> devices<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.899> got<00:00:58.079> two

different iPad 1 devices and got two

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.590 
different iPad 1 devices and got two
different<00:00:58.620> results<00:00:59.309> now<00:00:59.699> we<00:00:59.760> had<00:01:00.000> one<00:01:00.210> iPad

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
different results now we had one iPad
