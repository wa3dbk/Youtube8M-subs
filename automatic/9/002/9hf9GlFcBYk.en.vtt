00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.119 

today<00:00:00.690> I'm<00:00:00.870> making<00:00:01.050> a<00:00:01.319> set<00:00:01.500> of<00:00:01.530> new<00:00:01.740> pickup

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
today I'm making a set of new pickup

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.670 
today I'm making a set of new pickup
risers<00:00:02.580> for<00:00:02.790> this<00:00:02.939> 55<00:00:03.480> Gretch<00:00:03.840> round<00:00:04.170> up<00:00:04.440> a

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
risers for this 55 Gretch round up a

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.369 
risers for this 55 Gretch round up a
pickup<00:00:05.490> riser<00:00:05.790> goes<00:00:06.390> underneath<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:06.899> pickup

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
pickup riser goes underneath the pickup

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.650 
pickup riser goes underneath the pickup
and<00:00:07.560> holds<00:00:08.309> it<00:00:08.400> up<00:00:08.519> on<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.970> plane<00:00:09.179> of<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.450> top

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
and holds it up on the plane of the top

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.990 
and holds it up on the plane of the top
to<00:00:10.230> bring<00:00:10.349> it<00:00:10.530> closer<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.130> strings<00:00:11.460> it's

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
to bring it closer to the strings it's

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.879 
to bring it closer to the strings it's
not<00:00:12.210> like<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.660> mounting<00:00:13.410> ring<00:00:13.590> that<00:00:13.740> goes

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
not like a mounting ring that goes

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.919 
not like a mounting ring that goes
around<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.309> humbucker<00:00:14.670> it's<00:00:14.969> different<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.450> in

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
around a humbucker it's different and in

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.750 
around a humbucker it's different and in
this<00:00:16.139> case<00:00:16.379> it's<00:00:16.619> curved<00:00:16.890> on<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.100> bottom<00:00:17.580> and

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
this case it's curved on the bottom and

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.429 
this case it's curved on the bottom and
flat<00:00:18.060> on<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.390> top<00:00:18.600> because<00:00:18.869> these<00:00:19.230> old

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
flat on the top because these old

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.349 
flat on the top because these old
dearmond<00:00:19.800> pickups<00:00:20.340> are<00:00:20.850> flat<00:00:21.150> on<00:00:21.180> the

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
dearmond pickups are flat on the

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.109 
dearmond pickups are flat on the
underside<00:00:22.039> these<00:00:23.039> risers<00:00:23.609> are<00:00:23.789> made<00:00:23.939> out<00:00:24.090> of

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
underside these risers are made out of

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.080 
underside these risers are made out of
celluloid<00:00:24.720> in<00:00:24.900> 1955<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.189> they've<00:00:26.609> rotted<00:00:26.970> to

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
celluloid in 1955 and they've rotted to

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.630 
celluloid in 1955 and they've rotted to
pieces<00:00:27.480> they<00:00:28.230> smell<00:00:28.590> they<00:00:28.890> have<00:00:29.070> fumes<00:00:29.369> coming

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
pieces they smell they have fumes coming

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.299 
pieces they smell they have fumes coming
off<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:29.910> them<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.710> that<00:00:31.710> rots<00:00:31.980> all<00:00:32.189> the

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
off of them and that rots all the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.580 
off of them and that rots all the
plastic<00:00:32.730> on<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.969> guitar<00:00:33.270> eventually<00:00:33.840> it's

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
plastic on the guitar eventually it's

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.870 
plastic on the guitar eventually it's
even<00:00:34.890> happening<00:00:35.250> right<00:00:35.399> here<00:00:35.460> on<00:00:35.670> the

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
even happening right here on the

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.180 
even happening right here on the
pickguard<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.510> that'll<00:00:36.809> go<00:00:36.989> as<00:00:37.290> that

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
pickguard and that'll go as that

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.000 
pickguard and that'll go as that
celluloid<00:00:38.730> dries<00:00:39.149> out<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.719> gets<00:00:39.930> old<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.590> rots

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
celluloid dries out and gets old it rots

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.310 
celluloid dries out and gets old it rots
and<00:00:41.430> these<00:00:42.059> fumes<00:00:42.420> come<00:00:42.780> out<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.079> it

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
and these fumes come out of it

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.799 
and these fumes come out of it
it's<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.860> solvents<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.489> are<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:44.760> there<00:00:45.000> some

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
it's the solvents that are in there some

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.380 
it's the solvents that are in there some
people<00:00:46.079> call<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.260> off<00:00:46.590> gassing<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.430> they<00:00:48.180> come

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
people call it off gassing and they come

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.240 
people call it off gassing and they come
out<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.719> infect<00:00:49.289> all<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.590> metal<00:00:49.860> parts<00:00:50.160> with

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
out and infect all the metal parts with

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.549 
out and infect all the metal parts with
gold<00:00:50.640> plating<00:00:51.000> us<00:00:51.120> really<00:00:51.480> bad<00:00:51.690> they<00:00:52.320> turn

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
gold plating us really bad they turn

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.740 
gold plating us really bad they turn
green<00:00:52.920> there's<00:00:53.489> rust<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.030> corrosion<00:00:54.390> and

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
green there's rust and corrosion and

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.650 
green there's rust and corrosion and
then<00:00:55.620> if<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.039> case<00:00:56.309> has<00:00:56.579> been<00:00:57.000> closed<00:00:57.449> for

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
then if the case has been closed for

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.420 
then if the case has been closed for
many<00:00:57.960> years<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.590> guitar<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:58.949> trapped<00:00:59.250> in

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
many years and the guitar is trapped in

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.000 
many years and the guitar is trapped in
there<00:00:59.640> it's<00:00:59.910> even<00:01:00.210> worse<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:01.379> neck<00:01:01.559> pickups

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
there it's even worse the neck pickups

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.590 
there it's even worse the neck pickups
the<00:01:02.190> same<00:01:02.399> thing<00:01:02.699> but<00:01:02.879> it's<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> little

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
the same thing but it's in a little

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.399 
the same thing but it's in a little
better<00:01:03.719> shape<00:01:05.060> its<00:01:06.060> corrosion<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.900> rust<00:01:07.110> all

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
better shape its corrosion and rust all

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.560 
better shape its corrosion and rust all
over<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.799> Nuttall<00:01:08.070> parts<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.640> gold<00:01:09.180> plating

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
over the Nuttall parts and gold plating

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.330 
over the Nuttall parts and gold plating
really<00:01:09.840> gets<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.200> bad<00:01:10.380> from<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> pickup<00:01:11.040> rot

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
really gets it bad from the pickup rot

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.429 
really gets it bad from the pickup rot
so<00:01:12.180> what<00:01:12.360> I'm<00:01:12.479> going<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.689> do<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:13.020> make<00:01:13.229> my

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
so what I'm going to do is make my

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.620 
so what I'm going to do is make my
mounting<00:01:13.799> rings<00:01:14.010> out<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.250> tortoise<00:01:15.119> acrylic

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
mounting rings out of tortoise acrylic

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.749 
mounting rings out of tortoise acrylic
it's<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.380> modern<00:01:16.740> material<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.340> doesn't<00:01:17.520> do

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
it's a modern material that doesn't do

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.940 
it's a modern material that doesn't do
all<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:17.970> rot<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.720> it's<00:01:19.409> easy<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.799> machine

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
all that rot and it's easy to machine

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.899 
all that rot and it's easy to machine
and<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:21.509> tried<00:01:21.750> something<00:01:22.049> new<00:01:22.350> today<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.920> found

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
and I tried something new today I found

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.120 
and I tried something new today I found
out<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.390> radius<00:01:24.750> on<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.080> top<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.530> 16

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
out that the radius on the top is a 16

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.109 
out that the radius on the top is a 16
up<00:01:26.340> here<00:01:26.580> at<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.850> bridge<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:28.820> it's<00:01:29.820> about<00:01:30.060> a

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
up here at the bridge and it's about a

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.170 
up here at the bridge and it's about a
25<00:01:31.079> up<00:01:31.560> here<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.040> did<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.490> by<00:01:32.700> taking<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
25 up here and I did that by taking the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.980 
25 up here and I did that by taking the
shape<00:01:33.390> copier<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:35.420> picking<00:01:36.420> up<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.570> shape

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
shape copier and picking up the shape

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.620 
shape copier and picking up the shape
and<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:38.130> made<00:01:38.340> two<00:01:38.520> blocks<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.000> those<00:01:39.240> curves

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
and I made two blocks to those curves

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.050 
and I made two blocks to those curves
and<00:01:39.960> that's<00:01:40.619> what<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:40.920> double<00:01:41.340> stick<00:01:41.549> tape<00:01:41.579> down

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
and that's what I double stick tape down

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.510 
and that's what I double stick tape down
my<00:01:42.240> plastic<00:01:42.750> -<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.229> took<00:01:43.530> some<00:01:43.740> mahogany<00:01:44.430> and

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
my plastic - I took some mahogany and

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.200 
my plastic - I took some mahogany and
cut<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.299> curved<00:01:45.659> radius<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.649> top

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
cut it to a curved radius of the top

flatter<00:01:50.399> on<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.790> neck<00:01:51.560> then<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.680> could<00:01:52.860> double

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
flatter on the neck then I could double

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.889 
flatter on the neck then I could double
stick<00:01:53.399> tape<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.119> curve<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.540> put<00:01:54.780> the

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
stick tape on to the curve and put the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.130 
stick tape on to the curve and put the

machine vise and cut all around and get

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.459 
machine vise and cut all around and get
the<00:02:00.090> accurate<00:02:00.540> shape<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.020> then<00:02:01.110> cut<00:02:01.320> the

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
the accurate shape and then cut the

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.609 
the accurate shape and then cut the
center's<00:02:01.799> out<00:02:02.420> all<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.479> needed<00:02:03.930> was<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.320> double

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
center's out all I needed was the double

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.319 
center's out all I needed was the double
stick<00:02:04.890> tape<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.280> hold<00:02:05.399> this<00:02:05.640> one<00:02:05.850> down<00:02:06.090> because

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
stick tape to hold this one down because

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.990 
stick tape to hold this one down because
it's<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:06.689> skinny<00:02:07.129> this<00:02:08.129> one<00:02:08.399> has<00:02:08.550> two<00:02:08.700> layers

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
it's so skinny this one has two layers

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.300 
it's so skinny this one has two layers
glued<00:02:09.360> together<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.840> that's<00:02:10.470> how<00:02:10.649> Gretch<00:02:11.039> did

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
glued together and that's how Gretch did

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.420 
glued together and that's how Gretch did
it<00:02:11.430> back<00:02:11.640> then

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
it back then

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.520 
it back then
that's<00:02:13.299> a<00:02:13.420> little<00:02:13.629> stiffer<00:02:14.110> and<00:02:14.260> I<00:02:14.349> don't

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
that's a little stiffer and I don't

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.080 
that's a little stiffer and I don't
think<00:02:14.739> that<00:02:14.920> would<00:02:15.069> have<00:02:15.159> stuck<00:02:15.489> too<00:02:15.700> well<00:02:15.879> to

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
think that would have stuck too well to

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.929 
think that would have stuck too well to
the<00:02:16.209> tape<00:02:16.620> so<00:02:17.620> what<00:02:17.769> I<00:02:17.799> did<00:02:17.920> was<00:02:18.280> I<00:02:18.340> glued<00:02:18.760> the

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:18.939 
the tape so what I did was I glued the

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:20.940 
the tape so what I did was I glued the
bridge<00:02:19.150> riser<00:02:19.420> pieces<00:02:19.930> together<00:02:20.110> on<00:02:20.560> a<00:02:20.590> curve

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
bridge riser pieces together on a curve

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.850 
bridge riser pieces together on a curve
I<00:02:21.420> used<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.540> take<00:02:22.689> a<00:02:22.750> thick<00:02:23.019> piece<00:02:23.200> of<00:02:23.260> plastic

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
I used to take a thick piece of plastic

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.920 
I used to take a thick piece of plastic
and<00:02:24.010> bandsaw<00:02:24.879> it<00:02:24.939> to<00:02:25.120> a<00:02:25.150> curve<00:02:25.420> to<00:02:25.599> get<00:02:25.750> this

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
and bandsaw it to a curve to get this

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.410 
and bandsaw it to a curve to get this
riser<00:02:26.230> bottom<00:02:26.739> and<00:02:26.920> then<00:02:27.579> sand<00:02:27.939> that<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.329> the

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
riser bottom and then sand that to the

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.660 
riser bottom and then sand that to the
shape<00:02:28.659> I<00:02:28.930> had<00:02:29.260> a<00:02:29.290> new<00:02:29.500> idea<00:02:29.890> here<00:02:30.189> I<00:02:30.220> took<00:02:30.370> the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
shape I had a new idea here I took the

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.970 
shape I had a new idea here I took the
two<00:02:30.819> pieces<00:02:31.269> and<00:02:31.420> I<00:02:31.840> glued<00:02:32.170> them<00:02:32.409> together<00:02:32.590> on

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
two pieces and I glued them together on

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.399 
two pieces and I glued them together on
a<00:02:33.010> curve<00:02:33.370> with<00:02:34.299> three<00:02:34.540> blocks<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:34.989> hold<00:02:35.260> them

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:35.409 
a curve with three blocks to hold them

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:38.729 
a curve with three blocks to hold them
down<00:02:35.489> three<00:02:36.489> clamps<00:02:36.790> in<00:02:37.629> a<00:02:37.930> couple<00:02:38.230> of<00:02:38.319> drywall

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
down three clamps in a couple of drywall

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.710 
down three clamps in a couple of drywall
screws<00:02:39.129> to<00:02:39.340> keep<00:02:39.519> the<00:02:39.700> two<00:02:39.849> pieces<00:02:40.239> in<00:02:40.450> line

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
screws to keep the two pieces in line

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.440 
screws to keep the two pieces in line
when<00:02:40.959> I<00:02:40.989> glue<00:02:41.319> them<00:02:41.500> and<00:02:41.650> then<00:02:42.549> the<00:02:42.700> next<00:02:42.970> day<00:02:43.030> I

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
when I glue them and then the next day I

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.440 
when I glue them and then the next day I
had<00:02:43.689> a<00:02:43.870> curved<00:02:44.290> blank<00:02:44.879> that<00:02:45.879> fit<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.269> top

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
had a curved blank that fit the top

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.140 
had a curved blank that fit the top
perfectly<00:02:47.079> and<00:02:47.230> is<00:02:47.319> very<00:02:47.560> rigid<00:02:47.859> and<00:02:48.220> I<00:02:48.819> didn't

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
perfectly and is very rigid and I didn't

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.229 
perfectly and is very rigid and I didn't
have<00:02:49.269> to<00:02:49.420> do<00:02:49.569> any<00:02:49.780> sawing<00:02:50.700> it's<00:02:51.700> just<00:02:52.060> the

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
have to do any sawing it's just the

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.420 
have to do any sawing it's just the
shape<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.720> it<00:02:52.840> was<00:02:52.959> perfect<00:02:53.440> for<00:02:53.590> going<00:02:54.220> about

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
shape and it was perfect for going about

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.710 
shape and it was perfect for going about
and<00:02:54.579> doing<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:54.909> machine<00:02:55.239> work<00:02:57.329> then<00:02:58.329> I<00:02:58.359> being

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
and doing the machine work then I being

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.199 
and doing the machine work then I being
sawed<00:02:59.049> away<00:02:59.079> the<00:02:59.500> block<00:02:59.709> and<00:03:00.069> sanded<00:03:00.909> right<00:03:01.060> up

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
sawed away the block and sanded right up

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.330 
sawed away the block and sanded right up
to<00:03:01.359> the<00:03:01.480> plastic<00:03:01.959> so<00:03:02.200> I<00:03:02.230> have<00:03:02.560> a<00:03:02.590> holding<00:03:03.099> block

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
to the plastic so I have a holding block

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.729 
to the plastic so I have a holding block
now<00:03:03.639> that's<00:03:03.909> got<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.689> riser<00:03:04.930> on<00:03:05.139> it's<00:03:05.500> still

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
now that's got the riser on it's still

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.699 
now that's got the riser on it's still
stuck<00:03:06.040> there<00:03:06.099> and<00:03:06.720> I<00:03:07.720> traced<00:03:08.049> out<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.439> little

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
stuck there and I traced out the little

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.740 
stuck there and I traced out the little
radius<00:03:09.040> on<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.400> ends<00:03:09.760> using<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.239> old<00:03:10.450> ring

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
radius on the ends using the old ring

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.629 
radius on the ends using the old ring
and<00:03:11.549> shape<00:03:12.549> that<00:03:12.579> on<00:03:13.150> my<00:03:13.450> little<00:03:14.379> belt<00:03:15.040> sander

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:15.639 
and shape that on my little belt sander

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:19.349 
and shape that on my little belt sander
it's<00:03:16.419> an<00:03:16.599> edge<00:03:16.780> sander<00:03:17.079> or<00:03:17.290> tiny<00:03:17.590> one<00:03:17.859> and<00:03:18.549> when

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
it's an edge sander or tiny one and when

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:20.939 
it's an edge sander or tiny one and when
that<00:03:19.480> was<00:03:19.629> right<00:03:19.870> up<00:03:19.900> was<00:03:20.169> pretty<00:03:20.530> easy<00:03:20.739> to

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:20.949 
that was right up was pretty easy to

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:23.640 
that was right up was pretty easy to
take<00:03:21.099> it<00:03:21.280> out<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:21.699> get<00:03:22.540> five<00:03:23.049> different<00:03:23.260> grits

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
take it out and get five different grits

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.530 
take it out and get five different grits
of<00:03:23.829> stick<00:03:24.280> of<00:03:24.430> gold<00:03:24.609> paper<00:03:24.879> and<00:03:25.150> put<00:03:25.269> it<00:03:25.299> on<00:03:25.510> a
