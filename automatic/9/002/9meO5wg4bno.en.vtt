absolutely<00:00:24.040> clear<00:00:24.430> about<00:00:24.790> that<00:00:24.970> it's<00:00:25.360> very

absolutely clear about that it's very

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.120 
absolutely clear about that it's very
nice<00:00:25.840> to<00:00:25.869> be<00:00:26.050> enough<00:00:26.410> installation<00:00:26.860> where<00:00:27.040> you

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
nice to be enough installation where you

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.400 
nice to be enough installation where you
can<00:00:27.340> invent<00:00:27.790> yourself<00:00:28.240> if<00:00:28.450> you<00:00:28.570> want<00:00:28.810> a<00:00:28.990> little

I<00:00:33.730> think<00:00:34.239> the<00:00:34.360> canal<00:00:34.570> name<00:00:34.840> is<00:00:35.110> a<00:00:35.140> tremendous

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
I think the canal name is a tremendous

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.310 
I think the canal name is a tremendous
name<00:00:35.980> it<00:00:36.190> has<00:00:36.309> a<00:00:36.370> fantastic<00:00:37.150> image<00:00:37.330> it<00:00:38.170> is<00:00:38.290> a

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
name it has a fantastic image it is a

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.049 
name it has a fantastic image it is a
strength<00:00:38.680> there's<00:00:39.070> no<00:00:39.250> doubt<00:00:39.430> about<00:00:39.580> it<00:00:39.730> the

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
strength there's no doubt about it the

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.479 
strength there's no doubt about it the
canal<00:00:40.390> through<00:00:40.570> the<00:00:41.320> work<00:00:41.559> now<00:00:41.860> if<00:00:41.920> the<00:00:42.129> family

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
canal through the work now if the family

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.420 
canal through the work now if the family
name<00:00:43.379> certainly<00:00:44.379> opens<00:00:44.800> a<00:00:44.890> lot<00:00:45.040> of<00:00:45.070> doors

matters and installation is just an

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:53.250

did<00:01:04.149> plus<00:01:04.839> what<00:01:05.379> I<00:01:05.410> would<00:01:05.800> say<00:01:05.950> is<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:07.479> we

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
did plus what I would say is that we

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.840 
did plus what I would say is that we
never<00:01:07.750> say<00:01:08.110> that<00:01:08.740> something<00:01:09.160> is<00:01:09.250> impossible

you<00:01:13.660> know<00:01:13.780> reducing<00:01:14.380> the<00:01:15.280> carbon<00:01:16.410> emissions

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
you know reducing the carbon emissions

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.499 
you know reducing the carbon emissions
you<00:01:17.740> know<00:01:17.860> I<00:01:18.070> like<00:01:18.580> that<00:01:18.610> I<00:01:19.000> think<00:01:19.240> it's<00:01:19.330> good

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
you know I like that I think it's good

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.640 
you know I like that I think it's good
yeah<00:01:20.220> yeah<00:01:21.250> it<00:01:21.910> gives<00:01:22.119> me<00:01:22.299> pride<00:01:22.510> so<00:01:23.260> I<00:01:23.290> just

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
yeah yeah it gives me pride so I just

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.399 
yeah yeah it gives me pride so I just
have<00:01:23.830> this<00:01:23.950> vision<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:25.390> energy<00:01:26.080> efficiency

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
have this vision that energy efficiency

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.740 
have this vision that energy efficiency
is<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:27.310> core<00:01:27.549> of<00:01:27.580> everything<00:01:28.030> that<00:01:28.420> we<00:01:28.570> should

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
is the core of everything that we should

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.660 
is the core of everything that we should
be<00:01:28.869> doing<00:01:29.200> as<00:01:29.530> a<00:01:29.560> society<00:01:30.220> canal<00:01:30.549> for

insulation is in a fantastic position it

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.310 
insulation is in a fantastic position it
has<00:01:32.890> a<00:01:32.920> portfolio<00:01:33.790> of<00:01:33.850> solutions<00:01:34.150> which<00:01:35.110> are

think<00:01:39.220> now<00:01:39.610> installation<00:01:40.330> in<00:01:40.450> a<00:01:40.479> few<00:01:40.689> years

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
think now installation in a few years

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.749 
think now installation in a few years
would<00:01:43.270> have<00:01:43.540> a<00:01:43.570> reference<00:01:44.380> as<00:01:44.650> the<00:01:45.070> leader<00:01:45.490> in

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
would have a reference as the leader in

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.899 
would have a reference as the leader in
insulation<00:01:46.630> you<00:01:47.470> have<00:01:47.740> this<00:01:48.009> this<00:01:48.430> metric

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909

flight try to find that in any other
values<00:04:35.950> from<00:04:36.950> other<00:04:37.100> companies<00:04:37.460> and<00:04:37.760> that

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
values from other companies and that

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.420 
values from other companies and that
extends<00:04:38.570> also<00:04:38.690> to<00:04:38.840> the<00:04:39.080> environment<00:04:39.680> and<00:04:40.250> the

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
extends also to the environment and the

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.280 
extends also to the environment and the
impact<00:04:40.760> you<00:04:40.850> have<00:04:40.940> on<00:04:41.090> the<00:04:41.300> environment<00:04:41.810> and<00:04:42.169> I

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
impact you have on the environment and I

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.140 
impact you have on the environment and I
think<00:04:42.320> he's<00:04:42.710> part<00:04:42.919> of<00:04:43.130> that<00:04:43.310> that<00:04:43.550> value<00:04:43.910> I

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
think he's part of that that value I

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.480 
think he's part of that that value I
think<00:04:44.389> it<00:04:44.750> really<00:04:44.930> is<00:04:45.080> about<00:04:45.320> trusts<00:04:45.980> that's

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
think it really is about trusts that's

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.000 
think it really is about trusts that's
something<00:04:47.450> that<00:04:47.600> is<00:04:47.750> really<00:04:48.290> key<00:04:48.530> to<00:04:48.560> my<00:04:48.980> life

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
something that is really key to my life

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.430 
something that is really key to my life
I<00:04:49.490> like<00:04:49.790> the<00:04:49.910> people<00:04:50.090> I<00:04:50.270> work<00:04:50.480> with<00:04:50.510> and<00:04:50.690> I<00:04:51.230> care

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
I like the people I work with and I care

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.380 
I like the people I work with and I care
about<00:04:51.470> them<00:04:51.800> and<00:04:52.130> and<00:04:52.430> I<00:04:52.520> think<00:04:52.790> that's<00:04:53.000> the

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
about them and and I think that's the

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.330 
about them and and I think that's the
best<00:04:53.630> situation<00:04:54.200> you<00:04:54.290> can<00:04:54.440> be<00:04:54.590> in<00:04:54.740> but<00:04:54.919> I<00:04:55.040> think

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
best situation you can be in but I think

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.280 
best situation you can be in but I think
you<00:04:55.790> know<00:04:55.910> giving<00:04:56.210> consideration<00:04:56.900> and<00:04:57.020> care

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
you know giving consideration and care

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.350 
you know giving consideration and care
for<00:04:58.040> the<00:04:58.130> broader<00:04:58.340> community<00:04:58.460> and<00:04:59.030> for<00:04:59.240> other

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
for the broader community and for other

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.200 
for the broader community and for other
people<00:04:59.750> is<00:04:59.900> probably<00:05:00.470> a<00:05:00.710> decent<00:05:01.210> decent

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
people is probably a decent decent

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.550 
people is probably a decent decent
definition<00:05:02.930> but<00:05:03.230> for<00:05:03.470> me<00:05:03.650> it's<00:05:04.490> about<00:05:04.610> being

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
definition but for me it's about being

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:43.800 
definition but for me it's about being
who<00:05:06.560> you<00:05:06.620> are

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.870
