immigration stopped in the United States

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.259 
immigration stopped in the United States
in<00:03:40.510> the<00:03:40.540> 50s<00:03:41.200> everyone<00:03:42.190> came<00:03:42.430> to<00:03:42.609> Canada<00:03:43.060> here

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
in the 50s everyone came to Canada here

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.590 
in the 50s everyone came to Canada here
so<00:03:44.130> they<00:03:45.130> came<00:03:45.340> to<00:03:45.549> Canada<00:03:46.000> starting<00:03:46.390> in<00:03:46.510> the

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
so they came to Canada starting in the

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.479 
so they came to Canada starting in the
50s<00:03:47.079> and<00:03:47.350> so<00:03:47.620> it's<00:03:47.829> been<00:03:48.010> a<00:03:48.040> hotbed<00:03:48.280> for

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
50s and so it's been a hotbed for

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.479 
50s and so it's been a hotbed for
immigration<00:03:49.180> since<00:03:49.480> that<00:03:49.660> time<00:03:49.900> we<00:03:50.799> I<00:03:51.190> think

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
immigration since that time we I think
