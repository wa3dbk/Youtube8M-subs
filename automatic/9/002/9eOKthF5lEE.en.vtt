00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 Hi, people today. I'll show you how. 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.750
 is that we make a fool what not 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.880
 if you think it's Carol's that has this 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.900
 That's the way it is because he's already a bunny. 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.900
 how much does she use 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:21.630
 You're going to need an empty can. 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:24.269
 I nail the hammer and if you want 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.529
 some ribbons to be able to decorate the side 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.740
 leaving the most beautiful 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.330
 in addition despite the string in both 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.399
 or three meters more or less first 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.829
 thing you do is put the nail 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:44.370
 here and with a hammer you make a background 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:45.660
 in the can we stick with the hammer to 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.780
 power 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:53.070
 I think we made a pretty good hole. 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:59.760
 There you pass the string through the hole 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:02.820
 You just made a nail ready to 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.580
 give more security can give several 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.470
 Vines to get harder now I go 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.900
 do the same thing on the other side of me 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.670
 I passed the string of the hole I made 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.170
 complete and now I'm giving you a 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.130
 turban will be trapped 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.649
 the size of the string you will define 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.700
 the child because it is important that 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:24.979
 stand up 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.590
 malate and she could hold the 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.590
 string comfort leaving this case is 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.929
 that the right size of the house to finish 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.000
 she is technically ready it's canned 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:37.490
 we all cute animals and I'm going to get 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.770
 these tapes and another at home and 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:54.530
 I will use to coat pieces there leave 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:59.539
 more decorated and ready is that people 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:05.420
 It has just taken 30 of us. 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:08.080
 see how life so silly already ready our 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.080
 aside
