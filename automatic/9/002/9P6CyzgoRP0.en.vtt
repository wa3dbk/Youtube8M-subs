00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 bondi then I started applying 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:10.530
 this is an anti soy protein wrinkle 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.380

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.640
 producer which I will speak to you in the next 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.890
 video where I talk about my schinkel 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.670
 and then this cream of green shop 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:28.310
 retinol bioplast face cream which is the 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:31.260
 day cream let's say I'm using 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:35.000
 even there in the last few weeks then today 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.129
 a very very light trick because 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.950
 because then I will apply two products 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:46.649
 of disposal the first is the bb cream 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:52.590

 practically only the 2 bb cream of the 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.109
 of disposal and I find myself well 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.760
 because I have imperfect skin 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:06.510
 fortunately in this period therefore 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:10.350
 just give a uniform na 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:15.330
 we say is as a concealer I apply e 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:20.009
 I blur the maybelline with my fingers 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:24.540
 here the gate he is 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:30.540
 finally bringing it I apply the horns la 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:33.540
 his tina and dark sponges with published ho 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:40.700

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:45.509

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.250

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:56.100
 gimme brown my color is that 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:59.720
 intermediate the next I said I would like 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.880
 for a while I don't know how long I'll resist because 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.060
 I wish I could not do them ourselves not 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.300
 touch my eyebrows alone for a 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.200
 some time make them grow because we are 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:17.820
 pass by sephora Friday morning I neither 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:21.300

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.520

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.150
 really wonderful eyebrows e 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.820
 maybe you could help me out 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.590
 arrange mine though obviously first 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.220
 to be touched up it must be made 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.590
 grow up and it's a mess because when 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.640

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.850
