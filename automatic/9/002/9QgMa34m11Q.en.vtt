00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.129
 it's salvation is so today we 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:20.800
 going to do tagliatelle with smoked salmon 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:24.200
 halal is so we will need to 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.820
 the shallot delight we call it a shrink 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.340
 of the French shallot so three 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.109
 small chiseled we do not see each other 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.019
 camera because I erased everything without 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.540
 do it on purpose as usual so here we have 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:38.300
 fresh snow at best to be 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:42.079
 fresh smoked salmon with around 85 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.360
 grams of olive oil 2 of 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.440
 tagliatelle when you see it we'll have 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.440
 also need salt and pepper 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.370
 my 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.960
 once your skin is hot with 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.000
 a little olive oil but no 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.490
 shallots with its points where we go 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.670
 leave a little yes to the fact as usual 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.770
 so I forgot the cooking cream or 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.220
 otherwise called also the cream 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.790
 so 35% or less depends on people 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:24.050
 that make diets and parmigiano 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.850
 parmesan would do so one leaves to 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.330
 whiten and meanwhile we put 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.680
 water to heat up here we will put our 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.010
 qualities because because of the fact that 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.410
 dish learns roughly seven minutes to 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.160
 do it shock you the quickest is 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.570
 simple to do but it's great but 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.890
 so do not hesitate to do it 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.080
 tighten when you do not have 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.270
 time when he had so 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.250
 So here we have to have our socialos 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.410
 ready there we see add for the cream 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.410
 top of the liquid cream 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:00.530
 we'll let it boil 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:03.050
 as I explained to you these are these 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.140
 areas all the time where days taste ray 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:11.150
 is happy we listen again souti1 drops 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:13.820
 first then we dread to see if 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.380
 that if it does it so no need to 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.459
 too much olive oil because it's used to 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.800
 nothing so in lan is chiseled so we got it 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:26.989
 add we'll let the thing bring to 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.709
 boiling the thing they love salt 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:33.459
 and pepper 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:37.760
 so let it boil 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:40.489
 and here's once that saÃ¯b unissions 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.580
 so get lost one reserves to the dishes of 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:47.000
 we are going to take our paws 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.750
 we will try to drain them here they are 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.549
 are already done also serve them 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.950
 excellent we will add that to our 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.470
 sauce and let's impregnate 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:02.120
 basically it takes two three minutes hand 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.680
 just so that all learn one turns 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.950
 well as it takes the paws in the 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.480
 science to make it creamy 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.790
 and they believe it's going to serve 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.250
 we will cut the smoked salmon we will 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.670
 regret over it we will add 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.650
 also Parmesan and that's it and that's it 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.640
 and our people to be is a whole and 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.140
 for all that took 7 minutes chrono and 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.260
 I can tell you that this is one of the 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.420
 fastest dishes in addition to 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.860
 fish in foil fish not 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.870
 his best 12 minutes that's 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:39.599
 this idyll and that's the result 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.970
 super nice super good it's excellent and 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:44.329
 here is a little sur claise that the site 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.329
 right here
