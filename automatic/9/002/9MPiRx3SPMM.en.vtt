00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.479 
to live and reproduce so a good element
is<00:02:03.939> one<00:02:04.209> that<00:02:04.419> doesn't<00:02:04.599> harm<00:02:04.840> its<00:02:05.049> host<00:02:05.289> so<00:02:06.099> so

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:06.489 
is one that doesn't harm its host so so

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:08.040 
is one that doesn't harm its host so so
that's<00:02:06.669> the<00:02:06.849> fun<00:02:07.060> that's<00:02:07.299> the<00:02:07.450> fun<00:02:07.630> part<00:02:07.659> about

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
that's the fun that's the fun part about

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.199 
that's the fun that's the fun part about
studying<00:02:08.259> elements<00:02:08.800> is<00:02:08.920> to<00:02:09.340> because<00:02:09.880> what

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
studying elements is to because what

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.270 
studying elements is to because what
we're<00:02:10.360> studying<00:02:10.690> or<00:02:10.899> our<00:02:11.500> successful

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
we're studying or our successful

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.460 
we're studying or our successful
elements<00:02:12.460> and<00:02:12.880> successful<00:02:13.690> elements<00:02:13.870> act<00:02:14.290> in

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
elements and successful elements act in

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.280 
elements and successful elements act in
very<00:02:14.770> subtle<00:02:15.070> ways<00:02:15.510> so<00:02:16.510> transpose

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
very subtle ways so transpose

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.929 
very subtle ways so transpose
elements<00:02:17.739> are<00:02:17.890> almost<00:02:18.250> perfect<00:02:18.790> genetic

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:18.939 
elements are almost perfect genetic

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:21.990 
elements are almost perfect genetic
parasites<00:02:19.950> silently<00:02:20.950> using<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.430> chromosomes
