00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 if there is one thing that leaves people 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.460
 impressed 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.990
 is the before and after any process 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.110
 of weight loss 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.019
 who does not remember ronaldo here 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.139
 the right exit before and then 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.580
 when he was magrin, and there 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:35.700
 very common doubt 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:38.610
 take a look at killing it when people 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.649
 starts a diet is very common with people 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.980
 Look forward to seeing you soon did not 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.100
 download and then we end up eating little 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.230
 doing a lot of exercise and ends up doing 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.120
 things to see some weights even download 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.309
 but then I wonder myself too 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.590
 is this really healthy our 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.360
 and then I can keep the 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.360
 I can keep what I lost. 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.329
 then all these exercises and then the 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:32.710
 class was the amount of pounds 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:32.710
 healthy psp per week 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.450
 this doubt there is that everyone has is 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.280
 how much can I lose per week person 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.250
 want to start losing many will be that 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.130
 this is healthy is it not good to 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.350
 people say that at the beginning it is 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.090
 much easier then when you 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.180
 starts any activity program 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.960
 physical rehabilitation food first 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.119
 weeks 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.610
 You'll be able to lose more, will you? 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:05.299
 lose 2 sometimes up to three pounds in one 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.610
 week because it really is easier 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.200
 you can greatly increase your spending 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.380
 you were totally 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.700
 sedentary and you end up doing the 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.440
 feed correction too 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.840
 quickly but what we usually do 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.530
 say a pound a week 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.450
 When you do a job like that, it's 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.000
 healthy thing that needs to look good 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.459

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.250
 weight you lose is not exclusively 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.780
 fat then you lose water you 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.209
 take the lean mass

 7 thousand seven thousand and 500 calories is 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.930
 more than you are consuming not

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.200
