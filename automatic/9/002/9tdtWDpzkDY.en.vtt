00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.400
 hi friends how are you here I am going to 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.550
 leave 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.210
 some notes 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:14.910
 with the seven natural tones with 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:19.920
 first second and third 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:23.580
 for example your second is sun like this 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.640
 how are you seeing here from your second sun 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.820
 your third spa and I'll give an example 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.080
 of the song that is called impossible 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.769
 ok let's see an example with the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.880
 impossible song 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:40.190
 with finger tone 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.370
 first and second do it like that so 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.910
 see better 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.910
 ah 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:54.579
 impossible it makes me forget you 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:01:02.839
 they are the second 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:08.630
 although third-party live from me is a 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:11.690
 pat even if you live absent 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.690
 [Music] 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.070
 and as I had told you this is gift in the 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:21.909
 first video 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.820
 his second is they are the second 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:29.140
 position because this tower can be in 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:31.710
 the step if it is also in the position 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.710
 of the sun 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.610
 and this is also another position that are 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:46.080
 they are located between 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:49.440
 to sun and if that is another position so that 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:53.180
 make them easier this is so that 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.810
 it can be in the note of 2 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.810
 one 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.450
 sun and the track 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:10.430
 and the list and also that is here do 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:15.370
 re my fa here in fa also going 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:19.660
 and what is that then 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:22.660
 [Music] 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.660
 life 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:33.609
 even if you live absent from me 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.079
 and also so that they learn to vocalize 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.849
 a little bit can also do the 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:40.829
 exercises that I teach them for example 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.829
 this with the o with the letter a 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.719
 ah 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.719
 [Music] 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:02.350
 then the other exercise that had 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.350

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.270
 [Music] 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.360
 [Music] 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.420

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.420

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:31.410

 and 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.160

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.720
 [Music]
