00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
good when I tap the tray he knows it's

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.049 
good when I tap the tray he knows it's
time<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.980> get<00:00:53.100> tested<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.489> know<00:00:53.520> it's<00:00:53.820> up<00:00:53.910> here

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
time to get tested you know it's up here

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.939 
time to get tested you know it's up here
to<00:00:54.149> be<00:00:54.239> tested<00:00:58.070> you<00:00:59.070> can<00:00:59.250> use<00:00:59.430> pretty<00:00:59.699> much<00:00:59.789> any

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
to be tested you can use pretty much any

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.219 
to be tested you can use pretty much any
glucometer<00:01:01.949> any<00:01:02.699> krocomodo<00:01:03.239> reward<00:01:03.840> work

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
glucometer any krocomodo reward work

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.440 
glucometer any krocomodo reward work
there<00:01:04.949> are<00:01:05.100> special<00:01:05.610> glucometers<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.360> they

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
there are special glucometers and they

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.630 
there are special glucometers and they
just<00:01:06.720> for<00:01:06.900> pets

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
just for pets

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.830 
just for pets
personally<00:01:08.640> I've<00:01:08.820> compared<00:01:09.420> them<00:01:09.810> to

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
personally I've compared them to

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.870 
personally I've compared them to
over-the-counter<00:01:10.710> glucometers<00:01:11.549> use<00:01:11.700> for

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
over-the-counter glucometers use for

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.370 
over-the-counter glucometers use for
people<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.420> there's<00:01:12.930> not<00:01:13.110> really<00:01:13.260> a

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
people and there's not really a

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.640 
people and there's not really a
significant<00:01:14.040> difference<00:01:15.110> it<00:01:16.110> doesn't<00:01:16.409> really

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
significant difference it doesn't really

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.170 
significant difference it doesn't really
matter<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.159> we<00:01:17.369> know<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.909> blood<00:01:18.030> sure

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
matter that we know that the blood sure

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.840 
matter that we know that the blood sure
is<00:01:18.360> exactly<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.380> number<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.549> give<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.759> an

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
is exactly a number is to give you an

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.980 
is exactly a number is to give you an
idea<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.420> what<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.200> number<00:01:22.530> will<00:01:23.009> be<00:01:23.540> so<00:01:24.540> I

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
idea of what the number will be so I

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.920 
idea of what the number will be so I
have<00:01:25.530> all<00:01:25.650> our<00:01:25.770> supplies<00:01:26.040> here<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.549> use<00:01:27.540> this

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
have all our supplies here I use this

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.539 
have all our supplies here I use this
meter<00:01:28.290> it's<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.680> meter<00:01:28.890> maid<00:01:28.950> for<00:01:29.250> people

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
meter it's a meter maid for people

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.670 
meter it's a meter maid for people
called<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.790> true<00:01:29.970> track<00:01:30.210> meter<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.780> like<00:01:31.470> it

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
called the true track meter I like it

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.319 
called the true track meter I like it
because<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.100> doesn't<00:01:32.340> use<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.610> huge<00:01:33.000> amount<00:01:33.240> of

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
because it doesn't use a huge amount of

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.300 
because it doesn't use a huge amount of
blood<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.659> use<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:33.840> one<00:01:34.049> microliter<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:35.159> can

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
blood to use this one microliter you can

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.890 
blood to use this one microliter you can
get<00:01:35.490> meters<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:35.880> use<00:01:36.030> less<00:01:36.390> there's<00:01:36.720> also

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
get meters that use less there's also

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.940 
get meters that use less there's also
meters<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.320> use<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.470> lot<00:01:37.680> more

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
meters that use a lot more

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.120 
meters that use a lot more
it<00:01:38.759> has<00:01:39.060> strips<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.659> fit<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.650> blood<00:01:40.890> which

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
it has strips that fit the blood which

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.859 
it has strips that fit the blood which
makes<00:01:41.369> things<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.700> lot<00:01:41.820> easier<00:01:41.880> rather<00:01:42.689> than

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
makes things a lot easier rather than

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.810 
makes things a lot easier rather than
strips<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.770> have<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.040> drop<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.610> blood

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
strips that you have to drop the blood

The Lancet pen and we have a Lancet here

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.330 
The Lancet pen and we have a Lancet here
so<00:02:00.780> we<00:02:01.020> just<00:02:01.049> load<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.590> Lancet<00:02:02.009> in<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.250> The

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
so we just load the Lancet in to The

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.670 
so we just load the Lancet in to The
Lancet<00:02:02.549> pen

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.340 

you<00:02:07.680> want<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.310> ideally<00:02:08.910> not<00:02:09.300> touch<00:02:09.660> once<00:02:10.229> you

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
you want to ideally not touch once you

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.740 
you want to ideally not touch once you

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
take off the cap nut touch the lancet to

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.830 
take off the cap nut touch the lancet to
anything<00:02:13.290> because<00:02:13.770> it<00:02:13.920> is<00:02:13.950> sterile<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:14.840> just

leading<00:04:05.250> well<00:04:05.519> I<00:04:05.730> would<00:04:05.880> kind<00:04:06.060> of<00:04:06.120> push<00:04:06.780> up<00:04:07.230> to

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
leading well I would kind of push up to

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.550 
leading well I would kind of push up to
make<00:04:08.250> more<00:04:08.400> blood<00:04:08.609> come<00:04:08.819> but<00:04:09.030> I've<00:04:09.209> got<00:04:09.690> plenty

influenza bout six hours ago so this is
probably<00:04:37.360> as<00:04:37.539> low<00:04:37.780> as<00:04:38.020> it<00:04:38.169> will<00:04:38.319> go

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
probably as low as it will go

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.659 
probably as low as it will go
66<00:04:39.940> is<00:04:40.180> pre<00:04:40.750> a<00:04:41.050> pretty<00:04:41.440> normal<00:04:41.770> number<00:04:42.310> most<00:04:42.550> of
