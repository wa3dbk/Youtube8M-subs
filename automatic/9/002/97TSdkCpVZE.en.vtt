that almost every story is better with a

bit of direct speech in own so let's

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.520 
bit of direct speech in own so let's

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
look at how we do it so here we have

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.290 
look at how we do it so here we have
great<00:00:34.890> said<00:00:35.190> spot<00:00:35.520> one<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.850> my<00:00:35.940> favorite

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
great said spot one of my favorite

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.030 
great said spot one of my favorite
sentences<00:00:36.630> now<00:00:36.960> there<00:00:37.620> are<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.739> number<00:00:37.770> of

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
sentences now there are a number of

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.860 
sentences now there are a number of
problems<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:38.730> first<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.540> all<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.840> doesn't

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
problems of this first of all it doesn't

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.500 
problems of this first of all it doesn't
have<00:00:40.230> its<00:00:40.379> inverted<00:00:40.680> commas<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.820> what<00:00:42.390> the

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
have its inverted commas so what the

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.389 
have its inverted commas so what the
person<00:00:42.840> actually<00:00:42.960> said<00:00:43.350> has<00:00:43.649> inverted<00:00:43.950> commas

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
person actually said has inverted commas

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.790 
person actually said has inverted commas
around<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:45.690> course<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.320> sentence

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
around it of course this is a sentence

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.490 
around it of course this is a sentence
so<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:46.980> gets<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.250> full<00:00:47.280> stop<00:00:47.670> at<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.940> end<00:00:48.500> now

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
so it gets a full stop at the end now

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.020 
so it gets a full stop at the end now
some<00:00:49.770> people<00:00:49.890> would<00:00:50.070> be<00:00:50.219> tempted<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.610> put<00:00:51.000> a

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
some people would be tempted to put a

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.880 
some people would be tempted to put a
full<00:00:51.210> stop<00:00:51.239> here<00:00:51.809> because<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.559> actual<00:00:52.710> fact

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
full stop here because in actual fact

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.069 
full stop here because in actual fact
the<00:00:53.190> speech<00:00:53.489> needs<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.030> be<00:00:54.120> punctuated<00:00:54.570> it's<00:00:54.960> a

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
the speech needs to be punctuated it's a

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.110 
the speech needs to be punctuated it's a
sentence<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.649> or<00:00:55.770> an<00:00:55.890> utterance<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.910> needs

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
sentence to or an utterance so it needs

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.260 
sentence to or an utterance so it needs
some<00:00:57.300> kind<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.600> punctuation<00:00:58.109> at<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.469> end<00:00:58.649> the

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
some kind of punctuation at the end the

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.340 
some kind of punctuation at the end the
inverted<00:01:00.270> comma<00:01:00.449> there<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.870> not<00:01:01.140> enough

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
inverted comma there is not enough

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.500 
inverted comma there is not enough
punctuation<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.129> end<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.430> sentence<00:01:02.879> in<00:01:03.059> this

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
punctuation to end that sentence in this

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.299 
punctuation to end that sentence in this
case<00:01:03.750> it's<00:01:03.960> full<00:01:04.199> stop<00:01:04.500> but<00:01:04.710> for<00:01:04.920> reasons<00:01:05.189> I'll

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
case it's full stop but for reasons I'll

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.830 
case it's full stop but for reasons I'll
explain<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.729> little<00:01:05.970> bit<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.330> actually<00:01:06.630> turns

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
explain a little bit that actually turns

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.770 
explain a little bit that actually turns
into<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.200> comma<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:08.280> basic<00:01:08.610> rule<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:08.880> if<00:01:09.360> your

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
into a comma the basic rule is if your

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.719 
into a comma the basic rule is if your
full<00:01:09.990> stop<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.560> followed<00:01:10.920> by<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.130> speech<00:01:11.490> verb

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
full stop is followed by a speech verb

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.660 
full stop is followed by a speech verb
like<00:01:11.760> spot<00:01:12.360> said<00:01:12.600> or<00:01:12.869> said<00:01:13.140> spot<00:01:13.409> then<00:01:14.369> your

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
like spot said or said spot then your

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.630 
like spot said or said spot then your
full<00:01:14.909> stop<00:01:15.150> turns<00:01:15.509> into<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.930> comma<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:17.040> that's

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
full stop turns into a comma so that's

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.600 
full stop turns into a comma so that's
the<00:01:17.790> first<00:01:17.970> lesson<00:01:18.210> we<00:01:18.869> have<00:01:19.220> inverted<00:01:20.220> commas

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
the first lesson we have inverted commas

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.789 
the first lesson we have inverted commas
around<00:01:20.640> we<00:01:21.390> have<00:01:21.630> terminal<00:01:22.140> punctuation<00:01:22.710> and

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
around we have terminal punctuation and

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.890 
around we have terminal punctuation and
we<00:01:22.890> also<00:01:23.009> start<00:01:23.490> with<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.640> capital<00:01:23.880> letter<00:01:24.060> some

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
we also start with a capital letter some

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.240 
we also start with a capital letter some
people<00:01:25.200> have<00:01:25.590> all<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.890> their<00:01:26.009> speech

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
people have all of their speech

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.789 
people have all of their speech
lowercase<00:01:26.820> by<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.479> normal<00:01:27.930> rules<00:01:28.140> apply<00:01:28.290> if

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
lowercase by the normal rules apply if

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.380 
lowercase by the normal rules apply if
it's<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.280> start<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.670> sentence<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.210> need<00:01:30.360> a

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
it's the start of a sentence you need a

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.240 
it's the start of a sentence you need a
capital<00:01:30.780> letter<00:01:30.900> at<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.200> start<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.650> so

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
capital letter at the start of it so

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
could also use an exclamation mark if we

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.219 
could also use an exclamation mark if we
want<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.759> or<00:01:48.240> for<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.630> matter<00:01:48.720> could<00:01:49.049> be<00:01:49.200> a
