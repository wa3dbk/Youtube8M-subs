look at only you mentioned this last

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.680 
look at only you mentioned this last
week<00:00:07.740> he<00:00:08.429> looks<00:00:08.610> an<00:00:08.730> awful<00:00:08.849> lot<00:00:09.150> like<00:00:09.269> you<00:00:09.660> I

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
week he looks an awful lot like you I

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.629 
week he looks an awful lot like you I
mean<00:00:09.870> there's<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.110> obvious<00:00:10.830> resemblance<00:00:11.460> there

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
mean there's a obvious resemblance there

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.780 
mean there's a obvious resemblance there
within<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.030> family<00:00:12.360> well<00:00:12.870> I<00:00:12.900> guess<00:00:13.230> he<00:00:13.440> should

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:13.790 
within the family well I guess he should

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.070 
within the family well I guess he should
since<00:00:14.790> we're<00:00:14.969> first<00:00:15.179> cousins<00:00:15.480> it<00:00:15.839> would<00:00:15.960> only

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
since we're first cousins it would only

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.460 
since we're first cousins it would only
make<00:00:16.379> sense<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:16.890> we'd<00:00:17.070> look<00:00:17.310> alike<00:00:18.199> and<00:00:19.199> I'm

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
make sense that we'd look alike and I'm

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.189 
make sense that we'd look alike and I'm
seeing<00:00:19.830> that<00:00:20.100> we<00:00:21.029> wrestle<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> lot<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.779> like<00:00:21.960> -<00:00:22.170> I

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
seeing that we wrestle a lot of like - I

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.929 
seeing that we wrestle a lot of like - I
like<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.710> aggressive<00:00:22.830> style<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:23.760> know<00:00:23.850> in

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939
