00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:08.069
 asked to make a video of how to store cauldron 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:14.400
 so I got a cauldron now I want what 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:18.260
 cook it that is kept how much 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.260
 we know about a month 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:35.969
 that is, he was just blurry 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:39.290
 I kept here so it seemed to prove the following 4 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:43.680
 keep always oiled 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.989
 that is, even a little can be inserted on 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.789
 whether there should always be at the wall 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.539
 smeared 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:53.210
 at night it will rust start to cook in 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:58.140
 Kazan 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:03.260
 before you start you need to pour into the cauldron 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.260
 water can be incomplete 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:13.340
 just bring it to a boil 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:20.880
 spend a little water boils 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:25.130
 need to prevent 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.130
 what 's the wall of boiling water 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.620
 waiting for a full boil 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:47.560
 drink full power well in general cauldron 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:53.560
 I have a bird like water so long 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:57.030
 cut it all meat carrots do now 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.030
 something like pilaf 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:11.590
 now we take cauldron gloves 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:11.590
 and all if 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.490
 slim 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:28.880
 Cossack Salad 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.510
 and hurts maximum 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.740
 and you can wipe 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:13.040
 said we heat the whole 45 will be fast 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:15.110
 go out all the dampness we don't need for 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:26.180
 storage casanova clean everything 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:31.209
 completely right in front of this side 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.209
 dinner was completely holy saint still there 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:48.580
 Here you can see that in front of but since 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:59.510
 we take the usual oil which was prepared 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:04:03.860
 pour one spoon the second spoon all 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:09.640
 more butter we don't need two spoons 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:14.050
 quite enough further let's say 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:26.710
 toilet paper k in this tassel 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:31.690
 brush silicone brush and we 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.690
 smeared on the walls of cauldron 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:50.479
 massage from the movie because there is water 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:59.900
 there and i'm a little 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:05:02.990
 perhaps it is the cat baking grease 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.990
 second ear 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:15.070
 all let's say 1 spoon of butter is already 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:15.070
 smeared around the groove well, and the second 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:39.950
 let's say another 20 seconds some and we 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:41.020
 turn off the gas and make a stopwatch 20 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:48.140
 seconds all 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:51.740
 I turned off the gas close our eyes give him 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:55.760
 cool well and clean in everyday place 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:59.440
 where he kept everything on it seemed ready 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:06.310
 there let's say to the next application 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:06.310
