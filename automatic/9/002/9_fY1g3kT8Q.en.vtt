00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:04.250
 It is also the second day, but how is the atmosphere of the team this year 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.500
 Is not it 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.449
 Even if I want you to come and feel great 

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:13.339
 Because the whole team is not yet 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:16.339
 I have a previous team 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:19.339
 have 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:21.099
 I mean skill 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:23.050
 Replay or 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.579
 I still do not know 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:28.019
 I think that I want to review it from now on 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.429
 Themed personal stuff in this camp of recycled paper 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:32.850
 Please let me know 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.330
 First of all 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.200
 Too early 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.200
 How much safety Nishi Izu physically 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.110
 The idea that the prefecture's season is back now 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.170
 Speak a little more with the new player 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.310
 Is it going to happen again 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.120
 I think there is something good for the team 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.630
 I think I'm shy 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.890
 If the giant Utsumi + subwoofer such thing never goes 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.010
 I think you've got a broken bone 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.700
 Ward had many goals last year 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.350
 Grandson bra is also included at all 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.790
 After a little more use 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.680
 Koichi 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.080
 That's right after all 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.690
 Tsu-kun only 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.530
 I think there were probably twenty-eight places 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.530
 It's not a shame, and one in two people 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.430
 A player who can score as much as it goes out 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.150
 Up and over 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.110
 Good defense up 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.250
 I want to work hard 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.130
 Where do you meet your team goals 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.400
 Just thinking about promoting already as a team 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.790
 I don't think it's really a dream 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.090
 Well overwhelmed 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.540
 Personally 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.540
 To collect tax and to be in all games 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.360
 Answer to want to do 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.740
 I would like to personally go for this London Olympics 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.630
 But it will be an important season 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.120
 Mountain 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.410
 I have not been to it until now 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.410
 Parts are said to the earth and I think so I think 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.180
 In the Soviet Union so much those contracts now from work to revision 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.770
 I agree that I'm working hard for this team 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.229
 Seems like 

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:19.349
 Goto owners of the town do not care at all 

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:21.899
 I want to do this year 

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:24.969
 For the supporters who are addicted to that Tokushima 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:26.339
 Please give me a message 

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:28.489
 A little in Kochi 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.369
 It is uniform but 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:32.459
 Well there is a match on the last day 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.379
 if you can 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:35.310
 Please come to the Lord
