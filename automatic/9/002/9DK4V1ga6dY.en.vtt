 I am is Friday September 12th yes 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.590
 I 'm not mistaken, remember that from 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.720
 now in this new season all the 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.580
 Friday you will have a live playing 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.650
 with you the night of the subscriber as well 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.270
 remember that shortly after it 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.760
 upload this video we will start live 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.859
 in the channel tonight playing the led 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.360
 force of 2 so I'm waiting for you all 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.040
 you who see this if you fancy 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.199
 He spent an entertaining time of course 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.970
 I encourage you to sign up and apart from 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:40.530
 that I just wanted to remember 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.540
 We are going directly to comment on the 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.829
 news that are little in this case 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.600
 but some interesting cons or 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.340
 all the first two so we're going 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.690
 there with them we start in the first place 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.370
 talking a bit about the video game of 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.530
 gta 5 and is that finally has a date 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.180
 of launch scheduled for day 18 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.760
 November in this case for the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.140
 playstation 4 platforms xbox one and 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.480
 on the other hand it will also go on sale 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.879
 on January 27 of next year 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.250
 obviously for computer and that you do not 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.440
 surprise that they are different dates of 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.970
 fact has a certain logic because if 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.830
 we have in mind that the version of 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.450
 computer if it had come out at the same time 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.369
 in the other two versions could 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.200
 have them like someone who says stolen a little 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.670
 of sales then of course rockstar 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.830
 has been 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.330
 of cuckoo and has tried to do the best 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.100
 that you could not have done anyway 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.110
 I want to delve into that controversy every 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.210
 one that gives his opinion in the comments 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.100
 there are no absolute truths, much less 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.899
 just tell you that it has come out 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.369
 also a new trailer precisely 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.930
 announcing this release date that 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.700
 you have on screen and in the description and 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.440
 which lasts about a minute and in 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.000
 which then shows us a little bit of 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.060
 content of the video game remember that 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.369
 this new version will bring 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.170
 different visual improvements like the 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.299
 increased viewing distance increased 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.490
 resolution in short a lot of 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.710
 visual additions so to speak but 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.210
 basically it will be practically the same 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.130
 experience that you saw in 360 and 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.539
 playstation3 and precisely talking about 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.670
 launch dates we also have 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.799
 to comment in this case the dying 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.899
 light a title that originally had 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.340
 scheduled its release date for the 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:04.360
 February of next year but 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.610
 that in this case has given the surprise 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.890
 recently and has changed it but not 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.110
 for later but in this case the 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.680
 has advanced one month in particular will come out 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.900
 on January 27, 2015 obviously in 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.580
 North America and shortly after day 30 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.739
 January in the rest of the world remember 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.540
 that this title will be available for 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.239
 computer playstation 3 playstation 4 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.769
 360 and xbox one there has not been a new 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.540
 trailer so there's no need to comment 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.650
 nothing more simply this announcement that 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.819
 Of course it is enough 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.349
 interesting alone 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.700
 let's continue here with a little news 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.170
 that has to do with the video game of 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.970
 alien to isolation and is that it has left 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.950
 recently a new very short trailer 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.330
 about 40 seconds approximately 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.220
 you have it on screen and in the 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.170
 description and what you intend to give us 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.160
 understand on the one hand that not only 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.630
 there will be someone 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.850
 videogames but there will also be n 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.220
 fish with which to interact in a 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.140
 positive or in a negative way and also 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.880
 that not always the smartest thing is 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.950
 shoot because that can cause 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.330
 quite negative consequences in order 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.560
 leaving aside this nonsense of 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.900
 trailers remember that the date of 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.340
 launch is scheduled for day 7 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.530
 October and will be released for computer 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.750
 playstation 3 playstation 4 360 and xbox 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.340
 one we continue talking about another trailer 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.950
 what you have on screen and what belongs 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.210
 to the video game of crío a title that already 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.100
 I have spoken to you many times but 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.560
 I remember it's a kind of arcade 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.700
 driving based especially on the 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.800
 multiplayer that will get 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.690
 coming soon on the 11th day of 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.930
 November for computer playfish are 4 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.970
 360 and xbox one that effectively is not 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.800
 named playstation3 because it will not come out 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.970
 for that platform that many times 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.830
 you asked me and it's going to come out 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.960
 for playstation3 it's not going to go out for 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.760
 said platform have not explained 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.140
 exactly why, but it's a shame 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.150
 true if in this case what I wanted 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.920
 comment on this news is the trailer 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.600
 as I have said at the beginning that 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.210
 focuses especially on talking about the 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.430
 mechanics that will affect the gameplay 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.620
 and especially the issue of 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.819
 sociability or social networks 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.739
 implemented within 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.390
 videogames I do not put a nonsense but 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.859
 remember that ubisoft said he would have 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.480
 a very important role between this 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:59.799
 video game so maybe I can 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.120
 interesting finally I have done everything 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.590
 What do you have to know about this video game? 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.239
 now we just have to wait for his 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.439
 launch and finally to finish 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.730
 we also make a new spot 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:09.099
 advertising that has published 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.930
 recently electronic arts that has 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.459
 what to do with the fifa 15 videogame the 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.349
 that you have on screen that lasts about two 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.810
 minutes approximately and that 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:18.699
 basically it tells us that we will feel with 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.709
 this video game football like never 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:22.240
 before we had felt it I think this 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.919
 It sounds like other years and other 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.590
 deliveries but well finally let's say 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.400
 the spot is quite entertaining and deserves 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.690
 it's a shame that you take a look 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.250
 remember that the release date 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.590
 this video game is planned for the 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.300
 September 25 a day later the 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.430
 United Kingdom- in case I did not live there 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:40.180
 and will go out for playstation 3 playstation 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:42.370
 4 360 xbox band or computer 3ds vita and 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.199
 wii if paraguay one is going to leave 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.910
 curiously, finally remember that 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:47.770
 you have a demo currently available 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.970
 of this video game and finally here 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.680
 this gaming news I hope that I have 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.449
 liked as I said at the beginning 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.220
 of the video if you fancy tonight 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:55.900
 a ratillo entertained with me not 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.910
 hesitate to take a look at the live 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.470
 or even participate if you wish 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:03.030
 so just thank you very much for 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.030
