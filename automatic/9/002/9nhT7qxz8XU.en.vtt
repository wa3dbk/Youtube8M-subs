00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.920
 how are you good today I bring you a video 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.120
 that you have asked me strangely 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.940
 very much and I say strangely because 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.840
 for me it's like that very simple very very 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.389
 I do not know good the fact is that that's why 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.060
 a little bit this perspective now you will see and 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.310
 is when I told you that I was wearing some 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.380
 waves that I had made with a bow 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.989
 you asked so much in comments 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.169
 as by private message that like me 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:30.419
 he did those waves on the waves and he 's very good 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.219
 simple is more is that it gives me a little 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.600
 this shame to do it because when 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.550
 see how I do it, you are going to say and 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.320
 family and then a video then 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.030
 girls I asked for it if I give you a 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.269
 video you have to dislodge my 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.300
 hanging and nothing because that is very 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:47.670
 I'll use what I'm going to use now 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.710
 same let's see I usually do this 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.379
 hairstyle to the best when I have showered 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.110
 I have already wet hair but it is 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.920
 pretty pretty dry 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.040
 and I'm going to go to bed or I'll be 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.690
 all day or a while doing things and 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.900
 I make the bow and then I keep 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.430
 that's how much more carefree it depends on the 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.700
 day and how they made my bow 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.160
 does not have an exact science notice can 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.890
 to be as those waves as well as 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.300
 little beach the truth is very nice and 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.360
 day that is that there really are some 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.520
 Lovely curls do not look like people 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.880
 it is my hair that is not and my hair 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.619
 well it 's that smooth and it still has a little 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.300
 wave because today I took the east what 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.090
 it happens that I have taken them away so that 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.040
 see more so you see more this is 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.100
 is turning to make it look more 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.500
 the result then good what I'm going to 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.600
 use right now it's going to be to moisten 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.750
 my hair can you use oatmeal water 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.240
 tap water whatever you want any 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.670
 to be a paschal like 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.740
 I'm going to use this heat protector 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.780
 of leds cosmetics that I've taken it out on 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.700
 some video a subscriber and I do not 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.780
 agreement who told me he was at a 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.399
 euro and I think it's because they're going to 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.439
 check out I do not know but it smells 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.600
 incredibly well and it works for me 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.030
 well I do not notice the driest hair since 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.849
 I use it when I curl hair nothing 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.679
 that in the end I'm going to use this because 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.679
 probably accelerate a little bit the 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.810
 the result will speed up the process a bit 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.670
 of the process with heat even though not 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.250
 I did with heat probably 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.069
 I would also throw this because as I say 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.049
 it smells fantastic then good as what 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.790
 I will probably accelerate so that what 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.189
 You see, I'm going to put on the east heat 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.069
 I had brushed my hair to make 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:38.739
 this a little bit like it smells is that it smells 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.769
 deadly good the question is to moisten a 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.359
 little hair so that it takes a little more 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:48.130
 although I did it many times with 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:50.350
 the hair already dry and it has been the same 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.280
 and good is to moisten more than anything 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.280
 ends to ends 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.820
 and now we brush it so that it 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.770
 distribute well and do not get entangled 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.070
 because if not at the time of doing then the 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.750
 bow, they may remain when the 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.230
 let's go, curls may be a little 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.230
 strangers 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.850
 well now you are seeing the wash that 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.740
 intrigues you many wash but good 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.680
 I have a wash in the room and 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.630
 Nothing for you to see better me what 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.970
 I do is throw all my hair back 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:26.500
 sometimes I even shake my head so that 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.800
 I got all my hair right 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.800
 behind 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.770
 olic and mona and nothing is to make a bun 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.870
 very high I make it very high so that 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.690
 also take a little bit of volume that does not 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.400
 stay then the hair very sucked well 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.489
 it's like we can make a ponytail 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.819
 and it's just that he really does not have 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:58.330
 mystery are you going to tell me what is this 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:01.270
 it's just going to roll up your hair 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.970
 so it has no mystery of truth and 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.100
 rolling up the hair and at the same time as 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:10.390
 go rolling it on itself to 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:15.160
 make a bow go of tola like vale I 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:18.640
 I do so I try to keep a that 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:22.040
 is going more or less uniform and 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:24.500
 then at the point I do not follow 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.440
 I do not keep rolling it up 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.840
 hair on the bun but do not roll it 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.820
 about yourself and now what you can 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.350
 do I do sometimes I roll up so much 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.720
 the hair that I do not need 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.790
 hairpin ni ni ni nada nada 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.680
 good you can put a fork that is 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:43.130
 what I usually do 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.620
 taking the last strand and nothing 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:49.190
 fork point something besides also the 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:52.039
 so high so that you work so that 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.550
 not when sleeping, as I often do 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:57.800
 I do at night so it does not bother 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.960
 well if you are going to put a rubber I advise 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.910
 make it one of those super chubby gums 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.560
 so it does not leave a mark and sometimes it's done 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.449
 with some small and especially the 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.430
 tips have been a bit ugly if 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:10.310
 then I had to wet them again and 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.259
 Well, nothing we hope, I tell you 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.259
 good eggs nothing happens to us 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:17.509
 she from the street and we like her and is 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:19.580
 wait all night or apply a 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:21.289
 little bit of heat and I teach you the 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.000
 result and back as you see I have 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:25.520
 another makeup that I'm going to leave the 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.050
 link here if it is already uploaded and is that 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.580
 been taking advantage while this is 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.430
 dried a little bit gives a little bit with 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.100
 dryer not much so we're going to 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:37.600
 see the result I hope that 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.600
 enough 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:43.680
 and that is finished cooling and good nothing 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:46.339
 it has no more mystery than unwinding 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:50.370
 You see that there is a bit of shape left 

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:56.060
 You can stay lovely if you want 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:56.060
 and nothing this is about ruffling now 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:06.360
 so a little with love 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.610
 some day I have stayed around here 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.410
 precious little curls and I tell you goes with the 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.099
 we will see it in the videos 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:15.780
 because it's what I'm doing the most 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:18.060
 because between that I want to have it collected 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.729
 while I do things because it scorched me 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.319
 and everything and well nothing is not 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:24.210
 sufficiently done in other occasions 

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:25.710
 it stays more but good is so that 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.139
 you see a little the technique and I say them 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:30.870
 if you are videos back the riquillos that 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:34.710
 Mine are wearing are not worth chignon and 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.759
 nothing else I hope you liked it 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.259
 as here the wicks are 

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:39.180
 Californian that has become clearer 

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:41.009
 Well I hope you liked it 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.080
 have entertained you already know if you have 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:45.090
 some doubt that does not have this mystery 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.400
 which is a bun, then you can leave me 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:48.690
 down as you already have many times 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.820
 you put on twitter what are you going to do 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:52.470
 something that you have seen in a video I os 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:56.340
 I would really appreciate it if you jce a 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:58.620
 fotito and thus we see ourselves and nothing that we 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.539
 see you soon in another video that I'm going to 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.909
 leave the links of interest below as 

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:05.190
 always if there were photos will be 

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:08.280
 down also though good I think that 

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.689
 not that this is good enough 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:13.049
 is what is it that wins 

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:14.669
 the volume of the hair is that I get bored 

00:07:13.049 --> 00:07:18.120
 right away from my hair because it is very straight 

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:21.960
 and so at least it has a little more 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:24.210
 of the movement game of some of that and 

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:27.590
 the sayings and more thanks for watching - more 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.590
 in the next video chao
