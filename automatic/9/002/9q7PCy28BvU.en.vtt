why<00:00:17.130> wearable<00:00:17.820> computers<00:00:18.210> now<00:00:18.450> what<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.230> it

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
why wearable computers now what is it

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.780 
why wearable computers now what is it
that<00:00:19.530> allows<00:00:19.680> us<00:00:19.860> to<00:00:20.190> actually<00:00:20.310> make<00:00:20.520> this

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:20.790 
that allows us to actually make this

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.210 
that allows us to actually make this
technology<00:00:21.180> now<00:00:21.990> supposed<00:00:22.440> to<00:00:22.560> five<00:00:22.770> ten<00:00:23.190> or

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
technology now supposed to five ten or

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.220 
technology now supposed to five ten or
fifteen<00:00:23.640> years<00:00:23.670> ago<00:00:23.940> and<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:24.810> we're<00:00:24.990> showing

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
fifteen years ago and so we're showing

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.770 
fifteen years ago and so we're showing
here<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.070> basic<00:00:26.550> constraints<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.480> been

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:27.780 
here is the basic constraints that been

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.900 
here is the basic constraints that been
part<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.890> what<00:00:29.100> we've<00:00:29.190> been<00:00:29.310> designing<00:00:29.790> for

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
part of what we've been designing for

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:37.689 
part of what we've been designing for
the<00:00:30.060> past<00:00:30.300> twenty<00:00:30.630> years

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:40.119 

today<00:00:38.329> you<00:00:38.719> have<00:00:38.839> to<00:00:38.929> do<00:00:38.989> more<00:00:39.230> gross<00:00:39.559> gestures

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
today you have to do more gross gestures

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:42.490 
today you have to do more gross gestures
things<00:00:40.640> like<00:00:40.850> moving<00:00:41.359> your<00:00:41.480> finger<00:00:42.230> cross<00:00:42.469> a

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
things like moving your finger cross a

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.889 
things like moving your finger cross a
touchscreen<00:00:43.070> or<00:00:43.489> using<00:00:43.909> speech<00:00:44.300> for<00:00:44.600> input

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
touchscreen or using speech for input

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:46.420 
touchscreen or using speech for input
when<00:00:45.199> your<00:00:45.320> mobile<00:00:45.680> as<00:00:45.769> opposed<00:00:46.100> to<00:00:46.219> something

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
when your mobile as opposed to something

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.009 
when your mobile as opposed to something
that<00:00:46.550> takes<00:00:46.789> too<00:00:46.940> much<00:00:47.089> visual<00:00:47.719> manual

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
that takes too much visual manual

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:50.889 
that takes too much visual manual
attention<00:00:48.620> so<00:00:49.519> we<00:00:49.640> show<00:00:49.820> courting<00:00:50.359> keyboards

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
attention so we show courting keyboards

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.770 
attention so we show courting keyboards
so<00:00:51.409> we<00:00:51.469> show<00:00:51.710> embroidery<00:00:52.519> we<00:00:52.879> show<00:00:53.059> textiles

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
so we show embroidery we show textiles

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.170 
so we show embroidery we show textiles
we<00:00:54.469> show<00:00:54.649> ring<00:00:54.979> scanners<00:00:55.430> all<00:00:55.610> different<00:00:55.969> ways

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
we show ring scanners all different ways

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.180 
we show ring scanners all different ways
of<00:00:56.420> doing<00:00:56.510> input<00:00:57.019> on<00:00:57.199> mobile<00:00:57.469> device<00:00:57.739> doesn't

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
of doing input on mobile device doesn't

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.009 
of doing input on mobile device doesn't
take<00:00:58.549> so<00:00:58.760> much<00:00:58.909> visual<00:00:59.149> manual<00:00:59.449> attention

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
take so much visual manual attention

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:01.929 
take so much visual manual attention
from<00:01:00.769> there<00:01:00.979> we<00:01:01.070> go<00:01:01.189> to<00:01:01.250> different<00:01:01.489> types<00:01:01.820> of

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:01.939 
from there we go to different types of

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:03.789 
from there we go to different types of
displays<00:01:02.359> different<00:01:02.930> types<00:01:03.109> of<00:01:03.199> applications

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
displays different types of applications

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.370 
displays different types of applications
we<00:01:04.309> go<00:01:04.460> from<00:01:04.640> VR<00:01:04.970> helmets<00:01:05.420> in<00:01:05.600> the<00:01:05.720> 80s<00:01:06.110> and<00:01:06.229> 90s

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
we go from VR helmets in the 80s and 90s

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.679 
we go from VR helmets in the 80s and 90s
and<00:01:06.770> show<00:01:07.340> how<00:01:07.549> they're<00:01:07.759> trying<00:01:08.060> to<00:01:08.210> immerse

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
and show how they're trying to immerse

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.410 
and show how they're trying to immerse
you<00:01:08.899> in<00:01:09.380> a<00:01:09.560> synthetic<00:01:10.039> reality<00:01:10.789> they<00:01:10.970> take<00:01:11.179> all

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
you in a synthetic reality they take all

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.880 
you in a synthetic reality they take all
your<00:01:11.750> attention<00:01:12.080> away<00:01:12.170> from<00:01:12.289> the<00:01:12.500> real<00:01:12.710> world

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
your attention away from the real world

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.770 
your attention away from the real world
and<00:01:13.130> put<00:01:13.220> in<00:01:13.310> the<00:01:13.369> virtual<00:01:13.729> to<00:01:14.420> wearable

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
and put in the virtual to wearable

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.289 
and put in the virtual to wearable
computers<00:01:15.080> today<00:01:15.229> which<00:01:15.770> try<00:01:15.979> to<00:01:16.009> actually

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
computers today which try to actually

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:19.029 
computers today which try to actually
augment<00:01:17.299> your<00:01:17.750> world<00:01:18.020> use<00:01:18.679> the<00:01:18.830> minimum

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039 
augment your world use the minimum

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:20.620 
augment your world use the minimum
amount<00:01:19.280> of<00:01:19.429> attention<00:01:19.880> for<00:01:20.000> the<00:01:20.119> maximum

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
amount of attention for the maximum

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.630 
amount of attention for the maximum
interface

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.070 

so<00:01:26.640> what<00:01:26.910> this<00:01:27.090> exhibit<00:01:27.570> does<00:01:27.660> a<00:01:27.720> really<00:01:27.900> nice

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
so what this exhibit does a really nice

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.610 
so what this exhibit does a really nice
job<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.560> showing<00:01:28.800> is<00:01:29.160> how<00:01:29.640> power<00:01:30.620> production

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
job of showing is how power production

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.860 
job of showing is how power production
and<00:01:31.950> how<00:01:32.040> power<00:01:32.280> use<00:01:32.610> has<00:01:32.940> changed<00:01:33.480> what's

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
and how power use has changed what's

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.510 
and how power use has changed what's
happened<00:01:34.320> with<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.590> head-mounted<00:01:34.920> displays

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
happened with a head-mounted displays

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.030 
happened with a head-mounted displays
with<00:01:36.030> input<00:01:36.360> devices<00:01:36.660> that<00:01:37.560> have<00:01:37.710> allowed<00:01:37.980> us

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
with input devices that have allowed us

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.030 
with input devices that have allowed us
the<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.360> know<00:01:39.480> the<00:01:39.720> tools<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.230> draw<00:01:40.440> from<00:01:40.740> to

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
the you know the tools to draw from to

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.130 
the you know the tools to draw from to
really<00:01:41.730> build<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.120> device<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.990> could

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
really build a device that you could

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.070 
really build a device that you could
comfortably<00:01:43.440> wear<00:01:43.710> all<00:01:43.830> that<00:01:47.720> it's<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.780> really
