00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.899
 and I want you to enjoy the video as well 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.899
 I'm going to enjoy salvia 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.029
 ah 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.590
 this time I will do my washing routine 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.960
 using the coconut course products 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.970
 of the organics brand which 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.310
 get in fec stores if they want 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.290
 know more about the products in the 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.599
 description of the video I will leave you the 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.610
 link from one of my previous videos 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.770
 where he talked about this line for 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.410
 start applying the shampoo I like 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.450
 do it only at the root in this way 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.700
 I remove the excess fat from the leather 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.010
 scalp and the fat left by the 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.590
 combing cream did not apply as much in the 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.260
 tips since these are almost always 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.449
 recipes 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.550
 The next step is to divide the hair 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.159
 to facilitate the application of 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.829
 conditioner this unlike the 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:00.469
 shampoo I apply it approximately 10 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.580
 centimeters below the root until 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.010
 get to the tips 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.320
 [Music] 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.480
 presence of a little with the fingers 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.650
 taking advantage of the softness that comes from 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.389
 conditioner 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.389
 [Music] 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.310
 to 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.030
 with a large tooth-wide comb and 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:27.670
 just underwater from entanglement starting 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.770
 by the tips until you reach the root of 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.140
 this way it prevented the hair from 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.840
 tangle more and burst 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.010
 ah 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.440
 [Music] 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:45.110
 finally rinse 70% of the 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.700
 conditioner and dry the hair with a 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:02:07.730
 towel 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:02:07.730
 [Music] 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:14.240
 good I took the opportunity to put on makeup 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:19.360
 while the towel absorbed moisture 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.360
 of my hair so I'm going to finish 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:28.519
 applying me cream for him 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.930
 the comb cream I'm going to use the 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:36.590
 today is going to be this truth because 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:40.250
 I love how it defines the curls and 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:43.450
 love the smell that leaves in the hair 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.450
 so 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.859
 quito 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:56.319
 and always try to apply me very well in 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:59.890
 the tips because the tips tend 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.990
 as to be very dry then I do not 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.819
 like how the evidence looks 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.480
 hydrate them well so they fit 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.480
 pretty 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:21.520
 [Music] 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:29.120

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.760
