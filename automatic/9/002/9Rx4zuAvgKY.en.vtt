00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
which I've recorded in the game of

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.090 
which I've recorded in the game of
Bolivian<00:00:45.300> I've<00:00:45.480> had<00:00:46.110> someone<00:00:46.770> walking

Bolivian I've had someone walking
towards<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.940> camera<00:00:48.239> so<00:00:48.600> it'll<00:00:49.079> actually

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
towards the camera so it'll actually

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.080 
towards the camera so it'll actually
look<00:00:49.680> like<00:00:49.710> at<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.399> final<00:00:50.700> product<00:00:51.030> looks

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
look like at the final product looks

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.459 
look like at the final product looks
like<00:00:51.329> someone's<00:00:51.690> walking<00:00:51.870> towards<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
like someone's walking towards the

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.610 
like someone's walking towards the
window<00:00:53.270> and<00:00:54.270> you're<00:00:54.780> staring<00:00:55.230> at<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.469> window

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
window and you're staring at the window

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.560 
window and you're staring at the window
looking<00:00:55.829> at<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.460> bloke<00:00:56.699> coming<00:00:57.059> towards<00:00:57.420> you

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
looking at the bloke coming towards you

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.860 
looking at the bloke coming towards you
so<00:00:58.260> what<00:00:58.949> we<00:00:59.070> do<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.250> I've<00:00:59.520> created<00:00:59.550> a<00:01:00.059> basic

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
so what we do is I've created a basic

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.020 
so what we do is I've created a basic
window<00:01:01.230> I've<00:01:01.469> then<00:01:01.739> gone<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.340> I've<00:01:02.520> added<00:01:02.730> a

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
window I've then gone and I've added a

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.660 
window I've then gone and I've added a
target<00:01:03.570> camera<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.290> scene<00:01:04.530> now<00:01:05.460> what<00:01:05.640> a

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
target camera to the scene now what a

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.380 
target camera to the scene now what a
target<00:01:06.090> camera<00:01:06.420> does<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:07.020> um<00:01:07.680> like<00:01:08.390> positions

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
target camera does is um like positions

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.609 
target camera does is um like positions
where<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.750> camera<00:01:10.080> we're<00:01:10.290> going<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.439> actually

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
where the camera we're going to actually

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.490 
where the camera we're going to actually
make<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.369> move<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.270> was<00:01:12.720> just<00:01:13.080> staring<00:01:13.320> at

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
make it move so it's was just staring at

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.469 
make it move so it's was just staring at
the<00:01:13.650> window<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.280> there's<00:01:14.490> all<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.119> corners

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
the window so there's all the corners

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.359 
the window so there's all the corners
are<00:01:15.600> cut<00:01:15.750> off<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.560> we're<00:01:16.770> just<00:01:16.799> looking<00:01:17.220> at<00:01:17.340> one

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
are cut off so we're just looking at one

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.280 
are cut off so we're just looking at one
thing<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.240> through<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.960> window

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
thing and that is through the window

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.920 
thing and that is through the window
itself<00:01:19.890> now<00:01:20.520> we<00:01:20.580> do<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:21.000> just<00:01:21.210> by<00:01:21.299> moving<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
itself now we do that just by moving the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.320 
itself now we do that just by moving the
camera<00:01:22.200> around<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.030> position<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.119> where<00:01:24.299> we

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
camera around and position it where we

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.140 
camera around and position it where we
want<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:25.439> what<00:01:25.590> actually<00:01:25.950> we're<00:01:26.580> looking<00:01:26.970> at

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
want so what actually we're looking at

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.300 
want so what actually we're looking at
that<00:01:27.360> window<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.960> just<00:01:28.229> staring<00:01:28.590> at<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.799> one

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
that window that just staring at it one

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.179 
that window that just staring at it one
time<00:01:29.610> like<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:31.140> we<00:01:31.259> move<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.590> around<00:01:31.710> and

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
time like that so we move it around and

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.789 
time like that so we move it around and
position<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.119> hundred<00:01:33.689> percent<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.380> when

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
position it a hundred percent and when

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.819 
position it a hundred percent and when
you're<00:01:34.920> happy<00:01:35.070> with<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.869> you<00:01:36.869> just<00:01:37.049> use<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.500> ER

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
you're happy with it you just use the ER

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.760 
you're happy with it you just use the ER
x<00:01:38.100> y&amp;z<00:01:38.700> vertices<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.540> red<00:01:40.170> yellow<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.590> blue

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.460 
x y&amp;z vertices the red yellow and blue
arrows<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:42.240> move<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.540> around<00:01:42.689> until

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.370 
arrows and you move that around until
you<00:01:43.590> find<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:44.250> best<00:01:44.280> spot<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.880> want<00:01:45.229> and<00:01:46.229> when

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
here is just saying to an adder and we

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.570 
here is just saying to an adder and we
go<00:02:52.030> yes<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:52.720> there<00:02:53.290> we<00:02:53.410> go<00:02:53.530> our<00:02:53.800> texture<00:02:54.400> is

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
go yes and there we go our texture is

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.000 
go yes and there we go our texture is
now<00:02:54.850> listed<00:02:55.180> our<00:02:55.750> movie<00:02:56.200> clip<00:02:56.440> has<00:02:56.590> actually

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
now listed our movie clip has actually

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.680 
now listed our movie clip has actually
become<00:02:57.160> a<00:02:57.490> texture<00:02:58.060> itself<00:02:58.380> we<00:02:59.380> then<00:03:00.480> drag<00:03:01.480> the

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
become a texture itself we then drag the

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.470 
become a texture itself we then drag the
mid<00:03:01.870> texture<00:03:02.380> onto<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:03.280> background<00:03:03.850> object

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
mid texture onto the background object

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.650 
mid texture onto the background object
like<00:03:05.350> that<00:03:05.590> ah<00:03:06.930> damn<00:03:07.930> we<00:03:08.710> double<00:03:09.190> click<00:03:09.220> on<00:03:09.400> it

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
like that ah damn we double click on it

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.050 
like that ah damn we double click on it
so<00:03:10.660> we've<00:03:10.870> got<00:03:11.080> all<00:03:11.170> our<00:03:11.320> arm<00:03:12.010> options<00:03:12.880> for

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
so we've got all our arm options for

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.630 
so we've got all our arm options for
that<00:03:13.180> particular<00:03:13.650> material<00:03:14.650> we<00:03:15.160> then<00:03:15.340> click

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
that particular material we then click

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.220 
that particular material we then click
on<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:15.910> actual<00:03:16.270> name<00:03:16.510> itself<00:03:16.960> which<00:03:17.200> is

the maximum number of frame rates we
close<00:03:48.520> it<00:03:48.730> off<00:03:48.910> and<00:03:49.180> then<00:03:49.600> once<00:03:49.810> we<00:03:49.989> render

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
close it off and then once we render

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.140 
close it off and then once we render
that<00:03:50.530> if<00:03:50.739> we<00:03:50.890> render<00:03:51.220> that<00:03:51.370> right<00:03:51.610> now<00:03:51.850> it

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
that if we render that right now it

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.810 
that if we render that right now it
would<00:03:52.360> actually<00:03:52.510> render<00:03:53.050> the<00:03:53.170> movie<00:03:53.500> clip<00:03:53.820> so

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
would actually render the movie clip so

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.430 
would actually render the movie clip so
that's<00:03:55.000> pretty<00:03:55.209> much<00:03:55.360> how<00:03:55.570> easy<00:03:55.870> it<00:03:56.110> is<00:03:56.170> that's

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
that's pretty much how easy it is that's

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.949 
that's pretty much how easy it is that's
how<00:03:56.680> basic<00:03:57.190> it<00:03:57.370> is<00:03:57.520> to<00:03:57.910> add<00:03:58.060> a<00:03:58.090> movie<00:03:58.540> clip<00:03:58.780> to<00:03:58.810> a

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
how basic it is to add a movie clip to a

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.500 
how basic it is to add a movie clip to a
three-dimensional<00:03:59.650> object<00:04:00.070> so<00:04:00.940> here's<00:04:01.300> the

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
three-dimensional object so here's the

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.590 
three-dimensional object so here's the
final<00:04:01.930> example<00:04:02.440> of<00:04:02.800> how<00:04:03.370> it<00:04:03.489> turned<00:04:03.670> out<00:04:03.880> so<00:04:04.570> I

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
final example of how it turned out so I

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.910 
final example of how it turned out so I
hope<00:04:04.690> you<00:04:04.840> got<00:04:04.930> a<00:04:04.989> lot<00:04:05.050> of<00:04:05.170> information<00:04:05.770> out<00:04:05.860> of
