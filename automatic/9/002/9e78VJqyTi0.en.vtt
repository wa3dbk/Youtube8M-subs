other tracks in the back of dead so the
first<00:00:17.910> track<00:00:18.180> here<00:00:18.449> is<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.630> programming<00:00:19.230> track

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
first track here is a programming track

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.570 
first track here is a programming track
okay<00:00:20.160> we<00:00:20.490> have<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.760> put<00:00:20.939> power<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.449> this<00:00:21.570> track

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
okay we have to put power to this track

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.880 
okay we have to put power to this track
through<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:24.180> transformer<00:00:24.930> hey<00:00:25.470> this<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.800> e

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
through this transformer hey this is e

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.880 
through this transformer hey this is e
4,000<00:00:26.580> should<00:00:27.090> be<00:00:27.240> hooked<00:00:27.480> up<00:00:27.800> there's<00:00:28.800> a

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
4,000 should be hooked up there's a

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.620 
4,000 should be hooked up there's a
quick<00:00:29.099> check<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.460> make<00:00:29.789> sure<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:30.240> everything

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
quick check to make sure that everything

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.479 
quick check to make sure that everything
is<00:00:30.720> connected<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.199> right<00:00:31.349> way<00:00:31.590> there's<00:00:32.189> two

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
is connected the right way there's two

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.970 
is connected the right way there's two
banana<00:00:32.880> plugs<00:00:33.210> here<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.840> come<00:00:34.050> from<00:00:34.350> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
banana plugs here that come from the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.970 
banana plugs here that come from the
fixed<00:00:35.399> one<00:00:35.700> output<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.420> this<00:00:36.540> tianyou<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.829> the

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
fixed one output of this tianyou so the

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.950 
fixed one output of this tianyou so the
fixed<00:00:38.280> one<00:00:38.430> output<00:00:38.640> should<00:00:39.210> go<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.660> track

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
fixed one output should go to the track

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.889 
fixed one output should go to the track
and<00:00:40.250> the<00:00:41.250> right<00:00:41.550> handle<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.149> Transformers

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
and the right handle of the Transformers

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.500 
and the right handle of the Transformers
outputs<00:00:43.350> should<00:00:43.620> go<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.430> fixed<00:00:44.730> one<00:00:44.940> input

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
outputs should go to the fixed one input

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.720 
outputs should go to the fixed one input
okay<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.350> we<00:00:46.739> have<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.980> make<00:00:47.129> sure<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.460> those

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
okay so we have to make sure that those

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.340 
okay so we have to make sure that those
are<00:00:47.789> connected<00:00:48.180> sometimes<00:00:48.780> some<00:00:48.989> you'll<00:00:49.170> come

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
are connected sometimes some you'll come

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.080 
are connected sometimes some you'll come
in<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.620> disconnect<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.129> wire<00:00:50.340> here<00:00:50.730> or<00:00:50.879> there

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
in and disconnect the wire here or there

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.670 
in and disconnect the wire here or there
so<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.600> just<00:00:51.809> make<00:00:51.989> sure<00:00:52.020> those<00:00:52.320> are<00:00:52.379> connected

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
so I just make sure those are connected

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.910 
so I just make sure those are connected
first<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.850> put<00:00:54.030> power<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.629> tiu<00:00:54.989> there's<00:00:55.829> a

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
first to put power to the tiu there's a

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.849 
first to put power to the tiu there's a
little<00:00:56.309> power<00:00:56.489> plug<00:00:56.879> here<00:00:57.530> first<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.680> power

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
little power plug here first a power

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.970 
little power plug here first a power
plug<00:00:59.190> in<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.699> they<00:00:59.820> tell<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.379> will<00:01:01.379> power<00:01:01.590> up

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
plug in and they tell you will power up

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.640 
plug in and they tell you will power up
thank<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:03.000> know<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.570> tiu<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.260> powered

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
thank you know that the tiu is powered

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.730 
thank you know that the tiu is powered
up<00:01:05.150> by<00:01:06.150> looking<00:01:06.390> inside<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:09.350> under<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.439> cover

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
up by looking inside it under the cover

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.429 
up by looking inside it under the cover
that<00:01:11.430> little<00:01:11.729> red<00:01:11.939> light<00:01:12.180> comes<00:01:13.170> on<00:01:13.380> when

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
that little red light comes on when

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.890 
that little red light comes on when
powers<00:01:13.979> applied<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.580> tiu<00:01:14.909> one<00:01:15.750> thing

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
powers applied to the tiu one thing

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.390 
powers applied to the tiu one thing
you'll<00:01:16.020> notice<00:01:16.200> when<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.500> power<00:01:16.770> up<00:01:16.890> at<00:01:17.130> EIU

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
you'll notice when you power up at EIU

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.240 
you'll notice when you power up at EIU
that<00:01:18.180> red<00:01:18.390> light<00:01:18.600> will<00:01:18.750> blink<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.380> number<00:01:20.130> of

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
that red light will blink a number of

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.179 
that red light will blink a number of
times<00:01:20.490> or<00:01:20.759> one<00:01:20.939> time<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.960> amount<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.560> blinks

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
times or one time the amount of blinks

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.090 
times or one time the amount of blinks
is<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.939> address<00:01:24.360> at<00:01:24.509> at<00:01:24.600> EIU<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.650> if<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.860> place

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
is the address at at EIU so if a place

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.990 
is the address at at EIU so if a place
once<00:01:26.460> st<00:01:27.270> iu1<00:01:27.780> winks<00:01:28.500> twice<00:01:28.829> its<00:01:29.250> TI<00:01:29.490> youtube

once st iu1 winks twice its TI youtube

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.539 
once st iu1 winks twice its TI youtube
links<00:01:30.450> three<00:01:30.630> times<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.110> forth<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.280> tells

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
links three times so forth so that tells

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.670 
links three times so forth so that tells
you<00:01:32.729> what<00:01:32.970> address<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.720> associated<00:01:34.470> with<00:01:34.590> the

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
you what address is associated with the

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.340 
you what address is associated with the
TI<00:01:34.860> u<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.150> addresses<00:01:36.570> should<00:01:36.900> never<00:01:37.170> be

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
TI u that the addresses should never be

TI u that the addresses should never be
changed<00:01:37.590> here<00:01:38.070> unless<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.150> do<00:01:39.210> okay<00:01:40.079> so

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
changed here unless I do okay so

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.310 
changed here unless I do okay so
anything<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.159> any<00:01:41.729> changes<00:01:42.270> on<00:01:42.420> addressing

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
anything that any changes on addressing

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.899 
anything that any changes on addressing
goes<00:01:44.220> through<00:01:44.399> me

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
goes through me

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.690 
goes through me
okay<00:01:45.420> once<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.810> TI<00:01:45.990> u<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.320> powered<00:01:46.649> off<00:01:46.740> we

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
okay once the TI u is powered off we

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.130 
okay once the TI u is powered off we
have<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.880> power<00:01:48.090> up<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.329> transformer<00:01:48.780> there's

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
have to power up the transformer there's

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.149 
have to power up the transformer there's
a<00:01:49.170> little<00:01:49.350> switch<00:01:49.560> on<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.799> side<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.040> the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
a little switch on the side of the

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.760 
a little switch on the side of the
transformer<00:01:50.520> let's<00:01:51.329> place<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.600> on<00:01:51.869> one<00:01:52.140> thing

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
transformer let's place it on one thing

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.080 
transformer let's place it on one thing
with<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.070> Z<00:01:53.220> 4000<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.570> won't<00:01:54.899> power<00:01:55.229> up<00:01:55.850> if<00:01:56.850> the

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
notice the red light go off and it'll

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:14.120 
notice the red light go off and it'll
reset<00:02:13.890> too

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
reset too

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.800

where<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.370> should<00:02:14.430> be<00:02:14.760> sometimes<00:02:15.570> you<00:02:15.690> might

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
where it should be sometimes you might

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.540 
where it should be sometimes you might
see<00:02:16.020> a<00:02:16.050> little<00:02:16.230> phantom<00:02:16.770> voltage<00:02:17.130> here<00:02:17.340> that

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
see a little phantom voltage here that

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.500 
see a little phantom voltage here that
that's<00:02:17.730> no<00:02:17.940> big<00:02:18.180> deal<00:02:18.390> but<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:19.740> to<00:02:20.010> end<00:02:20.220> any

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
that's no big deal but to it to end any

command<00:02:21.510> control<00:02:21.840> engine<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:23.370> voltage

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
command control engine the the voltage

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.140 
command control engine the the voltage
to<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.000> track<00:02:24.270> should<00:02:24.480> be<00:02:24.600> around<00:02:25.760> 1920<00:02:26.760> volts

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
to the track should be around 1920 volts

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.750 
to the track should be around 1920 volts
so<00:02:27.540> we're<00:02:28.140> gonna<00:02:28.230> bring<00:02:28.470> it<00:02:28.590> up<00:02:28.680> this<00:02:29.460> little

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
so we're gonna bring it up this little

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.880 
so we're gonna bring it up this little
dial<00:02:30.270> I<00:02:30.540> mean<00:02:30.750> this<00:02:30.840> little<00:02:31.080> output<00:02:31.710> here

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
dial I mean this little output here

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.380 
dial I mean this little output here
tells<00:02:32.220> you<00:02:32.310> how<00:02:32.460> many<00:02:32.520> volts<00:02:32.850> is<00:02:33.030> going<00:02:33.300> to

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
tells you how many volts is going to

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.560 
tells you how many volts is going to
this<00:02:33.510> track<00:02:33.780> so<00:02:34.470> right<00:02:34.710> now<00:02:34.890> 19<00:02:35.610> volts<00:02:35.850> should

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
this track so right now 19 volts should

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.230 
this track so right now 19 volts should
be<00:02:36.690> on<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.440> programming<00:02:37.830> track<00:02:38.220> so<00:02:38.910> once<00:02:39.120> the

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
be on the programming track so once the

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.200 
be on the programming track so once the
programming<00:02:39.630> track<00:02:39.960> is<00:02:40.140> powered<00:02:40.560> on<00:02:41.210> the

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
what they call super capacitors in them

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.260 
what they call super capacitors in them
and<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:53.010> won't<00:02:53.160> be<00:02:53.280> able<00:02:53.460> to<00:02:53.550> power<00:02:53.910> this
