00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
pumping system right there are used to

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:59.859 
pumping system right there are used to
do<00:00:58.339> is<00:00:58.459> barrel<00:00:58.879> a<00:00:58.909> little<00:00:58.940> bit<00:00:59.239> saggy<00:00:59.539> but

00:00:59.859 --> 00:00:59.869 
do is barrel a little bit saggy but

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:14.710 
do is barrel a little bit saggy but
we'll<00:00:59.989> fix<00:01:00.170> that

that<00:01:27.950> garage<00:01:28.190> door<00:01:28.250> is<00:01:28.760> probably<00:01:29.270> how<00:01:29.900> far

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
that garage door is probably how far

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.260 
that garage door is probably how far
away<00:01:30.200> do<00:01:30.830> you<00:01:30.860> think<00:01:31.100> that<00:01:31.250> garage<00:01:31.460> door<00:01:31.790> is

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270

about<00:01:35.270> 45<00:01:35.900> feet<00:01:36.200> and<00:01:36.470> that's<00:01:36.920> like<00:01:37.070> about

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
about 45 feet and that's like about

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:38.920 
about 45 feet and that's like about
straight<00:01:37.760> line<00:01:37.970> distance<00:01:38.180> this<00:01:38.600> thing<00:01:38.780> could

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
straight line distance this thing could

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.450 
straight line distance this thing could
probably<00:01:39.110> almost<00:01:39.380> get<00:01:39.650> 200<00:01:40.070> feet<00:01:40.250> if<00:01:40.370> you

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
probably almost get 200 feet if you

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.900 
probably almost get 200 feet if you
angled<00:01:40.820> it<00:01:44.260> crappy<00:01:45.260> this<00:01:46.160> is<00:01:46.250> an<00:01:46.400> airplane

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
angled it crappy this is an airplane
