 hello i am you the christian again 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.010
 from very fotos.de today with a 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.809
 short video in between and am 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.830
 I came across the website I 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.130
 think pretty cool 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.020
 and that's about pixel people.com 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.910
 the address you will find in course 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.550
 the video description and that is one 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.260
 you can find website with the pictures 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.000
 with certain lenses and cameras 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.810
 so yes, for example 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.170
 can you go and you camera 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.030
 choose and say show me some pictures 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.290
 to those at a certain iso performance 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.879
 were made then the 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.640
 possibility to say easy or to 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.559
 See if I like the picture or 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.430
 yes like the picture quality just at this 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:48.739
 iso performance is level and the whole is 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.030
 really simple and we made 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.220
 Here is also very pretty 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.449
 simply built that means you have 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.400
 Here are some rubrics here 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.440
 objective mirror reflex and would have now 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.180
 just on nikon and if here 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.540
 Just take the camera out if the me 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.940
 have the d7000 you can see the synonymous 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.500
 popularity and now we come here 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.590
 simply pictures displayed with this 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.600
 camera and you can do that 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.550
 whole then a little bit 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.300
 specify here above in this menu 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.430
 or 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.660
 this attitude here and there we go 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.880
 Just go and say we want 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.370
 an iso 6,400 10 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.200
 let us show the pictures or 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.420
 we get exactly the pictures here 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.220
 displayed and the pictures here 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.409
 you can see that coming here now 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.480
 directly from flickr so you can get here 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.370
 access the data from flickr resp 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.770
 on the meta-data the whole one 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.840
 a little filter through and provided here 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.790
 the possibility just you 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.140
 to show certain pictures i 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.290
 personally think that's a bit better 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.690
 as this theme for example make that 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:54.200
 yes the tests at a high level so 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.729
 really hereby laboratory conditions and yes 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.590
 because everything is nice well you can then 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.390
 of course cameras uniform 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.500
 compare but I still know 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.790
 not if you have the picture at the end 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.460
 I really like the ones here 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.110
 possibility to i see it directly and 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.060
 can then just think about it if I am 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.890
 me such a camera or this one 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.299
 camera next to want to grow and whether me 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.340
 maybe another like better 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:15.370
 here below left you can see others 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.500
 possibilities of the search and that further 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.209
 Visitors here you can now for 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.830
 Example also indicate that you have one 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:25.390
 I wanted to see certain objective 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.940
 take here the tamron 17 200 and that 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.220
 whole again on my nikon d7000 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.659
 closed times more pictures and show me 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.909
 say I really want to join 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:37.569
 a focal length of 200 millimeters that 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:40.329
 whole see only the pictures in open 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:43.420
 blind and the whole at the iso 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:44.230
 between 1606 1400 leave me the pictures 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.200
 Show 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.940
 there is no okay now if we can 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.049
 fan out a bit further here 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.239
 the focal length 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:55.420
 Unfortunately, that does not exist yet 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.879
 now, I seem to have quite a bit here 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.650
 dumb value selected look again 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.019
 okay here because they are the same 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.670
 it fits right here and that's how I feel 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.980
 now just show this picture 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.480
 leave and could now with others 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.040
 Pictures beside maybe compare 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.940
 been made with other objective 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.200
 and then just say okay that here 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.090
 objective seems to make good pictures 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.440
 I like the picture performance and 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.389
 and so on 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.599
 I still even go to the quasi 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:24.250
 cameras and if it is here or her 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:28.419
 Objectively, it does not matter 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.010
 works at a now 24 70 2.8 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:32.379
 from nikon you see there is not only 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.019
 example pictures but also 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.700
 ads here pixel pieper speaks her 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.639
 then you can sell something 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.739
 you can directly ebay auctions and 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:43.629
 let onlineshops show the same 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.120
 sell this lens now 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.889
 there is still a few specification here 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.049
 now none of the cameras behind yet 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:52.480
 rather, which registered and you can 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.250
 show you historical prices too 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.069
 so you can see her like that 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.190
 price fluctuations at the given month 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:02.079
 just had with the award more in the month 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.459
 from this objective was and could then 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.980
 maybe a bit guess 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.829
 What did someone buy for what 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.510
 amount or 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:11.680
 what can I still use today ? 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.109
 just pay the price 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.539
 So that was to pixel pieper I found one 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:20.320
 really great thing clearly you can do that too 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:21.729
 filter on flickr or 500 pixels 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.039
 but I think this is one 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.840
 Nice survey is fast 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:27.610
 simply not confusing 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.740
 or a lot of bells and whistles 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.840
 just what it takes to find that 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.370
 directly if you like the video 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.020
 and if you like the page 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.969
 a thumbs up above all things 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.919
 if you write the comments 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:41.500
 if you can use that at all 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:45.099
 you use something in advance if you are 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.569
 just want to buy you new objectively 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:48.879
 write it in the comments 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:51.490
 if you do not have the channel here yet 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:54.370

 I still two videos ion linked 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.080
 can also just have a look 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:06.159
 So that's a short video today 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.750
 short and sweet of me 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:10.180
 I thank you again for watching 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.080
