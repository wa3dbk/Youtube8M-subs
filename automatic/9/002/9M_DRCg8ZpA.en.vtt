the untether will be released before the
next<00:00:57.989> weekend<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.680> was<00:00:58.890> using<00:00:59.100> an<00:00:59.309> oh<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.730> was

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
next weekend I was using an oh I was

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.060 
next weekend I was using an oh I was
using<00:01:00.030> older<00:01:00.480> colonel<00:01:00.870> patches<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.800> caused

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
using older colonel patches that caused

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.399 
using older colonel patches that caused
lagging<00:01:02.609> on<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.879> jailbroken<00:01:03.210> device<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.930> will

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
lagging on the jailbroken device I will

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.990 
lagging on the jailbroken device I will
change<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.220> then<00:01:05.369> port<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.790> other

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
change that and then port it to other

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.730 
change that and then port it to other
devices<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.720> release<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.890> basically<00:01:08.659> this

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
devices and release so basically this

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.350 
devices and release so basically this
untethered<00:01:10.740> jailbreak<00:01:10.979> for<00:01:11.369> all<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.549> devices

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
untethered jailbreak for all I devices

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.289 
untethered jailbreak for all I devices
on<00:01:12.540> firmware<00:01:12.930> 4.3<00:01:13.830> will<00:01:14.460> most<00:01:14.790> likely<00:01:15.119> be

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
on firmware 4.3 will most likely be

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.010 
on firmware 4.3 will most likely be
released<00:01:15.600> before<00:01:16.409> next<00:01:17.009> weekend<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.600> can

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
released before next weekend so you can

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.960 
released before next weekend so you can
see<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.259> anytime<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:19.979> week<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.520> probably

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
see it anytime this week so probably

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.990 
see it anytime this week so probably
within<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.330> next<00:01:21.560> three<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.950> seven<00:01:23.400> days<00:01:23.430> I'm

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
within the next three to seven days I'm

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.390 
within the next three to seven days I'm
guessing<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:25.020> job<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.470> will<00:01:25.619> be<00:01:25.890> released<00:01:26.250> in

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
guessing this job it will be released in

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.230 
guessing this job it will be released in
ffort<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.180> everyone<00:01:27.810> out<00:01:27.840> there<00:01:28.110> on<00:01:28.320> 4.3<00:01:29.240> will

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
ffort and everyone out there on 4.3 will

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.450 
ffort and everyone out there on 4.3 will
be<00:01:30.450> able<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.869> jailbreak<00:01:31.560> their<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:31.920> device<00:01:34.460> okay

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
be able to jailbreak their I device okay

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
said he jailbroke it in such a short

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.729 
said he jailbroke it in such a short
time<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.640> also<00:02:40.630> without<00:02:41.049> even<00:02:41.319> having<00:02:41.470> the

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
time and also without even having the

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.400 
time and also without even having the
device<00:02:42.040> so<00:02:42.819> basically<00:02:43.239> what<00:02:43.660> i<00:02:43.690> went<00:02:44.019> over<00:02:44.319> in

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
device so basically what i went over in

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.979 
device so basically what i went over in
this<00:02:44.530> video<00:02:44.830> was<00:02:45.400> that<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.760> iOS<00:02:46.390> 4.3

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
this video was that the iOS 4.3

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.990 
this video was that the iOS 4.3
jailbreak<00:02:47.500> should<00:02:47.860> come<00:02:48.099> out<00:02:48.250> in<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:48.849> next

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
jailbreak should come out in the next

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.900 
jailbreak should come out in the next
three<00:02:49.299> to<00:02:49.390> seven<00:02:49.720> days<00:02:50.160> untethered<00:02:51.160> and<00:02:51.459> also

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
three to seven days untethered and also

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.229 
three to seven days untethered and also
the<00:02:52.000> ipad<00:02:52.420> 2<00:02:52.750> jailbreak<00:02:53.260> should<00:02:53.799> come<00:02:53.980> out

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
the ipad 2 jailbreak should come out

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.699 
the ipad 2 jailbreak should come out
probably<00:02:55.239> around<00:02:55.569> the<00:02:55.690> same<00:02:55.780> time<00:02:55.989> what<00:02:56.590> I'm

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
probably around the same time what I'm

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.100 
probably around the same time what I'm
guessing<00:02:56.950> is<00:02:57.310> that<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.299> iphone<00:02:58.660> dev<00:02:58.840> team

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
guessing is that the iphone dev team

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.890 
guessing is that the iphone dev team
will<00:02:59.349> release<00:02:59.590> the<00:03:00.010> latest<00:03:00.549> redsnow<00:03:00.910> and<00:03:01.269> that

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
will release the latest redsnow and that

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.490 
will release the latest redsnow and that
the<00:03:02.319> untethered<00:03:03.150> 4.3<00:03:04.150> jailbreak<00:03:04.599> will<00:03:05.049> be<00:03:05.200> in

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
the untethered 4.3 jailbreak will be in

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.300 
the untethered 4.3 jailbreak will be in
it<00:03:05.739> and<00:03:05.950> also<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.489> ipad<00:03:06.819> 2<00:03:07.000> jailbreak<00:03:07.390> so<00:03:08.310> like

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900
