00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
not use a lot of product so this will

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.960

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
has this have made a small difference

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.890 
has this have made a small difference
where<00:04:33.159> that<00:04:33.340> is<00:04:33.490> concerned<00:04:33.669> it<00:04:34.419> keeps<00:04:34.720> the
