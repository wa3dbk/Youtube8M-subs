00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.610
 correct that even if only to have 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.540
 privacy only closure is not the 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.670
 enough 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.439
 you have to put the curtain on 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.020

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.910
 house darling really where the 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.710

 really last today the balcony is like this 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.199
 the place where the family meets to 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.539
 watch a television then depending on 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.320

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.979
 with blackout the lining a solar screen or 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.590
 even a rolled blackout has several 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.390
 options so it's important that 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.820
 I would go to the customer's house 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.500
