00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.220 

bothering<00:00:56.290> us<00:00:56.410> so<00:00:56.769> but<00:00:57.519> we<00:00:57.610> are<00:00:57.760> obviously

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
bothering us so but we are obviously

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.400 
bothering us so but we are obviously
running<00:00:59.230> in<00:01:00.070> a<00:01:00.250> special<00:01:00.670> way<00:01:00.790> we<00:01:01.600> can't<00:01:02.140> shut

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
running in a special way we can't shut

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.400 
running in a special way we can't shut
it<00:01:02.470> off<00:01:02.739> right<00:01:03.100> now<00:01:03.340> what<00:01:03.879> we<00:01:04.030> can<00:01:04.239> but<00:01:04.629> every

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
it off right now what we can but every

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.620 
it off right now what we can but every
time<00:01:05.560> we<00:01:05.740> do<00:01:05.920> we<00:01:06.369> got<00:01:06.520> the<00:01:06.670> push<00:01:06.880> type<00:01:07.210> of<00:01:07.450> thing

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
time we do we got the push type of thing

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.160 
time we do we got the push type of thing
so<00:01:08.160> as<00:01:09.160> you<00:01:09.340> talk<00:01:09.550> the<00:01:09.790> last<00:01:09.970> episode<00:01:10.600> it's

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
so as you talk the last episode it's

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.770 
so as you talk the last episode it's
still<00:01:11.619> doing<00:01:12.100> that<00:01:12.250> so<00:01:12.700> we<00:01:13.420> think<00:01:13.600> we've

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
still doing that so we think we've

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.560 
still doing that so we think we've
narrowed<00:01:13.990> it<00:01:14.200> down<00:01:14.259> to<00:01:14.410> maybe<00:01:14.770> starter<00:01:15.570> for

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
narrowed it down to maybe starter for

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.529 
narrowed it down to maybe starter for
the<00:01:16.660> charger<00:01:17.050> itself<00:01:17.170> or<00:01:17.770> boat<00:01:18.009> but<00:01:18.759> this<00:01:19.360> is

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:19.539 
the charger itself or boat but this is

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:21.270 
the charger itself or boat but this is
what<00:01:19.690> we<00:01:19.810> got<00:01:19.990> right<00:01:20.020> now<00:01:20.320> and<00:01:20.619> obviously<00:01:20.710> idle

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
what we got right now and obviously idle

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.590 
what we got right now and obviously idle

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
air control valve or something in that

for<00:03:00.169> our<00:03:00.500> engine<00:03:01.099> it's<00:03:01.400> a<00:03:01.669> JD<00:03:02.000> Mt<00:03:02.599> 15<00:03:03.049> B<00:03:03.319> which

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
for our engine it's a JD Mt 15 B which

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.530 
for our engine it's a JD Mt 15 B which
they<00:03:04.280> made<00:03:04.549> worse<00:03:05.329> by<00:03:06.169> putting<00:03:06.560> a<00:03:06.859> D<00:03:07.340> 15<00:03:07.819> b2

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
they made worse by putting a D 15 b2

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.640 
they made worse by putting a D 15 b2
head<00:03:09.049> on<00:03:09.260> it<00:03:09.530> so<00:03:10.160> the<00:03:10.940> head<00:03:11.329> is<00:03:11.599> from<00:03:11.870> a<00:03:11.989> u.s.<00:03:12.319> DM

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
can see it's just a bunch of dirt that

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.369 
can see it's just a bunch of dirt that
we<00:03:46.140> run<00:03:46.379> off<00:03:46.620> into<00:03:47.159> starting<00:03:47.700> from

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379 
we run off into starting from

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:53.690 
we run off into starting from
start/finish<00:03:49.940> we<00:03:50.940> start<00:03:51.299> headed<00:03:51.810> down<00:03:52.700> into

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
start/finish we start headed down into

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.300 
start/finish we start headed down into
the<00:03:53.790> first<00:03:54.060> turn<00:03:54.420> which<00:03:55.260> you<00:03:55.650> can't<00:03:55.920> really

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
the first turn which you can't really

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.460 
the first turn which you can't really
see<00:03:56.489> it<00:03:56.760> from<00:03:56.790> here<00:03:57.269> but<00:03:57.480> that<00:03:57.810> first<00:03:58.109> turn

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
see it from here but that first turn

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.759 
see it from here but that first turn
actually<00:03:58.859> dips<00:03:59.760> and<00:04:00.150> as<00:04:00.989> you're<00:04:01.500> turning

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
actually dips and as you're turning

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.890 
actually dips and as you're turning
right<00:04:02.220> cutting<00:04:02.790> that<00:04:02.940> corner<00:04:03.000> there<00:04:03.659> it

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
right cutting that corner there it

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.740 
right cutting that corner there it
actually<00:04:04.109> starts<00:04:04.620> to<00:04:04.680> incline<00:04:05.489> again<00:04:06.120> going

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
actually starts to incline again going

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.229 
actually starts to incline again going
back<00:04:06.870> onto<00:04:07.409> that<00:04:07.620> straight<00:04:08.129> it's<00:04:08.940> a<00:04:09.000> little

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
back onto that straight it's a little

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.940 
back onto that straight it's a little
bit<00:04:09.329> difficult<00:04:09.480> so<00:04:09.900> we<00:04:09.959> come<00:04:10.140> on<00:04:10.319> along<00:04:10.739> to

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
bit difficult so we come on along to

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.520 
bit difficult so we come on along to
this<00:04:11.099> long<00:04:11.519> straight<00:04:12.000> here<00:04:12.390> and<00:04:12.599> come<00:04:13.260> up<00:04:13.379> to

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
this long straight here and come up to

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.189 
this long straight here and come up to
turn<00:04:13.769> two<00:04:14.129> which<00:04:14.970> is<00:04:15.150> where<00:04:15.329> I<00:04:15.390> always<00:04:15.750> seem<00:04:16.079> to

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 
turn two which is where I always seem to

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.199 
turn two which is where I always seem to
have<00:04:16.350> difficulties<00:04:17.039> because<00:04:17.489> I've<00:04:17.639> taken<00:04:17.850> my

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
have difficulties because I've taken my

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.129 
have difficulties because I've taken my
ek<00:04:18.959> Civic<00:04:19.440> and<00:04:20.359> taking<00:04:21.359> too<00:04:21.510> much<00:04:21.690> speed<00:04:21.989> in

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
ek Civic and taking too much speed in

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.040 
ek Civic and taking too much speed in
that<00:04:22.289> corner<00:04:22.650> and<00:04:22.680> gotten<00:04:23.460> backwards<00:04:24.419> off<00:04:24.720> the

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
that corner and gotten backwards off the

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.909 
that corner and gotten backwards off the
side<00:04:25.260> of<00:04:25.289> the<00:04:25.500> road

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
side of the road

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.080 
side of the road
so<00:04:27.289> the<00:04:28.289> problem<00:04:28.650> really<00:04:28.770> is<00:04:29.010> gear<00:04:29.280> ratios<00:04:29.820> you

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
so the problem really is gear ratios you

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.779 
so the problem really is gear ratios you
have<00:04:30.240> to<00:04:30.419> really<00:04:30.630> be<00:04:30.950> just<00:04:31.950> stay<00:04:32.190> in<00:04:32.370> second

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789 
have to really be just stay in second

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:36.620 
have to really be just stay in second
gear<00:04:33.120> and<00:04:34.460> focus<00:04:35.460> on<00:04:35.639> breaking<00:04:35.940> instead<00:04:36.510> of

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
gear and focus on breaking instead of

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.719 
gear and focus on breaking instead of
accelerating<00:04:37.110> so<00:04:37.889> then<00:04:38.010> we<00:04:38.099> come<00:04:38.310> up<00:04:38.340> to<00:04:38.610> this

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
accelerating so then we come up to this

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:40.940 
accelerating so then we come up to this
next<00:04:38.970> straight<00:04:39.419> and<00:04:39.720> turn<00:04:40.289> three<00:04:40.680> which<00:04:40.919> is

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
next straight and turn three which is

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.909 
next straight and turn three which is
actually<00:04:41.430> pretty<00:04:42.210> pretty<00:04:43.080> simple<00:04:43.320> I<00:04:43.650> mean<00:04:43.830> you

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
actually pretty pretty simple I mean you

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.409 
actually pretty pretty simple I mean you
don't<00:04:44.039> get<00:04:44.220> too<00:04:44.400> much<00:04:44.550> speed<00:04:44.880> and<00:04:45.180> you<00:04:45.270> can

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
don't get too much speed and you can

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.360 
don't get too much speed and you can
focus<00:04:45.660> on<00:04:45.900> your<00:04:46.020> braking<00:04:46.470> I<00:04:46.680> think<00:04:47.039> the<00:04:47.160> thing

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
focus on your braking I think the thing

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.490 
focus on your braking I think the thing
about<00:04:47.610> it<00:04:47.849> is<00:04:47.880> this<00:04:48.360> the<00:04:48.570> apex<00:04:48.720> is<00:04:49.110> kind<00:04:49.380> of

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
about it is this the apex is kind of

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.480 
about it is this the apex is kind of
hard<00:04:49.650> to<00:04:49.710> find

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
hard to find

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.850 
hard to find
like<00:04:50.699> it's<00:04:51.120> so<00:04:51.300> rounded<00:04:51.810> yeah<00:04:52.260> it's<00:04:52.680> very

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
like it's so rounded yeah it's very

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.790 
like it's so rounded yeah it's very
rounded<00:04:53.460> so<00:04:53.760> it's<00:04:54.000> it's<00:04:54.510> not<00:04:54.630> a<00:04:54.690> bike<00:04:55.320> trap<00:04:55.590> set

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
rounded so it's it's not a bike trap set

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.530 
rounded so it's it's not a bike trap set
not<00:04:55.949> a<00:04:56.010> super<00:04:56.490> challenging<00:04:57.000> corner<00:04:57.360> but<00:04:57.539> it's

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
not a super challenging corner but it's

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.020 
not a super challenging corner but it's
it's<00:04:58.930> interesting<00:04:59.290> and<00:05:00.280> then<00:05:00.820> we<00:05:00.880> take

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
it's interesting and then we take

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.630 
it's interesting and then we take
another<00:05:01.150> straight<00:05:01.690> and<00:05:02.050> come<00:05:02.740> on<00:05:02.920> to<00:05:03.100> the<00:05:03.250> last

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
another straight and come on to the last

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.170 
another straight and come on to the last
turn<00:05:03.940> turn<00:05:04.270> four<00:05:05.370> it's<00:05:06.370> pretty<00:05:06.610> similar<00:05:06.940> to

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
turn turn four it's pretty similar to

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.630 
turn turn four it's pretty similar to
the<00:05:07.240> last<00:05:07.450> turn<00:05:07.840> that<00:05:08.530> one<00:05:08.710> again<00:05:09.010> is<00:05:09.250> pretty

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
the last turn that one again is pretty

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.560 
the last turn that one again is pretty
rounded<00:05:10.480> and<00:05:10.780> I<00:05:11.230> do<00:05:11.380> recall<00:05:12.160> always<00:05:13.120> having<00:05:13.390> to

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
rounded and I do recall always having to

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.190 
rounded and I do recall always having to
really<00:05:14.050> keep<00:05:14.950> turn<00:05:15.670> yeah<00:05:16.300> I<00:05:16.330> think<00:05:16.660> I've<00:05:16.990> gone

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
really keep turn yeah I think I've gone

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.140 
really keep turn yeah I think I've gone
off<00:05:17.440> on<00:05:17.650> that<00:05:17.800> turn<00:05:18.100> one<00:05:18.490> well<00:05:18.820> you<00:05:18.970> almost

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
off on that turn one well you almost

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.630 
off on that turn one well you almost
took<00:05:19.570> me<00:05:19.780> out<00:05:19.960> when<00:05:20.470> we<00:05:20.680> were<00:05:20.860> standing<00:05:21.220> right

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
took me out when we were standing right

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.210 
took me out when we were standing right
next<00:05:21.910> to<00:05:22.210> the<00:05:22.510> the<00:05:22.840> tree<00:05:23.320> line<00:05:23.560> over<00:05:23.800> here

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
next to the the tree line over here

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.110 
next to the the tree line over here
sounds<00:05:25.000> like<00:05:25.180> kamikaze<00:05:25.960> and<00:05:26.260> I'm<00:05:26.560> the<00:05:26.710> frickin

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
sounds like kamikaze and I'm the frickin

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.150 
sounds like kamikaze and I'm the frickin
USS<00:05:28.120> whatever<00:05:28.840> sitting<00:05:29.410> there<00:05:29.620> getting<00:05:30.100> ready

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
USS whatever sitting there getting ready

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.030 
USS whatever sitting there getting ready
to<00:05:30.400> get<00:05:30.660> kamikaze<00:05:31.660> definitely<00:05:32.590> hardest<00:05:32.950> to

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
to get kamikaze definitely hardest to

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.520 
to get kamikaze definitely hardest to
find<00:05:33.280> the<00:05:33.400> apex<00:05:33.790> in<00:05:33.940> that<00:05:34.120> one<00:05:34.330> but<00:05:34.660> hug<00:05:35.350> it

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
find the apex in that one but hug it

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.370 
find the apex in that one but hug it
tight<00:05:35.560> and<00:05:36.040> then<00:05:36.100> slam<00:05:37.090> the<00:05:37.300> gas<00:05:37.510> going

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
tight and then slam the gas going

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:50.070 
tight and then slam the gas going
straight<00:05:39.100> across

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.880 

first<00:05:51.080> turns<00:05:51.620> a<00:05:51.830> downshift<00:05:52.990> seconds<00:05:53.990> get<00:05:54.770> the

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:54.890 
first turns a downshift seconds get the

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.850 
first turns a downshift seconds get the
core<00:05:55.130> today

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:04.589 

and<00:05:59.580> then

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:04.599 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:58.909 

pass<00:06:05.050> the<00:06:05.319> Porta<00:06:05.710> Potty<00:06:06.159> township<00:06:06.789> to<00:06:06.999> second

00:06:58.909 --> 00:06:58.919 

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:01.459 

so<00:06:59.460> it<00:06:59.639> was<00:06:59.759> a<00:06:59.789> rough<00:07:00.090> flap<00:07:00.419> that's<00:07:01.050> what<00:07:01.349> we

00:07:01.459 --> 00:07:01.469 
so it was a rough flap that's what we

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:05.300 
so it was a rough flap that's what we
got<00:07:01.740> it's<00:07:02.159> our<00:07:02.370> baseline<00:07:02.789> it<00:07:03.780> is<00:07:04.139> as<00:07:04.560> the<00:07:05.039> car

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:05.310 
got it's our baseline it is as the car

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.360 
got it's our baseline it is as the car
is<00:07:05.580> as<00:07:05.939> we<00:07:06.180> buy<00:07:06.360> yep<00:07:06.960> we<00:07:07.259> if<00:07:07.800> you<00:07:07.949> laughed<00:07:08.159> out

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:08.370 
is as we buy yep we if you laughed out

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:09.890 
is as we buy yep we if you laughed out
there<00:07:08.580> and<00:07:08.759> we<00:07:08.819> tried<00:07:09.029> to<00:07:09.060> make<00:07:09.150> it<00:07:09.389> home<00:07:09.569> and

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:09.900 
there and we tried to make it home and

there and we tried to make it home and
I've<00:07:09.990> got<00:07:10.139> about<00:07:10.349> halfway

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:10.889 
I've got about halfway

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:13.820 
I've got about halfway
all<00:07:11.819> right<00:07:11.939> died<00:07:12.479> you<00:07:12.689> know<00:07:12.719> you<00:07:13.169> got<00:07:13.529> towed

about<00:07:14.219> 15<00:07:14.669> miles<00:07:14.849> packs<00:07:16.069> cart<00:07:17.069> is<00:07:17.279> what<00:07:17.490> it<00:07:17.580> is

00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:17.759 
about 15 miles packs cart is what it is

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:20.769 
about 15 miles packs cart is what it is
obviously<00:07:18.419> that's<00:07:18.719> how<00:07:19.560> it<00:07:19.710> sounded<00:07:20.219> righto

00:07:20.769 --> 00:07:20.779 
obviously that's how it sounded righto

00:07:20.779 --> 00:07:23.959 
obviously that's how it sounded righto
now<00:07:22.159> can't<00:07:23.159> really<00:07:23.400> figure<00:07:23.550> it<00:07:23.699> out<00:07:23.789> this

00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:23.969 
now can't really figure it out this
