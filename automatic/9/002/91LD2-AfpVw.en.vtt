00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
little bit of this on a q-tip and you

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.250 
little bit of this on a q-tip and you
wipe<00:03:37.760> around<00:03:37.909> the<00:03:38.299> spot<00:03:38.629> where<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:39.019> paint

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
wipe around the spot where the paint

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.880 
wipe around the spot where the paint
drip<00:03:39.579> within<00:03:40.579> about<00:03:41.260> 10<00:03:42.260> minutes<00:03:42.470> or<00:03:42.709> so<00:03:42.739> you

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
drip within about 10 minutes or so you

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.819 
drip within about 10 minutes or so you
can<00:03:43.129> clean<00:03:43.670> it<00:03:43.849> away<00:03:44.209> with<00:03:44.510> a<00:03:44.540> hard<00:03:45.230> white<00:03:45.530> rag

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
can clean it away with a hard white rag

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.800 
can clean it away with a hard white rag
and<00:03:46.129> it<00:03:46.489> might<00:03:46.609> get<00:03:46.849> a<00:03:47.090> decent<00:03:47.540> amount<00:03:47.720> of

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
and it might get a decent amount of

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.000 
and it might get a decent amount of
paint<00:03:48.019> off<00:03:48.109> depending<00:03:48.470> on<00:03:48.560> how<00:03:48.709> much<00:03:48.859> you've

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
paint off depending on how much you've

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.649 
paint off depending on how much you've
spilled<00:03:49.310> so<00:03:49.459> this<00:03:49.609> is<00:03:49.730> good<00:03:49.940> to<00:03:49.970> have<00:03:50.209> just<00:03:50.480> in
