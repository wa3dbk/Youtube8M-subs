00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
you're looking at that pro level boot

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.339 
you're looking at that pro level boot
this<00:04:09.239> is<00:04:09.449> something<00:04:09.750> that<00:04:09.900> you're<00:04:10.049> only<00:04:10.199> going

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
this is something that you're only going

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:11.809 
this is something that you're only going
to<00:04:10.500> see<00:04:10.560> with<00:04:10.889> a<00:04:10.919> lot<00:04:11.099> of<00:04:11.160> your<00:04:11.280> top<00:04:11.519> level

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
to see with a lot of your top level

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.140 
to see with a lot of your top level
boots<00:04:12.209> so<00:04:12.530> removable<00:04:13.530> sole<00:04:13.769> extremely<00:04:14.609> nice<00:04:14.819> a

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
boots so removable sole extremely nice a

boots so removable sole extremely nice a
lot<00:04:15.599> of<00:04:15.720> durability<00:04:15.870> durability<00:04:16.320> added<00:04:16.949> in

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
lot of durability durability added in

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.279 
lot of durability durability added in
there<00:04:17.280> now<00:04:18.239> look<00:04:18.510> in<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:18.720> front<00:04:18.930> of<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.049> boot

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
there now look in the front of the boot

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.349 
there now look in the front of the boot
so<00:04:20.010> this<00:04:20.250> is<00:04:20.400> something<00:04:20.579> that<00:04:20.699> Alpinestars

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
so this is something that Alpinestars

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.760 
so this is something that Alpinestars
tech<00:04:21.599> ten<00:04:21.810> this<00:04:21.930> is<00:04:22.049> the<00:04:22.139> only<00:04:22.320> boot<00:04:22.590> that

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
tech ten this is the only boot that

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.770 
tech ten this is the only boot that
we've<00:04:22.890> seen<00:04:23.219> that<00:04:23.400> actually<00:04:23.760> has<00:04:23.969> this<00:04:24.330> they

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
we've seen that actually has this they

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.630 
we've seen that actually has this they
have<00:04:24.930> a<00:04:24.960> blade<00:04:25.260> system<00:04:25.680> in<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:25.860> front<00:04:26.099> a<00:04:26.250> TPU

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
have a blade system in the front a TPU

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.070 
have a blade system in the front a TPU
blade<00:04:27.060> system<00:04:27.510> so

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
blade system so

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.529 
blade system so
as<00:04:28.139> you<00:04:28.379> have<00:04:28.560> hyperflexion<00:04:29.400> these<00:04:30.120> boots<00:04:30.389> are

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
as you have hyperflexion these boots are

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:32.360 
as you have hyperflexion these boots are
actually<00:04:30.810> reflects<00:04:31.229> on<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:32.009> front<00:04:32.220> of<00:04:32.280> the

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
actually reflects on the front of the

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.010 
actually reflects on the front of the
boot<00:04:32.580> that's<00:04:33.060> one<00:04:33.240> of<00:04:33.300> the<00:04:33.360> only<00:04:33.539> boots<00:04:33.840> that

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
boot that's one of the only boots that

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.659 
boot that's one of the only boots that
you're<00:04:34.139> going<00:04:34.259> to<00:04:34.289> see<00:04:34.470> that<00:04:34.590> has<00:04:34.800> a<00:04:35.039> sliding

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
you're going to see that has a sliding

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:37.790 
you're going to see that has a sliding
system<00:04:36.240> in<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:36.539> front<00:04:36.870> as<00:04:37.020> well<00:04:37.080> as<00:04:37.469> the<00:04:37.500> rear

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
system in the front as well as the rear

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.649 
system in the front as well as the rear
if<00:04:38.219> we<00:04:38.370> turn<00:04:38.580> around<00:04:38.699> and<00:04:38.939> look<00:04:39.180> at<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.419> rear

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:39.659 
if we turn around and look at the rear

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:41.209 
if we turn around and look at the rear
you're<00:04:40.110> going<00:04:40.229> to<00:04:40.289> have<00:04:40.439> that<00:04:40.560> blade<00:04:40.830> system

00:04:41.209 --> 00:04:41.219 
you're going to have that blade system

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:42.379 
you're going to have that blade system
in<00:04:41.340> the<00:04:41.430> back<00:04:41.580> as<00:04:41.759> well<00:04:41.939> so<00:04:42.120> you're<00:04:42.210> going<00:04:42.240> to

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
in the back as well so you're going to

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:44.420 
in the back as well so you're going to
have<00:04:42.509> that<00:04:42.629> hyperextension<00:04:43.500> support<00:04:43.919> it's

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
have that hyperextension support it's

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.709 
have that hyperextension support it's
going<00:04:44.610> to<00:04:44.669> have<00:04:44.879> a<00:04:44.909> point<00:04:45.270> where<00:04:45.479> it's<00:04:45.599> going

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:45.719 
going to have a point where it's going

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:46.999 
going to have a point where it's going
to<00:04:45.780> stop<00:04:46.020> flexing<00:04:46.439> so<00:04:46.590> you're<00:04:46.680> going<00:04:46.800> to<00:04:46.830> be

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:47.009 
to stop flexing so you're going to be

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:48.920 
to stop flexing so you're going to be
protected<00:04:47.610> from<00:04:47.639> that<00:04:47.939> and<00:04:48.150> you<00:04:48.479> also<00:04:48.629> have<00:04:48.900> a

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
reinforced heel box here that's going to

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.429 
reinforced heel box here that's going to
help<00:04:51.270> with<00:04:51.389> shock<00:04:51.659> absorption<00:04:52.020> as<00:04:52.229> well<00:04:52.349> as

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:52.439 
help with shock absorption as well as

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:55.520 
help with shock absorption as well as
impact<00:04:52.860> so<00:04:53.509> dual<00:04:54.509> blade<00:04:54.780> system<00:04:55.139> you<00:04:55.229> have<00:04:55.379> it

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
impact so dual blade system you have it

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.860 
impact so dual blade system you have it
in<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:55.770> rear<00:04:56.009> and<00:04:56.520> you<00:04:56.939> have<00:04:57.120> it<00:04:57.270> in<00:04:57.360> the<00:04:57.449> front
