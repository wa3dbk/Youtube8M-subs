00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.910 
up here with multi-position
recliners<00:02:05.150> that<00:02:05.780> would<00:02:05.869> be<00:02:06.020> my<00:02:06.170> setting<00:02:06.530> that

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
recliners that would be my setting that

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.370 
a removable armrest and a rear-facing
recliner<00:02:16.180> it'd<00:02:17.180> be<00:02:17.330> great<00:02:17.450> for<00:02:17.570> watching<00:02:18.320> the

skiers for sure

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.130 
skiers for sure
yeah<00:02:19.580> I<00:02:19.610> think<00:02:19.760> so<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:20.180> it's<00:02:20.540> a<00:02:20.630> two-position

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
yeah I think so and it's a two-position

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.199 
yeah I think so and it's a two-position
recliner<00:02:21.769> so<00:02:22.400> it<00:02:22.610> more<00:02:22.760> of<00:02:22.820> a<00:02:22.880> lay<00:02:23.030> back

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
recliner so it more of a lay back

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.729 
recliner so it more of a lay back
position<00:02:23.690> and<00:02:23.780> more<00:02:23.959> of<00:02:24.050> a<00:02:24.140> vertical<00:02:24.560> position

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
position and more of a vertical position

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.830 
position and more of a vertical position
so<00:02:25.220> if<00:02:25.310> you<00:02:25.400> are<00:02:25.610> watching<00:02:25.820> those<00:02:26.150> kids<00:02:26.360> tubing

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
about tell me about the home well this

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.220 
about tell me about the home well this
is<00:03:52.700> a<00:03:52.730> whole<00:03:52.940> new<00:03:53.090> design<00:03:53.299> and<00:03:53.690> again<00:03:53.900> this<00:03:54.080> is

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
is a whole new design and again this is

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.770 
is a whole new design and again this is
a<00:03:54.260> new<00:03:54.530> boat<00:03:54.739> for<00:03:54.980> 2014<00:03:55.970> and<00:03:56.180> when<00:03:56.299> we<00:03:56.450> started

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
a new boat for 2014 and when we started

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.780 
a new boat for 2014 and when we started
with<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:57.110> gauge<00:03:57.319> clusters<00:03:57.860> we<00:03:58.040> wanted<00:03:58.370> simple

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
with the gauge clusters we wanted simple

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.940 
with the gauge clusters we wanted simple
but<00:03:59.420> a<00:03:59.450> fishing<00:03:59.750> gauge<00:04:00.079> cluster<00:04:00.530> so<00:04:00.709> we<00:04:00.799> have

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
but a fishing gauge cluster so we have

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.430 
but a fishing gauge cluster so we have
two<00:04:01.220> larger<00:04:01.670> 5-inch<00:04:02.239> multifunction<00:04:03.019> gauges

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
two larger 5-inch multifunction gauges

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.009 
two larger 5-inch multifunction gauges
here<00:04:03.819> integrating<00:04:04.819> the<00:04:04.910> fuel<00:04:05.209> volt<00:04:05.599> and<00:04:05.840> the

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
here integrating the fuel volt and the

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.589 
here integrating the fuel volt and the
trim<00:04:06.349> clean<00:04:07.099> and<00:04:07.430> that<00:04:07.790> left<00:04:08.060> room<00:04:08.269> for<00:04:08.299> the

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
trim clean and that left room for the

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.720 
trim clean and that left room for the
larger<00:04:08.989> GPS<00:04:09.530> systems<00:04:09.980> that<00:04:10.190> most<00:04:10.400> of<00:04:10.579> our

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
larger GPS systems that most of our

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.819 
larger GPS systems that most of our
customers<00:04:11.090> are<00:04:11.510> asking<00:04:11.959> for<00:04:12.200> and<00:04:12.500> again<00:04:12.680> this

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
customers are asking for and again this

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:15.369 
customers are asking for and again this
is<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.099> echo<00:04:13.280> map<00:04:13.640> 50<00:04:14.090> system<00:04:14.510> which<00:04:15.049> is<00:04:15.230> one

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:15.379 
is the echo map 50 system which is one

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:18.610 
is the echo map 50 system which is one
