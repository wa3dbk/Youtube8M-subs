00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.349
 here again after so long together 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.390
 gathered at this table to commemorate 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.689
 the birth and death of Jesus is not true 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:35.230
 because nico boiate I don't know anyway 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:37.630

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.059
 you don't know I invite you to know that 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.660
 fuck i'm saying well don't you care about that 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.850
 what I say in between is stoned 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.770
 we come back here after a while 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.590
 sorry for the delay this time in 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.050
 late despite my reasons not 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.000
 be high this is a little late not 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.420
 my channel but I apologize to me 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.739
 sorry I really am a bit so I don't know if 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.910
 I understand I got the real knot 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.640
 finally back with a gameplay 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.470
 let's say I didn't know what to wear 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.159
 background is not a live is not a 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.799
 gameplay that I didn't know for those who buoys 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.850
 I absolutely had not not there 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.470
 I'm not able to put myself 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.590
 agree with the gaming group for 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:24.600
 make the bertran challenge I succeeded 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:29.679
 in abo I failed to bo say that 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.149
 however, this gameplay is a bit found in the 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:33.039
 my hard disk and I found it right in 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.999
 hard disk- type bottom too hard 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:38.259
 disk howson and this is a video 

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:41.109
 beautiful is a number always on 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:44.279
 new maps because as I already said 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:46.479
 I said in the previous video that 

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:48.039
 preferences is the first nuclear of 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.770
 heels in Italy if someone needs to 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:53.679
 say that the first is not my can 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:59.409
 make sure I got in 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:02:01.090
 contact with the one who made the other 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.889
 nuclear fingers that I can assure you that 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.920
 mine is the first not to say anything but 

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:09.959
 my first shitty person that 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.760
 am still al and understand mythical with whom 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.870
 is a core to the fact about study that 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.490
 really this map is the most beautiful 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.590
 perhaps on a par with in core but also of 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.780
 more because I adore this map 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.040
 reminds me of the good times of black ops 1 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.099
 where is it 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.659
 apple camper avo on the fucking tower 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:32.129
 the whole game really stops the memories 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.969
 they really become so many already 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.219
 gorgeous 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:37.590
 ok i say sorry tonight so excuse me 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:38.819
 this is a core of entities 7 or I will do 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.390
 some killings with an old man 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.129
 ground collection but boh there is and me 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.620
 sorry even if a piece of the game 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.209
 will be in the cavity will be in the cottage 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.239
 because we say that the game does not 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.040
 meshed for a gaming group and 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.079
 so I decided to engage the ego 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.689
 being a little firm playing a little easy 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.609
 to take a quick sack it will work 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:00.810
 the method is in fact bo 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:05.159
 then the rest of the game will be more 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:08.700
 left what can I tell you a moment 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:11.489
 of the extra game or studio to one 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.560
 decidedly cluster map does what you 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.900
 I recommend staying very very long 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.269
 very very very very very very very 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.099
 beware of the spots because in this 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.579
 the sponsors really did go 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:25.349
 tight that you will end up with 800 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.359
 enemies that are born in front of you and 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.949
 continue to be born before you like 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:32.370
 you could be there for half a game 

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:34.709
 without an enemy in front it is a bit random 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.479
 but if you manage to control it well 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.069
 background as we will in this game that 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:42.150
 there will be a continuous entry and exit 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:44.310
 in scouts or if you succeed in 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.359
 check stop map are here for free 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.379
 mom really many free kills 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:51.419
 let's say that today however it is not of the 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:53.190
 gameplay that I want to talk to you about what that da 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:55.199
 quite a while I remember this 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.959
 adc phrase with my first videos so much 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:04:00.900
 a long time ago in a few months and I said 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.940
 I want to talk to you about the game but for one 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.560
 once in this period there is no 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.479
 I'll talk about the game. I'll tell you about one 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:11.669
 little idea that came to me just for 

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:14.849
 make you understand the first one that comes to me 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:17.489
 say you copied the idea from yellow will come 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:20.220
 hung by the thumbs 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.070
 on the bulletin board of my channel and will come from 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.259
 rice was insulted by everyone because the 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.930
 first that will make such observation 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:31.520
 indeed he will be the least sly person of 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.690
 this country world multiverse universe 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.870
 size not this size 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:41.070
 this because i am going to open a 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.840
 second channel a stupid type channel 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.669
 just that of ale and if someone 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.770
 I repeat that he will tell me he will come 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:51.000
 launched a secondary channel where 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:53.190
 I'll load all my clips 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.570
 the things I won't load are on the first one 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.200
 channel because precisely on a video of 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:00.120
 few seconds but still nice ea 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.120
 difference of others 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.800
 i want to do something i don't know is from a 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.930
 some time I wanted to do let's say that 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.229
 I don't know I've always had a 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.180
 inclination to make videos demented and 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:13.940
 let's say I don't do this channel 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.860
 apart from both the ver we say 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:19.950
 from the seriousness of the first episodes alone 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.779
 with this new group they lost in 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.900
 seriousness 

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:28.080
 I love you we say that every 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:30.870
 intention to do also videos or gods 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:34.199
 live, let's say that the videos are still whole 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:37.039
 saw no clipping and so little things like that 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:42.570
 own video videos themselves 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:45.330
 where I talk like that and say where I don't know now 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.580
 I will do stupid things you will see things 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:51.029
 stupid stupid things still stupid things 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.770
 let's say they will be video I don't know video 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:54.120
 in live maybe even that webcam video 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.070
 which is something I don't know you love me has 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.040
 always enjoyed making videos that 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:01.970
 webcam I don't know type 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:04.490
 games or indie games sclerosis games 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.350
 I do n't know all that amusing games 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.530
 kind of thing that on the first channel not 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:13.910
 it loads but I'm still in mine 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:15.590
 heart I mix with the journey I hope 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.840
 that you like this idea tell me 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:20.690
 in the comments as usual tell me if 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:23.210
 the idea of waiting attracts you as it is 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:25.850
 felt like a lady when she felt 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.950
 he heard that the bear between would have 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.050
 opened a second channel now me 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.020
 he beats because I can't do it anyway 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:35.150
 We tried a little bit of a pain 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:37.640
 suffering a bit of regret a pinch 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:40.400
 of malice the lady does not answer 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:43.520
 so I invite you home to answer 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.680
 sending a message as it is 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.140
 according to you the lady when she has 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.840
 heard his son black bear in between 

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.280
 would have opened a secondary channel yes 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.560

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.790
 over and I don't know, I invite you 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.840

 enter the second channel that 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:02.210
 surely it will already be open because I will 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:04.940
 I ask the opinion but I will do it without the 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:06.440
 your opinion will already be open will be more 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.680

 name I will decide tonight precisely there is a 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.860
 I like going to the second channel there

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:20.590
 I love the state from the buoys between us 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.590
 he gets the next hello comments
