00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:15.519
 complicated 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.629

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.009
 this issue in order to 

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:41.479
 but find opportunities to strike a budget 

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:43.239

 construction of a traffic light object 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:03.669

 and of course a powerful radar governor 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.499
 Vologda region for the fact that 

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:32.129
 it grows significantly at the expense of funds 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:33.979
 regional budget 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:36.430
