which<00:02:03.720> is<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.870> terrible<00:02:04.350> return<00:02:04.620> rate<00:02:04.770> since

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
which is a terrible return rate since

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.560 
which is a terrible return rate since
they<00:02:05.010> sell<00:02:05.190> for<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.370> hundred<00:02:05.820> thousand<00:02:06.330> apiece

they sell for a hundred thousand apiece

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.800 
they sell for a hundred thousand apiece
right<00:02:06.810> each<00:02:07.320> RFP<00:02:08.220> sell<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.640> lot<00:02:08.850> of<00:02:08.880> 28<00:02:09.330> that's

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
right each RFP sell a lot of 28 that's

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.650 
right each RFP sell a lot of 28 that's
2.8<00:02:10.320> mil<00:02:10.500> almost<00:02:10.860> 30<00:02:11.010> mil<00:02:11.190> per<00:02:11.880> load<00:02:12.210> it's

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
2.8 mil almost 30 mil per load it's

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.080 
2.8 mil almost 30 mil per load it's
really<00:02:13.020> really<00:02:13.200> good<00:02:13.230> really<00:02:13.530> quick<00:02:13.770> money

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
but since cooking them is really

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.990 
but since cooking them is really
inefficient<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.370> you<00:02:17.640> really<00:02:17.820> want<00:02:17.940> to

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
inefficient you you really want to

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.190 
inefficient you you really want to
maximize<00:02:18.330> efficiency<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:18.840> want<00:02:18.989> to<00:02:19.050> get<00:02:19.140> as

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
maximize efficiency you want to get as

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.660 
maximize efficiency you want to get as
many<00:02:19.350> cooked<00:02:19.680> as<00:02:19.770> possible<00:02:20.130> about<00:02:20.190> losing<00:02:20.520> any

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
many cooked as possible about losing any

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.400 
many cooked as possible about losing any
