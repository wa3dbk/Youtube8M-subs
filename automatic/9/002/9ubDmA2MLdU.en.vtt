bringing them back to your base it's

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.660 
bringing them back to your base it's
coming<00:03:41.620> it's<00:03:41.709> kind<00:03:41.920> of<00:03:41.950> similar<00:03:42.130> to<00:03:42.220> I<00:03:42.370> of<00:03:42.610> the

tell you the to PvP changes that will be

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:54.870 
tell you the to PvP changes that will be
happening<00:03:53.200> in<00:03:53.500> patch<00:03:53.620> 5.3<00:03:54.160> that<00:03:54.459> caught<00:03:54.670> my

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
happening in patch 5.3 that caught my

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.600 
happening in patch 5.3 that caught my
eye<00:03:54.910> the<00:03:55.810> first<00:03:56.140> one<00:03:56.410> is<00:03:56.440> that<00:03:56.980> when<00:03:57.160> you<00:03:57.280> queue

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
eye the first one is that when you queue

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.430 
eye the first one is that when you queue
up<00:03:57.790> for<00:03:57.820> a<00:03:58.150> battleground<00:03:58.660> you<00:03:58.990> will<00:03:59.140> have<00:03:59.290> to

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
up for a battleground you will have to

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.620 
up for a battleground you will have to
choose<00:03:59.680> a<00:03:59.740> specific<00:04:00.040> role<00:04:00.490> tank<00:04:01.030> healer<00:04:01.420> or

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
choose a specific role tank healer or

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.960 
choose a specific role tank healer or
dps<00:04:01.660> and<00:04:02.500> this<00:04:02.950> is<00:04:03.190> so<00:04:03.430> that<00:04:03.550> there<00:04:03.730> will<00:04:03.820> be<00:04:03.940> a

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
dps and this is so that there will be a

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.230 
dps and this is so that there will be a
balanced<00:04:04.570> amount<00:04:04.720> of<00:04:04.900> healers<00:04:05.350> on<00:04:05.590> each<00:04:05.770> team

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240 
balanced amount of healers on each team

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.580 
balanced amount of healers on each team
apparently<00:04:07.240> there<00:04:07.420> will<00:04:07.510> only<00:04:07.600> be<00:04:07.750> a<00:04:07.870> maximum

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
apparently there will only be a maximum

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.949 
apparently there will only be a maximum
difference<00:04:08.980> of<00:04:09.190> one<00:04:09.490> healer<00:04:09.910> per<00:04:10.120> team<00:04:10.390> this

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
difference of one healer per team this

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.780 
difference of one healer per team this
means<00:04:11.290> that<00:04:11.410> if<00:04:11.560> hoard<00:04:11.980> has<00:04:12.190> three<00:04:12.520> healers

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
means that if hoard has three healers

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.570 
means that if hoard has three healers
the<00:04:13.390> Alliance<00:04:13.840> can<00:04:14.080> have<00:04:14.290> two<00:04:14.590> minimum<00:04:15.010> for

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
the Alliance can have two minimum for

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.220 
the Alliance can have two minimum for
maximum<00:04:16.180> and<00:04:16.359> that's<00:04:16.540> it<00:04:16.750> there<00:04:16.989> won't<00:04:17.109> be

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
maximum and that's it there won't be

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.770 
maximum and that's it there won't be
like<00:04:17.470> eight<00:04:18.100> healers<00:04:18.760> on<00:04:18.940> one<00:04:19.060> team<00:04:19.299> and<00:04:19.330> one

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
like eight healers on one team and one

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.539 
like eight healers on one team and one
on<00:04:19.959> the<00:04:19.989> other<00:04:20.140> this<00:04:20.500> is<00:04:20.680> this<00:04:21.160> is<00:04:21.310> a<00:04:21.340> pretty

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
on the other this is this is a pretty

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.300 
on the other this is this is a pretty
good<00:04:21.790> change<00:04:22.090> in<00:04:22.270> my<00:04:22.390> opinion<00:04:22.690> and<00:04:23.050> the<00:04:23.919> second

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
good change in my opinion and the second

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.640 
good change in my opinion and the second
thing<00:04:24.340> is<00:04:24.700> that<00:04:24.970> in<00:04:25.150> 5.3<00:04:25.840> when<00:04:26.200> you<00:04:26.320> are<00:04:26.440> any
