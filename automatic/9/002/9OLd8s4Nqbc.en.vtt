00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
hello I'm going to show you how to get

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.450 
hello I'm going to show you how to get
custom<00:00:03.510> moves<00:00:03.689> for<00:00:04.110> charity<00:00:04.799> one<00:00:04.980> really

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
custom moves for charity one really

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.820 
custom moves for charity one really
easily<00:00:05.700> in<00:00:05.940> Super<00:00:06.359> Smash<00:00:06.420> Bros<00:00:06.750> I<00:00:07.290> think<00:00:07.740> this

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
easily in Super Smash Bros I think this

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.890 
easily in Super Smash Bros I think this
only<00:00:08.069> works<00:00:08.340> for<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.519> Wii<00:00:08.610> U<00:00:08.639> but<00:00:09.030> I<00:00:09.090> actually

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
only works for the Wii U but I actually

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.570 
only works for the Wii U but I actually
died<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:10.679> checked<00:00:10.889> for<00:00:10.980> three<00:00:11.190> years

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
died and checked for three years

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.640 
died and checked for three years
my<00:00:12.389> understanding<00:00:12.599> is<00:00:12.900> easy<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.349> get<00:00:13.469> them<00:00:13.559> in

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
my understanding is easy to get them in

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.180 
my understanding is easy to get them in
three<00:00:13.769> days<00:00:13.860> anyway<00:00:15.049> yeah<00:00:16.049> you<00:00:16.109> go<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.379> smash

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
three days anyway yeah you go to smash

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.609 
three days anyway yeah you go to smash
mode<00:00:17.750> probably<00:00:18.750> works<00:00:18.900> for<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.080> player<00:00:19.320> as<00:00:19.470> well

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
mode probably works for a player as well

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.580 
mode probably works for a player as well
but<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:20.130> didn't<00:00:20.369> think<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:20.699> she<00:00:20.820> mends

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
but I didn't think of that she mends

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.870 
but I didn't think of that she mends
pick<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.740> character<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.189> want<00:00:23.430> cost<00:00:23.640> sums

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
pick the character you want cost sums

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.580 
pick the character you want cost sums
for<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.330> high<00:00:24.539> against<00:00:24.960> cultural<00:00:25.230> customs

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
for and high against cultural customs

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.929 
for and high against cultural customs
for<00:00:26.010> then<00:00:26.939> just<00:00:26.970> go<00:00:27.330> into<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.570> normal<00:00:27.810> battle<00:00:28.080> I

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
for then just go into a normal battle I

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.200 
for then just go into a normal battle I
don't<00:00:29.939> anything<00:00:30.119> if<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.480> win<00:00:31.399> but<00:00:32.399> if<00:00:33.030> you

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
don't anything if the win but if you

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.940 
don't anything if the win but if you
just<00:00:33.390> play<00:00:33.540> love<00:00:33.750> against<00:00:33.989> someone<00:00:34.410> then<00:00:34.590> it's

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
just play love against someone then it's

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.510 
just play love against someone then it's
hard<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.550> lose<00:00:35.670> anyone<00:00:36.770> and<00:00:37.770> can<00:00:38.100> only<00:00:38.190> be<00:00:38.309> one

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
hard to lose anyone and can only be one

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.260 
hard to lose anyone and can only be one
stuff<00:00:38.790> as<00:00:38.910> well

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
stuff as well

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.060 
stuff as well
if<00:00:39.719> you

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
if you

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.380 
if you
if<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.550> don't<00:00:41.760> want<00:00:41.880> to<00:00:41.940> play<00:00:42.059> for<00:00:42.239> much

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
if you don't want to play for much

00:00:42.390 --> 00:01:02.020 
if you don't want to play for much
longer<00:00:42.720> than<00:00:42.809> that

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:09.530 

there<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.120> go<00:01:07.130> and<00:01:08.130> after<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.850> go<00:01:09.090> into

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
there you go and after that you go into

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.850 
there you go and after that you go into
target<00:01:10.320> blast<00:01:10.740> mode<00:01:12.380> which<00:01:13.380> I'm<00:01:13.560> going<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.770> do

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.950 

there<00:01:29.400> we<00:01:29.460> go<00:01:29.640> Stadium<00:01:30.180> target<00:01:30.510> lost<00:01:30.659> any

there we go Stadium target lost any
anyone<00:01:31.560> doesn't<00:01:31.800> make<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.130> difference<00:01:32.430> I

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
anyone doesn't make the difference I

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.680 
anyone doesn't make the difference I
always<00:01:32.700> do<00:01:32.820> stage<00:01:33.030> one<00:01:33.240> just<00:01:33.420> because<00:01:33.510> it's

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
always do stage one just because it's

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.469 
always do stage one just because it's
slightly<00:01:33.930> easier<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:35.119> then<00:01:36.119> pick<00:01:36.450> the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
slightly easier and then pick the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.050 
slightly easier and then pick the
character<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.140> your<00:01:37.229> customs<00:01:37.650> for<00:01:37.770> again

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.190 

and<00:01:42.060> then<00:01:42.210> load<00:01:42.390> up<00:01:42.470> whichever<00:01:43.470> map<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.890> want

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
and then load up whichever map you want

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.660 
and then load up whichever map you want
and<00:01:46.200> then<00:01:46.380> immediately<00:01:46.590> pause<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.460> have<00:01:47.640> a

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
and then immediately pause it and have a

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.910 
and then immediately pause it and have a
look<00:01:47.790> around<00:01:47.909> in<00:01:48.390> case<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.810> can<00:01:48.960> see<00:01:49.140> the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
look around in case you can see the

little customs icon this stage doesn't

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.260 
little customs icon this stage doesn't
have<00:01:52.650> it<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.920> just<00:01:53.220> has<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.820> little<00:01:54.090> red

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
icon usually doesn't take more than

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.090

about<00:02:20.580> five<00:02:20.640> times<00:02:21.380> yeah<00:02:22.380> there's<00:02:22.590> one<00:02:22.739> bottom

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
about five times yeah there's one bottom

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.580 
about five times yeah there's one bottom
right<00:02:23.220> again<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:24.239> now<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:24.810> just<00:02:24.930> have<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.410> hit

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
right again so now you just have to hit

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.470 
right again so now you just have to hit
that<00:02:25.650> with<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.130> bomb<00:02:26.310> which<00:02:26.970> is<00:02:27.120> pretty<00:02:27.300> easy

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
that with the bomb which is pretty easy

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:41.660
