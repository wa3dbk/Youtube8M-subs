this guide I'm using some pretty high

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.080 
this guide I'm using some pretty high
level<00:03:58.440> items<00:03:58.769> such<00:03:59.040> as<00:03:59.069> overloads<00:03:59.670> super

prayers and the iron Titan should use

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.860 
prayers and the iron Titan should use
basically<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.349> best<00:04:04.500> of<00:04:04.860> these<00:04:05.720> things<00:04:06.720> that

basically the best of these things that

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.780 
basically the best of these things that
you<00:04:06.959> can<00:04:07.170> if<00:04:07.739> you<00:04:07.860> don't<00:04:08.010> have<00:04:08.129> overloads<00:04:08.580> for

you can if you don't have overloads for

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.880 
you can if you don't have overloads for
instance<00:04:09.060> you<00:04:09.209> can<00:04:09.360> just<00:04:09.540> use<00:04:09.750> extreme<00:04:10.590> attack

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890

up<00:04:51.210> on<00:04:51.300> you<00:04:51.449> if<00:04:51.660> you<00:04:53.479> you<00:04:54.479> can<00:04:54.600> get<00:04:54.750> up<00:04:54.900> to<00:04:54.930> about

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
six or so on you at once so you were to

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.240 
six or so on you at once so you were to
pay<00:04:57.870> very<00:04:58.080> close<00:04:58.289> attention<00:04:58.410> to<00:04:58.950> your<00:04:59.070> health

pay very close attention to your health
at<00:05:00.090> all<00:05:00.360> times

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.060 

this<00:05:04.510> is<00:05:04.660> the<00:05:04.810> end<00:05:04.990> of<00:05:05.140> the<00:05:05.260> first<00:05:05.530> trip<00:05:05.770> that<00:05:06.010> I

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
this is the end of the first trip that I

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.700 
this is the end of the first trip that I
made<00:05:06.750> as<00:05:07.750> you<00:05:07.870> can<00:05:07.990> see<00:05:08.140> there's<00:05:08.410> plenty<00:05:08.440> of

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
made as you can see there's plenty of

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.550 
made as you can see there's plenty of
put<00:05:08.890> drops<00:05:09.160> but<00:05:09.730> I<00:05:09.760> had<00:05:09.970> to<00:05:10.090> leave<00:05:10.290> because<00:05:11.290> I

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
put drops but I had to leave because I

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.370 
put drops but I had to leave because I
was<00:05:12.340> getting<00:05:12.490> driven<00:05:12.850> low<00:05:13.090> on<00:05:13.210> prayer<00:05:13.480> and<00:05:13.810> my

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
was getting driven low on prayer and my

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.470 
was getting driven low on prayer and my
overload<00:05:14.800> dose<00:05:15.010> just<00:05:15.040> ran<00:05:15.430> out<00:05:15.610> so<00:05:15.910> I<00:05:16.090> decided

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
overload dose just ran out so I decided

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.860 
overload dose just ran out so I decided
to<00:05:16.600> tell<00:05:16.900> brought<00:05:17.080> out<00:05:17.370> instead

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
to tell brought out instead

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:24.750 
to tell brought out instead
and<00:05:19.870> don't<00:05:20.230> be<00:05:20.350> supply<00:05:23.130> in<00:05:24.130> this<00:05:24.220> case<00:05:24.490> I

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
and don't be supply in this case I

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.780 
and don't be supply in this case I
bought<00:05:24.970> prayer<00:05:25.420> potions<00:05:25.660> and<00:05:26.430> less<00:05:27.430> supplies

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
bought prayer potions and less supplies

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.280 
bought prayer potions and less supplies
because<00:05:28.180> I<00:05:28.360> didn't<00:05:28.600> really<00:05:28.810> need<00:05:28.990> as<00:05:29.650> many

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
because I didn't really need as many

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.390 
because I didn't really need as many
because<00:05:32.290> I<00:05:32.380> had<00:05:32.530> learned<00:05:32.740> much<00:05:32.800> less<00:05:33.130> skills

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
because I had learned much less skills

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.320 
because I had learned much less skills
to<00:05:33.640> do<00:05:35.460> once<00:05:36.460> you<00:05:36.580> make<00:05:36.730> your<00:05:36.760> way<00:05:37.000> back<00:05:37.150> to<00:05:37.300> the

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
to do once you make your way back to the

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.710 
to do once you make your way back to the
water<00:05:37.570> fence<00:05:37.840> I<00:05:38.110> just<00:05:38.410> keep<00:05:38.560> continuing<00:05:39.720> and

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
water fence I just keep continuing and

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.500 
water fence I just keep continuing and
killing<00:05:41.020> them<00:05:41.970> you<00:05:42.970> should<00:05:43.150> end<00:05:43.300> up<00:05:43.450> with

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
killing them you should end up with

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.290 
killing them you should end up with
roughly<00:05:43.840> about<00:05:44.460> 80%<00:05:45.460> of<00:05:45.580> your<00:05:45.700> kills<00:05:45.970> with

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
roughly about 80% of your kills with

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.650 
roughly about 80% of your kills with
creams<00:05:46.780> and<00:05:46.900> charms

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
creams and charms

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.910 
creams and charms
that's<00:05:49.660> pretty<00:05:49.870> much<00:05:50.020> all<00:05:50.200> the<00:05:50.590> good<00:05:50.770> jobs

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:50.920 
that's pretty much all the good jobs

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.530 
that's pretty much all the good jobs
that<00:05:51.160> they<00:05:51.250> have<00:05:51.280> fun<00:05:51.730> they<00:05:51.970> do<00:05:52.030> have<00:05:52.330> alcohol

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:52.540 
that they have fun they do have alcohol

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.530 
that they have fun they do have alcohol
drops<00:05:53.130> but<00:05:54.130> you<00:05:54.310> will<00:05:54.940> be<00:05:55.030> rushing<00:05:55.360> around

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.540 
drops but you will be rushing around

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.840 
drops but you will be rushing around
picking<00:05:55.960> up<00:05:56.110> charms<00:05:56.470> and<00:05:56.620> things<00:05:56.800> so<00:05:57.130> you<00:05:57.640> have

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:57.850 
picking up charms and things so you have

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.960 
picking up charms and things so you have
barely<00:05:58.330> any<00:05:58.450> time<00:05:58.570> to<00:05:59.070> focus<00:06:00.070> on<00:06:00.400> Elkanah<00:06:00.790> and

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
barely any time to focus on Elkanah and

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:01.650 
barely any time to focus on Elkanah and
stuff<00:06:01.120> like<00:06:01.270> that

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660 
stuff like that

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.940 
stuff like that
so<00:06:02.140> don't<00:06:02.680> really<00:06:02.860> bother<00:06:03.010> with<00:06:03.160> those<00:06:04.950> yeah

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:05.950 
so don't really bother with those yeah

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.560 
so don't really bother with those yeah
so<00:06:06.220> that's<00:06:06.400> pretty<00:06:06.580> much<00:06:06.700> it<00:06:09.120> as<00:06:10.120> I<00:06:10.240> said<00:06:10.450> you

so that's pretty much it as I said you
will<00:06:10.600> need<00:06:10.810> very<00:06:11.050> very<00:06:11.440> high<00:06:11.590> stats<00:06:11.920> to<00:06:12.240> kill

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
will need very very high stats to kill

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.820 
will need very very high stats to kill
what<00:06:13.420> fiends<00:06:13.660> this<00:06:13.810> way<00:06:14.020> so<00:06:14.080> if<00:06:14.530> you<00:06:14.650> don't
