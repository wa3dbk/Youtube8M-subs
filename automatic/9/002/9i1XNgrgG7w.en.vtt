so the first thing I'm going to do is

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.059 
so the first thing I'm going to do is
just<00:02:52.600> open<00:02:52.900> up<00:02:52.959> a<00:02:53.079> blank<00:02:53.200> reason<00:02:53.680> session

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
just open up a blank reason session

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.520 
just open up a blank reason session
create<00:02:54.730> a<00:02:54.760> Combinator<00:02:55.299> go<00:02:56.109> over<00:02:56.319> here<00:02:56.470> and

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
create a Combinator go over here and

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.190 
create a Combinator go over here and
I'll<00:02:56.739> load<00:02:56.950> up<00:02:56.980> one<00:02:57.489> of<00:02:57.609> our<00:02:57.700> drum<00:02:57.940> kits<00:02:58.180> and<00:02:58.720> I

by the combinator controls so you have a

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.300 
by the combinator controls so you have a
short<00:03:55.150> and<00:03:55.270> a<00:03:55.330> long<00:03:55.450> reverb<00:03:55.860> spread<00:03:56.860> which<00:03:57.280> is

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:26.120 
the same sound these samples are what
you<00:06:24.000> hear<00:06:24.389> on<00:06:24.630> your<00:06:24.690> own<00:06:25.110> is<00:06:25.410> what<00:06:25.710> they<00:06:25.860> sound

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.130 
you hear on your own is what they sound

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.969 
you hear on your own is what they sound
like<00:06:26.310> in<00:06:26.699> the<00:06:26.849> music<00:06:27.300> so<00:06:27.720> you<00:06:27.780> could<00:06:27.990> layer<00:06:28.289> 12

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:28.979 
like in the music so you could layer 12

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:31.129 
like in the music so you could layer 12
layers<00:06:29.190> of<00:06:29.460> guitars<00:06:29.820> on<00:06:30.150> these<00:06:30.330> kick<00:06:30.900> drums

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:31.139 
layers of guitars on these kick drums

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:33.290 
layers of guitars on these kick drums
and<00:06:31.349> snare<00:06:31.590> drums<00:06:31.949> the<00:06:32.430> size<00:06:32.729> of<00:06:32.970> them<00:06:33.120> will

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
and snare drums the size of them will

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.350 
and snare drums the size of them will
never<00:06:33.599> go<00:06:33.930> away<00:06:34.880> but<00:06:35.880> that's<00:06:36.030> the<00:06:36.210> whole

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
never go away but that's the whole

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.749 
never go away but that's the whole
library<00:06:36.870> is<00:06:37.020> for<00:06:37.349> it's<00:06:37.650> with<00:06:38.280> somebody<00:06:38.639> who

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:38.759 
library is for it's with somebody who

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:40.820 
library is for it's with somebody who
hears<00:06:39.090> it<00:06:39.180> and<00:06:39.539> starts<00:06:39.960> working<00:06:40.199> with<00:06:40.440> it<00:06:40.710> and

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:40.830 
hears it and starts working with it and

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.860 
hears it and starts working with it and
really<00:06:41.070> understands<00:06:41.580> and<00:06:41.759> gets<00:06:42.090> it<00:06:42.360> they<00:06:42.720> are

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:42.870 
really understands and gets it they are

really understands and gets it they are
going<00:06:43.080> to<00:06:43.320> be<00:06:43.470> inspired<00:06:43.770> to<00:06:44.310> write<00:06:45.830> and

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 
going to be inspired to write and

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.790 
going to be inspired to write and
hopefully<00:06:48.120> write<00:06:48.270> something<00:06:48.570> good

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:51.800
