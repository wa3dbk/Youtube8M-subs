well<00:00:00.510> the<00:00:00.599> science<00:00:00.810> boys<00:00:01.110> are<00:00:01.290> going<00:00:01.469> for<00:00:01.620> the

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
well the science boys are going for the

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.409 
well the science boys are going for the
sunshine<00:00:02.040> cake<00:00:02.220> that<00:00:02.340> makes<00:00:02.520> electricity<00:00:02.760> out

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
sunshine cake that makes electricity out

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:04.880

of<00:00:03.449> your<00:00:03.659> sunlight<00:00:03.929> oh<00:00:04.319> yes<00:00:04.529> you<00:00:04.740> mean<00:00:04.830> the

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
of your sunlight oh yes you mean the

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.920 
of your sunlight oh yes you mean the
solar<00:00:05.250> battery<00:00:05.609> yeah<00:00:05.850> that's<00:00:06.299> hardly<00:00:06.690> even<00:00:06.750> a

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930
