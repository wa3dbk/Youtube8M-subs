00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.949 
fighters like the regular parts about
this<00:03:16.269> high<00:03:16.680> so<00:03:17.680> I<00:03:17.709> mean<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.190> time<00:03:18.370> defender<00:03:18.760> is

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
this high so I mean the time defender is

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:25.860 
this high so I mean the time defender is
pretty<00:03:19.959> big<00:03:21.300> so<00:03:23.610> yes<00:03:24.610> so<00:03:25.030> it's<00:03:25.209> sort<00:03:25.480> of<00:03:25.600> the

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
pretty big so yes so it's sort of the

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.220 
pretty big so yes so it's sort of the
review<00:03:26.380> we<00:03:26.560> got<00:03:26.800> the<00:03:27.510> flip<00:03:28.510> our<00:03:28.690> missiles<00:03:29.080> on

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
review we got the flip our missiles on

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.620 
review we got the flip our missiles on
its<00:03:29.260> first<00:03:29.500> feature<00:03:31.470> yeah<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:34.120> we<00:03:34.269> got<00:03:34.300> them

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
its first feature yeah and we got them

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.920 
its first feature yeah and we got them
on<00:03:34.720> each<00:03:35.019> side<00:03:35.500> one<00:03:35.920> two<00:03:36.220> three<00:03:36.730> four<00:03:37.030> five<00:03:37.300> six

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
on each side one two three four five six

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:44.130 
on each side one two three four five six
of<00:03:38.290> them<00:03:38.790> lots<00:03:39.790> flick<00:03:40.120> fired<00:03:40.360> man<00:03:42.810> then<00:03:43.810> we<00:03:43.959> got

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
of them lots flick fired man then we got

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.759 
of them lots flick fired man then we got
the<00:03:44.410> cockpit<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.100> cockpits<00:03:45.550> is<00:03:46.530> moves<00:03:47.530> on

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
the cockpit the cockpits is moves on

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.850 
the cockpit the cockpits is moves on
it's<00:03:48.010> gotten<00:03:48.370> better<00:03:48.760> I<00:03:49.060> must<00:03:49.450> say<00:03:49.860> it's

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
it's gotten better I must say it's

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.229 
it's gotten better I must say it's
gotten<00:03:51.190> better<00:03:51.310> than<00:03:51.580> the<00:03:51.670> older<00:03:52.030> ones

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
gotten better than the older ones

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.280 
gotten better than the older ones
especially<00:03:52.420> for<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:53.140> TIE<00:03:53.440> fighter<00:03:54.120> um<00:03:55.290> that's

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
especially for the TIE fighter um that's

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.670 
especially for the TIE fighter um that's
all<00:03:56.440> crap<00:03:58.890> sorry<00:03:59.890> about<00:04:00.130> that<00:04:00.160> um<00:04:01.230> so<00:04:02.230> this<00:04:02.560> is

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
all crap sorry about that um so this is

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.710 
all crap sorry about that um so this is
the<00:04:02.800> cockpit<00:04:03.250> you<00:04:03.280> just<00:04:03.670> fill<00:04:04.360> it<00:04:04.450> up<00:04:04.510> like

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
the cockpit you just fill it up like

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.360 
the cockpit you just fill it up like
that<00:04:04.900> so<00:04:05.880> yeah<00:04:06.880> it's<00:04:07.600> it's<00:04:08.530> pretty<00:04:08.769> decent<00:04:08.890> so

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
that so yeah it's it's pretty decent so

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.340 
that so yeah it's it's pretty decent so
um<00:04:09.700> so<00:04:10.769> basically<00:04:11.769> you<00:04:12.430> take<00:04:13.060> your<00:04:13.269> time<00:04:14.140> fire

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
um so basically you take your time fire

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.029 
um so basically you take your time fire
power<00:04:14.590> that<00:04:15.040> comes<00:04:15.459> with<00:04:15.610> and<00:04:16.020> since<00:04:17.020> sadly<00:04:17.859> it

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
power that comes with and since sadly it

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.009 
power that comes with and since sadly it
does<00:04:18.190> not<00:04:18.370> come<00:04:18.669> with<00:04:19.320> control<00:04:20.320> panel

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
does not come with control panel

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.430 
does not come with control panel
fine<00:04:21.319> I<00:04:21.560> mean<00:04:21.739> it's<00:04:22.520> still<00:04:22.580> okay<00:04:23.020> you<00:04:24.020> can<00:04:24.199> set

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
fine I mean it's still okay you can set

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.610 
fine I mean it's still okay you can set
the<00:04:25.270> ants<00:04:26.270> page<00:04:26.479> up<00:04:26.690> or<00:04:26.840> if<00:04:26.960> you<00:04:27.080> leave<00:04:27.229> it<00:04:27.410> like

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
the ants page up or if you leave it like

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.950 
the ants page up or if you leave it like
that<00:04:27.650> while<00:04:28.069> happened<00:04:28.580> for<00:04:29.569> them<00:04:29.720> like<00:04:29.900> that

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
that while happened for them like that

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.140 
that while happened for them like that
the<00:04:30.289> guys<00:04:30.470> in<00:04:30.710> there<00:04:30.919> and<00:04:31.509> go<00:04:32.509> spot<00:04:32.840> Cochrane

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
the guys in there and go spot Cochrane

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.850 
the guys in there and go spot Cochrane
so<00:04:35.150> I<00:04:35.180> mean<00:04:35.509> it's<00:04:35.750> you<00:04:36.530> know<00:04:36.560> pretty

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
so I mean it's you know pretty

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.320 
so I mean it's you know pretty
straightforward<00:04:37.580> what<00:04:38.509> it<00:04:38.629> is<00:04:39.250> cockpit<00:04:40.330> and

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
straightforward what it is cockpit and

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.570 
straightforward what it is cockpit and
so<00:04:41.569> now<00:04:41.690> this<00:04:41.990> is<00:04:42.259> probably<00:04:43.190> the<00:04:43.370> best

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
so now this is probably the best

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.850 
so now this is probably the best
features<00:04:44.030> a<00:04:44.060> spinning<00:04:44.780> feature<00:04:44.990> it<00:04:45.440> spins

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
features a spinning feature it spins

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.760 
features a spinning feature it spins
like<00:04:48.860> that<00:04:49.099> and<00:04:49.419> this<00:04:50.419> does<00:04:50.690> happen<00:04:51.289> in

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
like that and this does happen in

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.089 
like that and this does happen in
battlefront<00:04:52.610> two<00:04:52.879> guys<00:04:53.590> so<00:04:54.590> I<00:04:54.650> don't<00:04:54.860> think

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:55.099 
battlefront two guys so I don't think

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:57.760 
battlefront two guys so I don't think
it's<00:04:55.280> like<00:04:55.550> Amanda<00:04:56.270> it<00:04:56.900> doesn't<00:04:57.229> it<00:04:57.530> doesn't

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
it's like Amanda it doesn't it doesn't

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.610 
it's like Amanda it doesn't it doesn't
happen<00:04:58.159> like<00:04:58.310> that<00:04:58.509> like<00:04:59.509> this<00:04:59.539> so<00:05:00.349> I'll<00:05:00.590> just

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
happen like that like this so I'll just

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.330 
happen like that like this so I'll just
say<00:05:00.860> you<00:05:01.009> a<00:05:01.389> better<00:05:02.389> view<00:05:02.509> of<00:05:02.780> it<00:05:03.099> come<00:05:04.099> over

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
say you a better view of it come over

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.100 
say you a better view of it come over
here<00:05:04.370> and<00:05:04.639> show<00:05:04.849> you<00:05:04.909> guys<00:05:07.599> they<00:05:08.599> take<00:05:08.870> you<00:05:09.020> in

the middle and you take it any spin it

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:14.290 
the middle and you take it any spin it
you<00:05:12.949> can<00:05:13.130> do<00:05:13.250> a<00:05:13.280> while<00:05:13.490> going<00:05:13.729> forward

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
you can do a while going forward

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:21.369 
you can do a while going forward
backward<00:05:18.370> sorry<00:05:19.370> about<00:05:19.729> that<00:05:19.759> guys<00:05:20.150> and<00:05:20.960> you

can spend it you know forward backwards

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:29.620 
can spend it you know forward backwards
a<00:05:24.680> bit<00:05:25.340> and<00:05:25.699> side<00:05:26.630> side<00:05:27.880> rossman<00:05:28.880> and<00:05:29.180> if<00:05:29.479> you

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
a bit and side side rossman and if you

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.110 
a bit and side side rossman and if you
do<00:05:29.750> it<00:05:29.930> at<00:05:30.139> very<00:05:30.830> high<00:05:30.949> speeds<00:05:31.430> as<00:05:31.580> I<00:05:31.699> saw<00:05:31.909> which

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
do it at very high speeds as I saw which

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.760 
do it at very high speeds as I saw which
I<00:05:32.240> wasn't<00:05:32.449> doing<00:05:32.659> at<00:05:32.870> high<00:05:33.020> speed<00:05:33.380> slipped<00:05:33.650> on

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
I wasn't doing at high speed slipped on

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.430 
I wasn't doing at high speed slipped on
the<00:05:33.889> white<00:05:34.069> broke<00:05:34.430> but<00:05:35.360> it<00:05:35.630> breaks<00:05:35.870> the<00:05:36.259> wing

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
the white broke but it breaks the wing

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.279 
the white broke but it breaks the wing
completely<00:05:37.039> breaks<00:05:37.430> off<00:05:37.729> and<00:05:37.969> it<00:05:38.630> flies<00:05:38.840> and

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:39.289 
completely breaks off and it flies and

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:44.680 
completely breaks off and it flies and
breaks<00:05:40.659> you<00:05:41.659> don't<00:05:41.840> want<00:05:42.020> to<00:05:43.360> do<00:05:44.360> that<00:05:44.389> sir

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
breaks you don't want to do that sir

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.749 
breaks you don't want to do that sir
spin<00:05:44.960> it<00:05:45.080> gently<00:05:45.380> I<00:05:45.620> mean<00:05:45.889> the<00:05:46.340> highest<00:05:46.669> you

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:46.759 
spin it gently I mean the highest you

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:50.350 
spin it gently I mean the highest you
could<00:05:46.940> probably<00:05:47.120> spend<00:05:47.479> it<00:05:47.599> with<00:05:47.779> that<00:05:49.360> which

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
could probably spend it with that which

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.689 
could probably spend it with that which
is<00:05:50.449> pretty<00:05:50.599> good<00:05:50.810> it's<00:05:50.930> okay<00:05:51.460> this<00:05:52.460> does

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:52.699 
is pretty good it's okay this does
