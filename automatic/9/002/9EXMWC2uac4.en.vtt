so to avoid confusion we want to pull

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.380 
so to avoid confusion we want to pull
those<00:01:08.130> out<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:08.490> we<00:01:08.820> can<00:01:08.970> see<00:01:09.210> those

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
those out so we can see those

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.719 
those out so we can see those
individually<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.470> have<00:01:10.830> some<00:01:11.130> numbers<00:01:11.490> and

individually and have some numbers and

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.580 
individually and have some numbers and
units<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.270> work<00:01:12.420> with<00:01:12.659> without<00:01:13.110> all<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.560> extra

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.830 
units to work with without all the extra
words<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.670> let's<00:01:14.850> write<00:01:15.000> down<00:01:15.030> our<00:01:15.210> known<00:01:15.570> and

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
words so let's write down our known and

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.530 
words so let's write down our known and
our<00:01:15.900> unknown<00:01:16.320> information<00:01:17.130> we<00:01:18.000> are<00:01:18.119> trying<00:01:18.450> to

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
our unknown information we are trying to

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.320 
our unknown information we are trying to
find<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.439> MC<00:01:19.950> RT<00:01:20.369> they<00:01:20.670> want<00:01:20.909> us<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.030> calculate

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
find the MC RT they want us to calculate

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.140 
find the MC RT they want us to calculate
the<00:01:21.750> mean<00:01:22.200> cell<00:01:22.500> residence<00:01:23.040> time<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:23.880> we<00:01:23.970> write

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
the mean cell residence time so we write

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.830 
the mean cell residence time so we write
that<00:01:24.180> down

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
that down

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.999 
that down
now<00:01:24.960> MC<00:01:25.409> RT<00:01:25.770> has<00:01:26.009> unit<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.610> days<00:01:27.740> next<00:01:28.740> they

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
now MC RT has unit of days next they

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.980 
now MC RT has unit of days next they
tell<00:01:29.220> us<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.610> plant<00:01:29.880> flow<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.450> three<00:01:30.720> point

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
tell us that plant flow is three point

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.649 
tell us that plant flow is three point
two<00:01:31.229> five<00:01:31.500> million<00:01:31.979> gallons<00:01:32.520> per<00:01:32.729> day<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.570> we

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
two five million gallons per day so we

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.929 
two five million gallons per day so we
write<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:34.110> down<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:35.040> then<00:01:35.520> they<00:01:35.640> give<00:01:35.820> us

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
write that down and then they give us

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.270 
write that down and then they give us
the<00:01:36.119> concentration<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:37.079> solids<00:01:37.530> leaving<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
the concentration of solids leaving the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.020 
the concentration of solids leaving the
plant<00:01:38.750> 21<00:01:39.750> point<00:01:40.079> two<00:01:40.490> milligrams<00:01:41.490> per<00:01:41.790> liter

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
plant 21 point two milligrams per liter

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.929 
plant 21 point two milligrams per liter
so<00:01:42.630> we<00:01:42.720> write<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:42.930> down<00:01:43.430> then<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.579> problem

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
so we write that down then the problem

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.450 
so we write that down then the problem
tells<00:01:45.210> us<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.810> we're<00:01:46.049> wasting<00:01:46.799> we're

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
tells us that we're wasting we're

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.749 
tells us that we're wasting we're
wasting<00:01:48.090> our<00:01:48.360> sludge<00:01:49.049> at<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.439> rate<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.770> point

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
wasting our sludge at a rate of point

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.170 
wasting our sludge at a rate of point
zero<00:01:51.270> five<00:01:51.720> five<00:01:52.079> zero<00:01:52.490> million<00:01:53.490> gallons<00:01:53.939> per

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
zero five five zero million gallons per

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.039 
zero five five zero million gallons per
day<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:54.780> that's<00:01:54.899> our<00:01:55.200> waz<00:01:55.530> flow<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.840> they<00:01:57.840> tell

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
day so that's our waz flow and they tell

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.810 
day so that's our waz flow and they tell
us<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.500> concentration<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.490> our<00:01:59.579> waste

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
us that the concentration of our waste

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.749 
us that the concentration of our waste
activated<00:02:00.570> sludge<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:01.259> seven<00:02:02.070> thousand<00:02:02.579> nine

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
activated sludge is seven thousand nine

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.880 
activated sludge is seven thousand nine
hundred<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.149> eighty<00:02:03.420> milligrams<00:02:04.200> per<00:02:04.680> liter

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
hundred and eighty milligrams per liter

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.200 
hundred and eighty milligrams per liter
so<00:02:05.640> we<00:02:05.790> write<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.180> down

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
so we write that down

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.139 
so we write that down
we<00:02:07.780> see<00:02:08.020> that<00:02:08.170> the<00:02:08.320> aeration<00:02:08.740> Basin<00:02:09.520> volume<00:02:09.970> is

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
we see that the aeration Basin volume is

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.550 
we see that the aeration Basin volume is
1<00:02:10.479> million<00:02:10.929> gallons<00:02:11.250> write<00:02:12.250> that<00:02:12.460> down<00:02:12.730> and

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
1 million gallons write that down and

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.980 
1 million gallons write that down and
then<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.800> aeration<00:02:15.400> Basin<00:02:15.970> carries<00:02:16.330> solids

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
then the aeration Basin carries solids

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.290 
then the aeration Basin carries solids
or<00:02:17.140> mixed<00:02:17.440> liquor<00:02:17.650> suspended<00:02:18.310> solids<00:02:18.760> at<00:02:18.910> two

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
or mixed liquor suspended solids at two

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.110 
or mixed liquor suspended solids at two
thousand<00:02:19.960> and<00:02:20.080> fifty<00:02:20.680> milligrams<00:02:21.370> per<00:02:21.880> liter

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
thousand and fifty milligrams per liter

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.010 
thousand and fifty milligrams per liter
so<00:02:22.870> we<00:02:22.990> write<00:02:23.200> that<00:02:23.230> down<00:02:23.650> and<00:02:24.600> then<00:02:25.600> we<00:02:25.780> see

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
so we write that down and then we see

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.870 
so we write that down and then we see
that<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.440> secondary<00:02:26.980> clarifier<00:02:27.520> has<00:02:27.760> an

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
that the secondary clarifier has an

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:35.780 
that the secondary clarifier has an
operation<00:02:28.420> of<00:02:28.540> volume<00:02:28.870> of<00:02:29.110> 0.25<00:02:29.890> zero

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:44.070 

millimeters<00:02:40.830> equals<00:02:41.830> our<00:02:42.480> aeration<00:02:43.480> Basin

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
millimeters equals our aeration Basin

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.340 
millimeters equals our aeration Basin
volume<00:02:45.040> and<00:02:45.220> million<00:02:45.520> gallons<00:02:45.970> added<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:47.020> our

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
volume and million gallons added to our

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.770 
volume and million gallons added to our
final<00:02:48.040> clarifier<00:02:48.670> volume<00:02:49.180> in<00:02:49.330> million

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
final clarifier volume in million

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.350 
final clarifier volume in million
gallons<00:02:50.260> and<00:02:50.500> then<00:02:51.100> we'll<00:02:51.280> multiply<00:02:51.459> that<00:02:52.090> by

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
gallons and then we'll multiply that by

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.780 
gallons and then we'll multiply that by
our<00:02:52.600> mixed<00:02:53.050> liquor<00:02:53.260> suspended<00:02:53.890> solids<00:02:54.340> times

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
our mixed liquor suspended solids times

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.150 
our mixed liquor suspended solids times
8.3<00:02:55.600> and<00:02:55.840> that<00:02:56.500> will<00:02:56.940> give<00:02:57.940> us<00:02:58.150> our<00:02:58.300> total

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
8.3 and that will give us our total

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.970 
8.3 and that will give us our total
pounds<00:03:00.390> that's<00:03:01.390> carried<00:03:01.989> in<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.440> secondary

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
pounds that's carried in the secondary

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.680 
pounds that's carried in the secondary
so<00:03:03.250> we're<00:03:03.370> going<00:03:03.459> to<00:03:03.520> combine<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:04.120> volume<00:03:04.510> of

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
so we're going to combine the volume of

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.270 
so we're going to combine the volume of
our<00:03:04.780> aeration<00:03:05.350> Basin<00:03:05.739> and<00:03:05.860> the<00:03:05.920> final

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
our aeration Basin and the final

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.640 
our aeration Basin and the final
clarifier<00:03:06.850> and<00:03:07.090> then<00:03:07.660> multiply<00:03:08.200> that<00:03:08.230> by<00:03:08.470> our

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
clarifier and then multiply that by our

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.070 
clarifier and then multiply that by our
mixed<00:03:09.040> liquor<00:03:09.220> suspended<00:03:09.820> solids<00:03:10.180> times<00:03:10.420> 8.3

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
mixed liquor suspended solids times 8.3

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.699 
mixed liquor suspended solids times 8.3
4<00:03:11.350> that's<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.680> top<00:03:12.010> term<00:03:12.370> on<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:13.810> bottom<00:03:14.230> we

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
4 that's the top term on the bottom we

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.100 
4 that's the top term on the bottom we
need<00:03:14.860> to<00:03:14.950> calculate<00:03:15.190> pounds<00:03:16.030> per<00:03:16.269> day<00:03:16.450> leaving

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
need to calculate pounds per day leaving

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.000 
need to calculate pounds per day leaving
the<00:03:17.410> system

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
the system

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.060 
the system
well<00:03:18.400> we're<00:03:18.580> losing<00:03:19.090> solids<00:03:19.660> in<00:03:19.840> two<00:03:20.049> ways<00:03:20.290> one

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
well we're losing solids in two ways one

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.800 
well we're losing solids in two ways one
way<00:03:21.130> is<00:03:21.340> we're<00:03:21.730> wasting<00:03:22.269> it<00:03:22.420> through<00:03:22.720> our

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
way is we're wasting it through our

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.810 
way is we're wasting it through our
waste<00:03:23.049> activated<00:03:23.709> sludge<00:03:23.950> so<00:03:24.640> we'll

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
waste activated sludge so we'll

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.750 
waste activated sludge so we'll
calculate<00:03:25.030> pounds<00:03:25.870> per<00:03:26.080> day<00:03:26.290> of<00:03:26.519> wasting<00:03:27.519> and

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
calculate pounds per day of wasting and

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.720 
calculate pounds per day of wasting and
then<00:03:28.360> we're<00:03:28.510> also<00:03:28.720> losing<00:03:29.170> solids<00:03:30.100> over<00:03:30.280> our

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
then we're also losing solids over our

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.530 
then we're also losing solids over our
final<00:03:31.299> effluent<00:03:31.780> we're<00:03:32.049> that's<00:03:32.709> that<00:03:33.540> 21.2

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
final effluent we're that's that 21.2

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.420 
final effluent we're that's that 21.2
milligrams<00:03:34.989> per<00:03:35.290> liter<00:03:35.500> so<00:03:36.130> we're<00:03:36.310> losing

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
milligrams per liter so we're losing

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.400 
milligrams per liter so we're losing
some<00:03:36.850> of<00:03:36.880> our<00:03:37.090> solids<00:03:37.510> due<00:03:37.660> to<00:03:37.780> wasting<00:03:38.230> and

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
some of our solids due to wasting and

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.789 
some of our solids due to wasting and
some<00:03:39.220> of<00:03:39.340> our<00:03:39.459> solids<00:03:39.940> over<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.930> final<00:03:41.350> weir

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
some of our solids over the final weir

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.620 
some of our solids over the final weir
so<00:03:41.920> we<00:03:42.040> need<00:03:42.160> to<00:03:42.280> find<00:03:42.519> our<00:03:42.640> pounds<00:03:43.060> per<00:03:43.269> day<00:03:43.420> of

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
so we need to find our pounds per day of

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.050 
so we need to find our pounds per day of
each<00:03:43.989> and<00:03:44.260> add<00:03:44.650> those<00:03:44.950> together<00:03:45.250> and<00:03:45.790> that

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
each and add those together and that

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.150 
each and add those together and that
becomes<00:03:46.510> our<00:03:46.660> bottom<00:03:47.019> term<00:03:47.290> well<00:03:47.920> as<00:03:48.010> you

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
becomes our bottom term well as you

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.420 
becomes our bottom term well as you
remember<00:03:48.700> from<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:49.090> pounds<00:03:49.450> formula

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
remember from the pounds formula

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.330 
remember from the pounds formula
question<00:03:51.430> our<00:03:51.690> pounds<00:03:52.690> per<00:03:52.900> day<00:03:53.110> equals<00:03:54.010> are

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
question our pounds per day equals are

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.259 
question our pounds per day equals are
flowing<00:03:55.120> in<00:03:55.239> Gd<00:03:55.680> times<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:57.190> concentration<00:03:58.120> in

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
flowing in Gd times the concentration in

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.979 
flowing in Gd times the concentration in
milligrams<00:03:58.959> per<00:03:59.260> liter<00:03:59.500> times<00:04:00.280> 8.3<00:04:01.209> for<00:04:01.570> so

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
milligrams per liter times 8.3 for so

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:03.420 
milligrams per liter times 8.3 for so
I'm<00:04:02.079> going<00:04:02.230> to<00:04:02.290> put<00:04:02.500> that<00:04:02.650> on<00:04:02.769> the<00:04:02.890> bottom<00:04:03.070> here

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
I'm going to put that on the bottom here

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.360 
I'm going to put that on the bottom here
for<00:04:03.640> each<00:04:03.850> for<00:04:04.180> our<00:04:04.239> wasting<00:04:04.810> and<00:04:05.280> for<00:04:06.280> the

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
for each for our wasting and for the

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.449 
for each for our wasting and for the
solids<00:04:06.760> leaving<00:04:07.180> in<00:04:07.780> the<00:04:07.959> plant<00:04:08.200> effluent<00:04:08.560> so

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
solids leaving in the plant effluent so

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.910 
solids leaving in the plant effluent so
when<00:04:09.610> we<00:04:09.760> plug<00:04:10.000> all<00:04:10.150> these<00:04:10.329> numbers<00:04:10.720> in<00:04:10.930> on<00:04:11.110> top

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
when we plug all these numbers in on top

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.460 
when we plug all these numbers in on top
we<00:04:12.549> have<00:04:12.579> our<00:04:12.820> 1<00:04:13.209> million<00:04:13.630> gallons<00:04:14.049> in<00:04:14.230> the

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
we have our 1 million gallons in the

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.699 
we have our 1 million gallons in the
aeration<00:04:14.769> Basin<00:04:15.430> added<00:04:16.389> to<00:04:16.660> the<00:04:17.200> point<00:04:17.500> two

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
aeration Basin added to the point two

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.400 
aeration Basin added to the point two
five<00:04:17.980> million<00:04:18.400> gallons<00:04:19.000> in<00:04:19.209> the

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
five million gallons in the

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.860 
five million gallons in the
Andheri<00:04:20.680> clarifier<00:04:21.330> so<00:04:22.330> those<00:04:22.510> are<00:04:22.630> the<00:04:22.720> two

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
Andheri clarifier so those are the two

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.810 
Andheri clarifier so those are the two
volumes<00:04:23.230> we<00:04:23.380> add<00:04:23.560> together<00:04:23.740> and<00:04:24.190> then<00:04:24.700> we

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
volumes we add together and then we
