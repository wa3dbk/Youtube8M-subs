00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
3d simulation of what it's going to look

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.660 
3d simulation of what it's going to look
like<00:00:38.460> when<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.450> gets<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.930> print<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.370> here<00:00:41.550> we<00:00:41.579> go

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
like when it gets to print so here we go

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.180 
like when it gets to print so here we go
I've<00:00:42.000> got<00:00:42.300> one<00:00:42.570> up<00:00:42.899> on<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.230> screen<00:00:43.440> what<00:00:44.100> I've

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
I've got one up on the screen what I've

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.000 
I've got one up on the screen what I've
got<00:00:44.219> here<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.739> brochure<00:00:46.739> that's<00:00:46.890> been

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
got here is a brochure that's been

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.540 
got here is a brochure that's been
converted<00:00:47.219> via<00:00:47.789> real<00:00:48.690> view<00:00:48.960> 3d<00:00:49.309> into<00:00:50.309> this

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
converted via real view 3d into this

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.700 
converted via real view 3d into this
simulation<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:51.570> as<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.809> see<00:00:51.989> can<00:00:52.350> flip<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
simulation so as you see can flip the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
pages now Paige turning software really

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.580 
pages now Paige turning software really
isn't<00:00:57.239> anything<00:00:57.449> new<00:00:57.600> but<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.379> something

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
isn't anything new but this is something

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.170 
isn't anything new but this is something
quite<00:00:58.920> fundamentally<00:00:59.640> different<00:00:59.969> in<00:01:00.120> that

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
quite fundamentally different in that

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.130 
quite fundamentally different in that
you<00:01:00.899> can<00:01:01.170> spin<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:03.480> case<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.750> brochure

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
you can spin the in this case a brochure

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.560 
you can spin the in this case a brochure
around<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.650> see<00:01:05.400> what<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.760> actually<00:01:05.909> going<00:01:06.390> to

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
around and see what is actually going to

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.190 
around and see what is actually going to
look<00:01:06.780> like<00:01:07.280> once<00:01:08.280> it's<00:01:08.640> printed<00:01:08.880> now<00:01:09.869> there's

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
look like once it's printed now there's

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.750 
look like once it's printed now there's
various<00:01:10.590> different<00:01:10.920> crop<00:01:11.100> controls<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.700> I

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
various different crop controls that I

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.960 
various different crop controls that I
can<00:01:12.030> show<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.110> moment<00:01:13.970> including

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
can show you in a moment including

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.969 
can show you in a moment including
thicknesses<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.479> paper<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.170> can<00:01:16.350> add<00:01:16.470> varnish

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
thicknesses of paper you can add varnish

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.940 
thicknesses of paper you can add varnish
you<00:01:17.250> can<00:01:17.430> get<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.939> manage<00:01:18.950> double-page

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
you can get it to manage double-page

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.420 
you can get it to manage double-page
spreads<00:01:20.720> but<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.780> point<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:22.920> software

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
spreads but the point is this software

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.830 
spreads but the point is this software
really<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.150> designed<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.930> allow<00:01:25.850> people<00:01:26.850> to

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
really is designed to allow people to

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.190 
really is designed to allow people to
present<00:01:28.619> their<00:01:28.770> concepts<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.689> see<00:01:30.689> what<00:01:30.960> that

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
present their concepts and see what that

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.319 
present their concepts and see what that
publication<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:32.310> publication<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:33.119> going<00:01:33.270> to

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
publication that publication is going to

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.859 
publication that publication is going to
look<00:01:33.450> like<00:01:33.479> before<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.110> commit<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.909> print<00:01:35.909> and

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
look like before you commit to print and

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.289 
look like before you commit to print and
also<00:01:37.229> doing<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.280> virtual<00:01:38.850> world<00:01:38.880> like

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
also doing it in a virtual world like

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.319 
also doing it in a virtual world like
this<00:01:39.590> means<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.770> it's<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.070> lot<00:01:41.220> cheaper<00:01:41.520> and

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
this means is it's a lot cheaper and

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.660 
this means is it's a lot cheaper and
easier<00:01:42.570> rather<00:01:43.200> than<00:01:43.560> trying<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.070> enjoy<00:01:44.460> and

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
easier rather than trying to enjoy and

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.230 
easier rather than trying to enjoy and
mock<00:01:45.090> up<00:01:45.360> your<00:01:46.070> publication<00:01:47.070> right<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.090> now

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
mock up your publication right so now

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.090 
mock up your publication right so now
let's<00:01:48.450> go<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.659> have<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> look<00:01:48.869> at<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.170> few

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
let's go and have a look at a few

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.990 
let's go and have a look at a few
different<00:01:50.369> types<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.420> publications<00:01:52.640> so<00:01:53.640> for

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
different types of publications so for

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.580 
different types of publications so for
example<00:01:54.030> let's<00:01:54.540> have<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.899> look<00:01:55.049> at<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.229> book

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590

I've actually got this this book it's a
travel<00:01:59.670> photography<00:02:00.210> book<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:01.070> you<00:02:02.070> can<00:02:02.100> see

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
travel photography book and you can see

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.030 
travel photography book and you can see
that<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.509> it's<00:02:04.170> got<00:02:04.320> various<00:02:04.619> different

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
that the it's got various different

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.139 
that the it's got various different
beautiful<00:02:05.790> photographs<00:02:06.570> inside<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:08.149> what

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
beautiful photographs inside and what

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.969 
beautiful photographs inside and what
we've<00:02:09.270> done<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.569> we've<00:02:09.720> taken<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.050> PDF<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.739> we

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
we've done is we've taken the PDF and we

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.090 
we've done is we've taken the PDF and we
run<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.340> through

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
run it through

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.440 
run it through
