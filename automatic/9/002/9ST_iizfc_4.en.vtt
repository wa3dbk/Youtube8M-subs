00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:47.839 
it's a lot of camera time we're at 50

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.979 
it's a lot of camera time we're at 50
BPM<00:00:48.620> or<00:00:48.859> beats<00:00:49.100> per<00:00:49.370> minute<00:00:49.809> we're<00:00:50.809> going<00:00:50.929> to

play all of the roles based on sixteenth

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.970 
play all of the roles based on sixteenth
notes<00:00:54.370> one<00:00:55.370> E<00:00:55.609> and<00:00:55.640> two<00:00:56.329> E<00:00:56.570> and<00:00:56.809> three<00:00:57.440> E<00:00:57.739> and

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
notes one E and two E and three E and

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.239 
notes one E and two E and three E and
four<00:00:58.699> E<00:00:58.999> and<00:00:59.179> I<00:00:59.780> okay<00:01:00.649> this<00:01:00.800> is<00:01:00.949> the<00:01:01.070> roll

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:01.249 
four E and I okay this is the roll

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:04.000 
four E and I okay this is the roll
sequence<00:01:01.760> all<00:01:02.449> the<00:01:02.719> rolls<00:01:02.929> very<00:01:03.440> simply<00:01:03.890> are

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
sequence all the rolls very simply are

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.230 
sequence all the rolls very simply are
going<00:01:04.159> to<00:01:04.220> be<00:01:04.309> played<00:01:05.110> right<00:01:06.110> right<00:01:06.440> left<00:01:06.740> left

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
going to be played right right left left

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.920 
going to be played right right left left
until<00:01:08.240> you<00:01:08.329> get<00:01:08.509> there

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
until you get there

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.380 
until you get there
so<00:01:09.409> the<00:01:09.530> roll<00:01:09.740> sequence<00:01:10.399> as<00:01:10.670> I<00:01:10.820> call<00:01:11.060> it<00:01:11.090> is

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
so the roll sequence as I call it is

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.200 
so the roll sequence as I call it is
just<00:01:11.600> a<00:01:11.780> repetitious<00:01:12.530> right<00:01:13.460> right<00:01:13.729> left<00:01:14.060> left

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
just a repetitious right right left left

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.330 
just a repetitious right right left left
right<00:01:14.479> right<00:01:14.630> left<00:01:15.200> left<00:01:15.350> right<00:01:15.619> right<00:01:15.770> left

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
right right left left right right left

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.880 
right right left left right right left
left<00:01:16.490> right<00:01:16.820> right<00:01:16.970> left<00:01:17.240> left<00:01:17.659> until<00:01:18.619> we<00:01:18.770> get

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
left right right left left until we get

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.249 
left right right left left until we get
there<00:01:19.189> the<00:01:19.939> first<00:01:20.210> we<00:01:20.360> roll<00:01:20.540> the<00:01:20.689> most<00:01:20.869> common

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
there the first we roll the most common

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:26.200 
there the first we roll the most common
is<00:01:21.409> the<00:01:21.439> long<00:01:21.829> roll<00:01:22.250> one<00:01:22.909> two<00:01:24.340> ready<00:01:25.340> and<00:01:25.820> the

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
addressing the drum it's about waist

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.160 
addressing the drum it's about waist
high<00:01:37.149> and<00:01:37.420> that's<00:01:37.539> how<00:01:37.659> you<00:01:37.719> want<00:01:37.929> to<00:01:37.960> practice

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
high and that's how you want to practice

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.809 
high and that's how you want to practice
this<00:01:38.500> and<00:01:38.679> if<00:01:38.770> you're<00:01:38.890> practicing<00:01:39.460> in<00:01:39.579> front

00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:39.819 
this and if you're practicing in front

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:41.389 
this and if you're practicing in front
of<00:01:39.909> a<00:01:39.969> mirror<00:01:40.210> that's<00:01:40.509> the<00:01:40.689> best<00:01:40.990> way

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
of a mirror that's the best way

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:44.130 
of a mirror that's the best way
practicing<00:01:42.399> on<00:01:42.520> a<00:01:42.609> pillow<00:01:42.969> a<00:01:43.119> non<00:01:43.509> bouncing

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
practicing on a pillow a non bouncing

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.800 
practicing on a pillow a non bouncing
surface<00:01:44.560> is<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.429> best<00:01:45.640> way<00:01:45.850> because<00:01:46.659> we're

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
surface is the best way because we're

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.690 
surface is the best way because we're
going<00:01:46.899> to<00:01:46.959> develop<00:01:47.229> every<00:01:47.709> aspect<00:01:48.219> of<00:01:48.399> our

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
going to develop every aspect of our

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.559 
going to develop every aspect of our
range<00:01:49.000> of<00:01:49.360> motion<00:01:49.899> the<00:01:50.530> way<00:01:50.560> our<00:01:50.799> wrist<00:01:51.100> works

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:51.569 
range of motion the way our wrist works

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:54.719 
range of motion the way our wrist works
okay<00:01:52.569> nice<00:01:53.140> low<00:01:53.439> range<00:01:53.740> of<00:01:53.890> motion<00:01:54.219> about<00:01:54.429> five

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
okay nice low range of motion about five

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.279 
okay nice low range of motion about five
inches<00:01:55.179> off<00:01:55.450> the<00:01:55.479> drum<00:01:55.869> or<00:01:56.289> the<00:01:56.319> surface<00:01:58.289> still

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
inches off the drum or the surface still

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:00.419 
inches off the drum or the surface still
at<00:01:59.439> 50<00:01:59.770> we're<00:01:59.950> going<00:02:00.069> to<00:02:00.130> go<00:02:00.189> through<00:02:00.399> all

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
at 50 we're going to go through all

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:02.639 
at 50 we're going to go through all
these<00:02:00.700> and<00:02:00.759> won't<00:02:01.030> take<00:02:01.209> but<00:02:01.329> a<00:02:01.390> moment<00:02:01.569> I<00:02:01.959> want

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
these and won't take but a moment I want

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.050 
these and won't take but a moment I want
you<00:02:02.679> to<00:02:02.799> think<00:02:03.009> about<00:02:03.099> also<00:02:03.640> the<00:02:03.819> single

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
you to think about also the single

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.449 
you to think about also the single
stroke<00:02:04.420> roll<00:02:04.599> it's<00:02:05.079> worth<00:02:05.289> noting<00:02:05.739> that<00:02:05.770> the

00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:06.459 
stroke roll it's worth noting that the
