00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.480 
this video is going out to 910 Wesley
and<00:00:05.549> it's<00:00:05.819> about<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.690> afterburn<00:00:07.470> I'm<00:00:07.770> sure

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
and it's about the afterburn I'm sure

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.780 
and it's about the afterburn I'm sure
we've<00:00:08.670> all<00:00:08.700> heard<00:00:09.360> lots<00:00:09.900> of<00:00:10.170> misinformation

we've all heard lots of misinformation

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.610 
we've all heard lots of misinformation
about<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:12.059> afterburn<00:00:12.809> effects<00:00:13.139> of<00:00:13.320> exercise

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
about the afterburn effects of exercise

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.430 
about the afterburn effects of exercise
like<00:00:14.610> most<00:00:14.880> concepts<00:00:15.450> around<00:00:15.630> weight<00:00:16.199> loss

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
like most concepts around weight loss

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.200 
like most concepts around weight loss
and<00:00:16.470> bodybuilding<00:00:17.279> it's<00:00:17.490> blown<00:00:17.760> way<00:00:18.090> out<00:00:18.119> of

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
and bodybuilding it's blown way out of

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.390 
and bodybuilding it's blown way out of
proportion<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:19.020> it's<00:00:19.380> not<00:00:19.560> understood<00:00:20.160> very

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
proportion and it's not understood very

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.730 
proportion and it's not understood very
well<00:00:20.689> we've<00:00:21.689> all<00:00:21.900> heard<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.320> when<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.619> do

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
well we've all heard that when you do

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.470 
well we've all heard that when you do
exercise<00:00:23.250> in<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.550> morning<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:23.970> elevates<00:00:24.330> the

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
exercise in the morning it elevates the

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.320 
exercise in the morning it elevates the
metabolism<00:00:24.990> all<00:00:25.439> day<00:00:26.010> long<00:00:26.279> that's<00:00:27.090> such

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
metabolism all day long that's such

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.410 
metabolism all day long that's such
 I<00:00:28.080> can't<00:00:28.349> even<00:00:28.410> begin<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.800> tell<00:00:29.039> you

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
 I can't even begin to tell you

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.810 
 I can't even begin to tell you
when<00:00:30.420> you<00:00:30.599> do<00:00:30.810> cardio<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:32.160> do<00:00:32.369> cardio

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
when you do cardio and you do cardio

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.630 
when you do cardio and you do cardio
that's<00:00:33.120> relatively<00:00:33.899> intense<00:00:34.530> there<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.460> a

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
that's relatively intense there is a

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.510 
that's relatively intense there is a
short<00:00:36.270> period<00:00:36.719> afterwards<00:00:37.680> where<00:00:38.340> your

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
short period afterwards where your

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.049 
short period afterwards where your
metabolism<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.540> elevated<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.320> little<00:00:40.530> bit<00:00:41.250> you

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
metabolism is elevated a little bit you

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.420 
metabolism is elevated a little bit you
typically<00:00:42.629> will<00:00:42.750> notice<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.320> when<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:44.100> come

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
typically will notice this when you come

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.940 
typically will notice this when you come
inside<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.360> try<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.840> cool<00:00:46.230> off<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.710> you

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
inside and you try to cool off and you

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.910 
inside and you try to cool off and you
can't<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.460> can't<00:00:47.760> cool<00:00:48.210> down<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:49.200> still<00:00:49.590> seem

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
can't you can't cool down you still seem

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.470 
can't you can't cool down you still seem
to<00:00:49.950> be<00:00:50.070> hot<00:00:50.370> you're<00:00:50.579> like<00:00:50.730> man<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:51.030> can<00:00:51.149> go<00:00:51.270> jump

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
to be hot you're like man I can go jump

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.139 
to be hot you're like man I can go jump
in<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.629> shower<00:00:51.840> but<00:00:52.379> I'm<00:00:52.500> still<00:00:52.739> sweating

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
in the shower but I'm still sweating

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.990 
in the shower but I'm still sweating
that<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.570> typically<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.469> afterburn<00:00:56.399> period

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
that is typically the afterburn period

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.500 
that is typically the afterburn period
it<00:00:57.270> doesn't<00:00:57.809> last<00:00:57.960> all<00:00:58.260> day<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:59.160> might<00:00:59.670> last<00:00:59.940> 10

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
it doesn't last all day it might last 10

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.200 
it doesn't last all day it might last 10
to<00:01:00.899> 15<00:01:01.379> minutes<00:01:01.590> after<00:01:02.550> your<00:01:02.730> workout

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
to 15 minutes after your workout

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.270 
to 15 minutes after your workout
depending<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.809> how<00:01:03.960> big<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.470> are<00:01:04.500> how<00:01:04.890> hard

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
depending on how big you are how hard

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.950 
depending on how big you are how hard
you<00:01:05.489> worked<00:01:05.760> out<00:01:05.909> what<00:01:05.970> kind<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.420> shape<00:01:06.720> you're

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
you worked out what kind of shape you're

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.500 
you worked out what kind of shape you're
in<00:01:06.990> things<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.100> nature<00:01:08.390> during<00:01:09.390> this

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
in things of that nature during this

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.750 
in things of that nature during this
time<00:01:09.570> your<00:01:10.080> body's<00:01:10.409> helping<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.220> break<00:01:11.490> down

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
time your body's helping to break down

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.060 
time your body's helping to break down
some<00:01:12.390> additional<00:01:12.900> fats<00:01:13.229> trying<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.920> help

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
some additional fats trying to help

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.249 
some additional fats trying to help
replace<00:01:14.490> some<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.880> ATP<00:01:15.479> breaking<00:01:16.110> down

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
replace some of the ATP breaking down

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.070 
replace some of the ATP breaking down
sugars<00:01:16.740> things<00:01:17.280> like<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.759> but<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.630> does<00:01:18.869> not

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
sugars things like that but it does not

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.160 
sugars things like that but it does not
last<00:01:19.409> all<00:01:19.799> day<00:01:19.890> long<00:01:20.700> okay<00:01:21.540> that's<00:01:21.930> a

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
last all day long okay that's a

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.399 
last all day long okay that's a
misunderstanding<00:01:23.150> when<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.330> work<00:01:24.869> out<00:01:25.110> with

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
misunderstanding when you work out with

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.890 
misunderstanding when you work out with
weights<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:26.189> have<00:01:26.430> less<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:27.090> an<00:01:27.330> after<00:01:27.750> burn

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
weights you have less of an after burn

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.399 
weights you have less of an after burn
effect<00:01:28.020> because<00:01:28.680> you're<00:01:29.070> not<00:01:29.280> aerobic

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
effect because you're not aerobic

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.630 
effect because you're not aerobic
basically<00:01:31.409> you're<00:01:31.590> your<00:01:31.860> primary<00:01:32.310> source<00:01:32.520> of

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
basically you're your primary source of

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.700 
basically you're your primary source of
energy<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:33.119> creatine<00:01:33.450> phosphate<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.259> ATP

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
energy is creatine phosphate and ATP

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.069 
energy is creatine phosphate and ATP
when<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.310> exercise<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.600> don't<00:01:36.780> get<00:01:36.900> that

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
when you exercise so you don't get that

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.249 
when you exercise so you don't get that
huge<00:01:37.530> after<00:01:38.100> burn<00:01:38.280> effect<00:01:38.509> but<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.750> do<00:01:40.020> get

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
huge after burn effect but you do get

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.100 
huge after burn effect but you do get
some<00:01:40.920> residual<00:01:41.490> effects<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.630> form<00:01:42.930> of

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
some residual effects in the form of

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.620 
some residual effects in the form of
repairing<00:01:44.040> muscles<00:01:44.490> especially<00:01:44.670> if<00:01:45.450> you've

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
repairing muscles especially if you've

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.929 
repairing muscles especially if you've
worked<00:01:45.869> out<00:01:46.020> intensely<00:01:46.470> that's<00:01:47.399> why<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.610> said

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
worked out intensely that's why I said

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.270 
worked out intensely that's why I said
in<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.210> couple<00:01:48.509> videos<00:01:49.170> before<00:01:49.439> if<00:01:49.890> you

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
in a couple videos before if you

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.940 
in a couple videos before if you
exercise<00:01:50.729> with<00:01:51.210> tremendous<00:01:51.720> intensity<00:01:52.560> you

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
exercise with tremendous intensity you

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.370 
exercise with tremendous intensity you
do<00:01:53.310> utilize<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:54.090> certain<00:01:54.540> amount<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.810> calories

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
do utilize a certain amount of calories

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.429 
do utilize a certain amount of calories
helping<00:01:55.979> repair<00:01:56.790> those<00:01:57.090> muscles<00:01:57.659> but<00:01:58.320> the

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
helping repair those muscles but the

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.429 
helping repair those muscles but the
concept<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.219> having<00:01:59.670> an<00:01:59.939> elevated<00:02:00.600> metabolism

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439
