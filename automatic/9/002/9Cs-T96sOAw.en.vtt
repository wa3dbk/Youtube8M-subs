Collection over the years this watch a
vacation<00:00:30.180> the<00:00:30.390> name<00:00:30.600> is<00:00:31.439> basically<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.859> mash-up

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
vacation the name is basically a mash-up

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.130 
vacation the name is basically a mash-up
of<00:00:32.519> aviation<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.360> navigation<00:00:33.960> and

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
of aviation and navigation and

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.009 
of aviation and navigation and
essentially<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.800> throwback<00:00:35.070> to

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:36.019 
essentially this is a throwback to

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:38.360 
essentially this is a throwback to
aviators<00:00:37.019> watches<00:00:37.530> military<00:00:37.920> aviators

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
aviators watches military aviators

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.509 
aviators watches military aviators
watches<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:38.970> the<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:40.350> early<00:00:41.129> 20th<00:00:41.489> century

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:41.519 
watches of the of the early 20th century

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.560 
watches of the of the early 20th century
so<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:43.460> few<00:00:44.460> things<00:00:44.729> I<00:00:45.030> guess<00:00:45.299> the<00:00:45.390> other<00:00:45.449> thing

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
so a few things I guess the other thing

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.180 
so a few things I guess the other thing
I'll<00:00:45.690> point<00:00:45.720> out<00:00:45.930> on<00:00:46.049> the<00:00:46.140> name<00:00:46.290> the<00:00:46.409> a7<00:00:47.040> is

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
I'll point out on the name the a7 is

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.250 
I'll point out on the name the a7 is
actually<00:00:47.699> also<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:48.000> kind<00:00:48.540> of<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.750> resurrected

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
actually also a kind of a resurrected

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.520 
actually also a kind of a resurrected
term<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:50.129> goes<00:00:50.970> back<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.870> 1930s

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
term that goes back to the to the 1930s

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.979 
term that goes back to the to the 1930s
where<00:00:52.790> specific<00:00:53.790> watches<00:00:54.269> that<00:00:54.479> met<00:00:54.720> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
where specific watches that met the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.619 
where specific watches that met the
criteria<00:00:55.860> for<00:00:56.610> use<00:00:56.909> in<00:00:57.089> the<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.479> military

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
criteria for use in the in the military

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.509 
criteria for use in the in the military
that<00:00:58.080> launching<00:00:58.379> use<00:00:58.470> was<00:00:58.650> producing<00:00:59.190> we're

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
that launching use was producing we're

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:02.000 
that launching use was producing we're
given<00:00:59.790> the<00:00:59.820> a7<00:01:00.470> designation<00:01:01.470> so<00:01:01.650> that's<00:01:01.830> where

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
given the a7 designation so that's where

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.690 
given the a7 designation so that's where
that<00:01:02.070> moniker<00:01:02.460> comes<00:01:02.670> from<00:01:02.909> but<00:01:04.489> what<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.580> can

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
that moniker comes from but what you can

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.250 
that moniker comes from but what you can
see<00:01:05.729> about<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.119> watch<00:01:06.330> first<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.780> all<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.020> is

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
see about this watch first of all is is

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.060 
see about this watch first of all is is
the<00:01:07.619> dial<00:01:08.299> it's<00:01:09.299> actually<00:01:09.720> been<00:01:09.840> rotated<00:01:10.619> as

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
the dial it's actually been rotated as

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.800 
the dial it's actually been rotated as
the<00:01:11.490> Crown<00:01:11.700> has<00:01:11.970> as<00:01:12.150> well<00:01:12.330> basically<00:01:12.540> having

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
the Crown has as well basically having

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.630 
the Crown has as well basically having
kind<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:13.020> been<00:01:13.140> rotated<00:01:13.740> 50<00:01:14.040> degrees<00:01:14.370> to<00:01:14.550> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
kind of been rotated 50 degrees to the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.440 
kind of been rotated 50 degrees to the
right<00:01:15.020> and<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.710> was<00:01:16.980> that<00:01:17.730> is<00:01:17.880> basically<00:01:18.360> a

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
right and that was that is basically a

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.750 
right and that was that is basically a
nod<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:19.020> how<00:01:19.350> aviators<00:01:19.920> would<00:01:20.130> have<00:01:20.250> used<00:01:20.580> a

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
nod to how aviators would have used a

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.660 
nod to how aviators would have used a
watch<00:01:20.940> like<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.620> rather<00:01:22.620> than<00:01:22.800> wearing<00:01:23.400> it

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
watch like this rather than wearing it

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.520 
watch like this rather than wearing it
on<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.480> outside<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.110> wrist

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
on the outside of a wrist

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.800 
on the outside of a wrist
the<00:01:26.070> pilot<00:01:26.730> would<00:01:26.880> probably<00:01:27.390> be<00:01:27.480> of<00:01:27.630> been

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
the pilot would probably be of been

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.360 
the pilot would probably be of been
wearing<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.410> it<00:01:28.500> was<00:01:28.620> designed<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.010> be<00:01:29.100> worn

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
wearing and it was designed to be worn

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.220 
wearing and it was designed to be worn
on<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.520> inside<00:01:29.940> of<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.150> wrist<00:01:30.300> so<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.020> when

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
on the inside of the wrist so that when

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.630 
on the inside of the wrist so that when
their<00:01:31.350> hands<00:01:31.560> were<00:01:31.740> up<00:01:31.800> on<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.100> instruments

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
their hands were up on the instruments

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.970 
their hands were up on the instruments
instruments<00:01:33.360> they<00:01:33.480> could<00:01:33.690> see<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.560> watch<00:01:34.770> and

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
instruments they could see the watch and

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.220 
instruments they could see the watch and
read<00:01:35.160> it<00:01:35.280> at<00:01:35.760> a<00:01:35.790> glance<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.510> it's<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:37.050> very

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.230 
read it at a glance and it it's a very

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.280 
read it at a glance and it it's a very
legible<00:01:37.470> dial<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.790> case<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.210> 49<00:01:39.720> millimeters

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
legible dial the case is 49 millimeters

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.280 
legible dial the case is 49 millimeters
so<00:01:40.470> it's<00:01:40.590> very<00:01:40.770> large<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:44.750> for<00:01:45.750> standards<00:01:46.170> of

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
so it's very large and for standards of

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.660 
so it's very large and for standards of
an<00:01:46.380> aviators<00:01:46.860> watch<00:01:47.040> that's<00:01:47.340> really<00:01:47.550> not

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
an aviators watch that's really not

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.600 
an aviators watch that's really not
uncommon<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.480> I<00:01:48.720> like<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.380> long<00:01:50.370> jeans

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
uncommon and I I like that long jeans

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.640 
uncommon and I I like that long jeans
did<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.570> wanted<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.930> have<00:01:52.050> a<00:01:52.080> very<00:01:52.320> large

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
did that you wanted to have a very large

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.040 
did that you wanted to have a very large
legible<00:01:53.430> watch<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.450> can<00:01:54.600> see<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.900> has

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
legible watch and you can see it has

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.370 
legible watch and you can see it has
large<00:01:56.150> Arabic<00:01:57.150> numerals<00:01:57.570> which<00:01:58.050> are<00:01:58.200> really

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
large Arabic numerals which are really

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:05.360 
large Arabic numerals which are really
nice<00:01:58.650> and<00:02:01.970> the<00:02:02.970> coronagraph<00:02:04.220> which<00:02:05.220> is

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
nice and the coronagraph which is

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.770 
nice and the coronagraph which is
controlled<00:02:05.760> through<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:06.090> pusher<00:02:06.479> here<00:02:06.600> it's

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
controlled through this pusher here it's

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.839 
controlled through this pusher here it's
actually<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.080> mono<00:02:07.290> pusher<00:02:07.710> chronograph<00:02:08.190> so

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
actually a mono pusher chronograph so

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.770 
actually a mono pusher chronograph so
I'm<00:02:09.090> going<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.269> start<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:10.700> and<00:02:11.700> everything<00:02:12.659> is

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780

I'm going to start it and everything is
controlled<00:02:13.650> up<00:02:13.890> here<00:02:14.069> through<00:02:14.250> this<00:02:14.340> pusher

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
controlled up here through this pusher

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.760 
controlled up here through this pusher
so<00:02:15.269> start<00:02:15.739> stop<00:02:16.739> and<00:02:18.290> reset<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.319> then<00:02:19.590> also

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
so start stop and reset and then also

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.059 
so start stop and reset and then also
your<00:02:20.270> time<00:02:21.270> is<00:02:21.480> set<00:02:21.720> through<00:02:21.900> this<00:02:22.170> as<00:02:22.650> well

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
now the the normal running seconds is in

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.809 
now the the normal running seconds is in
this<00:02:27.420> sub<00:02:27.629> dial<00:02:27.870> here<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.469> then<00:02:29.280> actually

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
this sub dial here and then actually

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.280 
this sub dial here and then actually
your<00:02:29.939> date<00:02:30.180> is<00:02:30.420> controlled<00:02:30.810> through<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:31.049> little

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
your date is controlled through a little

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.679 
your date is controlled through a little
corrector<00:02:32.219> there<00:02:32.400> on<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:33.090> side<00:02:33.299> of<00:02:33.329> the<00:02:33.510> case

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:33.689 
corrector there on the side of the case

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:37.879 
corrector there on the side of the case
so<00:02:34.019> a<00:02:34.260> really<00:02:35.780> neat<00:02:36.780> dial<00:02:37.109> it's<00:02:37.409> got<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.680> tacky

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
scale it's a matte black dial and again

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.319 
scale it's a matte black dial and again
off-center<00:02:42.900> by<00:02:43.049> 50<00:02:43.379> degrees<00:02:44.150> gives<00:02:45.150> it<00:02:45.269> a

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
off-center by 50 degrees gives it a

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:46.819 
off-center by 50 degrees gives it a
really<00:02:45.510> distinct<00:02:45.870> look
