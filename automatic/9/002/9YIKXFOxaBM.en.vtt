00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.450
 yj 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.640
 hello friends welcome to minecraft to my 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.889
 channel here I will do a tutorial of 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.900
 how to make a clock circuit stop 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.480
 I remove all this so that from the beginning 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.369
 these are called retarders with them 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.529
 let's start and have a very option 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.269
 important that is to delay hours and that 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.009
 the spark of energy that we are going to 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.800
 find the rest 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.820
 here we will put them to make a sense 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:31.189
 another later I'm going to apply well not 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:33.740
 it works we do it 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 ok 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.539
 I'm going to open them a little while that's 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.960
 the method to delay the spark 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:40.960
 ok we talked a few here until the 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.540
 third 1 2 3 1 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.920
 some we leave you two as you want 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.680
 whether everyone likes as they want 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.180
 wanting late and making a connection I would 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.309
 I call wiring to this for me it's a 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.550
 wiring and this with our cable masters 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.980
 so that the circuit passes we will make a 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.140
 little skulls here and the spark this 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.059
 is the one that is going to give us the spark but 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.350
 that matters when you put it there 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.509
 to remove it quickly what happens is that 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.670
 I do not have a lever or a button so 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:08.200
 with this we will make that effect but 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.750
 we put you off and see how the 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.060
 spark blinds ok and this what the 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.759
 spinning around without stopping is very 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:20.050
 important to open these restorers of 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:22.179
 in three or two or as you like so that 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.770
 the spark of laps slower and it does not 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:27.130
 we get to burn the circuit here what 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.869
 are watching you see how I'm doing 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.810
 I'm going to close them all to see 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.280
 how it will be faster the effect of 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.800
 how energy is going to spend more energy 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.690
 fast among the collectors ok 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.550
 closed there is no effect only 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.100
 they work closed they work like a 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.420
 repeater that make the signal is 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.610
 lengthen later in another trick 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.200
 tutorial I will teach you I remember you 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.270
 those are advanced tutorials 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.770
 the basics I think that already many already know 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.840
 the basic connections so it's not 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.820
 I need to do tutorials on that if 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.500
 someone wants it, I put it on the 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.200
 channel and I put basic tutorials 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.630
 of good connection here you already saw how it 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.539
 accelerates and is encouraged a little the return of 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.759
 the energy here I have already composed it 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.259
 little bit more to make it look better ok 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:12.599
 Let one take the next step 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.599
 signal from there is very important to know 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.069
 if we get the wrong signal it's not going 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.290
 to continue highlighting sparks 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.209
 later on good signal because while 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.910
 I'm going to show you why they do not work 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.440
 upside down the challengers have a sense 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.400
 have as a positive and a negative 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.989
 although here he will teach it here 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.760
 you have to put them all to the same 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.200
 side of the negative or positive of the 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.959
 positive or negative as you want 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.120
 Know who sees the game as you want to 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.000
 me here is upside down observe as if 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.579
 I put the opposite of the signal of the rest 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.310
 the spark does not pass there and if 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:50.099
 I put as it is already happening 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.329
 they watch as if the signal passes ok that's 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.930
 important that they go towards the same 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:57.150
 sense the little ones are going to be towards 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.010
 Here I will show you again another 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.650
 very important thing 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.200
 and when removing a cable from 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.610
 watch you have to understand that you 're not going to 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.409
 live the signal if we take it out 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.510
 wrongly if we cut the 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:12.329
 north connection then teach here if I 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.430
 I make them here right here, look how 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.860
 it was cut and cut it did not keep going 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.780
 to the right of the clock then 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.150
 obviously you can not get out of there 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.409
 because they cut you have to get it out of this 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.239
 ok side 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:26.940
 observe of I'm not going to put a good 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.880
 I break him spark 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.890
 and the girl goes to the file will happen ok 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.570
 both half spark for outside as 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.990
 continue on the clock without losing the circuit 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:39.000
 and that is one of the most difficult things 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.410
 that you have to understand a little but with 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.500
 Time will figure out how to do it 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.570
 it's a new problem ok now I'm going to 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.560
 teach them a trigger from there 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.000
 chicken eggs that I have 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.500
 automatically do it by taking advantage 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.120
 this circuit so they can see how 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.520
 this works already also know how 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.030
 do a how to make a creator of 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.930
 automatic hens it is important that 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.520
 let me deny a little stone that 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.340
 I do not have anything else to ask for 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.950
 can be the circuit here we are going to put 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.330
 two stones one and two to put the 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.600
 dispensers that is very important the 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.810
 vending machines 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.340
 ok let's put two stones to be able 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.650
 go putting the dispensers towards 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.430
 in front of everyone looking in front ok 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:21.220
 one on top of this let's put another 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:24.330
 another one and we cut that stone down and 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.050
 we put another look here, though, and 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.450
 Now it is very important to do the 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.040
 connection to asia the dispensers 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.470
 so that all three work at the same 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.540
 Leave it a little bit more stone 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.330
 to explain it better even though I already have 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.830
 stone is important to put two stones to 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.150
 the sides of your dispensers because 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.550
 the stones also work as if 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.380
 were one as if the stones were 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.450
 they fill up with current and can 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.680
 work with the dispensers is very 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.970
 important 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.760
 good that I already put those stones 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.340
 of luxury I like how do you know here if I 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.140
 I just put the cable down below them 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.180
 I'm going to show you only going to have 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.370
 energy the bottom one the top one is not going to 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.140
 have no energy observe there is no 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.340
 energy up and much less that of 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.300
 up true 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.919
 and the solution of this look observe 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.919
 is not going to throw anything because the mass is 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:13.810
 passing energy to the one below and it's not 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:16.570
 pulling signal what we can do is 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.100
 give signal to the three dispensers the 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.620
 only solution for this give you three 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.120
 signals to the dispensers is putting 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.250
 a stone behind them 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.610
 ok we put this stone that this stone 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.909
 is the one that elevates the current to the one below 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:33.300
 ok and the other stones and you have to climb 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:35.000
 the circuit so that this this cable 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.729
 teach the medium and the one above 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.219
 observe how you are already pulling 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:42.710
 is pulling things from below and in the 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:45.100
 medium and the one above and three 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.110
 dispensers bring signals 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.970
 they have the clock signal that we made 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.190
 above you'll see and this has 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.950
 all three were the three connections 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.710
 Exact any doubt with the comment 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:58.960
 that they can not do the circuit with me 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.790
 I'll explain to you, there you are. 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.140
 pulling all three here you can 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.000
 add eggs or you can add it 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.440
 arrows to make a strip arrows or a 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.710
 throw eggs that makes you a farm 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.360
 automatic as you already taught with in your 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.240
 channel that has recorded me when I do not 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.160
 I had a captor and that's how it is 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.500
 circuit now it 's very important how you 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.700
 called composerlo ya habãa taste of each 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.500
 here and today he began to compose a 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.700
 little more because it looks better for them 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.710
 I remember that also of the four 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.210
 Watch points can also be taken out 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.190
 the wiring not just on that side 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.330
 where I pulled the wiring now I'm going 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.120
 to take out of the other corner so that what 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.190
 observe 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.680
 there is the four function, I say 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:38.910
 the three dispensers working ok 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:41.550
 see what I said here here I am going to 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:44.250
 Take out some cables so they can see 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.560
 what can also get out other side let me 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:48.120
 prove is 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:53.190
 quickly 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:54.600
 as in the act so that the spark is 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.550
 you can add a button or a lever 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.960
 to give the spark for the moment of 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.520
 put the lever you have to disable the 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.860
 quickly look here I'm going to take out 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.919
 cables and it reminded us of the circuit of a 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:07.830
 little ok they already saw and they are going to continue 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:09.840
 operating the dispensers 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:11.580
 what happens if we connect if they intertwine 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.560
 between the two corners is going to burn the 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.570
 circuit and it stays come it turns off 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:18.990
 circuit can not touch the wires 

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:21.120
 from the corners more than that well ok come 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.560
 a little spark I here what I see that 

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.240
 it's very long michy's for so I'm going 

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.070
 to try to cut back a bit so that 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.199
 undertake fewer repeaters at a time 

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:30.030
 watch how the spark is long 

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:32.139
 how are you going to see how I'm going to leave it 

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:34.330
 cortita
