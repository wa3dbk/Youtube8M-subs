00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.690
 in the three lives sometimes look 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.790
 Of course they will do that again 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.650
 linked below in the infobox and on 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.690
 I'll show you this at the end of the video 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.850
 Survey again we catch but now 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.350
 with our hackers and look at us 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.000
 to the ingredients 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:31.770
 we have 100 grams of beef here 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.210
 100 grams can channel one tablespoon of oil 125 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.490
 milliliters of water 60 grams of flour one 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.410
 half a teaspoon of sugar half 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.420
 lend tablespoon a tablespoon sauce 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:48.320
 coconut cream something coriander and four 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.320
 hardboiled eggs 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.050
 for the armpits we must now first 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.050
 cut the shrimp into small pieces 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:15.120
 we'll chop it up pretty fine 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.120
 they are already unrecognizable 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.099
 then we have the coriander here 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.870
 always fresh for that certain 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:32.220
 taste ensures the cutting 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.220
 or we also had small 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.660
 we need about 1 tablespoon 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.660
 chopped coriander 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.800
 Now we come to the eggs 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.420
 after we have peeled them all 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.930
 we cut them all in length 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.930
 the half 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.519
 we remove each of these halves 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:55.140
 the yolks and put them in one 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.489
 bowl 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.560
 that goes for example quite well with a 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.720
 teaspoons we need the egg white 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.900
 of course, and raise it for later 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.730
 on when we brought out everything they have 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.129
 Let's just push them until there are only those 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.079
 We also give small pieces 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.909
 Of course, winter can be here 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:15.069
 others understand if you want the 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:17.549
 chopped coriander and also the 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.549
 shrimp 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.620
 We also give the outside sauce and 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.600
 the cocoons cream the whole mission we 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.190
 good with each other and then you can 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.740
 even with a little salt and something 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.819
 seasoning with pepper 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.370
 our mix then we share in 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.760
 action that we each roughly what 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.760
 to form 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.480
 These we will then each in 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:56.980
 helping and shaping the protein's cool 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.420
 it were, the missing half so 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.680
 that we end up in the form of a 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.389
 all ice condition 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.249
 Of course we have to be careful 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:05.939
 The proteins do not help to tear 

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:08.590
 So exercise not so much pressure from 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:10.000
 the eight eggs are coming for at least 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.379
 an hour in the fridge 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.540
 but you can also do it for example 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:15.069
 do a day before and just do it 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.690
 Store overnight in the fridge 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.389
 Just before serving, we wrap it up 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.289
 because with talk and they fry for the 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:24.669
 dough, we mix the flour with the sugar 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:26.940
 and mix this with the oil and the 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.940
 water 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.650
 This results in a fairly liquid dough 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.539
 So do not worry because he should be like that 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.090
 if we have the dough bun free 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:46.520
 we let him stir about 20 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.720
 minutes of rom 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.250
 then we can then our cooled 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.500
 hackers in a row in the dough 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.539
 and pretty evenly and with it 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.710
 envelop her , she goes over with the 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:57.710
 dough and roll it in it 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.050
 the wrapped eggs we go directly 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:10.190
 from bowl to the hot fryer 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:12.770
 just let it slide in if 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.410
 her no fryer has it does, for example 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.180
 a pot with enough we leave ours 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.400
 Hackers fry until the outside 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.180
 have a nice crispy cave and in 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.310
 are gaza 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.530
 that takes me about ten to 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.259
 twelve minutes then we want to get them out 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.849
 let drain and give it first 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:30.830
 some kitchen paper before we take it 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:33.110
 Serve so that the paper again something 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.490
 absorbs excess oil and there you 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.440
 I'm sure you want to know how they feel from the inside 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.440
 I'll cut it up 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:44.329
 this is how they look from the inside and like you 

00:05:42.049 --> 00:05:45.739
 everything is beautiful here 

00:05:44.329 --> 00:05:48.049
 again we have the overview of the 

00:05:45.739 --> 00:05:49.939
