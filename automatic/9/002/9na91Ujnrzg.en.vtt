there's clearly a lot more going on in

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.050 
there's clearly a lot more going on in
the<00:01:58.530> glass<00:01:58.710> what<00:01:59.280> should<00:01:59.460> people<00:01:59.640> be<00:01:59.940> looking

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
the glass what should people be looking

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.289 
the glass what should people be looking
for<00:02:00.510> in<00:02:00.720> the<00:02:01.200> hosts<00:02:01.710> tale<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.130> art<00:02:02.340> baby

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.719 

yeah<00:02:07.930> we<00:02:08.200> like<00:02:08.560> to<00:02:08.590> call<00:02:08.890> it<00:02:09.069> or<00:02:09.280> think<00:02:09.550> of<00:02:09.610> it

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
yeah we like to call it or think of it

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.290 
yeah we like to call it or think of it
as<00:02:09.879> being<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.660> PT<00:02:11.410> paradox<00:02:12.010> so<00:02:12.760> you're

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
as being the PT paradox so you're

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.059 
as being the PT paradox so you're
absolutely<00:02:13.450> right<00:02:13.870> there's<00:02:14.140> more<00:02:14.440> to<00:02:14.650> our<00:02:14.800> bag

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
absolutely right there's more to our bag

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.759 
absolutely right there's more to our bag
than<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.819> smoke<00:02:16.060> it<00:02:16.510> is<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:17.170> smokiest

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
than the smoke it is the smokiest

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:18.839 
than the smoke it is the smokiest
whiskey<00:02:18.280> in<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.459> world

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
whiskey in the world

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.960 
whiskey in the world
the<00:02:18.970> piteous<00:02:19.420> phenol<00:02:20.349> on<00:02:20.650> our<00:02:21.069> back<00:02:21.280> 10<00:02:21.550> our

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
the piteous phenol on our back 10 our

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.530 
the piteous phenol on our back 10 our
flagship<00:02:22.480> ranges<00:02:23.230> between<00:02:23.319> 50<00:02:24.280> 55<00:02:24.879> 60<00:02:24.940> or

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
flagship ranges between 50 55 60 or

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.050 
flagship ranges between 50 55 60 or
there<00:02:25.870> abouts<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:26.500> depending<00:02:27.489> on<00:02:27.549> the<00:02:27.640> recipe

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
there abouts and depending on the recipe

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.440 
there abouts and depending on the recipe
and<00:02:28.360> so<00:02:28.840> as<00:02:28.930> a<00:02:28.959> standard<00:02:29.849> every<00:02:30.849> day<00:02:31.000> produced

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
and so as a standard every day produced

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.539 
and so as a standard every day produced
single<00:02:31.959> malt<00:02:32.140> that<00:02:32.410> that<00:02:32.709> is<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:33.010> smokiest<00:02:33.370> we

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
single malt that that is the smokiest we

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.699 
single malt that that is the smokiest we
think<00:02:33.819> and<00:02:34.450> but<00:02:34.870> it's<00:02:34.989> not<00:02:35.170> just<00:02:35.410> about<00:02:35.590> that

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
think and but it's not just about that

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.470 
think and but it's not just about that
smoke<00:02:35.980> level<00:02:36.310> it<00:02:36.370> has<00:02:36.519> to<00:02:36.640> be<00:02:36.760> well<00:02:36.910> balanced

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
smoke level it has to be well balanced

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.559 
smoke level it has to be well balanced
and<00:02:37.629> I<00:02:37.780> think<00:02:38.140> our<00:02:38.349> big<00:02:38.590> is<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:39.849> most<00:02:40.150> well

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
and I think our big is the most well

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.780 
and I think our big is the most well
balanced<00:02:41.140> of<00:02:41.230> all<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:42.099> ILA<00:02:42.310> whiskies<00:02:42.579> and<00:02:42.640> it

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
balanced of all the ILA whiskies and it

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.400 
balanced of all the ILA whiskies and it
has<00:02:42.880> to<00:02:43.060> be<00:02:43.150> because<00:02:43.390> it's<00:02:43.540> so<00:02:43.690> pity<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:44.170> begin

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
has to be because it's so pity to begin

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.530 
has to be because it's so pity to begin
with<00:02:44.560> yeah<00:02:44.829> and<00:02:45.340> if<00:02:45.549> you<00:02:45.700> ever<00:02:45.819> get<00:02:46.120> if<00:02:46.390> you

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.250 
right banana lots of fruity ste
sweet<00:02:59.980> notes<00:03:00.190> and<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:01.209> liquid<00:03:01.630> that<00:03:01.750> from<00:03:02.140> our

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
sweet notes and the liquid that from our

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.920 
sweet notes and the liquid that from our
bag<00:03:02.440> itself<00:03:02.739> is<00:03:03.010> actually<00:03:03.670> I<00:03:03.700> think<00:03:03.930> easily

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
bag itself is actually I think easily

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.030 
bag itself is actually I think easily
comparable<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.560> something<00:03:05.890> like

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
comparable to something like

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.789 
comparable to something like
Glenmorangie<00:03:06.910> it's<00:03:07.480> very<00:03:07.690> very<00:03:07.900> delicate<00:03:08.140> and

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
Glenmorangie it's very very delicate and

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.960 
Glenmorangie it's very very delicate and
it's<00:03:09.459> got<00:03:09.610> the<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.900> unusual<00:03:11.130> and<00:03:12.130> diffuser<00:03:12.850> on

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
it's got the the unusual and diffuser on

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.690 
it's got the the unusual and diffuser on
the<00:03:13.060> top<00:03:13.329> of<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.630> the<00:03:13.959> still<00:03:14.260> yep<00:03:14.680> and<00:03:14.889> so<00:03:15.579> it's

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
the top of the the still yep and so it's

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.580 
the top of the the still yep and so it's
almost<00:03:15.850> distilled<00:03:16.329> two<00:03:16.810> and<00:03:16.959> a<00:03:16.989> half<00:03:17.139> times<00:03:17.350> if

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
almost distilled two and a half times if

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.370 
almost distilled two and a half times if
you<00:03:17.680> like<00:03:17.829> so<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.489> liquid<00:03:18.639> itself<00:03:19.060> is<00:03:19.420> very

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
you like so the liquid itself is very

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.650 
you like so the liquid itself is very
light<00:03:20.680> very<00:03:20.709> delicate<00:03:21.489> very<00:03:21.609> SD<00:03:22.030> and<00:03:22.239> then

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
light very delicate very SD and then

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.990 
light very delicate very SD and then
pairs<00:03:23.079> very<00:03:23.290> well<00:03:23.560> with<00:03:23.709> a<00:03:23.859> smoky<00:03:24.519> side<00:03:24.730> of<00:03:24.880> it

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
pairs very well with a smoky side of it

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.849 
pairs very well with a smoky side of it
there's<00:03:25.180> a<00:03:25.269> beautiful<00:03:25.540> balance<00:03:25.959> so<00:03:26.530> when<00:03:26.680> you

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
there's a beautiful balance so when you

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.500 
there's a beautiful balance so when you
try<00:03:27.190> it<00:03:27.220> for<00:03:27.519> the<00:03:27.579> first<00:03:27.790> time<00:03:27.910> your<00:03:28.329> mains

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
try it for the first time your mains

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.180 
try it for the first time your mains
almost<00:03:28.870> tricked<00:03:29.170> into<00:03:29.440> thinking<00:03:29.530> it's<00:03:29.950> not<00:03:30.160> a

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
almost tricked into thinking it's not a

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.030 
almost tricked into thinking it's not a
smoky<00:03:30.670> as<00:03:30.850> it<00:03:31.180> is<00:03:31.329> and<00:03:31.630> it's<00:03:32.079> that<00:03:32.200> PT<00:03:32.590> paradox

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
smoky as it is and it's that PT paradox

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.819 
smoky as it is and it's that PT paradox
how<00:03:33.220> can<00:03:33.549> a<00:03:33.790> whisky<00:03:34.359> this<00:03:34.510> smoky<00:03:34.930> taste<00:03:35.440> so

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
how can a whisky this smoky taste so

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.890 
how can a whisky this smoky taste so
sweet<00:03:36.160> yeah<00:03:36.609> that's<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.359> balance<00:03:37.720> you<00:03:37.840> should

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
sweet yeah that's the balance you should

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.740 
sweet yeah that's the balance you should
look<00:03:38.109> for<00:03:38.319> fantastic

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.050 

there's<00:03:43.680> a<00:03:43.770> food<00:03:43.950> peering<00:03:44.340> help<00:03:44.610> or<00:03:44.790> hinder

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
there's a food peering help or hinder
