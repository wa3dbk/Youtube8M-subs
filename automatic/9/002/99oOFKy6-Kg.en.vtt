00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:09.660
 so it was here in wednesday 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.690
 Of course it's the cooking time we cook 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.130
 Do not cook today we make delicious 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.080
 cocktail outside, the sun is shining 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.119
 the summer approach wars right lust 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.439
 on a lot of liquid we are thirsty 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.970
 if you're thirsty you should get up 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.340
 definitely sluggish anyway a signal 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.000
 from the body drinks what we have to 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.189
 really for ours 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.019
 liquid household care make that 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.880
 we use a lot of water and a lot of water 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.000
 but of course also with delicious 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.920
 Drink cocktails are delicious though 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.899
 Most cocktails are with a lot of fruit 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.000
 with a lot of sugar we get in fast 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.550
 solid peak but then we go down 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.079
 get tired we can 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.420
 Do not be so active outside because of that 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.160
 have delicious tomatoes today 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.940
 cocktail I probably think about it 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.460
 God's sake 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.440
 spins the ba tomatoes we need 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.730
 namely garlic we need one 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.610
 bit on it a bit 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.829
 horseradish bit ginger ice cubes 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.000
 that's it you think god does that 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.129
 can not taste that it is disgusting 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.799
 Now tell the cheese no it is 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.740
 really really tasty the video should 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.400
 a little bit to serve you 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.990
 vegetable juices a bit up to be 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.549
 We bring vegetables so many 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.600
 vitamins so many minerals we 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.220
 For example, you have a lot of potassium here 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.990
 Give something for that 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.850
 fluid balance is very important 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.159
 we have the sharpness of 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.780
 horseradish through the garlic 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.939
 very good qualities for the 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.080
 athletes at the warm temperatures of the 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.860
 metabolism will be a bit 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.689
 driven 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.880
 we just do not have that much sugar in it 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.070
 I promise you will do it 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.500
 it is very delicious and then you can 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.630
 Get started too 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.650
 we take the tomatoes had such and 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.850
 then the first time in the container 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.490
 pay attention to that with the tomatoes 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.100
 The rich are the richer the sweeter 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.100
 So the delicious are really two 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.960
 really nice ripe tomatoes take like that 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.979
 then take us a bit of that 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:00.720
 Onion in small pieces is enough 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:03.370
 nice to cut the very small dice 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.040
 garlic is a bit like garlic 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.200
 insanely healthy really well take one 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.780
 tough we could of course out 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.180
 but he really gives it all 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.980
 really good taste one 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.830
 he does not quite have a nice fresh taste either 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.209
 so this strong aroma so look there 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.510
 really that it is fresh 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.190
 nice small and offers the whole 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.340
 best your guests also with fear 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.880
 then the smell is complete afterwards 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.520
 no matter 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.959
 do not blackmail or crush anything 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.520
 Bittern becomes free and then 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.770
 Beating with more sun can be so easy 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:40.410
 cut nice little slices 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.410
 ginger next 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.810
 Do not be surprised that way 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.280
 is there a teaspoon of horseradish you 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.560
 but also fresh relative 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.300
 fresh horseradish make sure that 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.680
 It's not a creamy horseradish or something 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.900
 as possible rainer horseradish 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:13.670
 now the whole thing is pureed or how 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:17.620
 said in the aftermath is done 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.760
 Now take your glass 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.310
 nice to pack a lot of ice 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.810
 a lot has melted 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:32.810
 today a lot of repa copy and ball and then 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:36.140
 Completely delicious cocktail on top 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:41.900
 and just try me out 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:43.550
 tasted fantastic tasted as 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.580
 Molly sharpness that is really delicious 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.870
 really really yummy bit her 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.519
 you have to rethink a bit 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.830
 a bit unusual and cocktail must 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.410
 not always be critical but vegetables 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.360
 Cocktails are just the hit of it 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.430
 In the sense friends enjoy the weather 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.769
 Subscribe the skull well to the new one 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.190
 side in it or looks a side with 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:03.440
 purely 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.150
 the whole nutrition plan is new 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.819
 already in there in new changes and 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.810
 training plan looks at facebook 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.430
 at instagram over 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.470
 there are also exciting pictures of 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.390
 My stuff I do so at home 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.830
 when I order something experimental 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.630
 it just happens when you are 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:21.019
 Things at home tastes delicious 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:25.479
 I enjoy the whole on the terrace 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.479
 in the sun and until then 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.199
