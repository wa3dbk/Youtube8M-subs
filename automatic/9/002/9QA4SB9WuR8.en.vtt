over the other and the end up for this

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.719 
over the other and the end up for this
kind<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.110> package<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.860> what<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.220> does<00:01:05.460> is

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
kind of a package and what that does is

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.020 
kind of a package and what that does is
that<00:01:05.760> keeps<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.900> ear<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.740> bag<00:01:08.130> because<00:01:08.460> as

that keeps the ear in the bag because as

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.960 
that keeps the ear in the bag because as
soon<00:01:09.210> as<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.390> starts<00:01:09.659> popping<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.260> tends<00:01:10.650> to

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
soon as it starts popping it tends to

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.340 
soon as it starts popping it tends to
move<00:01:11.970> all<00:01:12.119> around<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.659> microwave<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.260> you

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
move all around in the microwave so you

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.380 
move all around in the microwave so you
want<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.560> keep<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:13.920> one<00:01:13.950> place<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.909> also

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
want to keep it in one place and also

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.429 
want to keep it in one place and also
this<00:01:15.710> holds<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.860> popcorn<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:18.409> allows<00:01:19.409> for

this holds the popcorn and allows for
the<00:01:19.830> vent<00:01:20.040> in<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.220> air<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.509> stuff<00:01:21.720> like<00:01:21.900> that

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
the vent in the air and stuff like that

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.679 
the vent in the air and stuff like that

whole bunch going at the same time so

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:08.659 
whole bunch going at the same time so
we'll<00:02:00.080> see<00:02:00.260> how<00:02:00.350> it<00:02:00.470> goes

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:08.669 

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:25.620

and<00:02:31.909> as<00:02:32.540> it<00:02:32.689> counts<00:02:33.049> down<00:02:33.110> to<00:02:33.290> zero<00:02:34.250> you<00:02:34.610> can

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
and as it counts down to zero you can

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.809 
and as it counts down to zero you can
hear<00:02:35.450> here<00:02:35.780> it's<00:02:35.900> still<00:02:36.079> popping<00:02:36.590> some<00:02:36.890> but

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
hear here it's still popping some but

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.179 
hear here it's still popping some but
it's<00:02:37.939> lessons<00:02:38.390> quite<00:02:38.689> a<00:02:38.719> bit<00:02:39.049> we<00:02:39.709> did<00:02:39.890> a<00:02:39.920> full

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:40.189 
it's lessons quite a bit we did a full

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:43.089 
it's lessons quite a bit we did a full
three<00:02:40.489> minutes<00:02:40.879> of<00:02:41.409> course<00:02:42.409> it'll<00:02:42.620> depend<00:02:42.769> on

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
three minutes of course it'll depend on

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:48.520 
three minutes of course it'll depend on
power<00:02:43.909> of<00:02:44.180> your<00:02:44.359> microwave<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:45.469> then<00:02:47.470> so<00:02:48.470> you

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
power of your microwave and then so you

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.009 
power of your microwave and then so you
can<00:02:48.890> see<00:02:49.099> it's<00:02:49.250> all<00:02:49.400> puffed<00:02:50.000> up<00:02:50.269> that's<00:02:50.629> a<00:02:50.810> good

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
can see it's all puffed up that's a good

00:02:51.019 --> 00:03:05.760 
can see it's all puffed up that's a good
sign<00:02:51.319> let's<00:02:51.709> see<00:02:51.920> what<00:02:52.099> we<00:02:52.220> got

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:17.300
