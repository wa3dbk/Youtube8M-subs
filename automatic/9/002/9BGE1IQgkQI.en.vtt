00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.189
 so for this second part we are going 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.990
 continue where they had therefore stopped 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.639
 we will try to complicate a little 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.900
 things and add on the one hand the costs 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.490
 up and on the other hand the 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.990
 Changes strings ago 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.279
 basically nothing different by 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.750
 report to this government after reparti 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.520
 it's always the same concept to ask 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.439
 hand with a little flesh in touch and 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.400
 to scratch the strings properly but 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.289
 I just want to show some 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.820
 tips to make it easier because 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.859
 it's not always obvious 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.109
 so regarding costs up 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.739
 that we can add the same to discover the 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.150
 bape in order to go back the principle is 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.170
 always the same one makes a blow to the 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.190
 down and after we make a move towards the 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.900
 high in the other direction 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.820
 the concern is that many people have 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.320
 wrong with that simply because 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.970
 basic does not really control the 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.860
 costs up even his palm mute 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.150
 the reason for this is that often the 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.830
 people make a shot up a lot 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.989
 too big compared to the cost to the 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.400
 down they did it's pretty logical 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.239
 in a sense in the empty guitarist on 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.379
 spend a lot more time doing 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.030
 discover the tray of iron shots 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.860
 discovered the top how to make the 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.699
 reggae and suddenly we are more to the east 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.290
 the costs that would be down 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.250
 covered up so train sees 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.049
 do behind the returns everything 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.870
 gently in palm mute connects me 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:11.310
 serious and remake also a little the same 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.900
 exercises that we saw in the course on 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.390
 the round trip does it we did well 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.430
 mastered the sound and the blows you 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.260
 do on your guitar with palm 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.910
 mutates the same way as without failure ut 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.270
 we really want to discover the water 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.010
 own small precise movements that 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.570
 do not make you lose the palm mute 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.130
 so if you make too big 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.780
 move upward when you 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.340
 do your returns your hand is going 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.760
 take off from the easel and there are more 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.890
 bonus 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.720
 and that's not what we want so be 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.400
 very specific with that because we're going 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.260
 often found from the palm tree of the go 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.260
 back in the hard rock rhythmic 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.620
 metal all to iron maiden if you have any 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.180
 listened to is that all the time not 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.760
 do not allow me to go back all 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.190
 the time is here for the question of 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.780
 how to make return not 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.920
 fight to change ropes at the 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.170
 briefing in no better it's not going to be 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.300
 obvious at all and it's going to depend on 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.530
 case in cases we only play two or 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.350
 three adjacent ropes 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.000
 for example mimic reminded airy he 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.380
 must arrange to pose 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.140
 other hands in not better position 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.400
 in order to smother the three strings of 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.220
 the same way so that there 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.080
 grants mines and the serious agreement 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.600
 the corderie and all done the same 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.310
 way like that where we do what we want 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.690
 in the left hand what to do and 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.130
 alain right we can just scratch 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.630
 the rope that we want with a 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.940
 movement on the rope half of the or 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.620
 golden without the right hand moving 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.470
 we have that the thumb and index they have 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.470
 scratched differently and the palm that 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.250
 touch the strings will not move him 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.870
 unfortunately it does not always have to be 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.160
 possible since sometimes we go everything 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.560
 simply play on more ropes 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.470
 kind on the rope half serious stop 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.910
 is alone and we will not arrive with our 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.010
 hand is smothered all the strings of 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.440
 uniform way in this case there we go 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.150
 having to move your hand slightly 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.150
 when we go on a serious rope 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:01.060
 we will simply block 20 minutes and 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.060
 the agreement given to progress 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.980
 and we will adjust the pressure of others 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.660
 marks so always smothered the 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.500
 rope that corresponds to the one that we 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.380
 plays with the left hand 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.970
 so it is not obvious its 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.020
 asks the practice of the habit so 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.670
 I advise you to really go all 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.990
 gently start by not working 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.040
 minutes on a single string after 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.540
 try to do sequences on 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.760
 two adjacent strings where and render 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.260
 melodies agree what do you want on 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.150
 will also do a series of exercises on the 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.070
 palm mute to give examples of this 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.570
 to work but go ahead 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.950
 gradually once you master 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.510
 really well the palm besides two strings 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.700
 tried on three strings out of four 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.160
 strings and so try to adjust the 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.480
 position of your hand to match 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.490
 what you need to play by hand 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.650
 left is not obvious but with the 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.120
 practical it is possible and one can at 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.460
 finally end up playing scales 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.760
 whole on six ropes all rampal 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.200
 fight 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.930
 even if again on the ropes 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.190
 acute it's not obvious at all so that 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.600
 that brought a lot of work also a 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.280
 to make it really natural 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.080
 easy and that it is not horrible 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.430
 when we listen to you play even if 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.210
 I'm sure it's not you 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.130
 are the best in the world you 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.810
 do not worry we spent the third 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.010
 part to see how alternates 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.540
 costs with palm mute and impales minutes 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.340
 and in the meantime you can also 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.810
 join on facebook.com to buy 4 to 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.460
 guitar or twitter.com wise table 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.660
 on acoustic way to make shots 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.660
 rising costs without him 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.800
 and by doing that we can do that kind 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.800
 rhythmic
