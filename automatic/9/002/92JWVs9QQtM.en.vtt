 So it's only you and my 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.220

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.710
 quickly okay I want to give a tip 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.600
 maybe you do not know much yet 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.080
 People should know who the expert is already. 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.029
 fifa and mainly on 15 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.980
 January already this tip and but I think it will 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.410
 anyway make this video 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.449
 I do not know, I think that the more people I 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.890
 I know this better and if I could be 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.210
 useful for some people 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.940
 this video that has had some use 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.010
 beauty is basically the following is 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.290
 let's say you want to buy a player 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.300
 that it is not that it is not in the version 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.039
 Normal him ie he is inform 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.289
 a time of the year 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.530
 if you buy a player who does not have the 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.480
 normal version of his example we'll see 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.180
 benzema who left there on the team of the week Ã³ 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.039
 karim benzema here is not like I had 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.469
 use for the report version of it 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.809
 Only here is the silver and gold bronze 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.580
 obviously obese is bigger then 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.610
 these two options to which they are useless do not 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.049
 there is a report option here last 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.549
 idea as it should already have 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.869
 been implemented for a long time and that 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.240
 say you want to look for the 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.590
 benzema prices only report 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.450
 You have to do what I know that 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.030
 search here and have to keep walking 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.549
 Here, for example, you have a 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.380
 benzema has the same information as in the 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.140
 case of his century form 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.110
 op has a first report here in the middle 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.479
 the galley has a few centuries report 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.900
 There you and he is walking this hill. 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.600

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.850

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.680

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.860
 you will create a concept cast 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.750
 here any name of the fight has created a 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.820
 concept error here you will add 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.110

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.950
 but will talk to me and it generates more 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.900

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.799
 difference is that being here on the market 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.690
 of transfers 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.700
 we can restrict the price of 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.100
 That year, we can restrict 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.049
 here the maximum price has to pay for the 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.250
 LAN but for example so that ollanta 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.269
 costing whatever I do not know how much is 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.459
 costing I'll take a look here at 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.739
 soccer football informing that ollanta 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.739
 worth 1 million and I felt then there was 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:01.860
 here and I will put through all the snacks 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:04.079
 which are costing up to one million and 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.940
 six hundred is going to take a little bit 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.530
 Come on, beauty. We're coming. 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.959

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.310
 Let's see, you did not find anything. 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.640

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.970
 Mass can decide I'm just going to change so 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.070
 reflect here 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.630

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.890

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.690
 end up assuming someone will buy this 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.460

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.110

 I understand, there's no one else. 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.220
 cheap and not a little bit more expensive than 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.440
 that it is a very very good price 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.460
