like<00:05:23.180> about<00:05:23.360> this<00:05:23.780> yacht<00:05:24.080> is<00:05:24.110> that<00:05:24.440> it's<00:05:24.590> large

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
like about this yacht is that it's large

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.440 
like about this yacht is that it's large
but<00:05:25.280> the<00:05:25.400> power<00:05:25.610> behind<00:05:25.820> it<00:05:26.150> is<00:05:26.270> not

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
but the power behind it is not

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.840 
but the power behind it is not
exaggerated<00:05:27.260> and<00:05:27.440> we're<00:05:27.830> travelling<00:05:28.220> at<00:05:28.310> 32

I<00:05:33.080> wonder<00:05:33.590> how<00:05:33.710> fast<00:05:33.920> it<00:05:34.190> can<00:05:34.280> go<00:05:34.340> there<00:05:35.000> is

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
I wonder how fast it can go there is

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.820 
I wonder how fast it can go there is
only<00:05:35.330> one<00:05:35.600> way<00:05:35.780> to<00:05:35.840> find<00:05:36.200> out

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.050

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:49.050 
joy I'm on it let's open the throttle
and<00:05:41.360> see<00:05:41.660> what<00:05:41.810> it<00:05:41.900> can<00:05:42.050> do
