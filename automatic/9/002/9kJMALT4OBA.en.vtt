00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.569
 hello very good everyone here a 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.609
 new video and first of all I want 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:08.710
 tell you that the description have in a 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:10.780
 page and they have the most prices 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.420
 cheap the whole market and with the code 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.869
 then they will have a discount like that 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.779
 let's start with the video that you 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:22.390
 I bring another trade or to the channel this is going to 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:26.289
 consist of trade ar with the app that 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:29.069
 they are some letters that will take out I think that 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:32.619
 end of January or beginning of February 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:34.149
 and that what consists of those letters that 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.370
 around here on the screen you are watching 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:38.829
 what are some of those that 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.120
 they took out last year and that is that 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:44.140
 players who are doing a good 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:47.559
 season because they are added 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.920
 will increase your average and then we 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:53.170
 let's take advantage because last year 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.480
 the players that had a go and they 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.829
 They took out in the suite increased 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.870
 automatically of average and people 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.080
 Well, at the beginning 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.530
 I buy very expensive the first ones and that 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.290
 they were up and then what is it 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.000
 what am I going to do this year because this one 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.750
 trade or that the truth is that it 's a bit 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.450
 risky because it is not known if they will do 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.810
 last year is to increase 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.940
 automatically the letter and then if 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.340
 you do not want to risk much what I 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.740
 I wanted to sign him at the time of 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.320
 chotis and everything is cheaper and still 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.660
 even if you can not duplicate the coins 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.600
 so at least not lose not lose or 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:40.090
 win a few and now I'm going to 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.330
 teach me more or less the players that 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.720
 I am buying and for me it is 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:50.470
 they are going to have an app and I am going to tell you 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:54.509
 how much are we going to start for me the most 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.509
 clear are going to be from gea 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.860
 if you have come to shine or shift and 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:03.640
 if not then the eve that is right now 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.640
 by 334 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.050
 I the truth that de gea I follow little the 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.319
 barkley but what little I've seen since 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.390
 years ago I was awesome with the 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.760
 Manchester United is giving you a 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.130
 most of the parties and they are 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.020
 saving many points so let me 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.060
 I think it's going to be one of those that almost 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.110
 sure he's going to take the up 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.810
 another of those who have many 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.730
 possibilities is going to be the cassette that 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:34.069
 it also has the shift 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:36.110
 so for 235 and the if for 106 on the street 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.409
 I think he goes to the Olympique de Lyon first 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.510
 in link 1 and I think that the lord 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:44.780
 house goes to goal per game being 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.810
 top scorer of league 1 and also very 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.000
 likely to take out your app another player 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.400
 that also have possibilities is 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.360
 alexis 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.360
 alexis sanchez 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.160
 and here we have alexis sanchez who is 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.410
 left band but if you're going to get caught 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:07.270
 some milk I would recommend that you spied 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.660
 jalid because if it comes out I think that being 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.030
 m 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.640
 and all that will go up more than the price 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.220
 the one that is by band but good here 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.190
 you have in those three are the ones that for me 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.070
 has they are clearer than they take out soft 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.930
 I already obeyed a few possibilities 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.430
 that also look like it comes out 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.819
 start with godín 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.719
 by godin who has also shift is 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:35.780
 very cheap both in play and in equipment 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:38.510
 has ifixit another player who also 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:42.319
 he has a lot of possibility of that disc 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:45.459
 the malagueño of real madrid who also 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.459
 has ypf and shift 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.870
 well more than the athletic one also has the 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:55.930
 infidel shift 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.400
 of forward the two seem to me 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.620
 and it's also doing very good 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.930
 season these last three also 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.319
 is doing very good season 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.989
 godin is if it goes out it's going to be pretty 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:12.909
 carillo because it's the best 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:17.650
 central of the bea Griezmann is of the 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:21.489
 front so more expensive that are rented 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.500
 more apart from benzema and some more are 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.139
 of which more or less is not even a 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.460
 very cheap or very expensive price and the 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:31.180
 truth is that they are going pretty well 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:34.360
 isco then another option is also good 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:37.509
 of midfielder in the search for others 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.050
 players that are not so expensive would be 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:40.050
 perisic 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:46.450
 of wolsburg that was by 34 and the 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.370
 another for 16,000 the truth that they are 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.830
 thrown for people who do not have much 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:54.160
 money and I did not want to risk so much 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:58.840
 here you have a choice another would be chupo 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:00.760
 moting I do not know if he has said well what 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.650
 I'm a player, the truth is that 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.199
 chosen I do not know if he's doing very 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.720
 good season but what misses me 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:11.290
 that already has an if that is 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:14.169
 uploading 22 of average points and that 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.880
 your letter to evil will be gold be gold is not 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.820
 weird and then I think the truth is 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:22.960
 that has some option to go out 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:26.020
 and already these are options that the truth 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:30.680
 I have it so clear and if you believe and risk 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:33.770
 and believe that I can because it would be you see 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:37.370
 which is also difficult but is already more 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.840
 expensive and I do not know if yes you can really 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.600
 leave or not 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:45.020
 harry caine that is the truth is that I 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:47.930
 yes I bought it and it's because this 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.120
 boy I 've done it looking and the 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.919
 truth is that it is very good and the one that 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.919
 You are doing to win matches or 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:58.040
 to tottenham it seems to me that the last time 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:06:00.770
 it was against the last matches that 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.229
 played was against chelsea I think that 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.389
 he made a double and gave an assist to 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:09.110
 two and the truth that for a player who 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:11.240
 I think he's 20 21 years old, he's doing very well and 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.400
 the truth that you raise 3 points of 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.430
 media lift already without getting better can 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.640
 go out 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:20.890
 and good up to here the video today if 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.620
 I had some doubt or you want to ask 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:29.170
 something you can leave some comment in the 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:32.250
 in the video and if you want to watch some video 

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:34.720
 more than trade or you can say it and 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:36.280
 we will try to look for some without 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.000
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.000
 the next video
