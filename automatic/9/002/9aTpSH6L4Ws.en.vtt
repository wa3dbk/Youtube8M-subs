00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:12.420
 Hello, I wanted to show you more 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:15.299
 one longing and immediately gave pretty 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:21.060
 interesting thing do you think chinese 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:23.880
 damask there or not well here I am 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.769
 bought this knife showed me yes 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.750
 really chinese damask 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.640
 there is a manufacturer unknown to me 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.059
 that is, we understand that it is made in China 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.219
 but what kind of master and department to me is incomprehensible 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.570
 it was written on the site that it was supposedly 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:45.469
 collection item 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:52.640
 here comes a box of husband's cost 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:54.860
 30 dollars with penny box that's gel 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.640
 against moisture 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.640
 such a unit 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:32.730
 the wedge in the center looks all this 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.730
 So 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.090
 very beautiful lining 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:55.030
 the only thing that is not very neat 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.360
 processed here are these holes under 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:01.720
 screws on the plates 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:09.070
 if you look closer here is better 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:12.160
 can be seen then according to the manufacturer here 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:16.900
 this layer is supposedly mother of pearl 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:20.610
 from the clam, respectively, well here rather 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:26.830
 just something like org glass 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:29.070
 the knife is claimed as a collection yes and not 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:34.360
 fact of course but pretty 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:37.800
 original made for why arises 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.800
 the question of its practical use 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:50.190
 look at his tip now i 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.190
 I tried to measure the thickness of the tip 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.240
 see 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:21.790
 this is tip thickness 0 36 millimeters this 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:26.400
 In general, just some cool on the same I 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:31.540
 sorry mixing cutting edges 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:35.250
 there by 7 millimeters by millimeter here 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:39.160
 that's exactly the thickness of the tip that is 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:42.910
 right now if i stick his table and yes 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:46.690
 just carelessly make right all along 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:49.680
 my tip we drown kapets well yes 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.570
 maybe you can open them a letter 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.900
 pencil sharpen something very very 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:59.880
 neatly on the other hand look 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.680
 what an interesting drawing to damask 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.560
 the most interesting thing here if you look 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:11.110
 here is the center of the butt yes there we will see the dark 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:13.660
 lane that is, it turns out that's 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:17.040
 one metal which then goes on 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:21.549
 cutting edge but from this part yes 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:25.450
 here the layers of metal here are the same with 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:27.460
 this and from this part of the knife but i'm im 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.860
 I tried to cut the paper there 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.180
 pencil sharpen new in principle 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.700
 copes with this job 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.490
 but it is a hundred percent stickman that is 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:39.240
 there's even a fortune teller walk and if you look 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:42.220
 on the fact that here 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:45.820
 linerock pretty deeply comes 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:48.610
 yes on the heel of the blade but it can even 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:52.510
 don't pay attention provided 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:56.620
 that with such a subtle mixing and with 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:58.990
 so well on the finest tips I have not 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.140
 I have never seen it already 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:05.620
 the tip is fine but if the answer was it was 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.110
 here so here it is clear that he could 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:11.020
 work 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:13.830
 principle, some perform functions in 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.660
 In this case, he will only lie on the shelf 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.740
 but this damask is pretty 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.280
 neatly 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:24.130
 yes it really is Damascus I watched 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.900
 under the microscope that is really 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:36.820
 these are metal layers not 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:40.690
 what is called not etching but of course 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:46.740
 very beautiful and everything on it somehow 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:52.990
 so and all the functionality of the knife 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:56.430
 0 but very beautiful I liked everything 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.430
 thank you all bye
