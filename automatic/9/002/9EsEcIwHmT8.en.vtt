00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.910
 hello live chew again- and in 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.550
 this very short video tutorial 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.759
 I'll show you a little but very useful 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.290
 tool he's called ren im firing 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:15.870
 Essentially, it's worth it that it allows 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.600
 rename group of objects through 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.970
 I have the template you have now 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.210
 open here is such a scene here just 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.539
 walls having entered the grandfather field that is such 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.050
 fragments and windows they have me all through 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.570
 dance is all the same but it is in principle 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:37.050
 not so important in this case and 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.680
 now let's all these walls here 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.640
 let's group 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.410
 and for example we want to choose walls 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.360
 let's say we have such conditions that direct 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.250
 we can't do this because 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.200
 that we have here all sorts of objects well 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.300
 that is, the hour scene is simple but it can 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.760
 be quite complicated and just like that 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.489
 select an object using the mouse cursor 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.250
 it is quite difficult in this case 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.190
 very convenient to use the tool 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.640
 selection by menu name select select buy 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.030
 and i have it hotkey n 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.200
 click it opens a list of all 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.790
 objects in the scene and 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.310
 and in this case we have all the objects 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.340
 have the name of groups and some value 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.500
 digital ie through this instrument 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.979
 it turns out we also can not choose 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.840
 and if the scene for example is not yours or you like 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.880
 for some reason it was launched that is 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.430
 you have a lot of all sorts of different objects 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.860
 and you did not waste time initially to 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.049
 give them some meaningful names then 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.619
 you have a lot of groups a lot 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.320
 there are camera lights and very 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.610
 it's hard to understand which one is which for 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.920
 you can use it 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.299
 the tool with the name object is it 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.649
 I have an ace and here anri name object 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.450
 to run it you need to select 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.290
 object and what we want to rename 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.210
 and we now let's ungroup ours 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.460
 walls 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.619
 select them and for example do so that 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.890
 they were all called the wall and as 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.360
 suffixes had some sort of number value 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.789
 Well, that is, the order you just numbers 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.789
 in the disease parameter we write walls 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.060
 wall do the underscore for 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.310
 order to beat off a numeric value and 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.890
 Next are the parameters that allow 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.640
 we put some value in the form 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.620
 prefix that is, we will have some 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.810
 characters to be described before the word 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.400
 wall 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.010
 further the tool suffix allows us 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.620
 substitute this value 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.330
 after the main name and on in this 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.870
 the case is still interested in this parameter 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.880
 which allows you to add a counter 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.620
 numeric value first parameter 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.140
 indicates what date will start 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.600
 numbering of our objects and further 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.520
 value step means how much 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.620
 numbers we will be assigned a numeric 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.750
 the value of the next object that is if 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.270
 we will put in this case the unit 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.050
 All numbers will be with us 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.300
 consecutive that is zero one two 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.900
 three four and so on if we put 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.600
 deuce then we will have 0 2 4 6 8 and so 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.940
 further in this case it makes sense to put 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.740
 I see no other unit except 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.600
 Two for example can be useful if 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.820
 you want to divide your objects into 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.550
 even and odd ie you highlight 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.800
 some group put dvoechka 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.130
 press rene them and they all accept 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.670
 even values ​​then select another 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.920
 the group 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.000
 press exactly the same ren and but with 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.510
 value of one 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.650
 and you have all the values ​​of numeric udders 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.890
 each object will be 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:39.340
 Odd to us in this case, this is all not 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:42.700
 it is necessary to return as we allocate our 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.540
 walls and press the ren button and as soon as 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.420
 we pressed it 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:50.970
 our objects are all assigned to them 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:56.680
 values ​​wall 00 in this case 05 03 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:57.820
 02 01 and 04 and the same thing let's do 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.230
 for windows but for windows 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:05.680
 there will be such a feature right now I 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:08.130
 it'll show you we put a window just 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.110
 same tick the numbering and 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.580
 leave the same values ​​0 and 1 click 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.560
 ren and 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.230
 This window can be closed but here it should 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.780
 to draw your attention to how much 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.150
 we have our window consists of two objects 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.110
 that is, this is our group we had 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.830
 glass 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:29.349
 and we have a frame due to the fact that 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.479
 group we have two objects this one 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:34.300
 rename tool it takes into account 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:37.150
 objects within the group that is given 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:41.650
 case we have box 60 if we are a group 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:44.620
 open we will have window 62 and windows here 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.449
 61 i.e. he renamed not only 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.280
 group but also objects within this group 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:52.750
 so keep that in mind, and 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.169
 I'll give you one more feature 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.789
 for example if you have all the objects 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.860
 Here are some such values to all 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:02.860
 monotonous in this case we have Tina 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.960
 and the number and you want to make you 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.639
 This name is not renamed 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.379
 that it have remained the same but 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:10.810
 want to write some more in the beginning 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:14.800
 word for this we highlight these objects 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:18.669
 We go to the rhino them object and need 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.500
 remove this basic name checkmark here 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:23.110
 would mean that this parameter is not 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.370
 will be taken into account that is the name of the object 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.620
 which you have now 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.539
 but on it you will remain without 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.949
 changes and then you can put 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:35.339
 for example prefix write for example 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:39.029
 let's say brick 

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:40.990
 underscore push ren and and 

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:42.879
 now let's see what we have 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.860
 it turned out we got a brick 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:49.330
 brick wall 004 at 0 1 and so on 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:53.349
 that is, here is this parameter if we 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.490
 remove the tick basic it to us 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:57.189
 lets leave 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.740
 the name of the selected objects is unchanged and 

00:05:57.189 --> 00:06:04.449
 make this change through the prefix and 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:06.210
 through the suffix well and basically everything 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:09.580
 there is a pretty small parameter 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.219
 so the lesson is also small but 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.439
 I hope it will be useful to you and 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:16.779
 sometime we all come in handy 

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:18.990
 a lesson and see you at the store dot numbers 

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:18.990
