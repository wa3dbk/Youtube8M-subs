00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:48.380 

okay<00:00:44.940> Ohio<00:00:45.510> by<00:00:45.719> Neely<00:00:46.019> are<00:00:47.149> pretty<00:00:48.149> simple

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
okay Ohio by Neely are pretty simple

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.869 
okay Ohio by Neely are pretty simple
it's<00:00:48.570> built<00:00:48.780> around<00:00:48.929> this<00:00:49.589> D<00:00:50.129> chord<00:00:50.519> shape

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
it's built around this D chord shape

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.299 
it's built around this D chord shape
okay<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.839> that<00:00:51.929> has<00:00:52.140> two<00:00:52.710> other<00:00:52.859> chords<00:00:53.219> in

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
okay and that has two other chords in

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.189 
okay and that has two other chords in
the<00:00:53.399> course<00:00:53.870> but<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:55.019> pretty

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
the course but it's pretty

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.689 
the course but it's pretty
straightforward<00:00:55.890> from<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.280> cording

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
straightforward from a cording

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.420 
straightforward from a cording
standpoint<00:00:57.149> it's<00:00:57.719> played<00:00:58.019> in<00:00:58.049> D<00:00:58.439> modal<00:00:58.979> tuning

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
standpoint it's played in D modal tuning

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.520 
standpoint it's played in D modal tuning
or<00:00:59.609> some<00:01:00.359> people<00:01:00.479> call<00:01:00.600> double<00:01:01.019> drop<00:01:01.260> D<00:01:01.469> tuning

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
or some people call double drop D tuning

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.579 
or some people call double drop D tuning
so<00:01:02.460> let<00:01:02.579> me<00:01:02.640> show<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.850> what<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.149> it's

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
so let me show you what that is it's

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.130 
so let me show you what that is it's
standard<00:01:04.589> tuning<00:01:04.949> but<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.840> sixth<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
standard tuning but the sixth and the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.029 
standard tuning but the sixth and the
first<00:01:07.320> strings<00:01:07.590> are<00:01:07.860> tuned<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.429> a<00:01:08.580> D<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.470> D<00:01:10.470> and

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:11.039 
first strings are tuned to a D so D and

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:14.990 
first strings are tuned to a D so D and
D<00:01:13.189> that<00:01:14.189> means<00:01:14.310> if<00:01:14.429> you're<00:01:14.520> trying<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.819> make

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
D that means if you're trying to make

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.260 
D that means if you're trying to make
sure<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.270> do<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.509> like<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:16.909> the<00:01:17.909> seventh

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
sure you do it like this the seventh

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.410 
sure you do it like this the seventh
fret<00:01:21.709> tuna<00:01:22.709> okay<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.940> rest<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.149> it<00:01:24.299> is

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
fret tuna okay so the rest of it is

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.410 
fret tuna okay so the rest of it is
standard<00:01:24.899> tuning<00:01:25.080> so<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.319> got<00:01:25.470> an<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.709> a<00:01:26.700> D<00:01:27.179> and

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
standard tuning so you got an a a D and

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.520 
standard tuning so you got an a a D and
G<00:01:28.940> a<00:01:29.940> B<00:01:31.280> D<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.880> Heidi<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:34.049> actually<00:01:34.350> gives

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
G a B D and a Heidi it actually gives

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.060 
G a B D and a Heidi it actually gives
you<00:01:34.649> three<00:01:35.009> DS<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.670> 3d<00:01:36.600> it's<00:01:36.780> in<00:01:36.929> 3d

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.060 

it<00:01:40.580> is<00:01:40.760> which<00:01:41.090> means<00:01:41.330> when<00:01:41.540> you<00:01:41.570> get<00:01:42.470> a<00:01:42.860> big

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
it is which means when you get a big

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.920 
it is which means when you get a big
sound<00:01:43.370> and<00:01:43.640> she<00:01:44.030> can<00:01:44.150> do<00:01:44.300> this

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.800 

a<00:01:49.680> lot<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.790> what<00:01:50.940> Neil<00:01:51.120> Young<00:01:51.360> does<00:01:51.540> not<00:01:51.720> all

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
a lot of what Neil Young does not all

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.140 
a lot of what Neil Young does not all
kinds<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.170> songs<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:52.590> on<00:01:52.980> Ohio<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.700> goes<00:01:53.880> like

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
kinds of songs so on Ohio it goes like

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.040 
kinds of songs so on Ohio it goes like
this

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.130 

alright<00:01:59.770> that<00:02:00.370> very<00:02:00.520> well<00:02:00.670> but<00:02:00.850> basically<00:02:01.780> if

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
alright that very well but basically if

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.889 
alright that very well but basically if
you<00:02:02.230> look<00:02:02.350> at<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.740> left<00:02:03.070> hand<00:02:03.160> go

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.119 

you

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:13.129 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:15.069 

so<00:02:13.609> more<00:02:13.849> this<00:02:14.030> is<00:02:14.180> about<00:02:14.359> the<00:02:14.540> right<00:02:14.719> hand<00:02:14.959> the

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:15.079 
so more this is about the right hand the

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:23.690 
so more this is about the right hand the
left<00:02:15.109> hands<00:02:15.469> well<00:02:15.650> left<00:02:15.859> hands<00:02:16.040> going

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.010 

so<00:02:24.700> that's<00:02:24.910> basically<00:02:25.240> the<00:02:25.360> core<00:02:25.600> thing<00:02:25.810> so

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
so that's basically the core thing so

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.540 
so that's basically the core thing so
and<00:02:26.230> then<00:02:26.350> he's<00:02:26.470> worked<00:02:26.860> on<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.160> right<00:02:27.340> hand

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
and then he's worked on the right hand

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:37.420 
and then he's worked on the right hand
to<00:02:27.640> make<00:02:27.760> it<00:02:27.790> work

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.180 

and<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:39.260> don't<00:02:39.409> need<00:02:39.500> to<00:02:39.620> be<00:02:39.709> too<00:02:39.860> precise

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
and you don't need to be too precise

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.229 
and you don't need to be too precise
with<00:02:40.400> your<00:02:40.519> right<00:02:40.640> hand<00:02:40.730> when<00:02:40.970> you<00:02:41.030> played

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
with your right hand when you played

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:42.610 
with your right hand when you played
Neil<00:02:41.390> Young<00:02:41.569> because<00:02:41.780> he's<00:02:41.959> actually<00:02:42.140> kind<00:02:42.530> of

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
Neil Young because he's actually kind of

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.399 
Neil Young because he's actually kind of
a<00:02:43.269> sloppy<00:02:44.269> is<00:02:44.540> right<00:02:44.750> I<00:02:44.780> mean<00:02:44.930> it's<00:02:45.080> by<00:02:45.200> design

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
a sloppy is right I mean it's by design

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.160 
a sloppy is right I mean it's by design
but<00:02:46.280> he's<00:02:46.670> not<00:02:46.909> a<00:02:46.940> he's<00:02:47.330> not<00:02:47.360> a<00:02:47.510> precise<00:02:47.870> player

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
but he's not a he's not a precise player

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.899 
but he's not a he's not a precise player
and<00:02:48.349> it<00:02:48.409> gives<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:48.709> lot<00:02:48.890> of<00:02:48.920> it<00:02:49.099> brings<00:02:49.670> a<00:02:49.760> lot<00:02:49.849> of

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:49.909 
and it gives a lot of it brings a lot of

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.089 
and it gives a lot of it brings a lot of
his<00:02:50.090> feel<00:02:50.390> to<00:02:50.629> it<00:02:50.750> okay<00:02:51.319> and<00:02:51.500> so<00:02:51.799> what<00:02:51.980> he's

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
his feel to it okay and so what he's

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:53.860 
his feel to it okay and so what he's
doing<00:02:52.250> with<00:02:52.310> his<00:02:52.370> right<00:02:52.580> hand<00:02:52.730> is<00:02:52.909> he's<00:02:53.090> doing

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
doing with his right hand is he's doing

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.319 
doing with his right hand is he's doing
this<00:02:54.079> with<00:02:54.319> the<00:02:54.650> fat<00:02:55.069> part<00:02:55.370> of<00:02:55.519> his<00:02:55.610> hand<00:02:55.909> here

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
this with the fat part of his hand here

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.500 
this with the fat part of his hand here
he's<00:02:56.840> putting<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.769> strings<00:02:58.269> pumping<00:02:59.269> on<00:02:59.390> the

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
he's putting the strings pumping on the

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.910 
he's putting the strings pumping on the
strings<00:02:59.780> muting<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:00.290> strings<00:03:00.379> at<00:03:00.799> the<00:03:00.860> same

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
strings muting the strings at the same

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.330 
strings muting the strings at the same
time<00:03:01.340> he's<00:03:01.610> picking<00:03:01.940> and<00:03:02.930> that<00:03:03.170> makes<00:03:03.409> gives

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
time he's picking and that makes gives

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.360 
time he's picking and that makes gives
you<00:03:04.459> this<00:03:04.549> unique<00:03:04.610> ring

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:37.320 

gives<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.120> this<00:03:09.239> muting<00:03:09.569> ring<00:03:09.750> so<00:03:09.989> he<00:03:10.019> goes

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.170 

so<00:03:38.330> that's<00:03:39.400> that's<00:03:40.400> a<00:03:40.520> picking<00:03:40.820> pattern<00:03:41.090> that

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
so that's that's a picking pattern that
