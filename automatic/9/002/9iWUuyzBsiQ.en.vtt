ingredients water hops malt yeast malt

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.300 
ingredients water hops malt yeast malt
so<00:00:21.000> we<00:00:21.150> used<00:00:21.480> like<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.869> canvas<00:00:22.470> for<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.710> beer<00:00:22.920> it

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
so we used like a canvas for the beer it

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.279 
so we used like a canvas for the beer it
also<00:00:23.430> provides<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.180> lot<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.420> flavor<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:25.080> color

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
also provides a lot of flavor and color

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.980 
also provides a lot of flavor and color
so<00:00:25.590> our<00:00:25.710> average<00:00:25.920> beer<00:00:26.369> contains<00:00:26.970> around<00:00:27.449> 40

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
so our average beer contains around 40

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.169 
so our average beer contains around 40
kilograms<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.740> malt<00:00:28.980> per<00:00:29.279> battle<00:00:29.550> not<00:00:30.000> only

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
kilograms of malt per battle not only

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.999 
kilograms of malt per battle not only
does<00:00:30.300> this<00:00:30.420> keep<00:00:30.660> us<00:00:30.779> really<00:00:31.109> fit<00:00:31.349> but<00:00:31.920> it

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
does this keep us really fit but it

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.830 
does this keep us really fit but it
provides<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.460> vital<00:00:32.669> sugar<00:00:33.180> source<00:00:33.540> for<00:00:33.750> our

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
provides a vital sugar source for our

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.520 
provides a vital sugar source for our
fermentation<00:00:35.450> hops<00:00:36.450> do<00:00:36.660> three<00:00:36.960> things<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:37.410> our

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
fermentation hops do three things in our

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.299 
fermentation hops do three things in our
beers<00:00:38.719> yeah<00:00:39.719> add<00:00:39.809> bitterness<00:00:40.110> flavor<00:00:40.950> and

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
beers yeah add bitterness flavor and

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.420 
beers yeah add bitterness flavor and
aroma<00:00:42.110> during<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.200> 90<00:00:43.500> minute<00:00:43.800> boil<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.309> our

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
aroma during the 90 minute boil in our

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.580 
aroma during the 90 minute boil in our
brew<00:00:44.610> hell<00:00:44.879> we<00:00:45.480> revel<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.020> adding<00:00:46.320> as<00:00:46.410> much

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
brew hell we revel and adding as much

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.029 
brew hell we revel and adding as much
hops<00:00:46.920> as<00:00:47.100> we<00:00:47.219> can<00:00:47.460> we<00:00:47.730> use<00:00:47.910> 35<00:00:48.600> times<00:00:49.110> more<00:00:49.620> hops

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
hops as we can we use 35 times more hops

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.220 
hops as we can we use 35 times more hops
per<00:00:50.610> bottle<00:00:50.850> than<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> average<00:00:51.690> industrial

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230

beer<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:55.140> fermentation<00:00:55.559> tank<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.219> where<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
beer the fermentation tank is where the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.910 
beer the fermentation tank is where the
real<00:00:56.699> magic<00:00:56.940> happens<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.719> these<00:00:58.050> shiny<00:00:58.379> tanks

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
real magic happens in these shiny tanks

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.920 
real magic happens in these shiny tanks
a<00:00:59.039> newly<00:00:59.309> boiled<00:00:59.670> war<00:00:59.910> it's<00:01:00.180> transformed<00:01:00.840> it

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
a newly boiled war it's transformed it

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.689 
a newly boiled war it's transformed it
to<00:01:00.960> be<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.289> awesomeness<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.340> magic

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
to be the awesomeness the magic

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.039 
to be the awesomeness the magic
ingredient<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.480> used

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
ingredient is used

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.289 
ingredient is used
so<00:01:04.229> once<00:01:04.439> added<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.159> yeast<00:01:05.430> quickly<00:01:06.000> gets<00:01:06.210> to

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
so once added the yeast quickly gets to

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.810 
so once added the yeast quickly gets to
work<00:01:06.650> multiplying<00:01:07.650> eating<00:01:08.280> those<00:01:08.460> sugars

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
work multiplying eating those sugars

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.090 
work multiplying eating those sugars
turning<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.360> into<00:01:09.479> alcohol<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.380> more<00:01:10.409> mold<00:01:10.950> we

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
turning it into alcohol the more mold we

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.890 
turning it into alcohol the more mold we
put<00:01:11.310> in<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.460> mash<00:01:11.640> tun<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.330> higher<00:01:12.630> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
put in the mash tun the higher the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.620 
put in the mash tun the higher the
alcohol<00:01:13.260> content<00:01:13.590> for<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.010> final<00:01:14.369> beer<00:01:14.630> after

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
alcohol content for the final beer after

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.149 
alcohol content for the final beer after
fermentation<00:01:16.049> our<00:01:16.530> beers<00:01:16.799> undergo<00:01:17.130> a

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
fermentation our beers undergo a

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.280 
fermentation our beers undergo a
two-week<00:01:17.640> maturation<00:01:18.360> process<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:19.110> allows

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
two-week maturation process this allows

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.109 
two-week maturation process this allows
the<00:01:19.619> flavors<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.189> develop<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.820> marry

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
the flavors to develop and marry

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.270 
the flavors to develop and marry
together<00:01:21.420> we<00:01:21.900> had<00:01:21.990> loads<00:01:22.350> more<00:01:22.710> hops<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.189> the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
together we had loads more hops to the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.190 
together we had loads more hops to the
beer<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.729> processes<00:01:24.299> called<00:01:24.540> dry<00:01:24.780> hoping

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
beer and the processes called dry hoping

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.320 
beer and the processes called dry hoping
this<00:01:25.650> adds<00:01:25.890> an<00:01:26.040> avalanche<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.670> flavor<00:01:27.030> and

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
this adds an avalanche of flavor and

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.969 
this adds an avalanche of flavor and
aroma<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.840> really<00:01:28.140> explode<00:01:28.590> out<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.829> the

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
aroma that really explode out of the

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.920 
aroma that really explode out of the
glass<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.490> we<00:01:29.700> don't<00:01:29.850> use<00:01:29.970> any<00:01:30.180> additives<00:01:30.390> we
