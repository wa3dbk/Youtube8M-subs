00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
go Ida lost no muscle to my knowledge I

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.710 
go Ida lost no muscle to my knowledge I
kept<00:03:45.609> my<00:03:46.609> strength<00:03:46.940> for<00:03:47.180> every<00:03:47.419> single

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
kept my strength for every single

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.890 
kept my strength for every single
workout<00:03:48.609> that<00:03:49.609> might<00:03:49.849> be<00:03:50.090> I<00:03:50.480> don't<00:03:50.599> know<00:03:50.810> if

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
workout that might be I don't know if

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:51.970 
workout that might be I don't know if
this<00:03:51.049> has<00:03:51.199> anything<00:03:51.349> to<00:03:51.470> do<00:03:51.590> with<00:03:51.620> it

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
this has anything to do with it

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.180 
this has anything to do with it
I<00:03:52.010> think<00:03:52.250> that's<00:03:52.400> because<00:03:52.549> of<00:03:52.669> my<00:03:52.940> BCA's<00:03:53.980> so<00:03:54.980> if

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
I think that's because of my BCA's so if

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.369 
I think that's because of my BCA's so if
you<00:03:55.310> guys<00:03:55.459> go<00:03:55.669> on<00:03:55.699> a<00:03:55.849> cut<00:03:56.120> I<00:03:56.299> recommend<00:03:56.870> taking

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 
you guys go on a cut I recommend taking

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:59.680 
you guys go on a cut I recommend taking
branch<00:03:57.769> eight<00:03:57.949> amino<00:03:58.099> acids<00:03:58.699> maybe<00:03:59.239> twice<00:03:59.660> a

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
branch eight amino acids maybe twice a

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.259 
branch eight amino acids maybe twice a
day<00:03:59.959> I<00:03:59.989> just<00:04:00.260> do<00:04:00.530> once<00:04:00.709> a<00:04:00.799> day<00:04:00.889> I'd<00:04:01.010> do<00:04:01.190> it<00:04:01.340> I'd

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
day I just do once a day I'd do it I'd

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.559 
day I just do once a day I'd do it I'd
use<00:04:02.510> it<00:04:02.629> as<00:04:02.780> a<00:04:02.810> intro<00:04:03.470> workout<00:04:03.799> just<00:04:04.609> and<00:04:04.970> it

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
use it as a intro workout just and it

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.339 
use it as a intro workout just and it
keeps<00:04:05.780> me<00:04:05.930> refresh<00:04:06.349> basically<00:04:07.660> but<00:04:08.660> yeah<00:04:08.810> so<00:04:09.319> I

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
keeps me refresh basically but yeah so I

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.199 
keeps me refresh basically but yeah so I
would<00:04:09.709> rate<00:04:09.889> this<00:04:10.099> an<00:04:10.400> 8.5<00:04:11.389> out<00:04:11.540> of<00:04:11.569> 10<00:04:12.160> the

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
would rate this an 8.5 out of 10 the

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.250 
would rate this an 8.5 out of 10 the
oxyelite<00:04:14.209> pro<00:04:14.299> would<00:04:14.780> probably<00:04:15.019> be<00:04:15.079> like<00:04:15.230> a

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
oxyelite pro would probably be like a

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.279 
oxyelite pro would probably be like a
9.5<00:04:15.769> B<00:04:16.070> now<00:04:16.220> obviously<00:04:16.910> the<00:04:17.030> pro<00:04:17.239> is<00:04:17.419> just<00:04:17.660> the

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
9.5 B now obviously the pro is just the

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:21.640 
9.5 B now obviously the pro is just the
best<00:04:18.530> out<00:04:19.159> there<00:04:19.280> that<00:04:19.640> I'm<00:04:19.760> trying<00:04:20.349> so<00:04:21.349> what

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
best out there that I'm trying so what
