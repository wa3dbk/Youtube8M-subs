00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
all right so we are going to install

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.660 
all right so we are going to install
laminate<00:00:03.659> on<00:00:03.929> a<00:00:03.990> headlight<00:00:04.740> or<00:00:04.980> fog<00:00:05.400> light

with a dome convex or curvature shape to

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.180 
with a dome convex or curvature shape to
it<00:00:09.230> these<00:00:10.230> sometimes<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.860> little<00:00:10.950> bit<00:00:11.099> more

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
it these sometimes a little bit more

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.020 
it these sometimes a little bit more
complex<00:00:12.049> than<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.620> standard<00:00:14.040> flat<00:00:14.280> light<00:00:14.580> so

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
complex than the standard flat light so

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.760 
complex than the standard flat light so
I'm<00:00:15.480> going<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.690> show<00:00:15.839> you<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.049> best<00:00:16.260> technique

guts or whatnot because obviously once

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.979 
guts or whatnot because obviously once
you<00:00:38.610> put<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.850> lab<00:00:39.030> attacks<00:00:39.270> on<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.750> stays

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
you put the lab attacks on it it stays

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.930 
you put the lab attacks on it it stays
on<00:00:40.170> there<00:00:40.379> if<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:40.860> have<00:00:40.980> any<00:00:41.040> contaminants<00:00:41.820> on

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
on there if you have any contaminants on

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.940 
on there if you have any contaminants on
there<00:00:42.180> conventionally<00:00:42.829> prevent<00:00:43.829> the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
there conventionally prevent the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.770 
there conventionally prevent the
adhesive<00:00:44.340> from<00:00:44.430> really<00:00:44.940> sticking<00:00:45.210> down<00:00:45.510> and

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
adhesive from really sticking down and

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.410 
adhesive from really sticking down and
it<00:00:45.870> can<00:00:45.960> peel<00:00:46.200> back<00:00:46.230> up<00:00:46.710> or<00:00:46.950> curl<00:00:47.340> up<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.969> you

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
it can peel back up or curl up and you

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.389 
it can peel back up or curl up and you
don't<00:00:48.539> want<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.559> already<00:00:49.980> made<00:00:50.280> sure

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
don't want that so I already made sure

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.819 
don't want that so I already made sure
that<00:00:50.670> this<00:00:50.789> lens<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.270> thoroughly<00:00:51.750> cleaned<00:00:52.079> so

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
that this lens is thoroughly cleaned so

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.200 
that this lens is thoroughly cleaned so
what<00:00:53.250> we're<00:00:53.399> going<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.579> do<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:53.910> we're<00:00:54.059> going<00:00:54.149> to

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.479 
what we're going to do is we're going to
apply<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.510> film<00:00:54.870> on<00:00:55.110> right<00:00:55.680> now<00:00:56.070> if<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.340> have

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
apply the film on right now if you have

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.360 
apply the film on right now if you have
something<00:00:56.760> that's<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.600> know<00:00:57.739> 78<00:00:58.739> inches<00:00:59.160> or

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
something that's you know 78 inches or

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.240 
something that's you know 78 inches or
smaller<00:00:59.780> you<00:01:00.780> can<00:01:00.930> especially<00:01:01.649> with<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.070> shape

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
smaller you can especially with a shape

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.250 
smaller you can especially with a shape
like<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:02.460> just<00:01:03.120> apply<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.420> Landmarks<00:01:03.960> drive

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
like this just apply the Landmarks drive

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.140 
like this just apply the Landmarks drive
it's<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.949> lot<00:01:05.100> easier<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.519> way<00:01:05.790> than<00:01:06.030> trying

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
it's a lot easier that way than trying

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.270 
it's a lot easier that way than trying
to<00:01:06.330> do<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.450> wet<00:01:06.810> there<00:01:07.500> are<00:01:07.740> more<00:01:08.040> days<00:01:08.159> because

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
to do a wet there are more days because

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.679 
to do a wet there are more days because
if<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.549> have<00:01:08.700> moist<00:01:08.880> have<00:01:09.150> too<00:01:09.299> much<00:01:09.420> moisture

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
if you have moist have too much moisture

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.109 
if you have moist have too much moisture
it<00:01:10.409> could<00:01:10.590> curl<00:01:10.799> back<00:01:11.040> up<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.549> be<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.729> bit<00:01:12.090> more

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
it could curl back up and be a bit more

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.300 
it could curl back up and be a bit more
difficult<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.750> install<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.860> what<00:01:14.040> we're<00:01:14.189> going

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
difficult to install so what we're going

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.980 
difficult to install so what we're going
to<00:01:14.369> do<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.700> we're<00:01:14.850> going<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.060> take<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.600> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
to do is we're going to take you the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.910 
to do is we're going to take you the
little<00:01:16.229> X<00:01:16.409> from<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.979> liner<00:01:18.590> and<00:01:19.590> I'm<00:01:19.680> going<00:01:19.860> to

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
little X from the liner and I'm going to

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.770 
little X from the liner and I'm going to
start<00:01:20.220> by<00:01:20.580> lining<00:01:20.909> up<00:01:21.210> as<00:01:21.360> best<00:01:21.600> as<00:01:21.720> possible

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
start by lining up as best as possible

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.810 
start by lining up as best as possible
about<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:22.439> plate<00:01:22.680> has<00:01:22.890> alignment<00:01:23.280> nipples

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
about this plate has alignment nipples

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.370 
about this plate has alignment nipples
on<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.390> I'm<00:01:24.540> just<00:01:24.750> going<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:24.960> try<00:01:25.170> those

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
on it so I'm just going to try those

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.130 
on it so I'm just going to try those
Center<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.640> alignment<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.780> know<00:01:27.960> between

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
Center it and alignment you know between

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.160 
Center it and alignment you know between
the<00:01:28.470> nipples<00:01:28.799> as<00:01:28.890> best<00:01:29.130> as<00:01:29.250> possible<00:01:29.689> and<00:01:30.689> I'm

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
the nipples as best as possible and I'm

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.319 
the nipples as best as possible and I'm
just<00:01:31.350> going<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.650> stick<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.670> right<00:01:32.790> on<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
just going to stick it right on the

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.660 
just going to stick it right on the
center<00:01:33.509> part<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.189> then<00:01:35.189> I'm<00:01:35.340> just<00:01:35.430> going<00:01:35.610> to

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
center part and then I'm just going to

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.969 
center part and then I'm just going to
apply<00:01:35.900> starting<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:36.990> how<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.170> use<00:01:37.380> my<00:01:37.409> fingers

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
apply starting this how I use my fingers

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.700 
apply starting this how I use my fingers
and<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.369> circular<00:01:38.850> motion<00:01:39.200> then<00:01:40.200> going<00:01:40.560> my

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
and the circular motion then going my

down<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.790> road<00:02:03.799> so<00:02:04.799> I'm<00:02:05.040> just<00:02:05.250> still<00:02:05.490> doing

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
down the road so I'm just still doing

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.999 
down the road so I'm just still doing
going<00:02:06.119> on<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.299> circle<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.049> can<00:02:07.170> still<00:02:07.380> see

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
going on a circle and you can still see

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.350 
going on a circle and you can still see
it<00:02:08.160> in<00:02:08.220> somewhat<00:02:08.580> spots<00:02:08.910> where<00:02:09.119> it's<00:02:09.239> actually

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
it in somewhat spots where it's actually

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.660 
it in somewhat spots where it's actually
bunching<00:02:09.929> up<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.709> only<00:02:10.860> just<00:02:11.160> kind<00:02:11.459> of<00:02:11.489> just

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
bunching up and only just kind of just

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.180 
bunching up and only just kind of just
make

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
make

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.810 
make
personals<00:02:13.000> areas<00:02:13.390> down<00:02:13.690> but<00:02:14.490> distribute<00:02:15.490> the

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
personals areas down but distribute the

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.180 
personals areas down but distribute the
Lamanites<00:02:16.240> equally<00:02:16.900> we<00:02:17.320> doing<00:02:17.620> about<00:02:17.830> the

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
Lamanites equally we doing about the

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.860 
Lamanites equally we doing about the
bunch<00:02:18.490> up<00:02:18.670> in<00:02:18.760> one<00:02:18.940> particular<00:02:19.210> area<00:02:19.480> so<00:02:19.750> you

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
bunch up in one particular area so you

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.510 
bunch up in one particular area so you
get<00:02:19.990> one<00:02:20.200> huge<00:02:20.440> crease<00:02:20.800> because<00:02:21.070> I<00:02:21.100> don't<00:02:21.340> pop

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
get one huge crease because I don't pop

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.360 
get one huge crease because I don't pop
back<00:02:21.760> up<00:02:21.940> later<00:02:22.210> on<00:02:22.360> down<00:02:22.540> there

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
back up later on down there

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.110 
back up later on down there
so<00:02:24.370> just<00:02:24.580> keep<00:02:24.790> going<00:02:25.060> a<00:02:25.180> circular<00:02:25.660> motion

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
so just keep going a circular motion

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.640 
so just keep going a circular motion
when<00:02:28.120> I<00:02:28.210> get<00:02:28.390> close<00:02:28.570> to<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:28.750> edge<00:02:29.020> I<00:02:29.290> can<00:02:29.320> just

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
when I get close to the edge I can just

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:43.320 
when I get close to the edge I can just
push<00:02:29.980> down<00:02:33.150> feel<00:02:34.150> small<00:02:34.510> wrinkles<00:02:42.330> that's

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
push down feel small wrinkles that's

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.720 
push down feel small wrinkles that's
good<00:02:43.660> now<00:02:43.990> I'm<00:02:44.080> going<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.350> take<00:02:44.530> my<00:02:44.710> take<00:02:45.580> my

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
good now I'm going to take my take my

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.130 
good now I'm going to take my take my
cutting<00:02:46.240> tool<00:02:46.510> and<00:02:46.900> cut<00:02:47.320> the<00:02:47.410> tabs<00:02:47.650> off<00:02:49.140> just

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
cutting tool and cut the tabs off just

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.960 
cutting tool and cut the tabs off just
scoring<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.680> film<00:02:50.890> not<00:02:51.190> cutting<00:02:51.700> all<00:02:51.820> the<00:02:51.940> way

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
scoring the film not cutting all the way

00:02:51.970 --> 00:03:03.309 
scoring the film not cutting all the way
through<00:02:52.090> it

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.119 

you<00:03:04.319> want<00:03:04.530> a<00:03:04.709> sweep<00:03:05.099> around<00:03:05.310> it<00:03:06.349> and<00:03:07.349> there<00:03:08.099> you

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
you want a sweep around it and there you

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.699 
you want a sweep around it and there you
are<00:03:08.370> laminates<00:03:09.299> installed<00:03:09.750> perfectly

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
are laminates installed perfectly

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.490 
are laminates installed perfectly
without<00:03:10.829> any<00:03:11.040> wrinkles<00:03:11.640> on<00:03:12.239> the<00:03:12.480> light<00:03:12.689> with

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
without any wrinkles on the light with

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.729 
without any wrinkles on the light with
the<00:03:13.590> convex<00:03:14.099> curve<00:03:14.640> in<00:03:15.060> shape<00:03:15.360> to<00:03:15.629> it<00:03:15.659> and<00:03:15.989> this

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
the convex curve in shape to it and this

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.640 
the convex curve in shape to it and this
is<00:03:16.920> our<00:03:17.010> Gunsmoke<00:03:17.579> film<00:03:17.879> so<00:03:18.629> that's<00:03:19.409> pretty

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
is our Gunsmoke film so that's pretty
