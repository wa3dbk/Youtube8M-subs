at the bottom if you don't stir it

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.679 
at the bottom if you don't stir it
properly<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.859> will<00:00:26.070> get<00:00:26.250> fat<00:00:26.880> accumulated<00:00:27.359> at

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
properly you will get fat accumulated at

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.450 
properly you will get fat accumulated at
the<00:00:27.720> bottom<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.619> will<00:00:28.740> get<00:00:28.830> lumps<00:00:29.279> like

the bottom and you will get lumps like
this<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.289> eventually<00:00:31.289> after<00:00:31.500> some<00:00:31.800> time<00:00:32.070> it

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
this and eventually after some time it

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.490 
this and eventually after some time it
will<00:00:32.430> start<00:00:32.550> burning<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.480> your<00:00:33.960> milk<00:00:34.230> will

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
will start burning and your milk will

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.150 
will start burning and your milk will
get<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.890> burnt<00:00:35.790> smell<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.320> better<00:00:37.800> to

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
get a burnt smell so it is better to

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.040 
get a burnt smell so it is better to
keep<00:00:38.309> on<00:00:38.550> stirring<00:00:38.820> until<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.450> comes<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:40.020> a

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
keep on stirring until it comes to a

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
boil once it comes to a boil you can

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:47.569 
boil once it comes to a boil you can
stop<00:00:45.539> stirring<00:00:45.870> continuously<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.340> can

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
stop stirring continuously and you can

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.930 
stop stirring continuously and you can
still<00:00:48.420> occasionally<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.410> have<00:00:49.640> reduced<00:00:50.640> the

still occasionally and have reduced the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.040 
still occasionally and have reduced the
power<00:00:51.539> from<00:00:52.320> high<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.649> medium<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.809> the<00:00:54.809> milk

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
power from high to medium and the milk

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.619 
power from high to medium and the milk
will<00:00:55.260> keep<00:00:55.440> on<00:00:55.649> coming<00:00:56.039> up<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.579> have<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.789> stir

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
will keep on coming up you have to stir

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.470 
will keep on coming up you have to stir
it<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.020> bring<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.410> down<00:00:58.559> periodically<00:00:59.449> so<00:01:00.449> I

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
it and bring it down periodically so I

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.290 
it and bring it down periodically so I
am<00:01:00.629> going<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.079> do<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.649> until<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.969> reduced

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
am going to do this until it is reduced

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.410 
am going to do this until it is reduced
in<00:01:03.870> volume<00:01:04.339> completely<00:01:05.339> there<00:01:05.760> should<00:01:05.939> be<00:01:06.090> no

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
in volume completely there should be no

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.410 
in volume completely there should be no
moisture<00:01:06.930> at<00:01:07.080> all<00:01:07.290> now<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.250> can<00:01:08.580> see<00:01:08.850> the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
moisture at all now you can see the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.170 
moisture at all now you can see the
white<00:01:09.689> color<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.350> milk<00:01:10.619> has<00:01:11.220> fader<00:01:11.850> and

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
white color of the milk has fader and

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.359 
white color of the milk has fader and
you<00:01:12.330> have<00:01:12.450> started<00:01:13.110> getting<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.560> creamy<00:01:13.979> color

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
you have started getting a creamy color

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.730 
you have started getting a creamy color
and<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:15.420> can<00:01:15.600> see<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.900> milk<00:01:16.080> will<00:01:16.320> keep<00:01:16.530> on

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
and you can see the milk will keep on

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.929 
and you can see the milk will keep on
coming<00:01:16.950> up<00:01:17.250> like<00:01:17.490> this

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
coming up like this

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.109 
coming up like this
so<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:19.820> stir<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.240> allow<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.409> boil

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
so just stir it and allow it to boil

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.840 
so just stir it and allow it to boil
continuously<00:01:24.170> also<00:01:25.170> take<00:01:25.500> care<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.130> scrap<00:01:26.610> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
continuously also take care to scrap the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.390 
continuously also take care to scrap the
edges<00:01:27.509> periodically<00:01:28.320> otherwise<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.189> fat

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
edges periodically otherwise the fat

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.060 
edges periodically otherwise the fat
will<00:01:29.640> get<00:01:29.850> accumulated<00:01:30.210> there<00:01:30.630> as<00:01:30.900> well<00:01:31.200> so

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
will get accumulated there as well so

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.850 
will get accumulated there as well so
you<00:01:32.640> have<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:33.030> stir<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.570> periodically<00:01:34.110> as<00:01:34.560> well

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
you have to stir it periodically as well

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.429 
you have to stir it periodically as well
as<00:01:35.009> scrap<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.640> edges<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.020> don't<00:01:37.259> get

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
as scrap the edges so that you don't get

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.609 
as scrap the edges so that you don't get
the<00:01:37.710> burnt<00:01:38.070> smell<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.700> spoil<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.119> dish<00:01:39.619> now

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
the burnt smell and spoil the dish now

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.749 
the burnt smell and spoil the dish now
it<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.430> almost<00:01:41.880> reduced<00:01:42.450> one<00:01:43.259> third<00:01:43.619> has<00:01:44.520> been

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
it is almost reduced one third has been

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.090 
it is almost reduced one third has been
reduced<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.420> two-third<00:01:46.079> remaining<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:46.770> there

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
reduced and two-third remaining is there

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.960 
reduced and two-third remaining is there
so<00:01:47.759> again<00:01:48.090> keep<00:01:48.509> on<00:01:48.720> continuing<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:50.159> if<00:01:50.610> you

it<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.530> called<00:02:04.829> as<00:02:05.009> beta<00:02:05.340> or<00:02:05.670> milk<00:02:06.479> sweet<00:02:06.780> and

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
it is called as beta or milk sweet and

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.619 
it is called as beta or milk sweet and
thing<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.920> there<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.429> only<00:02:08.729> slight<00:02:09.060> difference

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
thing so there is only slight difference

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.740 
thing so there is only slight difference
for<00:02:09.840> both<00:02:10.080> these<00:02:10.730> varieties<00:02:11.730> but<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.569> base

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
for both these varieties but the base

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.820 
for both these varieties but the base
remains

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
remains

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.800 
remains
now<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.190> can<00:02:14.489> see<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.970> has<00:02:15.120> started<00:02:15.209> to

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
now you can see it has started to

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.860 
now you can see it has started to
thicken<00:02:16.170> well<00:02:16.680> now<00:02:17.400> at<00:02:17.670> this<00:02:18.090> stage<00:02:18.420> you<00:02:18.690> have

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
thicken well now at this stage you have

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.260 
thicken well now at this stage you have
to<00:02:19.080> be<00:02:19.200> very<00:02:19.500> careful<00:02:20.130> even<00:02:20.700> if<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:20.880> take<00:02:21.090> your

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
to be very careful even if you take your

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.510 
to be very careful even if you take your
hand<00:02:21.660> out<00:02:21.840> for<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.200> single<00:02:22.620> minute<00:02:22.980> it<00:02:23.280> will

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
hand out for a single minute it will

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.460 
hand out for a single minute it will
start<00:02:23.849> burning<00:02:24.090> this<00:02:24.540> is<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.690> very<00:02:24.989> sensitive

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
start burning this is a very sensitive

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.740 
start burning this is a very sensitive
face<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:26.459> I<00:02:26.489> have<00:02:26.760> changed<00:02:27.300> to<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.480> spatula

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
face so I have changed to a spatula

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.199 
face so I have changed to a spatula
instead<00:02:28.170> of<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.650> spoon<00:02:28.980> that<00:02:29.459> is<00:02:29.610> easy<00:02:29.910> for

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
instead of a spoon that is easy for

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.990 
instead of a spoon that is easy for
scraping<00:02:30.599> it<00:02:31.050> you<00:02:31.470> can<00:02:31.680> see<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:32.280> is<00:02:32.459> almost

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
scraping it you can see it is almost

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.229 
scraping it you can see it is almost
thickened<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:34.670> moisture<00:02:35.670> has<00:02:35.790> completely

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
thickened the moisture has completely

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.420 
thickened the moisture has completely
gone<00:02:36.630> but<00:02:37.019> there<00:02:37.260> is<00:02:37.349> still<00:02:37.440> more<00:02:37.830> moisture

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
gone but there is still more moisture

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.699 
gone but there is still more moisture
now<00:02:39.000> if<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:39.360> are<00:02:39.450> preparing<00:02:39.930> pankova

now if you are preparing pankova
this<00:02:40.890> is<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.190> perfect<00:02:41.670> stage<00:02:41.970> before<00:02:42.390> it

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
this is the perfect stage before it

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.050 
this is the perfect stage before it
becomes<00:02:42.840> much<00:02:43.170> dry<00:02:43.530> you<00:02:44.010> must<00:02:44.220> add<00:02:44.430> sugar<00:02:44.880> to

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
becomes much dry you must add sugar to

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.690 
becomes much dry you must add sugar to
