00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 Impressions from the r1 we catch up 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.970
 a tour of the region around 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.910
 abbas title and you according to what 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.710
 We read in the trade press 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.350
 the motorcycle is for his class 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.330
 almost unbelievably official one 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.780
 Thousands in a 600 of the chassis too 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.060
 to build 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.099
 so is the order to the engineers 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.310
 clearly the guys have a 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:23.859
 salary increase earned 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.529
 such an agile thousands or 900 gives 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:27.910
 It can not be effortless again 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.570
 the bike through curves of all kinds 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.849
 conduct 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.730
 no wonder was 200 kilograms weight 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.680
 Ready to drive, mind you, there is a 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.390
 comfortable sitting position for the driver 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.769
 We recommend only to the passenger 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.920
 in the face of the emergency seat is a 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:42.910
 mountain bike that is always comfortable 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.739
 everything works perfectly 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.050
 the gear shifts in ours 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.460
 r1 easily play the clutch 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.420
 inconspicuous and even the windbreak 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.799
 is amazingly good until tempo 150 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.629
 Overall, you will not get rid of the feeling 

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:57.010
 that the motorcycle does not yet 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.920
 started has to work 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.260
 no wonder 150 ps needs on the 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.710
 nobody is still sleeping 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.299
 the best way is back to alberta 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.520
 Now let's get to the bottom of it 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:12.040
 go and look at it once 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.590
 she looks compact in her stature yes 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.700
 but still forced the front 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.950
 is characterized by the oblique 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.330
 open space headlights at the same time 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.400
 to guarantee good light 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.170
 in many details with the outbreak with 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.750
 Carbon shell becomes the consistent 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.850
 lightweight significantly all suspensions and 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.250
 Steering systems are filigree 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.500
 came for gram with weight saved 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.580
 unfortunately also in the wrong place that 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.530
 Frame tail is welded 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.600
 City repair friendly screwed 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.340
 A special feature of the brakes 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.370
 the saddles are made of a cast piece 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.380
 manufactured and thus extremely stiff murks 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.180
 turn on the coupling the outer rod 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.070
 towers over the engine and should 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.070
 The first fall in the rushes go 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.700
 a look under the disguise 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.550
 reveals a little miracle 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.370
 compactness and lightness with 65 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.990
 kilogram, the 1 motor is just 15 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.050
 kilogram heavier than the engine of the 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.000
 plant ducati in the superbike wm five 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.979
 valves per cylinder extra 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.350
 Load control and forties carburetor 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.720
 help the engine to 150 ps and one 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.610
 raised torque curve 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.920
 but now applies on the race track 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.560
 He once revealed all her potential 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.990
 achieved a lot she says in the exchange rates is 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.060
 almost unbelievable how easy to handle 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.370
 and power to an explosive mixture 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.230
 society 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.000
 in direct comparison must now the 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.190
 Honda fireblade stretch the weapons 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.440
 the kawasaki zx 10r can still compete 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.280
 with increasing speed 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.140
 he once revealed her too 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.480
 problematic side of her 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.070
 suspension geometry hard on the limit results 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.410
 a restless front part in the 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.770
 Extreme case until the handlebars strike lead 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.840
 can 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.340
 a phenomenon that also when driving over 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.010
 of ground waves on the highway 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.200
 turns up then it becomes life threatening 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.210
 on the other hand, on the other hand, stand the 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.890
 Let's do something for a while 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.520
 better we have not yet 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.110
 hazards 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.710
 on the other hand, we would raise those 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:07.160
 reach michel 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:09.740
 b 58 swap remains at the end 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.960
 ambiguous conclusion of the once is with 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.930
 safety the most fascinating sportbike 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.970
 that came from japan in recent years 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.470
 And the hands of inexperienced drivers can do it 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.930
 also easy to a kieler motorcycle 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.980

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.120
 security discussions will trigger 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.550
