00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:32.000
 the route next to the dragon walk and nokia 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:34.399
 money very well I played three hours of 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.579
 bombai flame with this playing time is 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.950
 impossible and unfair to make a detour 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.730
 game but I can at least explain and 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:51.800
 say macaé bomb play me bomb 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:54.559
 was produced by AIDS and is a 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.110
 action now at the beginning the story is about 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:02.420
 ice creatures that want to dominate the 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.530
 planet and your character the vulcan is 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.290
 that's right 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.409
 This is the name of the main character. 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:12.229
 by luck or chance it ends up being possessed and 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.689
 dividing body with the demon power of 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:18.229
 very mysterious fire 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:22.899
 hence the name of the game drew puts father 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.899
 play on a bid 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:40.700
 so it fits the mouth 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:46.250
 riga unravel the secrets of the devil and 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.990
 end the threat posed cold 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.660
 Improvements and cold looks like I'm 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.740
 talking about that ice cream rum raisin 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:57.400
 that my mother would choose to serve would have 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.400
 cold threat 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.390
 As I said the game is an action RPG and 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.239
 combat slow as it is in time 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.610
 real is almost a rock slash and to be 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.670
 sincere after watching the trailers 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:43.090
 I thought the game would be crap. 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:47.590
 total the game and mainly combat 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:50.260
 but I was wrong, combat is nice 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.140
 combat blog is cool in a way 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.630
 Strange I'm needing the stranger. 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.959
 and if there is such a word of 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.150
 combat strangeness is one of the most 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.150
 fight and take the cybershot camera to 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.420
 times already mira does not work right 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.970
 but it's fun it's kind of like that dog 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.940
 hot late at night after the ballad 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.459
 When you go to the ballad and 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.700
 see for the first time for this disgusting 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:21.430
 You're never going to eat but by five o'clock. 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.980
 of the morning you buy one ends up 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.870
 delighting even as the other and 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.360
 still exchange an idea the dog's uncle 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.680
 hot and turns your partner is over or 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.209
 least this 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.910
 so this is the bout summarizing 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.040
 Weird nerd more cool and you can 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.650
 make various congos the different weapons 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.540
 magic scrolls have done evil Stélvio 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.540
 so the combat is very varied 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:57.290
 within three hours of a player or 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:59.650
 open 3 that the 3 you are putting 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.120
 points and opening new skills 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.090
 As your character evolves 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.980
 classic thing in a rpg you too 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.250
 many items that can be 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.680
 equipped filipe serving to be 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.140
 used for creating new items 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.840
 that old man to stay in the world of rpgs 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.180

 less not on playstation 3 the music 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.260
 it is also not memorable and the dubbing 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:25.760
 also not the best but by 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.669
