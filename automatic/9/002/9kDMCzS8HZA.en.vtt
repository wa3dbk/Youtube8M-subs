00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 Hello everyone from the Tuscan pipe today 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.370
 I will show a gameplay on thor the bucks 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.759
 a rather particular game that 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:15.560
 consists of ruthless fighting 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.670
 to the last blood by moving limbs 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.660
 nothing we will first go to 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:25.080
 warm up in the file school so to 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.269
 buoys to explain a little to the mechanics of 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.310
 game 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:34.460
 ok perfect one thing is not much going 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:38.210
 food so giving you ray muscles then 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:42.170
 we will choose which one 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:46.760
 muscle so click to do 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:52.489
 an action in this case will have to 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:58.000
 select the bibs and tomorrow so 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:01:00.979
 to try to hold on to it is then 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.280
 then to start 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:04.940
 let 's say the move we have to press bar 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.810
 space 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:15.039
 and voila he did they did 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.039
 his move I made mine 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:26.530
 now we have to rest the case i 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:34.640
 muscles to say fight faith 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:44.329
 to remove the whole is poor to bring it down 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:48.490
 land left in my bed one 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.490
 kick the ribs 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:02:11.400
 this is not new to see 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.810
 because it is an achille judo coin if 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.810
 you touch the ground you lost 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.770
 and nothing even though at this point it was not 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:26.440
 lost, however, there is this against us 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:37.180
 born we must try to throw it away 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:39.960
 off the line or on the ground, yes 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.960
 gives up 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:09.090
 front mom hard to use the 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.750
 sponge of the salt to turn me the 43 tena 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.750
 at least try 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:25.969
 I can't find it so I did 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:46.220
 is about to fall to the ground no no not good 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:50.849
 for nothing I put a lot of world gods 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:56.790
 it's happening with terrible that i am 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:04:10.340
 of the two is determined to lose rammed 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:13.200
 Body head I now agree with me 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.410
 I think he lost him being who he is 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.479
 practically then from the line it was 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.489
 when on the ground so much 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.229
 I probably won 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.190
 I take this opportunity to explain two or three 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:28.229
 things then that little red thing 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:33.750
 we practically play like this 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:36.659
 that that pretty much he who says what 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:42.060
 what will happen if new ones determine 

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:45.120
 muscles so we say that it is very useful 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.040
 then in the upper right corner there are 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.169
 written our names with above gods 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:55.200
 numbers numbers would be the damage it is 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:05:03.389
 did the opponent fact he 7400 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:07.080
 10,000 11,000 87 870 sorry enough in 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:14.570
 low there is the chat as you can see in 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:14.570
 bottom right to left and that's it 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:23.790
 nothing then wait now 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:28.830
 I finish the round at the end of the joke 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:31.139
 game there is a final video on the video 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:44.580
 practically shows all the moves you 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:48.900
 they were done well now I won 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:50.310
 so I can't make it from scratch, nobody knows 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:54.210
 still a lot I haven't understood yet 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:57.800
 well the reason but it is so i pretty much 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:01.380
 to do it all over again you have to take esk 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.470
 fight school is another time of 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.630
 choose challenger ray 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:09.680
