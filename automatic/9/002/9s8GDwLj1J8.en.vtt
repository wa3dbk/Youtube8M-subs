reason I reserved it for Xbox 360 I'm

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.620 
reason I reserved it for Xbox 360 I'm
really<00:01:17.690> not<00:01:17.810> sure<00:01:18.110> why<00:01:18.530> but<00:01:19.040> I<00:01:19.490> guess<00:01:20.390> I<00:01:20.510> made

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
really not sure why but I guess I made

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.380 
really not sure why but I guess I made
the<00:01:20.720> right<00:01:20.840> choice<00:01:20.900> at<00:01:21.380> least<00:01:21.530> during

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
the right choice at least during

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.340 
the right choice at least during
considering<00:01:23.390> consoles<00:01:23.900> because<00:01:24.200> what

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
considering consoles because what

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.650 
considering consoles because what
they're<00:01:24.470> saying<00:01:24.500> is<00:01:25.060> this<00:01:26.060> game<00:01:26.270> does<00:01:26.479> have<00:01:26.510> a

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
they're saying is this game does have a

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.740 
they're saying is this game does have a
mandatory<00:01:26.990> install<00:01:27.680> on<00:01:27.950> PlayStation<00:01:28.940> 3<00:01:29.330> it

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
mandatory install on PlayStation 3 it

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.609 
mandatory install on PlayStation 3 it
has<00:01:29.900> a<00:01:29.930> optional<00:01:30.650> install<00:01:31.100> on<00:01:31.340> Xbox<00:01:31.790> 360<00:01:32.479> and<00:01:32.660> I

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
has a optional install on Xbox 360 and I

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.320 
has a optional install on Xbox 360 and I
actually<00:01:33.979> have<00:01:34.220> a<00:01:34.250> much<00:01:34.460> larger<00:01:34.729> hard<00:01:35.150> drive

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
actually have a much larger hard drive

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.330 
actually have a much larger hard drive
on<00:01:35.450> my<00:01:35.479> Xbox<00:01:35.900> 360<00:01:36.470> so<00:01:36.500> I'll<00:01:36.680> probably<00:01:36.830> be<00:01:37.160> doing

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
on my Xbox 360 so I'll probably be doing

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.420 
on my Xbox 360 so I'll probably be doing
that<00:01:37.610> install<00:01:38.470> to<00:01:39.470> speed<00:01:40.009> up<00:01:40.130> the<00:01:40.250> loading

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
that install to speed up the loading

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.100 
that install to speed up the loading
times<00:01:40.850> and<00:01:41.150> when<00:01:41.270> you<00:01:41.360> install<00:01:41.810> it<00:01:41.930> on<00:01:42.020> the

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
times and when you install it on the

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.050 
times and when you install it on the
Xbox<00:01:42.440> 360<00:01:42.680> supposedly<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:43.580> loading<00:01:43.880> times

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
Xbox 360 supposedly the loading times

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.300 
Xbox 360 supposedly the loading times
are<00:01:44.210> faster<00:01:44.390> than<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.380> PlayStation<00:01:45.920> 3<00:01:46.130> so

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
are faster than the PlayStation 3 so

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.550 
are faster than the PlayStation 3 so
that's<00:01:46.460> pretty<00:01:46.670> cool<00:01:46.990> but<00:01:47.990> anyway<00:01:48.259> let's<00:01:48.410> take

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
that's pretty cool but anyway let's take

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.590 
that's pretty cool but anyway let's take
a<00:01:48.590> look<00:01:48.800> at<00:01:48.890> what<00:01:48.979> you<00:01:49.100> get<00:01:49.509> with<00:01:50.509> the
