00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.570
 the fastest car in the world and fought 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.790
 recently here in Sweden is not what 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.610
 one waits for the land that saw the birth of 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.419
 dust but you know we're not talking about the 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.419
 typical Swedish 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.920
 they say that being successful depends on loving what 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.490
 what are you doing 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.490
 confirms it 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.920
 with little more than 30 years old cristian started 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.649
 his career selling perfumes today or 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.079
 frozen and plastic bags all for 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:42.590
 finance your great passion to build 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:46.030
 very fast cars in August 2005 its 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:50.210
 action comics reached the amazing 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.270
 388 kilometers per hour or 241 miles per 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.610
 hour 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.430
 speed records is something that husband 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:01.240
 but finally the cis has already broken the 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.700
 brand that maintained in mclaren formula 1 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.850
 incredibly the physio made that 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.220
 record running on a circular track 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.810
 we achieved our speed record 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.730
 running on a circular track which 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.830
 reduced our brand but it was the only 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.840
 track available on this occasion now 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.730
 we look for a place where we can run 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.150
 in a straight line and thus overcome the record 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.940
 current 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:26.090
 shortly after the record was beaten by a 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:29.870
 bugatti veyron cristian wants to recover 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.240
 the distinction for Sweden with the former Sisi 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.280
 in the 50s a mile was aspired 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.910
 four minutes now they want to overcome the 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.500
 400 km but it would be good to achieve 250 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.570
 miles per hour that are almost 400 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.750
 kilometers per hour I hope that 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.250
 we can get to that very soon 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.550
 remember this is a car that can 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:53.730
 buy although the 13 is quite high 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:56.160
 about 650 thousand dollars 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.900
 supposedly at this moment I will 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.120
 I could tell you some details of the 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.160
 car for example that possesses high 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.160
 technology but it would make them wait 

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:09.380
 tests first and comment after 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.230
 and I hope my mom is not looking 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.840
 I must admit that I am extremely 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.650
 nervous and I have reasons to spare for 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.260
 be it 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.600
 the tsjex is almost as fast as the most 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.090
 fast from the rosters but we do not have a 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.580
 parachute to stop us 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.730
 Cristian, I'll just say a word but I do not 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.410
 I know if the brakes are very very powerful in 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.180
 this car are made of carbon 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.220
 ceramic and originate in the industry 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.519
 aeronautics at 100 kilometers per hour 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.650
 are 31 meters in stop and good at 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:45.390
 less that distance the end of the track and 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.390
 he agreed to go for an excellent round 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.959
 first turns at full speed 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.400
 do not 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.160
 now in a straight line to test your 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.160
 speed 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.230
 tell me what speed costs 160 kilometers 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.370
 per hour 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.370
 170 per hour 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.020
 rather 216 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.280
 at 150 miles per hour that's 240 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.590
 kilometers per hour still far from the 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.900
 maximum speed of this car but they 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.120
 sure is definitely the fastest 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.370
 that has been in a car but thanks to 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.130
 design feels very safe and very 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.460
 stable even in turns and curves is 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.460
 fascinating 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.720
 so much emotion we can use it that 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.970
 Kristen calls the delicate balance 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:12.250
 Between high performance and beautiful design 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.220
 I do not like to add to the car accessories 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:18.100
 that are not useful that only decorate us 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:22.360
 we have inspired a lot in aircraft birds 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:27.240
 dolphins things that are aerodynamic and 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:29.650
 that help us in our design 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.290
 good for example you can see it here 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.540
 this is a part with form from the end 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.610
 that is to say with two dolphins that jump from the 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.220
 water and the front of the car has 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.990
 something also with its blunt nose and a 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.230
 expression lasts but without losing the 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.960
 aerodynamic appearance the aerodynamics of the 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.210
 auto is its main feature the 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.240
 air is driven by the sides of the car 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.040
 enters the engine warms up expands 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.920
 and it is propelled towards what cristian calls 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.200
 the duck tail by that means we increase 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.090
 much the efficiency of the small tail 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.980
 of duck in the back what 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.870
 generates all the gravitational force that 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.550
 can capture with your grenade instead of 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.770
 a spoiler that restricts the flow of air 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.270
 then it means to take advantage of the air 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.790
 that flows around the palate to 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.220
 windshield and body 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.790
 the car and it comes out of the skate tail 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.610
 imprison confidence 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.740
 It is a very refined engineering but there 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.010
 more in this car than dolphins and tail 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.010
 duck 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.690
 what impressed me the most about this car 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.479
 is directly related to the 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.310
 speed sex is a great example of 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:36.139
 individual creation that teaches the 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.120
 great manufacturers how the 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:40.729
 things the first thing I noticed are the 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.199
 forces is a very wide car so with 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:44.300
 traditional forces or calls 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:46.550
 Seagull wings would have many 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.960
 problems in the parking lots there were 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.940
 experts who said it was a 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.400
 impossible alternative but cristian 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:55.920
 he invented a mechanism that goes up and runs 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:58.890
 the forces in a fluid movement 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.450
 so much for this auto land options and 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.640
 the cis and ex transforms into 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.850
 convertible by removing the roof and 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:08.460
 keep it under the hood is such a good idea 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:11.540
 that a great competitor of comics he already 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.540
 use it in your models 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.680
 if you have never sat in a 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:21.990
 high performance sports car les 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.390
 will be very surprised to know this detail 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.490
 far from being uncomfortable this seat is 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.630
 designed for 2 meters people is 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.430
 say very high 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.230
 cristian says he has no loss 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.590
 customers as soccer players and 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.590
 basketball 

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:39.219
 Athletic mind my getting in and out of 

00:06:36.619 --> 00:06:39.219
 this car 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:50.370
 and will try to beat the record soon 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:50.370
 and of course I give him co-pilot
