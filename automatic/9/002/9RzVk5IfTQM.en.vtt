00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.770
 so that people know what you do 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.990

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.960
 model is the boat carlos 83 we can 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.470

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.470
 hydraulic 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.479
 is that people also know that there is no 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.609
 to judge the race by how we 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.200
 we dress because the appearance is a 

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:29.969
 wave but but we also 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.740
 we change and we are decent people and not 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:34.969

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.969

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.020

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.680
 9 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:09.950
 you're a battler who does not do anything 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:13.190
 he works and he also has his ship 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.190
 sports well 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.930
 explaining bone 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.640
 with its face of 10 switches to observe 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.640
 it seems like 10 tricks 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:39.190
 I have like a little more two years 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:44.020
 modifications of new elements and 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.020
 Original originals did not bring us 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.520
 to 100% 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:06.400
 and now that I'm better known 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.800
 like the pair because it sucks blood today to 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.690

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.910
 bus and I said little then 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.530
 hundreds of Iraqis what kind of 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.020
 buses 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.200
 of the new plant where once the 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.880
 model is clean an impala 6-4 where 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.610
 you are going to show us the interiors and 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.370
 all are blue kennedy king outside 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.370
 also in stretched blue vinyl skin 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.800
 in this style the original ryder 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.900
 your board in your interiors that 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.700
 you modified something in the snow your things 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.630
 chromed chromed board that has its 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.160
 original style if you separate this 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.930
 everything that these glasses go up and down in 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.330
 the car that pulls if in your painting that 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.330
 be the style the raiders good god 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.880
 how much I invested them and I bought it for myself 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.530
 leonera company yes yes I think that the 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.709
 camera he invested about 150 thousand 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.709
 pesos 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.950
 this is the club but the best because it is 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:04.700
 the only one that climbs the hydraulics that 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:08.000
 those classics look like the number 1 rolling 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:11.590
 the street minus that of this club as soon as 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.590
