a<00:00:06.509> little<00:00:06.720> bit<00:00:06.930> more<00:00:07.080> complicated<00:00:07.470> than<00:00:08.010> say

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
a little bit more complicated than say

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.810

making<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.480> face<00:00:09.630> mask<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.400> it<00:00:11.400> might<00:00:11.700> be

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
making a face mask and it might be

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.060 
making a face mask and it might be
quicker<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.210> do<00:00:12.330> it<00:00:12.420> this<00:00:12.540> way<00:00:12.750> so<00:00:13.290> let's<00:00:13.799> see

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
shown scientifically that it contains

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.900 
shown scientifically that it contains
more<00:00:42.750> antioxidant<00:00:43.590> power<00:00:43.770> than<00:00:44.129> say<00:00:44.430> vitamin

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
more antioxidant power than say vitamin

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.110

C<00:00:45.090> or<00:00:45.300> vitamin<00:00:45.329> E<00:00:46.550> it's<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.640> really<00:00:47.820> good<00:00:47.910> thing

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
C or vitamin E it's a really good thing

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.400 
C or vitamin E it's a really good thing
and<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.420> reason<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.719> I'm<00:00:48.840> doing<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:49.230> is

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
and the reason that I'm doing this is

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.819 
and the reason that I'm doing this is
because<00:00:49.530> yesterday<00:00:50.780> fianceé<00:00:51.780> decided<00:00:52.739> that

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
because yesterday fianceé decided that

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.220 
because yesterday fianceé decided that
he<00:00:53.010> was<00:00:53.129> kind<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.460> feeling<00:00:53.730> sick<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.239> last

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
he was kind of feeling sick and last

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.930 
he was kind of feeling sick and last
last<00:00:55.739> winter<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:57.440> had<00:00:58.440> this<00:00:58.949> around<00:00:59.309> all<00:00:59.699> winter

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
last winter I had this around all winter

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.630 
last winter I had this around all winter
long<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.449> he<00:01:00.660> loved<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.890> kept<00:01:02.129> him<00:01:02.280> healthy

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
long and he loved it it kept him healthy

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.179 
long and he loved it it kept him healthy
I<00:01:02.850> didn't<00:01:03.600> really<00:01:03.809> need<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.140> because<00:01:04.379> I'm

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
I didn't really need it because I'm

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.570 
I didn't really need it because I'm
awesome

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.100 
awesome
but<00:01:06.510> anyway<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.830> um<00:01:08.580> just<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.570> little<00:01:09.600> bit<00:01:09.960> more

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
but anyway so um just a little bit more

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.640 
but anyway so um just a little bit more
on<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.409> scientific<00:01:10.950> side<00:01:11.960> what<00:01:12.960> this<00:01:13.260> what

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
on the scientific side what this what

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.429 
on the scientific side what this what
the<00:01:14.299> compound<00:01:15.299> in<00:01:15.479> Ella<00:01:15.689> berries<00:01:16.020> actually

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
the compound in Ella berries actually

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.060 
the compound in Ella berries actually
does<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.100> inhibits<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.570> enzyme<00:01:19.070> that

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
does is it inhibits the enzyme that

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.830 
does is it inhibits the enzyme that
allows<00:01:20.570> viruses<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.810> attach<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.350> host<00:01:22.560> cells

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
allows viruses to attach to host cells

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.310 
allows viruses to attach to host cells
so<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.020> did<00:01:25.200> just<00:01:25.350> really<00:01:25.680> just<00:01:26.630> no<00:01:27.630> more<00:01:27.869> no

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
so it did just really just no more no

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.100 
so it did just really just no more no
