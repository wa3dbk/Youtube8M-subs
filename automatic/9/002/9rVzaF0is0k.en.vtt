00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:09.809
 The Bible is inspired by scripture and 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:18.500
 to inspire is divine is fantastic 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:40.170
 inspired person cuts the unit 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:42.870
 the problem now problematize your 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:51.239
 look of god for example 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:01:00.020
 so do not forget this 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:01:09.080
 he never wrote the script to 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:17.990
 scripture is inspired it is not divine to 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:17.990
 scripture is inspired she is not god 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:28.850
 the only word of god 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:34.560
 divine and more than inspired 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:37.520
 is the very source of inspiration that is 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.520
 Jesus 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:47.549
 read the deed 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.740
 looking at jesus whatever it is like jesus is 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:54.439
 God's word 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:02:00.119
 internally what is not like jesus 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:04.530
 was a contingency of a time the 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.040
 inspired by time but defeated by the 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.690
 divinity 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.690
 from the eternal verb 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:19.930
 For god's sake, understand. 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:23.980
 For God's sake, it's fallen. It reminded me of you. 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.970
 Only yesterday I was there. 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.970
 watch online 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.660
 everyone there to participate sending 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.660
 questions for you 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.940
 [Music] 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.460
 [Music] 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:24.880
 now when the questions to answer 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:26.260
 It was very cool, a guy who made a 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.989
 ask you what is yours 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:33.970
 It was a good response, I was excited. 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:37.989
 I got up and went there and I did not give up on the best 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:40.450
 sense of the word I told you here was 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:49.840
 very good, very good, and he asked 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:58.330
 You have passed this way of Jesus in the 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:04:02.890
 jesus earth google what are the 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:04.380
 concrete evidence on earth that Jesus is 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.270
 the guy 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:13.960
 He asked this question for you and you. 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:15.760
 gave that exclusive answer you until 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.100
 asked me if I would answer that I 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.760
 I said I'll answer the same thing until 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:25.570
 Sunday but not the same way and I do not 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.160
 I know I was not born to repeat then I 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.090
 I can not 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.640
 I go one way and I come back from the other. 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:37.060
 same path same same logic 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.640
 But I do not know how to do the same. 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:43.150
 strip tease 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:46.390
 so that's why I do not decorate anything 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:50.740
 I never know what I know I'm going 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:54.490
 never answered how to respond and if 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.860
 as is the time to give me for pole 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.320
 all 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:03.480
 now the issues in God not only a 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:06.820
 problem when there is only so 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.380
 intensely full of meaning 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:14.340
 gospel 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:18.270
 the problem is the only team to do 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:26.380
 simplify as much as possible to 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:28.780
 understand is because of this intention 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:32.680
 every time something is answered 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:36.720
 answered the second moment because I 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:40.900
 I ended up becoming completely 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:43.180
 intuitive in relation to the mode 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:47.110
 that yesterday's moment was a time of 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.940
 today cool moment this level 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.250
 experience that I lived there yesterday in 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.770
 cairo exclusive fact and here people 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.960
 differently than a check 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.990
 no turning back 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.460
 nobody writes even doing the 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.009
 people 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.389
 is the condition of communicating to dengue 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:07.289
 huh 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:11.490
 and they have god's name the cities will 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:13.919
 start having video show will begin to 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:17.789
 manifest through video 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:21.750
 it is true that yesterday I could have 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:26.240
 I preferred not because there was the risk of something 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:31.080
 not yet know how to move and stop the flow 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:34.680
 first train some was going to increase the use 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:37.500
 environment and train better to 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:40.949
 we begin to receive the interaction of 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:43.949
 video there and talk a lot 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:46.590
 more intimate is totally 

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:51.870
 different from what normally happens already 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:54.630
 is a home-way participates and has its 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.460
 return even has a yes interaction 

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.380
 It is that it is unprecedented 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:02.099
 our traditional formats are wrong. 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:13.620
 here the staff is there no time 

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:16.580
 exclusive will have a special place 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:19.500
 thinking about separating a channel here giving 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:22.740
 suffers exclusive only for 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:24.360
 facilitate the dynamics of introducing 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:27.599
 the other the heirs 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:29.639
 it will get much simpler nice to 

00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:32.940
 people use the features that come from tv 

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:36.770
 having to wear it today has more 

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.770
 bandaged amateurs 

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:41.580
 we are moving in this direction and it is easy 

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:45.560
 only period we will evaluate 

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:45.560
 Yes I want, this is it. 

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:53.520
 [Music] 

00:07:48.539 --> 00:07:53.520
 Come and watch the channel, and you?
