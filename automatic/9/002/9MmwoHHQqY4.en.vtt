 yes these men and women who are at 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.250
 the head of a ship from a boat a 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.830
 same plane of an airliner 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.690
 so did you wonder 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.700
 once and nothing only once 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.480
 why do they always arrive 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.820
 or almost always at your destination 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:24.960
 why despite the storms 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.619
 breakdowns thunderstorms and even the 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.080
 human errors 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.840
 well he manages to reach their goals 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.840
 and their destination 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.440
 and because they have 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.870
 a goal 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.710
 they have a destination hello 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.120
 cename ined 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.579
 welcome to this very first 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.739
 video of the blog take back his life in hand 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.280
 so to you now what is your 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.559
 goal 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.570
 what is your destination me my goal 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.620
 it's to make 24 video like this 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.170
 in six months 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.270
 because I am a total newbie in 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.670
 the domain of becoming the actor and the 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.680
 pilot of my life my destination is 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.480
 become a recognized guide they 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.219
 contribute positively to 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.430
 others because it's my passion 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.320
 so just like a captain I have a goal 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.060
 I have a destination and what is 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.950
 happens when we have a goal and a 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.060
 destination well we always finish 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.750
 to get there 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.729
 on the other hand when there is no goal or 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.640
 destination or when they are not 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.100
 accurate and well or not his time and we 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.880
 wasted time running around in circles and 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.040
 final we do not move a little like a 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.259
 sailboat for example yes a sailboat a 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.110
 sailing boat which is drifting by 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.299
 winds and in the end they advance but they 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.640
 do not move forward because he's going nowhere 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.770
 so you understand how it's 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.280
 simple to go somewhere it takes 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.290
 know exactly where we are going then 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.810
 Now, it's your turn to play 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.340
 so what are your goals what are 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.450
 your destinations 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.070
 what pleases you in life 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.759
 what is important what is it 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.890
 who counts 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.060
 or do you want to go 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.060
 to answer them 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.090
 you just need a paper and 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.820
 of a pen so if now you are you 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.430
 say yes do not know what am I 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.190
 want me 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.510
 I have no idea no panic because 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.290
 that precisely I have an excellent 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.570
 new to you is that you have 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.920
 necessarily an idea because you like 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.290
 necessarily something in life 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.750
 is not it there is necessarily some 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.540
 something that fascinates you this maybe 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.930
 travel and spend more time with 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.620
 your family your friends to become a 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.110

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:49.070
 degree et cetera et cetera et cetera 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.230
 I like the idea that the possibilities are 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.800
 infinite in life and that everything is 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.980
 possible 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.840
 can not we really do this 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.750
 we want when we want 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.810
 how do we want with whom we want or 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.510
