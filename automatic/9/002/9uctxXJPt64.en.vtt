00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.330
 in the stadium of vallecas the ray 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.910
 Vallecano received Real Madrid in this 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.129
 derbi madrileño of the day number 30 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.889
 in a match in which Real Madrid 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:16.110
 he played it and he could not let go 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.770
 the three points to follow the wake 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.450
 of FC Barcelona a Real Madrid that had 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.970
 the ball very little in the first 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.530
 part but he enjoyed some occasions 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.710
 to get ahead on the scoreboard 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.420
 The Vallecano spoke the greatest 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.009
 time of the first period and it was also 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.960
 who generated more opportunities for 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.329
 danger as in this shot from adriano 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.940
 in beard very active during all the 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.129
 I find that left to the left 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.350
 of the goal of a determinant and that 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.269
 he squares and today 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.829
 gael kakuta also one of the most 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:48.989
 assets in the set of paco jémez 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.269
 attended in this play so that Alberto 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.239
 good with that left-footed shot from outside the 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:56.260
 area forces him to intervene to captain and 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.050
 Real Madrid goalkeeper 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.730
 a Vallecano ray that led to force 11 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.039
 arrivals to the area and it exists and I started in 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.470
 the first period but he saw how in 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.119
 some isolated action the real madrid him 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.649
 won the back to his defense in this 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.110
 case it was gareth bale that ended 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:13.570
 scoring but in the meantime it did not go up 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.400
 marker outside play 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.650
 Welsh footballer 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.650
 the ray that in this release of 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.110
 corner to point was to open the 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.480
 scoreboard the auction of manucho la 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.600
 reaction in times by part of 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:31.060
 iker boxes to prevent him from getting 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.890
 in front of the set franjirrojo that 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.100
 he did not lose faith he did not lose hope and 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.020
 which again forced to not squeeze 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.480
 Real Madrid captain with this 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.270
 headbutton of roberto trashorras that 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.280
 repelled again iker boxes and that 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.780
 allowed to keep the goal to zero 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.110
 a real madrid that in the second part 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.910
 showed a very different image after the 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.440
 I went through the changing rooms the set of 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.330
 carlo ancelotti started generating 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.550
 opportunities for danger this was the 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.350
 first after the hummer center 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.410
 Rodriguez and the head of Gareth Bale 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.060
 it went away deviated a little bit to the 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.560
 right of the goal and in this fall 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.380
 that we are seeing inside the 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.750
 area the play for the controversy in the 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.780
 party with that downing of antonio amaya 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.760
 about Christian ronaldo that supposed the 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.690
 yellow cardboard for Portuguese in 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.980
 the school did not understand 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:25.040
 he was trying to trick the scorer 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.290
 Real Madrid and it ends up showing you a 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.910
 yellow that will not allow 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.250
 Cristiano Ronaldo to be with his team 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.190
 in the next day before society 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.350
 sports eibar to meet the cycle of 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.510
 warnings the great occasion he had 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.030
 karime in sebha in the match was this 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.250
 cross shot and left to the right of 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.740
 the cobeño goal 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.480
 a real madrid that was better in the 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.110
 second period and that was accumulating 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.610
 chances of danger until getting the 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.620
 first so much of the encounter here was 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.040
 marcelo the Brazilian side in which 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.990
 an addition to the attack released that 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.060
 left-handed who left near the post 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.580
 and how was this going to come out 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.870
 shot of gareth bale breaking towards 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.450
 in that movement so 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.920
 characteristic and so often you 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.170
 saw gareth bale in the premier league 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.790
 in the ranks of the tottenham broke towards 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:18.250
 in let go and shot 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.040
 very hard and I was about to do the 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.409
 first the first so much was not going to 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.900
 get in this action leaves Rodriguez 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:28.209
 the Colombian who was looking for the space to 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.810
 release the shot and that left-footed shot 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:35.349
 finally something was going over 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.359
 of the goal defended by cobeño the 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:40.000
 real madrid that kept trying that 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:42.459
 he was the great agitator of the second period 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.829
 surpassing the vallecano ray and in this 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.510
 carvajal's move reaches the line of 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.209
 background the lateral and its center the 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.220
 took advantage of ronaldo Christian to do 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.819
 the first to open the scoreboard 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:58.780
 minute 68 that is below the Portuguese 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:02.319
 that beat a cobeño and that supposed the goal 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:05.349
 300 of ronaldo Christian yes yes 300 already 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.959
 with the shirt of the Real Madrid in a 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:10.900
 celebration as we always did and with 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.000
 something also demanding so 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.129
 I understood that it had been a mistake 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.519
 collegiate in the penalty not previously 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:18.979
 indicated 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.470
 tie the beam and close was of 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:23.569
 achieve it with this nacho shot that 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.879
 forced iker boxes back to take out 

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:28.789
 to reduce its good placement and its 

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:30.470
 good reflexes but when the beam 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.720
 overturned to look for the tie came the 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.819
 sentence came the second he attends 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.419
 Christian ronaldo so that jaime 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:41.870
 Rodriguez in the 74 fit that ball to 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:43.610
 that great shot to the wood and can not 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.259
 do absolutely nothing to cobeño go to 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.930
 second of madrid put land of 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:50.030
 medium and from then on the goal could 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.430
 to fall both on one side and on the other 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.400
 this time I went to school with what was 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.440
 substitute today who he said 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.840
 I was about to beat a cobeño after that 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.630
 individual action of gareth bale and that of 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.360
 Benalmádena, who was not able to introduce 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.009
 that ball in the goal was not going 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.710
 to make the ray behind that center nacho 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:11.680
 the header of manucho was removed by iker 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.470
 boxes 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.919
 new great intervention of the goalkeeper 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.690
 of Real Madrid today perhaps one of his 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:22.000
 most outstanding performances of the 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.979
 season to leave your goal to zero 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.470
 and for Real Madrid to take the 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:29.080
 match 0 to 2 and to follow the wake 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.440
 of FC Barcelona in the fight for the league 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.440
