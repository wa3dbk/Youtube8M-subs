rheumatoid arthritis lupus any of these

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.300 
rheumatoid arthritis lupus any of these
things<00:00:27.570> now<00:00:27.810> it's<00:00:28.080> mild<00:00:28.410> it's<00:00:28.800> cosmetic

initiate a person than leprosy okay it's
already<00:00:48.960> treatments<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.559> can<00:00:49.620> do<00:00:49.860> their

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
already treatments you can do their

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.799 
already treatments you can do their
successful<00:00:50.700> yeah<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.059> original<00:00:51.120> treatment

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
successful yeah the original treatment

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.500 
successful yeah the original treatment
was<00:00:51.989> proof<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.680> but<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:52.980> i<00:00:53.070> think<00:00:54.000> that's<00:00:54.180> fallen

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
was proof of but I i think that's fallen

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.580 
was proof of but I i think that's fallen
out<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.600> favor<00:00:54.840> because<00:00:55.050> it's<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.350> systemic

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
out of favor because it's a systemic

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.930 
out of favor because it's a systemic
drug<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.250> there's<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.430> whole<00:00:56.610> slew<00:00:56.910> of

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
drug and there's a whole slew of

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.670 
drug and there's a whole slew of
problems<00:00:57.090> but<00:00:57.539> number<00:00:57.809> one<00:00:57.989> it's<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.230> drug<00:00:58.440> you

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
problems but number one it's a drug you

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.170 
problems but number one it's a drug you
got<00:00:58.829> taken<00:00:59.010> by<00:00:59.129> mouth<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.550> connect<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.059> eyes

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
got taken by mouth you connect the eyes

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.720 
got taken by mouth you connect the eyes
for<00:01:00.329> 24<00:01:00.719> hours<00:01:00.750> afterwards<00:01:01.440> because<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.550> stays

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
for 24 hours afterwards because it stays

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.579 
for 24 hours afterwards because it stays
in<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.940> system<00:01:03.270> for<00:01:03.359> 24<00:01:03.750> hours<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:04.229> increases

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
in the system for 24 hours it increases

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.469 
in the system for 24 hours it increases
your<00:01:04.739> chances<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.220> skin<00:01:05.489> cancer<00:01:05.970> placed

mussoorie attics and you're looking at

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.710 
mussoorie attics and you're looking at
to<00:01:08.400> twice<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.700> week<00:01:08.970> for<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.180> year<00:01:09.240> under

to twice a week for a year under
treatments<00:01:10.520> bitten<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:12.030> down<00:01:12.600> from<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.140> now

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
treatments bitten so down from that now

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.730 
treatments bitten so down from that now
is<00:01:13.979> narrowband<00:01:14.549> UVB<00:01:15.000> which<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.140> an

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
is narrowband UVB which is an

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.090 
is narrowband UVB which is an
ultraviolet<00:01:17.490> no<00:01:17.850> drug<00:01:18.140> it<00:01:19.140> works<00:01:19.350> almost<00:01:19.740> as

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
ultraviolet no drug it works almost as

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.380 
ultraviolet no drug it works almost as
well<00:01:20.340> but<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.820> still<00:01:21.000> takes<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.210> lot<00:01:21.360> of

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
well but it still takes a lot of

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.630 
well but it still takes a lot of
treatments<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.229> last<00:01:22.530> thing<00:01:22.890> which<00:01:23.400> works

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
treatments the last thing which works

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.730 
treatments the last thing which works
better<00:01:23.880> than<00:01:24.150> narrowband<00:01:24.630> upp<00:01:25.110> but<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.470> can't

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
better than narrowband upp but you can't

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.399 
better than narrowband upp but you can't
do<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> whole<00:01:26.070> body<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.640> laser<00:01:27.080> so<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:28.229> called

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
do a whole body is laser so it's called

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.960 
do a whole body is laser so it's called
an<00:01:28.500> X<00:01:28.650> or<00:01:28.799> laser<00:01:29.130> it's<00:01:29.460> in<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.670> same

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
an X or laser it's in the same

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.090 
an X or laser it's in the same
wavelength<00:01:30.329> it's<00:01:30.990> 308<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:31.860> it's<00:01:32.009> an

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
wavelength it's 308 so it's an

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.440 
wavelength it's 308 so it's an
ultraviolet<00:01:32.909> but<00:01:33.119> they<00:01:33.210> took<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.750> peak<00:01:34.170> and

the old days probably 40 years ago
useless<00:02:27.130> look<00:02:27.310> for<00:02:27.460> pernicious<00:02:27.820> anemia<00:02:28.240> with

useless look for pernicious anemia with

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.820 
useless look for pernicious anemia with
it<00:02:28.600> because<00:02:28.870> that<00:02:29.140> was<00:02:29.470> an<00:02:29.560> autoimmune

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
it because that was an autoimmune

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.590 
it because that was an autoimmune
disease<00:02:30.070> in<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.370> old<00:02:30.580> days<00:02:30.760> so<00:02:31.480> you're

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
disease in the old days so you're

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.350 
disease in the old days so you're
supposed<00:02:31.690> to<00:02:31.840> look<00:02:31.990> for<00:02:32.260> that<00:02:33.240> it's<00:02:34.240> a

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
supposed to look for that it's a

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.360 
supposed to look for that it's a
question<00:02:34.690> of<00:02:34.720> how<00:02:34.930> cosmetically<00:02:35.770> is<00:02:35.890> figuring

question of how cosmetically is figuring

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.670 
question of how cosmetically is figuring
this<00:02:36.520> so<00:02:36.820> obviously<00:02:37.360> black<00:02:37.720> person<00:02:38.110> face<00:02:38.320> it's

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
this so obviously black person face it's

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.000 
this so obviously black person face it's
cosmetically<00:02:39.160> disfiguring<00:02:40.470> so<00:02:41.470> it<00:02:41.860> would<00:02:41.950> be

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
cosmetically disfiguring so it would be

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.130 
cosmetically disfiguring so it would be
nice<00:02:42.220> to<00:02:42.490> treat<00:02:42.760> them<00:02:42.970> earlier<00:02:43.450> if<00:02:43.840> it's<00:02:44.020> going

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
nice to treat them earlier if it's going

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.710 
nice to treat them earlier if it's going
to<00:02:44.200> psychologically<00:02:45.100> bother<00:02:45.310> them<00:02:45.580> you<00:02:46.450> don't

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
to psychologically bother them you don't

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.330 
to psychologically bother them you don't
want<00:02:47.140> them<00:02:47.320> to<00:02:47.440> get<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.770> where<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:48.040> missing
