 but Mason also fell in preparation I'm feeling a little scared 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.700
 In my trauma therapy I had a couple of times with a little bird 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.900
 thoughtfully he agreed he had seen the ferry and then it's easy 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.060
 If you want to live half the life, some people will 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.060
 the horrible stories from the dentist listen owner family and then there 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.640
 already pre-program for the most part teams like people also traumatized by 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.770
 Treatments and a whole horror judge people with their others 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.700
 Trauma for example, rape use of force after all, every second 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.010

 oval PFO PI what do you know from your own practice? 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.990
 In addition, the ten teams between 8 and 12 million in the 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.050
 Federal Republic 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.020
 in practice he is having problems with this 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.090
 the game usually does not show up 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.160
 have the least 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.210
 I have donkeys to Fontane as well, so now it's wet too 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.210
 Oh and I spontaneously think of people as their own 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.580
 Fear of the dentist 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.570
 Winter is in the fields and in very little pain 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.390
 Percent very often these are then recorded as in the young years then too 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.580
 or 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.910
 it will simply lie exposed to violence valued were forced, among other things 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.350
 essentially 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.559
 and 80 percent of these patients are simply afraid of back pain 

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:12.470
 which shows that the percent that my fear 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.949
 the normal level of decency increases 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:19.179
 So being a classic kid is simply avoiding Berlin before Biala 

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:22.279
 avoid i'm not going to try on some elevator anymore 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:24.310
 own dog I avoid the dentist below 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.690
 So why the classic mark and him on his bad conscience 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.849
 Aurich would have to do a white man's teeth 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.119
 That's what these people can do 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:38.169
 Toothache we have in and around an inflammation in the jaw 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:41.300
 masdar-city is about everything 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.530
 Obama demanded to be able to keep abusing so this 

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:48.959
 Phobics are incredibly resourceful 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.629
 and they are capable of suffering 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.739
 they get themselves medicines 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.199
 Percent who buy their infection 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:58.549
 Percent of those have their face swelling so in the meadows 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.179
 Fellow man with both solutions to the medics but there are also 

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:05.540
 Limits so if you have, for example, the mine pine single 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.560
 You can get that with painkillers or a good thing they do not 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.300
 Seeing and experiencing how simple what they fear they are through family 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.809
 and his friend is 

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:16.099
 or even near the clinic 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.010
 they are treated in the same way as they do not want to be terminated, namely as 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.769
 Emergency and there has to be urgently needed help and that settles 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.099
 even further, one's fear of being single 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.420
 most of the time, it is also that of these people 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.110
 counting childhood had a traumatic experience and we want that 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.179
 now one with a core team show 

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:38.600
 one she knows suffers from a phobia 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.519
 he is afraid of the dentist 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.199
 For years her teeth were called plagued by bad pain 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:48.979
 on the other hand 

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:50.790
 the doors and five places 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.790
 others do not give enough air then not 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:56.569
 and under pressure 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.539
 After many preliminary talks, she should now be treated under general anesthesia 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:04.760
 but after some hesitation, she dares then but in the practice of doctor 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.209
 local in Hannover 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.289
 for the anxiety life in childhood then she made a bad experience 

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:12.219
 with a dentist 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:14.659
 but still would be missing 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:19.130
 Entertainment and local products and we started and son actually did 

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:21.579
 were not necessary 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.579
 Olmert also got older man 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.319
 it really is like that 

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:30.599
 two pieces and parental home in the lead 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:34.080
 But then no kid these problems traded many anxiety patients 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.479
 works closely with a psychologist 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:39.550
 Shepherd of the patients are taken very seriously
