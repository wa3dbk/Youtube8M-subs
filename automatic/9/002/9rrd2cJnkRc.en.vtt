I've<00:00:39.699> just<00:00:40.059> been<00:00:40.239> using<00:00:40.719> the<00:00:40.930> camera<00:00:41.140> alone

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
I've just been using the camera alone

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:43.770 
I've just been using the camera alone
and<00:00:41.860> when<00:00:42.520> I<00:00:42.550> wasn't<00:00:42.879> using<00:00:43.059> a<00:00:43.120> camera<00:00:43.300> finding

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
and when I wasn't using a camera finding

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.689 
and when I wasn't using a camera finding
somewhere<00:00:44.050> to<00:00:44.110> set<00:00:44.320> it<00:00:44.410> down<00:00:44.530> that's<00:00:45.520> really

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
somewhere to set it down that's really

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:47.459 
somewhere to set it down that's really
inconvenient<00:00:46.239> obviously<00:00:46.899> if<00:00:47.020> you're<00:00:47.140> doing

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.469 
inconvenient obviously if you're doing

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.170 
inconvenient obviously if you're doing
things<00:00:47.680> with<00:00:47.890> lighting<00:00:48.460> setups<00:00:48.820> or<00:00:48.969> you<00:00:49.059> have

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
things with lighting setups or you have

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.760 
things with lighting setups or you have
other<00:00:49.210> things<00:00:49.570> to<00:00:49.660> do<00:00:49.899> or<00:00:50.230> you<00:00:50.260> want<00:00:50.590> a<00:00:50.620> free

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
other things to do or you want a free

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.860 
other things to do or you want a free
hand<00:00:51.010> to<00:00:51.160> do<00:00:51.309> pretty<00:00:51.489> much<00:00:51.609> anything<00:00:51.969> you<00:00:52.359> find

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870

a place to put your camera I saw the ads
for<00:00:56.500> the<00:00:56.559> blackrapid<00:00:57.010> and<00:00:57.399> decided<00:00:58.000> it<00:00:58.090> was

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
for the blackrapid and decided it was

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.029 
for the blackrapid and decided it was
worth<00:00:58.239> a<00:00:58.510> shot<00:00:58.539> I<00:00:58.899> really<00:00:59.230> like<00:00:59.440> the<00:00:59.620> look<00:00:59.829> of

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039 
worth a shot I really like the look of

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:06.840 
worth a shot I really like the look of
the<00:01:00.820> design<00:01:01.179> and<00:01:01.539> how<00:01:01.690> secure<00:01:02.109> it<00:01:02.230> was<00:01:05.850> here's

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
the design and how secure it was here's

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.060 
the design and how secure it was here's
the<00:01:07.000> strap<00:01:07.240> itself<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:08.500> looks<00:01:08.710> like<00:01:08.830> a<00:01:08.860> setup

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
the strap itself it looks like a setup

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.560 
the strap itself it looks like a setup
gun<00:01:09.340> holsters<00:01:09.790> or<00:01:09.909> maybe<00:01:10.060> like<00:01:10.270> a<00:01:10.299> backpack

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
gun holsters or maybe like a backpack

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.230 
gun holsters or maybe like a backpack
which<00:01:11.020> is<00:01:11.140> how<00:01:11.259> it's<00:01:11.439> worn<00:01:11.680> the<00:01:12.670> construction

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
which is how it's worn the construction

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.810 
which is how it's worn the construction
is<00:01:13.390> really<00:01:13.780> nice<00:01:13.930> it's<00:01:14.259> very<00:01:14.470> solid<00:01:15.040> there's

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
is really nice it's very solid there's

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.760

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
it's also really nice because the straps

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.319 
it's also really nice because the straps
on<00:01:29.350> to<00:01:29.470> which<00:01:29.619> each<00:01:29.829> camera<00:01:30.189> is<00:01:30.610> attached<00:01:31.030> are

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
sewn in such a way so that they can't

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.319 
sewn in such a way so that they can't
slip<00:01:35.380> out<00:01:35.560> ever<00:01:35.829> the<00:01:36.490> only<00:01:36.700> way<00:01:36.790> they<00:01:36.939> can<00:01:37.000> come

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 
slip out ever the only way they can come

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:39.270 
slip out ever the only way they can come
out<00:01:37.360> is<00:01:37.780> by<00:01:38.020> this<00:01:38.259> quick<00:01:38.500> release<00:01:38.799> buckle<00:01:39.040> in

out is by this quick release buckle in

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.280 
out is by this quick release buckle in
the<00:01:39.369> back<00:01:39.579> and<00:01:39.820> it's<00:01:40.390> unlikely<00:01:40.750> that<00:01:40.899> we'll

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
the back and it's unlikely that we'll

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.130 
the back and it's unlikely that we'll
get<00:01:41.409> tripped<00:01:41.740> by<00:01:41.979> accident<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.930> I'm<00:01:44.110> very

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
get tripped by accident so I'm very
