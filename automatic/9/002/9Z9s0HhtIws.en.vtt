00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.920
 good guys welcome to the good channel 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:11.059
 I will teach a little in the mode of 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.059
 trajectory I'm already I'm motorcycle gp 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:18.840
 I have already climbed to motogp and I am level level 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.840
 61-62 I think 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.900
 and nothing is your life motogp with 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.770
 to which good 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.940
 what a scratch I made the game 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.260
 I was motogp with a bad team and I 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:36.440
 I remember what is called of these that you 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.780
 they give more chips no big despite 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.260
 win the championship in motorbike 1 moto 3 and 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.840
 motorcycle 2 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.550
 So nothing 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.969
 and nothing I will teach a little 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.620
 in trajectory mode when you get to 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.739
 motorcycle gp the bike change quite the 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.940
 true the control the touch the 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:59.769
 acceleration changes the change quite the 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.210
 compete from a motogp of moto2 to 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:05.590
 motogp changes quite a bit recently 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.420
 I come from playing a game with the 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.610
 Subscribers play with Carlos with 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.770
 carmine 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.260
 I've recorded a game as much as I think 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.570
 that has not left one has cut the 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.920
 half the other one has not come out too 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.140
 all right 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.620
 so I really do not know if I'm going to 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.230
 go up 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.850
 but good 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.960
 At least we have done the time 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.730
 it improves a little bit all 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.540
 and nothing 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:36.840
 we'll see in that in more games in the 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.460
 resistance in the call of duty 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.020
 that is, after trying a 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.149
 bit 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.149
 the online good 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.020
 could go thinner the truth is not going to 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.290
 fail 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:57.140
 so we're not going to cheat 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.140
 it hangs sometimes it hits pulls what good 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.800
 things that I wanted to tell you, let's see 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.100
 the first 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.520
 is that if you play in the medium difficulty 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.240
 in this game 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.310
 in moto3 and moto2 good you will not have more 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.290
 problem to win 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.650
 the thing changes motogp and it's costing me 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.280
 very much on medium difficulty 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.620
 and win something 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:32.080
 say another thing that I do not like about this 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:35.680
 I do not like the aggressiveness of 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.090
 of the pilots the previous race is 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.580
 in the third race the championship to the 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.020
 second I had to repeat it 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.600
 in fact I had to lower the difficulty to 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.630
 easy it is what is now again 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.610
 because in the first curve 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.850
 which was that it was left in a curve 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.850
 closed 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.900
 I was being pulled, I was braking and I was 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.180
 they pulled, it came braking and I threw in 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.700
 I had to repeat it like a lot 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.109
 of times the race until I scratch and 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.719
 the difficulty went down so that 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:08.150
 I pull and I do not understand why they have done 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:08.150
 such an aggressive guide in this game 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.819
 but good they will know 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.249
 say that he 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:20.060
 when you get to level 64 in trophy 

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:21.829
 gold is not reached very easily climbs 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.769
 very easily the levels in this game 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:27.379
 has no greater difficulty than 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:31.329
 throw him out and throw him hours and hours and 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.329
 hours until no 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.450
 until more or less is going up 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.730
 it does not matter to level up not 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.470
 it matters a lot the difficulty is true 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.100
 they give you a few extra dots and you play 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.550
 in 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.880
 on medium-high difficulty or realistic but 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.880
 one 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.920
 that you also see below on the right my 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.800
 motorcycle is red because it gives me a milk is 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.660
 when I rival I play with damages in the 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.550
 motorcycle game with the tires too 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.830
 so that they are spending 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.970
 and more than anything to prove one thing and yes 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.820
 It is true that when you have 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.400
 tire the bike gets better grip on the 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.989
 curve when 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.360
 you see below on the right that the 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.109
 back tire goes away that happens to me 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.299
 so look 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.680
 by looking at the camera below to the right 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.930
 you see that the tire is being worn 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.240
 when the whole is spent it is super difficult 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:28.819
 keep the bike on track on all the 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.819
 sidewalk of the curve is very very difficult 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.930
 well there it is 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.460
 it shows that the race is easy 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.470
 because the advantage that took the rock 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.319
 what I do not understand because it's the jump 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.100
 so big of medium difficulty easy not 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:46.890
 I get it 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.660
 I guess I guess after half 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.820
 of the championship that I'm playing now 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:57.470
 they will call me to sign for a team 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:57.470
 bigger a ducati a sling I do not know 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.800
 I do not know what to tell you 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.320
 but good despite having won the 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.750
 championship on moto3 and moto2 have made me 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:10.770
 no offer to pass so nothing 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.770
 here we are 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.910
 and tell you also one thing 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.320
 I'm going to make a video of questions and 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.360
 answers you can leave me in the 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.469
 comments 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.310
 3d games on twitter wherever you want 

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:33.470
 any question 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.240
 and I'm going to make a special video with a 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.890
 background gameplay and I will explain a 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.480
 I'm going to answer all the 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.450
 questions worth 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.880
 good up here the boys video nothing 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:46.430
 send a greeting to all those who 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.970
 you are watching and see you next
