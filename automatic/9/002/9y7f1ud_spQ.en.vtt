00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 There are girls, all right , today's video. 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.770
 to teach you is to make this braid 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.030
 She's super different, she's a braid. 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.070
 4 wicks 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.309
 only one of the wicks is replaced 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.630
 for this transition here is quite easy to 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.390
 and you are sure that you will 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.949
 give a special video to the channel 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.689
 from jÃºlia moraes 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.279
 I really want you to meet her and 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.430
 her channel that i'll leave it here 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:33.110
 below for you to go there too. 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:35.670
 Let's start, let's start. 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.680
 untangling all the hair and putting 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:43.129
 he sideways to make a side tail 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.129
 fasten with an elastic 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.230
 now separate a small wick and in this 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.629
 wicks and other three masters who 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.260
 We are going to make a transition one 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.260
 normal transition 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:11.730
 this braid will be one of the goals of our 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.280
 bra from four meters to intel 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.400
 Let's separate all the hair from the tail in 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.100
 three equal parts and leave separated 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.540
 this way as if France were a 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.150
 of the four mercia 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.700
 she has to stay in second position 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.610
 from the inside out 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.430
 so let's assume that outside the 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.670
 side of our shoulder and the side of 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.740
 inside the side of the neck 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.880
 start picking the last wick from the side of 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.250
 out 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.240
 under the wick that is at the 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.040
 side of it and over france 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.330
 now that you've started to get very 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.190
 easier 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.630
 take the mexico state to the side of 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.940
 inside that would be a side of the neck 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.710
 to go over the goal on the 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.710
 down the stain of france 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:08.369
 Now just keep doing this. 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:12.420
 from below and above and now goes through 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.269
 up and down 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.920
 I keep repeating these movements 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:22.310
 repeating it in your head underneath and 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.310
 over 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:36.040
 above and down below and 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.040
 up winning underneath 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.750
 There is not much secret after you 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.010
 one time, just keep repeating until 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.930
 the end and then when it's all over, it's just 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.810
 learn from the other elastic 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.180
 and to finish because the gominhos 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.260
 braid so that it is wider and 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.260
 appear better 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.520
 already among girls and I hope you have 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:12.340
 I noticed that who I like does not matter 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.340
 to visit Julia and see the next video
