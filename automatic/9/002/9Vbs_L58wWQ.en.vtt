00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:09.420
 in addition to Nordic walking and of course 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.809
 downhill skiing here at recoaro thousand 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.940
 you can also practice cross-country skiing 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:18.270
 let 's talk about this discipline together with 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.310
 two masters and coaches from 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.050
 this sport then we are together with 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:27.180
 paolo storti riporti and roberto orsato 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.330
 ok very well then I want 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.469
 understand what kind of equipment it is 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.260
 necessary for cross-country skiing 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:39.449
 obviously the equipment is needed 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.659
 specific and suitable for our own 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:44.670
 discipline that is divided into two techniques 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:48.210
 in classical technique in 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.120
 skating and even list are two types 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.960
 of different equipment for the 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.479
 skating we use skis for smoothness 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.309
 skis without on-line school equipment 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:01.379
 while for the alternate technique 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.149
 We use classic skis with 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.530
 scales for sealing 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.700
 then of course the rackets 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.320
 obviously we need rackets and shoes 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.329
 suitable shoes of course also of 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.350
 different for the skating technique 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:18.390
 higher while for the classical technique 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.450
 lower and even clothing 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.310
 suitable to keep us warm 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.039
 and to move a lot too 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.100
 easy in fact you sweat more to do 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:32.369
 melt to make descent on the so-called fund yes 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.560
 sweat for the sweat that you enjoy then 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.140
 I imagine that with a discipline like this 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.180
 stay in much closer contact with the 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.180
 nature has the time to the way of 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.070
 enjoy the view more than that 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.289
 around us then especially in a 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.119
 wonderful day like this if 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.369
 absolutely the one discipline that 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.189
 however, it goes back a lot with the 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.909
 contact with the environment is suitable for everyone 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:02:00.929
 older children up to the elderly 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:04.560
 this contact with nature places us 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:06.990
 really in a very simple world 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.670
 fantastic views especially here 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.470
 in our tracks we have the 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.380
 mountains that we touch them with our hand 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.160
 so it offers us more and even more 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.500
 for children it grows far below 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.410
 the playful aspect is very fun 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.599
 very rich discipline of man 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.790
 let's show two skates to friends 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:30.380
 who follow us from home roberto ce la 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.380
 we are the ones we are 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.550
 we want I do not ski I have not 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.200
 skis but ok ok then roberto 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.330
 meanwhile I wanted to ask you this thing 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.549
 I see that there are so many jovanotti 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.160
 here they have just argued then one 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:48.530
 care tender we have just done i 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.690
 Recoaro Championships we are looking for 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.760
 bring up young boys will come 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.549
 and fifteen boys all very much 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.290
 good and we're also competing 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.630
 bus data circuit that then in 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.290
 provincial circuit we are coming 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.340
 also quite good with someone there 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.030
 we're having fun 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.280
 we are having fun is a discipline 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.709
 beautiful and today is a wonderful day e 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.690
 we also count on a wonderful track 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.660
 our track the bottom center le 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.700
 Montagnole is very different from the others 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.600
 background centers for the context in which one is 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.970
 puts a discipline we said before 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.090
 i really can do it 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:33.660
 children but also those who are ahead with 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:37.290
 age is cross-country skiing 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:40.769
 discipline that fascinates young people i 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.739
 small because it allows you to do everything 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:46.440
 really to play so maybe you have 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.470
 already seen the gincana we can do 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.989
 slalom and seems uphill we can 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.660
 really to have fun and also who it is 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.540
 higher with age is a sport that done 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.850
 in a certain way it is not so 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.160
 in short, it is as blind as it seems 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.480
 a school is a ski club right here 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.900
 recoaro you want to talk about it 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.660
 yes the cross-country ski is born in 1972 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.270
 so he is over 40 years old 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.990
 association 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:16.520
 and still those who commit themselves are still alive 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:20.270
 also in the management of the fund center 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:23.710
 which is precisely how we have 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:28.160
 keystrokes as general management 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.720
 according to the picture it is not a passion 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.520
 just an association but it's really one 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.190
 passion for members 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.470
 we are about 150 members and they are all 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.180
 active assets means that when there 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.360
 is racing gets busy when there was 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:45.110
