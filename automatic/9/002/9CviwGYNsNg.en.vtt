00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 channel sponsor thermaltake 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.589
 thermaltake play even easier then more 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.599
 affects gaming performance 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.170
 bye everyone by the way this is me johnny 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.170
 susey 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.480
 and techno-kitchen when buying a computer for 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.470
 games are not always clear what component 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.350
 should highlight 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.480
 special priorities and so with you hit parade 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.340
 components but unlike other 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.199
 ratings, we will start immediately with the first 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.840
 places to move on to less 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.420
 significant components and in the first place 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.700
 We are a video card because in games as a rule 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.590
 the entire burden falls on her to be 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.050
 generally understandable by example 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.480
 if you take a r9 280x video card 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.550
 then you can count on pretty 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.350
 highest quality picture 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.230
 settings plus fourfold 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.579
 anti-aliasing + full hd permissions true 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.170
 fps can go below 35 30 what 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.590
 uncomfortable therefore more demanding 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.640
 comrades take r9 290 gtx 970 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:03.570
 or immediately 980ti thereby increasing the FPS 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.510
 or the number of frames per second is higher than 40 50 60 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.460
 there is such a card 11 12 thousand rubles 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.860
 Now not tass production and its 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.650
 Shift came r9 380 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.680
 for the same price but if you start 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.990
 fall below then gtx losses are waiting for you 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.369
 960 two gigabytes of memory will be 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.380
 fall through in in many modern 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.920
 games like call of duty advanced 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.619
 warfare daylight or gta5 there will be 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.740
 slow down just due to lack of 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.790
 video memory 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.290
 Yes, and 960 itself is weaker 280x 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.570
 what we have already proven 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.970
 so the more expensive version with four 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.420
 gigabytes of memory is also unlikely to save 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:46.619
 if you buy a r9 270x video card 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.299
 or r9 370 then fps in especially heavy scenes 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.509
 will fall to 25 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.490
 that is, we lose speed comfort 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.630
 case with and gtx760 happens to me 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.399
 driver optimization 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.950
 due to the fact that the video card counts 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.079
 outdated output is not necessary 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.030
 save on video card need to take 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.670
 powerful enough to play your own 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.250
 resolution in the whole game for full hd 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.560
 minimum is 280x 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.430
 for 2k resolution, minimum recommended 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.250
 970 and for 4k at least 980ti 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.430
 do not need to save on video memory and 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.530
 must be at least 3 gigabytes is not necessary 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.750
 take outdated card is nvidia they are not 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.080
 already supported by drivers so much 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.360
 good how modern cards are what 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.310
 concerns two video card can do them 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.390
 only for top solutions for today 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.459
 this is 980 ti or mashed x allowed two 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.700
 chips and graphics card but only based on 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.739
 again top solutions in second place 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.350
 most important CPU 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.780
 Again, we start from the minimum and start 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.110
 with oh 3 this processor pulls badly 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.230
 stream games like gta5 crisis 3 not here 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.230
 Four streams almost everywhere missing 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:02.370
 but this stone will become an obstacle to 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.390
 970 or 980 with him you will not get one 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.140
 what could 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.450
 fx 83 2 0 well pulls and streaming games and 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.090
 ordinary but in general again the loss with 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.860
 cool graphics cards and accelerator cooler 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.799
 r9 280x 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.299
 we would not advise you in the tanks and the army 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.390
 3 overclocking is required 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:24.600
 however, he will not save the situation again. 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.030
 processor resembles fx 83 2 0 but worth it 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.190
 although more expensive does not require acceleration and 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.340
 tank army 3 and desi manifests itself 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.470
 better than 4690 key acceleration almost 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.690
 all games cool is the best solution 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.380
 for the modern gamer in terms of 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.870
 price and quality but 4790 cue you are true 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.760
 reach the top with any top 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.640
 video card or two such 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.620
 about sem unlike a and 5 carries 8 they 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.360
 four computing threads what 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.510
 start to love modern games and 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:59.100
 programs in third place we have memory 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.959
 at least 6 gigabytes optimum 816 comfortable 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.600
 not in games but in the browser and with 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.549
 tens of open windows at least two 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.560
 dual channel dies 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:10.950
 But the timings and frequency radiators 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.780
 practically do not change fps if you have 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.790
 there will be four gigabytes of operational 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.019
 do not wait for memory high FPS 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.289
 as the video card and processor will 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.210
 don't receive data and idle 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:24.460
 fourth place is her motherboard 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.500
 modest role maintain and overclock 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.539
 processor and nothing else from it 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.889
 need an excellent payment will give the processor 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:35.379
 need and 14 14 volts a and everything on it 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:37.210
 when the formula for video cards 88 is if 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:39.270
 you collect make a cross or slide about 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.150
 than we have a separate video by the way 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.560
 Overclocking the processor and video card gives up 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.020
 25-30 performance gains 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.300
 good match cooling system for 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.280
 CPU and 3 fan on and solution 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.460
 for the video card will give high speeds 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.889
 with low heat and noise level six 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.479
 place a solid state drive fast 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:01.060
 loads textures without giving 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.500
 briefly fall off fps take 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.960
 at least one hundred twenty eight gigabytes 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.250
 enough for windows programs and although 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.310
 would be 2 3 games 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.080
 Seventh place hard drive almost no 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.789
 plays on gaming performance with 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.530
 point of view that they are all 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:16.780
 exchange about the same 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.120
 data transfer rate of 100 megabytes per 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.819
 you can not bother a second 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.949
 8 place power supply it will not speed up your 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:24.639
 system found you will have an ancient old 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.289
 KGB officer 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.360
 and the video card will be connected they 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:31.240
 directly then there may be problems with 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.699
 280x performance is enough 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:37.630
 500 watt systems with any processor and 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:41.560
 Overclocking as for gtx 970 600 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:43.990
 watts need for a and 7 plus 980ti 650 watts 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.169
 take and do not steam for two top 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:50.469
 video cards and a7 can safely take 850 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:53.020
 watt on the 9th place body competently 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:55.840
 the case has a front fan for blowing 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.210
 rear blowing and + power supply should 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.400
 be lower even better when you can 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.560
 install a fan at the bottom and two on top 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.590
 side fan helps a little 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.940
 video card low temperature stock for 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.729
 acceleration which will increase 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.979
 fps tenth place sound card 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:14.139
 separate sound card with your 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:15.819
 processor to slightly reduce the load and 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:19.120
 help you give one extra 

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:19.990
 the office in certain games was ours 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.690
 hit parade 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.759
 with you was john no connection and those in the kitchens 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.529
 do not forget to put this video like and 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:27.990
 subscribe to my channel 

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:31.790
 the link is in the description 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.790
 good luck to all and bye
