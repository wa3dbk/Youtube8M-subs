00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.549
 the reality 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:11.690
 the view of refusing the starting position was clearly the shooting gallery 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.740
 The league is in Erkrath in Dusseldorf Andreasberg weather 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.519
 49 goals conceded 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.929
 26 the goal difference u2 - the worst value of the league 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.279
 or only 23 goals scored 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.239
 there is only axle left but that is not competitive in the league yet 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.710
 been weaker 12 goals Padberg Rademann scored 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.690
 Guy Demel, too 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.690
 from the city this the waters but he has it seven points 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.600
 for 16 Tel against the fifteenth 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.810
 Here was spasm felt from the beginning and so there was no 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.920
 then big chances in the first half hour though 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.820
 Oberheide put him off the fix, the title was Speak first accents comes 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.830
 over the wing 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.080
 For a long time the chancellor has a serious recession, according to the duel 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.400
 Hits after 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.850
 the fist shown 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.290
 one to zero 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.690
 in his 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.210
 nice shooting technique 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.550
 the keeper 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.980
 Depp is right at the head 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.980
 then, however, this attack repelled 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.990
 disturbed early 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.640
 from plaque Renault ID card also here a nice wing change Breitkopf 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.729
 not out of the danger zone and then this shot from the ambush 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.800
 the balance can not be grasped for OCR 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.020
 something went wrong 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.150
 Take summer again 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.150
 in the middle of the fray but just there and not 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.460
 Halftime one-to-one 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.220
 in the second game section 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.740
 defense-ass badge r 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.030
 Stormy Freecom do hit 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.030
 goes for the first time in this game in the lead 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.780
 his lead in the table 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.760
 from Bonn Cologne is still time 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.090
 Tiedemann can not fall as well. "Number 99" you rarely have in goal 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.769
 looks surprised 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.649
 No this one to three hit 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:15.719
 Oh that was a kind of preliminary decision 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:19.139
 arise Andreas Trautvetter 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:22.339
 but it should be happy and should go one better 

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:27.289
 but it turned out differently after this foul 

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:28.669
 Red card 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:29.859
 and henceforth 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:31.159
 could 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:35.029
 Andreasberg offenders only with ten men act as Roger enter 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:37.919
 and he takes advantage of it 

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:39.899
 Attack on the right side 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:42.899
 real defense position at plaque because I refer 

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:45.849
 The shot comes off first, but then it is blocked 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.399
 Center Forward dar 

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:48.579
 makes the beginning 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.859
 This looks all but the striker but too late two 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:54.859
 Defensive wall also not a good idea 

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:59.219
 compensation 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:00.649
 everything open again 

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:02.819
 in this 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.609
 and as I said numerical superiority for OCR Heidi Pohle that they out with 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:08.819
 the winning goal 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.819
 Â«The ladder after depth minute 4 to 3 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:15.919
 completely euphoric on the opposite side 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:19.409
 the pressure ions 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:24.029
 so much so trusts anyway so Karin Prutsch weaken his resurrection 

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:28.189
 Forced retirement and, last but not least, the mother 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:32.109
 well recovered and is great
