00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
certainly does it glow in the dark so I

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.050 
certainly does it glow in the dark so I
actually<00:05:02.780> let<00:05:03.050> me<00:05:03.430> charges<00:05:04.430> again<00:05:04.700> on<00:05:04.850> one

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
actually let me charges again on one

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.690 
actually let me charges again on one
side<00:05:05.410> let<00:05:06.410> me<00:05:06.470> just<00:05:06.710> charge<00:05:06.890> a<00:05:07.220> spot<00:05:07.550> on<00:05:07.580> the

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
side let me just charge a spot on the

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:14.520 
side let me just charge a spot on the
blade<00:05:07.880> to<00:05:08.090> see<00:05:08.240> exactly<00:05:08.690> how<00:05:08.930> long<00:05:09.110> this<00:05:09.290> less

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.450

the handles already kind of fading so it

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.780
