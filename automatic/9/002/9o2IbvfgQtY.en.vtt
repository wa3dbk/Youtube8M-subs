00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.040
 Hi guys, how are you? 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.560
 so today I came to tell a story 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.330
 world in 12 maps of jerry proton is 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.670
 receive this book from the radio's publisher 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.500
 has a funny story because in the 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.839
 Actually, I had seen this cake before. 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.029
 English and had almost encountered him 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.580
 several times but for some reason I 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.840
 always stopped buying and 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.689
 when I saw them I did not leave I stayed 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.400
 very happy, that's cool , that's good 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.039
 what is this 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.349
 this guy will get 12 maps and will 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.020
 tell us the context of this evil 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.360
 then how it was done because it was 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.670
 done when it was done 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.430
 he will contextualize this map so much 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.649
 historically will not tell what is 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.079
 happening in the world and especially in 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.680
 where this map was made right 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.410
 at that moment and technically so the 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.070
 cartography in the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.250
 when we had tools 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.260
 available and that kind of thing 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.769
 interesting of this contextualization is 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.360
 that you understand well where that 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.610
 map is located in 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.890
 so what's happening in that 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.850
 world because what it shows in the background 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.850
 For us, these maps have a lot of 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:22.110
 your time site of the right of your spending 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.509
 time and that they say a lot about the 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.970
 dominant ideology at that time and 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.070
 on the way you saw the rest 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.799
 the world at that time is well 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.630
 interesting because it goes first 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.600
 contextualize and will present the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.990
 ideas he kills bring and then goes 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.939
 In a way, interpreting this is 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.860
 interesting as it shows these 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.100
 12 times to us 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:51.840
 good this goes from the first ideas 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:54.390
 from map to google maps then it's a 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.509
 fairly comprehensive time range 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.329
 Good, he talks about a lot in the book. 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.119
 but there were three parts that interested me 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.640
 plus the first one was the part of the 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.860
 navigation is the chapter that most 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.140
 involves Brazil and he ends up counting 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.660
 many historical things that I do not 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.450
 knew about this period was well 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.140
 interesting 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:21.129
 about the trips made and about 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:24.120
 the creation of some maps and 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:27.790
 this notion that the world went around 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.739
 made new things and not new ones 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.690
 types of travel had happened 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.430
 At that time, I thought it was cool. 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.000
 another discussion that interested me 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.590
 much was the issue of the projections then 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.790
 when you already had more technology 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:45.489
 advanced is started if you search the 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.280
 how to transform this 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:52.090
 representation of the world that is 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.610
 It's impossible for you to do this. 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.860
 with complete accuracy 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.739
 but the gaucho hats began to 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.900
 to make projections that tried to show 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:07.049
 most realistic way possible 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:10.810
 and this is also a matter much one 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:13.299
 let's say politics from which to adopt 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.549
 This discussion is very interesting. 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.220
 well cool, people ended up adopting 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:21.280
 market because it has mystery north in 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:24.730
 up the southern hemisphere below that 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.549
 idea so best novelty line 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.650
 I think this please if the stadium 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.760
 You're talking bullshit correct me and 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.290
 another discussion that I found 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.359
 interesting chapter on google 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.600
 maps in which he will comment as this 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:39.609
 new nor google maps and google earth 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.859
 how these new technologies also 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:44.799
 change a little the way people 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:45.760
 will use and see the maps good 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.670
 the research he did is very 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.549
 comprehensive this is cool because you forget 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.109
 many chapters then for example the 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:55.299
 begins with the history of 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:57.370
 buying a map for a very very long time 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.590
 money and is a map that 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.650
 first time the term america for 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.230
 refer to the new continent and it is well 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.970
 interesting as senate congress 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.609
 I do not remember very well. 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.709
 buy this map for a lot of money 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:13.120
 this map became a relic 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.489
 historical ne 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.380
 and from there he goes from this story to 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.500
 tell us later why he 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.889
 relic as it was at the time because it is the 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.830
 sound 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:25.719
 the name of who this cartographer was 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.699
 super important photographer for the time 

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:30.550
 so cool 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:32.469
 it is this kind of montage that it does with 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.789
 these stories is this the very book 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:35.650
 more interesting 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:37.360
 Good people, I'll show you the book now. 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.460
 for you inside because it's okay 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.900
 cool editing also pretty those can 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.699
 see a little more 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.909
 good we are here is the book I 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:50.319
 this very cool cover I wanted to show 

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:52.539
 for you the part of the summary for 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:55.509
 who wants to know right here that has 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:58.840
 in it that I wanted to show here 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:05:01.590
 it is part of the text but there are two 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:06.550
 notebooks that are colored 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:10.060
 Try this moment here with here with 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:14.650
 all the maps he mentions are very 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:19.060
 cool because you give to grandson while he 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:25.110
 he speaks out the map and cause the 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:25.110
 aspects he talks about are the details and 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:34.029
 This helps a lot to understand 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:38.020
 some some characteristics that it 

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:39.370
 the king is pointing the maps go 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.560
 getting over time the face that the 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.629
 people you know today did not start talking 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.939
 of them are quite different function 

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:51.039
 theirs is also a bit different 

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:57.370
 so it is very curious here a projection 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:06:00.099
 which has been widely used for a while and is 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.849
 This is the book that pretty tacacÃ¡ 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:03.250
 edition 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:05.229
 Anyway, people here are the 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:08.199
 book is a book that is sure to be 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:10.990
 easier for geographers and cartographers 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:12.550
 finally people from this area but who can 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.009
 quietly follow 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:18.729
 person who is interested in history by 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:20.379
 maps anyway is it a book a string one 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:21.879
 book a little in. I took one 

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:24.279
 A little time to read but I went 

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:26.620
 reading so as not to get tired of him I went 

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:27.639
 reading from chapter to chapter and other 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.550
 things together 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:33.249
 and it 's a really cool book so I guess 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:36.129
 that the way in which the author chose 

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:38.560
 to tackle made all the difference left 

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:40.210
 the story is much more interesting and good 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.099
 That's it 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.770
 I hope you liked the video 

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:46.150
 who have read missiles thought that if you 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.370
 Do you want to know anything about the book that 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:55.080
 Did not say just ask me the 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:55.080
 comments and until the next video bye
