00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
because I have five sets of five this

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.709 
because I have five sets of five this
time<00:00:51.420> which<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.690> another<00:00:51.899> set<00:00:52.430> so<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:54.090> knew

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
time which is another set so I knew

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.479 
time which is another set so I knew
going<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.469> was<00:00:55.710> going<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.980> be<00:00:56.100> a

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
did everything I could to prep for it my

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.330 
did everything I could to prep for it my
recovery<00:01:01.170> was<00:01:01.199> solid<00:01:01.620> my<00:01:01.739> nutrition<00:01:02.219> was

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
recovery was solid my nutrition was

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.650 
recovery was solid my nutrition was
solid<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.699> actually<00:01:02.879> gained<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.329> little<00:01:03.449> bit<00:01:03.570> of

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
solid I actually gained a little bit of

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.950 
solid I actually gained a little bit of
weight<00:01:04.790> over<00:01:05.790> those<00:01:05.970> some<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.720> might<00:01:06.869> be

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
weight over those some of that might be

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.870 
weight over those some of that might be
water<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.260> probably<00:01:08.070> doubled<00:01:08.369> my<00:01:08.490> water<00:01:08.700> intake

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
water I probably doubled my water intake

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.429 
water I probably doubled my water intake

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
running a program like this that's

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.389 
running a program like this that's
supposed<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.409> be<00:01:55.439> really<00:01:55.770> intense<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.189> really

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399

tough<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.329> don't<00:01:57.540> get<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.719> quit<00:01:58.020> until<00:01:58.860> I

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
tough that I don't get a quit until I

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.770 
tough that I don't get a quit until I
miss<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.189> rep<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.670> there's<00:02:00.119> no<00:02:00.360> way<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.659> I'm

my<00:03:04.750> form<00:03:04.989> breakdown<00:03:05.380> is<00:03:05.530> still<00:03:05.770> present<00:03:05.980> but<00:03:06.600> I

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
my form breakdown is still present but I

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.710 
my form breakdown is still present but I
held<00:03:08.350> it<00:03:08.500> off<00:03:08.620> a<00:03:08.650> lot<00:03:08.980> longer<00:03:09.190> and<00:03:09.580> I<00:03:10.150> had<00:03:10.360> a<00:03:10.390> lot

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
held it off a lot longer and I had a lot

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.510 
held it off a lot longer and I had a lot
more<00:03:10.780> legitimate<00:03:11.620> reps<00:03:11.830> and<00:03:12.040> this<00:03:12.190> workout

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
more legitimate reps and this workout

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.060 
more legitimate reps and this workout
than<00:03:12.790> I<00:03:12.880> did<00:03:13.120> in<00:03:13.330> the<00:03:13.570> last<00:03:13.720> workout<00:03:14.200> even<00:03:14.590> with

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
than I did in the last workout even with

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.340 
than I did in the last workout even with
an<00:03:15.340> extra<00:03:15.730> set<00:03:15.910> added<00:03:16.299> in<00:03:16.450> i<00:03:16.720> would<00:03:17.080> say<00:03:17.320> that

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
an extra set added in i would say that

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.229 
an extra set added in i would say that
last<00:03:17.799> time<00:03:18.040> fifty<00:03:18.430> percent<00:03:18.700> of<00:03:18.790> my<00:03:18.880> reps<00:03:19.030> were

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
last time fifty percent of my reps were

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.710 
last time fifty percent of my reps were
probably<00:03:19.540> not<00:03:20.010> good<00:03:21.010> enough<00:03:21.280> for<00:03:22.030> my<00:03:22.299> standard

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
probably not good enough for my standard

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.880 
probably not good enough for my standard
of<00:03:22.780> lifting<00:03:23.140> and<00:03:23.549> I<00:03:25.049> definitely<00:03:26.049> improved<00:03:26.680> on

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
of lifting and I definitely improved on

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.600 
of lifting and I definitely improved on
that<00:03:26.950> so<00:03:27.959> I'm<00:03:28.959> happy<00:03:29.380> that<00:03:29.560> it<00:03:29.799> is<00:03:29.920> over<00:03:30.220> I<00:03:30.370> am

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
that so I'm happy that it is over I am

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.600 
that so I'm happy that it is over I am
happy<00:03:30.970> that<00:03:31.120> I<00:03:31.150> survive<00:03:31.600> this<00:03:31.630> workout<00:03:32.170> and<00:03:32.610> I

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
happy that I survive this workout and I

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.470 
happy that I survive this workout and I
poured<00:03:34.090> a<00:03:34.330> lot<00:03:34.660> of<00:03:35.070> myself<00:03:36.070> into<00:03:36.519> this<00:03:36.790> I<00:03:37.120> mean

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
poured a lot of myself into this I mean

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.080 
poured a lot of myself into this I mean
I<00:03:37.510> don't<00:03:37.810> think<00:03:38.140> I<00:03:38.230> could<00:03:38.380> have<00:03:38.470> done<00:03:39.090> another

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
I don't think I could have done another

I don't think I could have done another
set<00:03:40.650> after<00:03:41.650> my<00:03:41.980> my<00:03:42.700> final<00:03:43.120> rep<00:03:43.239> of<00:03:43.390> the<00:03:43.480> last

and i will say most of the time it's a

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.779 
and i will say most of the time it's a
better<00:05:01.260> idea<00:05:01.320> to<00:05:01.590> use<00:05:01.740> spotters<00:05:02.100> but<00:05:02.430> if<00:05:02.639> I

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789 
better idea to use spotters but if I
