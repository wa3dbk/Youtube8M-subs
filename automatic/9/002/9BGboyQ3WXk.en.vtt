playing<00:01:58.090> a<00:01:58.240> part<00:01:58.450> of<00:01:58.570> that<00:01:58.660> I<00:01:58.840> was<00:01:59.020> a<00:01:59.080> fast<00:01:59.290> suit

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
playing a part of that I was a fast suit

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.810 
playing a part of that I was a fast suit
no<00:01:59.740> question<00:02:00.040> about<00:02:00.130> that<00:02:00.220> I<00:02:00.400> was<00:02:00.580> happy<00:02:00.760> to

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
no question about that I was happy to

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.970 
no question about that I was happy to
wear<00:02:00.970> it<00:02:01.060> and<00:02:01.260> so<00:02:02.260> are<00:02:02.320> most<00:02:02.440> of<00:02:02.560> my<00:02:02.650> teammates

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 
wear it and so are most of my teammates

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.010 
wear it and so are most of my teammates
I<00:02:03.190> mean<00:02:03.340> it<00:02:03.550> was<00:02:03.700> a<00:02:03.790> fast<00:02:04.060> suit<00:02:04.270> and<00:02:04.510> I<00:02:04.750> would

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
I mean it was a fast suit and I would

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.500 
I mean it was a fast suit and I would
think<00:02:05.140> a<00:02:05.290> logical<00:02:05.890> progression<00:02:05.980> in<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:07.360> line

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
think a logical progression in the line

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.720 
think a logical progression in the line
of<00:02:07.630> suits<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:08.080> I<00:02:08.290> don't<00:02:09.070> know<00:02:09.130> how<00:02:09.280> anything's

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:09.730 
of suits and I don't know how anything's

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:10.640 
of suits and I don't know how anything's
going<00:02:09.850> to<00:02:09.940> come<00:02:10.119> up<00:02:10.270> and<00:02:10.390> beat<00:02:10.540> that

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:10.650 
going to come up and beat that

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.230 
going to come up and beat that
eventually<00:02:11.650> said<00:02:12.250> that<00:02:12.370> about<00:02:12.490> the<00:02:12.790> first<00:02:13.060> one

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
eventually said that about the first one

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.480 
eventually said that about the first one
but<00:02:13.810> always<00:02:14.230> seems<00:02:14.590> to<00:02:14.680> happen<00:02:14.890> you<00:02:15.370> know<00:02:15.460> I

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
but always seems to happen you know I

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.090 
but always seems to happen you know I
mean<00:02:15.990> it's<00:02:16.990> just<00:02:17.050> you<00:02:17.710> know<00:02:17.770> evolution

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
mean it's just you know evolution

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.620 
mean it's just you know evolution
Darwinism<00:02:18.730> I<00:02:18.850> suppose<00:02:19.150> they<00:02:19.330> did<00:02:19.450> a<00:02:19.510> little

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
Darwinism I suppose they did a little

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.880 
Darwinism I suppose they did a little
bit<00:02:19.780> of<00:02:19.810> work<00:02:19.990> on<00:02:20.110> it<00:02:20.200> very<00:02:20.230> proud<00:02:20.620> of<00:02:20.650> the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
bit of work on it very proud of the

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.220 
bit of work on it very proud of the
result<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.400> I<00:02:21.580> think<00:02:22.000> Australians<00:02:22.390> by<00:02:22.930> fire

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
result and I think Australians by fire

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.930 
result and I think Australians by fire
had<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.620> best<00:02:23.800> seat<00:02:24.040> we<00:02:24.250> had<00:02:24.460> the<00:02:24.640> hottest

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
had the best seat we had the hottest

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.940 
had the best seat we had the hottest
suit<00:02:25.270> in<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.480> fall<00:02:25.780> so<00:02:25.810> I<00:02:26.110> really<00:02:26.650> loved<00:02:26.860> our

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
suit in the fall so I really loved our

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.260 
suit in the fall so I really loved our
pattern<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:27.490> some<00:02:27.670> of<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.850> suites<00:02:28.120> actually

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
pattern and some of the suites actually

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.090 
pattern and some of the suites actually
had<00:02:28.510> us<00:02:28.630> one<00:02:28.840> star<00:02:29.170> on<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.620> back<00:02:29.770> so<00:02:29.920> when<00:02:30.010> the

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
had us one star on the back so when the

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.320 
had us one star on the back so when the
girls<00:02:30.280> were<00:02:30.430> doing<00:02:30.580> flight<00:02:30.850> looked<00:02:31.180> at

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
girls were doing flight looked at

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.449

magnificent<00:02:31.989> so<00:02:32.260> I<00:02:32.500> mean<00:02:32.860> all<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.130> hard<00:02:33.310> work

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
magnificent so I mean all the hard work

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:34.770 
magnificent so I mean all the hard work
was<00:02:33.610> really<00:02:33.910> worth<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:34.300> I<00:02:34.360> think<00:02:34.570> it<00:02:34.660> really

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
was really worth and I think it really

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.420 
was really worth and I think it really
paid<00:02:35.050> off<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.440> it<00:02:35.530> they<00:02:35.830> really<00:02:36.160> did<00:02:36.310> look

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430
