of<00:00:06.379> fantastic<00:00:07.379> species<00:00:07.859> your<00:00:08.040> first<00:00:08.220> time

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
of fantastic species your first time

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.180 
of fantastic species your first time
speaking<00:00:08.639> right<00:00:09.200> 21<00:00:10.200> convention<00:00:10.440> absolutely

speaking right 21 convention absolutely
yeah<00:00:11.490> number<00:00:11.880> one<00:00:12.030> great<00:00:12.450> we<00:00:12.630> loved<00:00:12.990> your

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
yeah number one great we loved your

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.570 
yeah number one great we loved your
speech<00:00:13.440> so<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:13.650> think<00:00:13.830> it<00:00:14.130> we're<00:00:14.280> gonna<00:00:14.370> have<00:00:14.519> a

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
speech so I think it we're gonna have a

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.250 
speech so I think it we're gonna have a
hard<00:00:14.849> time<00:00:15.059> topping<00:00:15.360> that<00:00:15.540> speech<00:00:15.839> there's

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
hard time topping that speech there's

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.810 
hard time topping that speech there's
just<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.440> couple<00:00:16.470> things<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:17.010> definitely<00:00:17.460> wanted

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
just a couple things I definitely wanted

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.760 
just a couple things I definitely wanted
to<00:00:17.880> ask<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.390> for<00:00:18.750> viewers<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:19.380> they<00:00:19.529> are<00:00:19.680> if

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
to ask you for viewers that they are if

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.779 
to ask you for viewers that they are if
you<00:00:19.830> ain't<00:00:19.949> get<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.100> catch<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.400> whole<00:00:20.520> speech

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
you ain't get to catch the whole speech

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.519 
you ain't get to catch the whole speech
you<00:00:21.720> talked<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.990> little<00:00:22.109> bit<00:00:22.260> about

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
you talked a little bit about

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.070 
you talked a little bit about
epigenetics<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.660> what<00:00:24.660> do<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:24.750> think<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.050> the

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
epigenetics and what do you think is the

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.040 
epigenetics and what do you think is the
best<00:00:25.410> way<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.769> either<00:00:26.460> fight<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.390> epigenetics

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
best way to either fight the epigenetics

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.679 
best way to either fight the epigenetics
or<00:00:28.289> try<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.010> use<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.310> in<00:00:29.490> your<00:00:29.519> advantage<00:00:30.060> okay

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
or try and use it in your advantage okay

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.920 
or try and use it in your advantage okay
so<00:00:30.890> I'll<00:00:31.890> just<00:00:31.949> be<00:00:32.250> clear<00:00:32.489> one<00:00:33.300> epigenetics

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
so I'll just be clear one epigenetics

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.620 
so I'll just be clear one epigenetics
yeah<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.530> epigenetics<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:36.090> idea<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.480> we

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
yeah so epigenetics is this idea that we

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.510 
yeah so epigenetics is this idea that we
can<00:00:36.780> inherit<00:00:37.050> things<00:00:37.350> right<00:00:38.010> either

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
can inherit things right either

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.780 
can inherit things right either
behavioral<00:00:39.300> or<00:00:39.420> physical<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.530> are<00:00:40.829> not

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
behavioral or physical that are not

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.030 
behavioral or physical that are not
genetically<00:00:42.210> coded<00:00:42.540> in<00:00:42.780> our<00:00:42.899> genetic<00:00:43.079> code<00:00:43.290> so

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
genetically coded in our genetic code so

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.979 
genetically coded in our genetic code so
sometimes<00:00:44.879> they're<00:00:45.149> sometimes<00:00:45.570> they're<00:00:45.960> just

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
sometimes they're sometimes they're just

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.750 
sometimes they're sometimes they're just
paid<00:00:46.440> like<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.980> mentioned<00:00:47.160> before<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.610> can

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
paid like I mentioned before you can

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.819 
paid like I mentioned before you can
inherit<00:00:48.450> in<00:00:48.660> neuroticism<00:00:49.110> epigenetically

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
inherit in neuroticism epigenetically

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.590 
inherit in neuroticism epigenetically
but<00:00:50.640> other<00:00:50.760> times<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.180> connection<00:00:51.510> be

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
but other times it connection be

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.819 
but other times it connection be
physical<00:00:51.989> deformities<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.500> we<00:00:52.710> can

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
physical deformities that we can

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.459 
physical deformities that we can
actually<00:00:52.920> pick<00:00:53.489> up<00:00:53.610> on<00:00:53.879> but<00:00:54.840> ok<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.199> you've

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
actually pick up on but ok so you've

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.020 
actually pick up on but ok so you've
asked<00:00:55.620> me<00:00:55.710> how<00:00:55.920> do<00:00:56.190> we<00:00:56.309> work<00:00:56.430> with<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.730> exactly

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
asked me how do we work with it exactly

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.090 
asked me how do we work with it exactly
the<00:00:57.090> same<00:00:57.149> way<00:00:57.360> we<00:00:57.899> would<00:00:57.930> work<00:00:58.680> with<00:00:58.739> any

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
the same way we would work with any

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.130 
the same way we would work with any
other<00:00:59.309> type<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.579> genetic<00:00:59.820> variants<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.930> for

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
other type of genetic variants so for

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.229 
other type of genetic variants so for
example<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.680> may<00:01:01.949> be<00:01:02.010> born<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.460> all<00:01:02.579> people

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
example you may be born to all people

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.850 
example you may be born to all people
and<00:01:03.300> short<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.780> may<00:01:03.899> be<00:01:03.960> born<00:01:04.260> with<00:01:04.439> great

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
and short you may be born with great

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.469 
and short you may be born with great
hair<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.280> maybe<00:01:05.400> they're<00:01:05.610> both<00:01:05.880> mad<00:01:06.150> hey<00:01:06.420> you

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
hair and maybe they're both mad hey you

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.609 
hair and maybe they're both mad hey you
may<00:01:06.659> be<00:01:06.720> one<00:01:06.990> with<00:01:07.110> all<00:01:07.260> sorts<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.560> different

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
may be one with all sorts of different

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.380 
may be one with all sorts of different
things<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.400> may<00:01:08.490> be<00:01:08.549> like<00:01:08.790> me<00:01:08.970> your<00:01:09.240> hairs

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
things you may be like me your hairs

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.000 
things you may be like me your hairs
that<00:01:09.570> starts<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.260> then<00:01:10.380> when<00:01:10.530> you're<00:01:10.590> 30<00:01:10.799> I

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
that starts that then when you're 30 I

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.859 
that starts that then when you're 30 I
you<00:01:11.670> get<00:01:11.820> all<00:01:12.000> these<00:01:12.150> different<00:01:12.360> things<00:01:12.540> so

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
you get all these different things so

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.390 
you get all these different things so
the<00:01:13.170> way<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.320> work<00:01:13.530> around<00:01:13.590> them<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.100> first<00:01:14.340> of

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
the way to work around them is first of

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.820 
the way to work around them is first of
all<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.580> have<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.760> fight<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.320> again<00:01:16.320> i'm<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.619> big

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
all to have a fight so again i'm a big

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.740 
all to have a fight so again i'm a big
fan<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.070> buddhist<00:01:17.400> philosophy<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:18.090> and

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
fan of buddhist philosophy and and

fighting with anything in life is the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.880 
fighting with anything in life is the

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
dissatisfied with it the key is to learn

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.740 
dissatisfied with it the key is to learn
to<00:01:25.200> work<00:01:25.409> with<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:26.280> around<00:01:26.580> what<00:01:27.360> you've<00:01:27.540> got

it's they believe they have control over

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.350 
it's they believe they have control over
the<00:04:03.769> way<00:04:03.860> people<00:04:04.010> think<00:04:04.370> over<00:04:04.850> the<00:04:04.940> weather<00:04:05.120> of

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
the way people think over the weather of

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.680 
the way people think over the weather of
the<00:04:05.540> stock<00:04:05.750> market<00:04:06.200> of<00:04:06.680> everything<00:04:07.250> and<00:04:08.060> so

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
the stock market of everything and so

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.330 
the stock market of everything and so
it's<00:04:08.870> about<00:04:08.959> perceived<00:04:09.530> control<00:04:09.800> what<00:04:10.250> we

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
it's about perceived control what we

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.040 
it's about perceived control what we
believe<00:04:10.700> so<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.209> biggest<00:04:11.360> mistake<00:04:11.540> we<00:04:11.870> make

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
believe so the biggest mistake we make

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.390 
believe so the biggest mistake we make
is<00:04:12.080> we<00:04:12.290> set<00:04:12.500> goals<00:04:12.530> where<00:04:12.950> we<00:04:13.100> don't<00:04:13.220> have

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
is we set goals where we don't have

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.830 
is we set goals where we don't have
complete<00:04:13.730> control<00:04:13.820> over<00:04:14.030> what<00:04:14.600> does<00:04:14.690> life

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
complete control over what does life

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
the difference between the influence

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.320 
the difference between the influence
versus<00:04:28.640> control<00:04:29.000> ah<00:04:29.390> right<00:04:30.110> so<00:04:30.610> as<00:04:31.610> I<00:04:32.180> was<00:04:32.300> just

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
versus control ah right so as I was just

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.210 
versus control ah right so as I was just
saying<00:04:32.510> yeah<00:04:32.870> I<00:04:33.020> control<00:04:33.680> over<00:04:33.830> the<00:04:33.919> world<00:04:34.070> is

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
saying yeah I control over the world is

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.060 
saying yeah I control over the world is
actually<00:04:34.520> very<00:04:34.550> small<00:04:34.940> in<00:04:35.270> fact<00:04:35.419> life<00:04:35.840> is

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
actually very small in fact life is

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.800 
actually very small in fact life is
depressingly<00:04:37.070> full<00:04:37.790> of<00:04:37.910> lack<00:04:38.060> of<00:04:38.090> control<00:04:38.479> are

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
depressingly full of lack of control are

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.070 
depressingly full of lack of control are
things<00:04:39.080> go<00:04:39.260> wrong<00:04:39.380> all<00:04:39.560> the<00:04:39.710> time<00:04:40.120> but<00:04:41.120> but<00:04:41.870> we

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
things go wrong all the time but but we

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.630 
things go wrong all the time but but we
certainly<00:04:42.290> get<00:04:42.590> better<00:04:42.830> influencing

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
certainly get better influencing

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.850 
certainly get better influencing
operators<00:04:44.240> so<00:04:44.720> another<00:04:45.410> mistake<00:04:45.680> that<00:04:45.830> people

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
operators so another mistake that people

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.159 
operators so another mistake that people
make<00:04:46.100> which<00:04:46.550> is<00:04:46.580> perfect<00:04:47.030> exactly<00:04:47.540> Ryan's

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
make which is perfect exactly Ryan's

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.200 
make which is perfect exactly Ryan's
this<00:04:48.350> is<00:04:48.650> they<00:04:49.040> had<00:04:49.220> they<00:04:49.370> become<00:04:49.640> people<00:04:49.850> who

started<00:06:05.330> out<00:06:05.450> with<00:06:05.599> the<00:06:05.990> typical<00:06:06.349> where

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
started out with the typical where

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.300 
started out with the typical where
things<00:06:07.190> you<00:06:07.310> said<00:06:07.520> these<00:06:07.669> long<00:06:07.909> big<00:06:08.479> goals<00:06:09.050> and

what I found was that you usually don't

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:12.700 
what I found was that you usually don't
achieve<00:06:11.659> them<00:06:12.080> because<00:06:12.470> they're<00:06:12.590> always

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
achieve them because they're always

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.620 
achieve them because they're always
