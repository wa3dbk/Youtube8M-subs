00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
unconscious I don't know which one I

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.429

want her to be unconscious whatever she
is<00:01:19.470> not<00:01:19.770> dead<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.070> course<00:01:20.310> but<00:01:21.060> we<00:01:21.240> don't<00:01:21.420> know

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
but what I also find out to be very

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.950 
but what I also find out to be very
interesting<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.369> in<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.360> actual<00:01:27.540> video

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
interesting is that in the actual video

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.249 
interesting is that in the actual video
there's<00:01:28.439> actually<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.220> new<00:01:29.759> villain<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:31.200> I

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
there's actually a new villain that I

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.429 
there's actually a new villain that I
think<00:01:31.680> appears<00:01:32.130> now<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.780> definitely<00:01:34.229> a

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
think appears now this is definitely a

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.590 
think appears now this is definitely a
new<00:01:34.710> entity<00:01:35.159> we<00:01:35.460> don't<00:01:35.759> know<00:01:35.970> who<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.570> or

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
new entity we don't know who that is or

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.319 
new entity we don't know who that is or
what<00:01:37.079> he<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.290> but<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.280> definitely<00:01:38.909> seems<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.299> be

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
what he is but it definitely seems to be

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.649 
what he is but it definitely seems to be
the<00:01:39.570> one<00:01:39.689> responsible<00:01:40.049> for<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:41.729> woman<00:01:42.329> lying

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
the one responsible for this woman lying

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.100 
the one responsible for this woman lying
unconscious<00:01:43.170> onto<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.680> ground<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.360> feel<00:01:45.990> as

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
unconscious onto the ground so I feel as

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.410 
unconscious onto the ground so I feel as
though<00:01:46.140> Gohan<00:01:46.649> will<00:01:46.829> seek<00:01:47.130> revenge<00:01:47.579> towards
