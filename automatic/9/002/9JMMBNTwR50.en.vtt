00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:09.420
 what's up, well, several players 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.789
 yesterday of this I will not play with two 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.199
 wheels to change a bit of the 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:15.800
 last games that have been playing 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:19.550
 with the hunter and especially with a warrior 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.550
 so let's go 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:30.080
 come on, exercise tony, come on let's go 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:33.670
 give me a worthy opponent but after a while 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.670
 there is a worthy opponent 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.289
 and good 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:46.449
 the bushings and he has given me very letters 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.210
 fun fixes all cause less 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.710
 I love this scourge I love the 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.960
 protective iron bark for my taste 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.360
 one of the best 8 diamond cards 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.809
 because an 88 who came to provoke is 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.839
 very important the bad thing is that this 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.430
 bastard I have as opposite can have 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.250
 the letter to execute and that can 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.890
 bust an 88 letter with only two 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.720
 touches that is touching me with a unit 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.180
 although he commits suicide and then 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.490
 launching to sing then nothing ready to 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.430
 the action started with a lackey 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.060
 and see what this scourge has in store for me 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.060
 love inflicts four points of 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.060
 enemies 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.260
 let's see these letters 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:39.150
 he is getting a number of points 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:39.150
 equivalent to your weapon attack as 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:49.760
 a bit brutal is a little bit of a moment 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:54.410
 I could get mana crystals 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:56.480
 extra and take out the scourge and it would be good 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.220
 idea but it would also be a little bad 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.960
 spend it I do not know 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.730
 I can happen to the I can book it 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.730
 all this and already if that later 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.469
 with the weapons when winning with them 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:16.190
 I'm going to hurt myself a bit but I'm going to 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:18.890
 try to attack with my character to this 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.680
 Pirate can win in one turn this 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.480
 provoke it loads it now but it 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.870
 will be one of health and power then 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.490
 already with my passive load it and thus I try 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.070
 book some cards for the late 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.400
 game that is where it really resolves 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.400
 the thing 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.580
 it's awesome how the xerez is a 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.850
 Sometimes things can be given totally 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.530
 the turn towards me 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.900
 so you have to have the greatest number of 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.820
 low possible or I am now I have a 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.370
 protective iron bark but I do not believe in 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.970
 he does not believe in him because he can get me out 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:57.810
 a letter run and load less and 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:01.230
 I could use the glass 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.460
 also and the stimulating for let's say to 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.750
 get this iron bark in the turn 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:10.200
 5 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.640
 but still it would be risky because if 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.500
 then very fast maybe it could 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.880
 still have letters to run or not 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.620
 who knows that this is already a game 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.330
 luck can not not know can not 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.330
 guess what the contract takes 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:29.550
 Of course it is difficult because it does not have 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:33.270
 It looks like you have a lot of idea of what to do 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:36.800
 please come to attack me is 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.650
 it is clear that maybe it is 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.579
 disconnected 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.579
 is looking at the shrews 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.819
 alan to take for ass 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.430
 when you want to do nothing alone 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:53.180
 OK 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:56.959
 excellent excellent as we will continue 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.459
 taking advantage of let's see in this turn I 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.219
 could do with stimulate it would be six 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.760
 points I come but if a man of the 

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:03.760
 sand yes 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:12.260
 the strong is in goodbye to arms 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:16.570
 there he is and with this he already controls table or 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:19.570
 be it with the sole use of a letter or 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.570
 now 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:27.409
 is eating the sausages now or that 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:27.409
 power 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.050
 Y 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:43.199
 well worth bone 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:45.149
 I'm playing well but apart from that 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:48.719
 at least I'm playing I'm playing 

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:50.729
 is not at least game you can tell that 

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:52.900
 it is an advantage when it comes to wanting to win 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.510
 well 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:59.249
 is 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:02.089
 is that I'm going to give for ass 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:02.089
 the eyes 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.910
 and I'm going to stay like that because who knows 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.440
 if the best is a trick better I trust 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:13.180
 is some command of letters and then I 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.180
 does something no no no 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.800
 by the way I think the player is German 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:28.620
 but disconnected is not because it is the 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.730
 battle or difference 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.730
 they just are not playing 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:42.820
 very well 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.820
 it seems good 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:50.790
 hey it's a range that I win I'm not going to 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:54.690
 feel bad 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.690
 there it is there is 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:06:03.929
 ay go back go go go and come back 

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:03.929
 strong 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.790
 and me what is it to me about the 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.860
 disconnection but it's too late 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.690
 because he just showed up and he's going to say my 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.820
 combo but it does not matter he used this already 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:20.080
 take for ass 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.080
 finished 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.820
 that happens to the Germans to do 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:35.090
 Nazi stuff takes already then over 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:37.250
 victory of the druid or the rogue is not worth 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.230
 let's be a dear money not what 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.210
 demons is worth of any of the 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.980
 ways or a good battle has been 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.300
 well played is true we have not going to 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.220
 say that you have missed a van many 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.710
 letters are you going to draw the precise moment and 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:52.330
 pimba then nothing sesame side put a 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.330
 like see you in the next
