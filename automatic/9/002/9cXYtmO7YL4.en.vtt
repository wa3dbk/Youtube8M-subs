00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.450
 this is the reel of a this canon 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.430
 As you can see, this is where the 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.599
 hows called 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.599
 the cartridges 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.060
 all the ribbons already leave me a canon 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.579
 because I'm going to occupy only the 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.710
 scanner I will not occupy this all the 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:36.720
 canon is a multifunctional 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.150
 in the title of the video is the model of 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:43.470
 the canon that disarms 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:45.690
 and this is it, but since I'm not going to 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.820
 occupy this what would be the cartridges and 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.420
 all that I 'm going to do I 'm going to occupy the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.329
 only the scanner 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.879
 is completely disarmed and I'm going to throw 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.079
 this that does not work for me the only thing I want 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.079
 is that I serve the scanner 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.820
 practically everything and make a mold of 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.640
 wood with what 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.140
 with which I'm going to put a motor for 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.170
 that the scanner does not work perfectly 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.460
 a wooden mold and I'm going to use 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.460
 what is glue 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.420
 although it is glue for 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.340
 why 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:28.000
 so that the scanner does not work 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:31.490
 and those are the pins where the 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.080
 cartridge in case they did not know porta les 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.080
 i bring a cartridge bag 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:53.760
 this would be a cartridge this will be a 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:58.700
 cannon cartridge then this this they see 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.700
 here is what sticks in these parts 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.280
 what you see here is what hits this 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.490
 what sticks in these parts here 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.590
 there are also methods for the canon to be 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:15.480
 recognize the cartridges in this case and 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.480
 the cartridges had already opened 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.560
 and I knew this silicon post for 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.640
 close them again and they remain again 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.030
 tight and here they have the plug 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.150
 the plug where the system was connected 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.910
 of continuous ink 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.540
 the cartridge is put in this way 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.540
 they got 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.490
 the cartridges got in like this 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.720
 ah 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.300
 ah 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:31.140
 with the joke that these are the 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:34.070
 cartridges if we go more closely we get 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.070
 see what this is 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.430
 what it is 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.850
 the entrance with which they scan the 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.850
 inks 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.770
 from the stain 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:53.540
 what are these 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.540
 it is not enough to appreciate well 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:00.650
 when they are going to be cleaned, not the 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.640
 you have to clean with your finger like that 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.450
 how am I doing because 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:09.130
 practically what it does is ruin the 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.130
 You will have to clean it with cotton 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:16.930
 and this this here that are the pins 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:21.609
 of the cartridge of preference is not 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:24.880
 I would not have to touch them or stain them 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:27.070
 those of ink since that makes it 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.000
 obsolete since they are circuits that go 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.980
 directly here 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.950
 And if they're stained, that's going to damage 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.410
 what would be the pins these 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:39.320
 this here is the same, they will be 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:42.560
 have to get cleaned with a cotton swab or 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.420
 something with a cotton swab or brush 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.730
 teeth this is very good a brush 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.400
 teeth so that everything 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:52.009
 what waxed or something 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.470
 and that you recognize these pins well 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:57.610
 which are the ones connected here 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.610
 there being gotten 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.330
 and this is the color the color ink 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.870
 same as you see has the three 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.660
 Slots 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.790
 it is not enough to appreciate well 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.760
 and this black and white this is the one of 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:16.020
 black this is the color east color 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:19.580
 It has three slots that are the color ones 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:22.069
 there the three grooves look good 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:25.950
 as you see here is all the plastic shaft 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:29.540
 what would be the what was the canon 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.540
 here is all broken 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:39.699
 this is what we are going to vacate 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.699
 then in the other video
