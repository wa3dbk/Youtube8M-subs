00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 Hello dear Nozemans 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:09.450
 Recently, I was looking for an alternative 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.639
 less rat but thank god there is internet 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.730
 and he quickly suggested a solution 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.850
 Means prompted that in alternative 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:23.430
 the rat can choose such a knife 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.869
 lock to by essie means actually 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.859
 saying what is 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.500
 alternativeness 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.009
 and why I decided to buy this knife 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.840
 and try but the main reason 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.290
 written here is here is written frame 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.050
 locke 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.969
 as is well known on the rat thin liner 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.420
 here is frame lock 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:43.860
 It means necessary to try a knife that is the 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.050
 alternativeness consists 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.270
 but how not cool how not twirl and two 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.110
 knife will have to compare but what am I 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.110
 I'll do it now 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.219
 well let's look at the size of the boxes 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.449
 first boxes but practically 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.609
 of the same size 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.979
 which is longer than the width of headquarters 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.760
 height that is, knives about 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.780
 same size equal here 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:17.549
 now if we look here 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:20.670
 see as not rat written by Randals 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.880
 drinks and training at once somewhere 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.240
 written randals adventures training then 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.040
 there is one group of designers 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:34.200
 designed these knives here still 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.840
 there is an inscription made in may win taiwan that 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.040
 they were made basically the same 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:44.450
 conditions now 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:51.800
 You can look at the knives themselves 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:54.530
 compare them and make sure that here 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.780
 This knife lock yes and hit on Spanish 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.710
 mosquito is an alternative 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.360
 the rat 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:05.180
 mini cruiser means thats the size in 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.800
 folded but practically 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:12.160
 the same can be a rat a little more 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.160
 if decomposed 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:29.000
 please laid out too practically 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:31.750
 same size with imposed too 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.310
 almost the same size 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.310
 same size when folded 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.860
 the wedge 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:46.420
 almost the same log size 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:50.209
 cutting edge, too, one size does 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.310
 the only difference is rat shoes 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.989
 slightly rounded but practically 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:03:00.440
 direct and here is an uzam where mosquito 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:04.989
 shoes down a little so 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:07.480
 teardrop shape is obtained now 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:11.720
 I want to compare design 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:16.160
 if we look at the rat, we see that 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:19.880
 the knife is a beautiful enough knife here if 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.760
 we look at the castle until we understand that 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.880
 is it some kind of freak or something? 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.590
 a little lax knife if in design 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.230
 rats not only provided 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.950
 on practicality and more how beautiful it 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:37.970
 here is a solid feature very let's 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:40.790
 let's see what it is expressed to begin with 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.980
 compare the thickness of the arms can be seen that here 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.150
 this knife . 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.000
 accordingly less felt on 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.150
 pocket 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.270
 means pegs to open immediately 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:55.180
 it can be seen that they are symmetrical on the rat 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.730
 lock yes the same pinner that fits 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:02.590
 pocket less and perform practically 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:04.510
 the thickness of the liner is generally done with 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:09.700
 they didnâ€™t call for less to cling to 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:14.890
 pocket upon delivery so inverse 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:17.709
 medal side thinner knife wider grip 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:23.980
 is a belly right hypertrophied on 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:26.260
 the handle here is what about the locks here by 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.720
 my everything is very clear and thin 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.600
 liner on a rat before or here's a frame block 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:37.540
 quite a decent thickness on such 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:40.780
 small on the same actually those 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:43.860
 moments that I wanted to draw 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:47.020
 attention and comparing these two knives 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.180
 This is how this knife will show itself. 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.270
 I 'll see later I plan to take off 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.919
 the second video where I will spend some tests 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:59.380
 look at how much this knife is more convenient 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:03.070
 what a rat might be the other way around in 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:08.460
 general test will show for now thanks for 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.460
 attention all bye
