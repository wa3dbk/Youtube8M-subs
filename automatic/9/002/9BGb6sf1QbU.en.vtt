00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:14.150
 very good personal fiat freemont 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.150
 the dodge journey 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.109
 people ask if you can 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.960
 put in it and the original key itself 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:29.160
 of the vehicle 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:31.710
 that from here functions that make one rose 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.680
 the glass close the mirrors and the ceiling 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:41.730
 independent of the position that is 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:45.809
 is yes it is possible but not for some 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.370
 people is logical is if you connect the 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.780
 concessionaire they say that it is 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.579
 it simply impossible to do this 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.090
 working with the closing system of 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.350
 see by original vehicle key 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.129
 due to the vehicle 's system is very 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.989
 complex 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.550
 some parts in redican others in 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.460
 fiber optic 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.949
 A lot of people are afraid to move. 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:10.200
 it is possible in this case what was 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:13.670
 placed in a freemont fiat year 2013 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.659
 the closing of electric windows 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.040
 mirrors and sunroof 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.770
 remembering that the sunroof is 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.490
 regardless of his position 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.009
 it will be closed will never pass your 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.540
 course because it is accessories 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.890
 the first line that has conditions of 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.630
 measuring the position of the sunroof 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.530
 let's see how it works 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:41.450
 way with the mirror as it closes the 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.450
 mirror when deactivating it opens the mirror 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:52.579
 see if the sunroof running through the mirror 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:56.990
 internally busting the books will 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:02:01.270
 driver's first series and so on. 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.270
 successively make your circle party 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:16.519
 when you turn off the car alarm it opens 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:20.209
 only the mirrors is not as magnificent 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:24.680
 so if you did it was good 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:28.130
 It is possible to do this yes 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.130
 even if the concessionaire says that 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.349
 remembering that no wire agreed 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:40.640
 all these hours are indexed to the car 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:43.930
 especially not altering then 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:48.380
 car warranty in case you have 1 to 0 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:51.190
 may be making that hug accessory 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.190
 see you next time
