now<00:00:40.590> when<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:40.829> say<00:00:41.070> pieces<00:00:41.520> I'm<00:00:41.700> talking<00:00:42.059> about

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
now when I say pieces I'm talking about

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.650 
now when I say pieces I'm talking about
rooks<00:00:42.629> Knights<00:00:43.350> bishops<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.550> queens<00:00:45.149> that's

rooks Knights bishops and queens that's

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.750 
rooks Knights bishops and queens that's
how<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:45.960> works<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.440> chess<00:00:46.649> world<00:00:46.890> pawns

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
how it works in the chess world pawns

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.209 
how it works in the chess world pawns
are<00:00:47.969> pawns<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.539> pieces<00:00:49.379> are<00:00:49.590> rooks<00:00:49.890> Knights

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
are pawns and pieces are rooks Knights

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.389 
are pawns and pieces are rooks Knights
bishops<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.300> queens<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:52.680> pieces<00:00:53.160> are

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
bishops and queens so pieces are

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.360 
bishops and queens so pieces are
extremely<00:00:53.489> mobile<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:55.160> grandmasters<00:00:56.160> know

extremely mobile and grandmasters know

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.709 
extremely mobile and grandmasters know
when<00:00:56.550> their<00:00:56.699> pieces<00:00:56.910> are<00:00:57.149> starting<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.570> lose

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
when their pieces are starting to lose

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.189 
when their pieces are starting to lose
mobility<00:00:58.260> they<00:00:59.070> can<00:00:59.250> see<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.579> mile<00:00:59.850> away

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
mobility they can see that a mile away

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.270 
mobility they can see that a mile away
that's<00:01:01.199> why<00:01:01.379> my<00:01:01.530> first<00:01:01.710> tip<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.250> is

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
that's why my first tip to you is

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.429 
that's why my first tip to you is
actually<00:01:02.640> totally<00:01:03.539> unrelated<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.140> trap

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
actually totally unrelated to trap

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.750 
actually totally unrelated to trap
pieces<00:01:04.860> pawns<00:01:05.850> are<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.689> best<00:01:06.990> targets

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
pieces pawns are the best targets

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.820 
pieces pawns are the best targets
because<00:01:08.760> they<00:01:08.909> mostly<00:01:09.479> move<00:01:09.840> only<00:01:10.110> one<00:01:10.500> square

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
because they mostly move only one square

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.399 
because they mostly move only one square
at<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.070> time<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.580> usually<00:01:12.570> only<00:01:12.900> in<00:01:13.140> one

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
at a time and usually only in one

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.249 
at a time and usually only in one
direction<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:14.100> that's<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.180> powerful<00:01:15.479> reminder

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
direction so that's a powerful reminder

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.960 
direction so that's a powerful reminder
don't<00:01:16.590> underestimate<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.310> piece<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.700> advice

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
don't underestimate that piece of advice

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.330 
don't underestimate that piece of advice
or<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:19.170> reminder<00:01:19.619> if<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.890> already<00:01:20.100> know

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
or that reminder if you already know

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.060 
or that reminder if you already know
that<00:01:20.689> all<00:01:21.689> right<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.049> let's<00:01:22.650> see<00:01:22.799> some

black plays rook b3 well you've studied
the<00:02:22.410> other<00:02:22.620> videos<00:02:23.100> then<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:23.910> already

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
the other videos then you already

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.180 
the other videos then you already
recognize<00:02:24.780> that<00:02:24.990> black's<00:02:25.290> rook<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:25.800> King<00:02:26.040> are

recognize that black's rook and King are

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.470 
recognize that black's rook and King are
on<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.430> same<00:02:26.610> diagonal<00:02:27.110> what<00:02:28.110> signal<00:02:28.470> is<00:02:28.590> that

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
on the same diagonal what signal is that

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.110 
on the same diagonal what signal is that
alignment<00:02:30.920> we<00:02:31.920> also<00:02:32.070> have<00:02:32.400> an<00:02:32.520> exposed<00:02:32.850> King

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
an unprotected piece so you could figure

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.150 
an unprotected piece so you could figure
it<00:02:35.070> out<00:02:35.280> either<00:02:35.550> way<00:02:35.850> if<00:02:36.660> you<00:02:37.260> missed<00:02:37.560> them<00:02:37.830> I'm
