00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:13.900
 let's see one of the functions of 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.820
 excel that will help us in our data 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.939
 statistics 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:24.110
 suppose we have a picture like 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:26.050
 this where they give us the names of the 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.530
 students 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.310
 the sex of each of them 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:36.550
 the ages 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:40.450
 and Spanish qualifications 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:43.060
 of mathematics and natural sciences 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:47.230
 in this case 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:50.590
 first of all in this summary we 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:54.130
 They ask how many men we have and how many 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:58.260
 women for this I will use the 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.810
 function tell if you excel 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.400
 we go to formulas 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:09.300
 open we ask for more functions and we search 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.390
 here in select a category the 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:16.010
 statistics category 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.090
 here we find the function tell if 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:23.280
 we select and accept 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:27.360
 asks us for the range the rank will be 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:31.140
 the sex of each of the students 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:36.600
 the criteria how will I count men in 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:38.970
 this case will be male I write the m no 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.680
 must necessarily be with lyrics 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.830
 capitalized as I have it here in the 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.360
 format with lowercase also not 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:51.470
 accept accept and tell us we have 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:57.120
 14 men I will do the same with women 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:59.070
 we go to formulas we open more 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.260
 functions 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.610
 the category selection I do not do anything 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.580
 because it is already here 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:10.410
 statistical functions I select count 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:13.200
 if I accept and the range asks me the rank 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.930
 it will be sex 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.189
 I select the whole range 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:24.239
 and the criteria in this case will be women 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:28.920
 will be the letter f accepted he tells me that I have 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:31.620
 11 I'm going to add these two this I do 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.220
 with formulas 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.430
 auto adds and automatically gives me the 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:43.049
 rank to add only I give enter to 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.450
 accept and he tells me that they are in total 25 and 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.630
 I check it with my numbering and we see 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.050
 that we have 25 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.660
 I go now to the ages they will ask me 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.610
 how many men of seven how many men 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:02.180
 of eight and how many men of nine years 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:04.940
 I have for it then selected the 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.040
 Where will the result go? 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.939
 to 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.939
 formulas 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:19.390
 auto add more functions and he said now 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:23.260
 the function tell if joint accepted and 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:27.270
 the first criterion asks me the range of 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:30.070
 first criterion will be sex again 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:33.150
 and I 'm going to tell you in this case that they are going to 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:36.060
 to be men will be masculine 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.990
 where I'm going to choose ages 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.620
 it will be my second rank 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:47.390
 I choose the age range and I'm going to 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:51.200
 say that it will be those of 7 years accepted and 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:53.810
 it tells me that I have 5 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:04:00.080
 we go with those 8 years old again 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:04.580
 formulas I open more functions and I choose the 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:06.440
 function to count and set I accept the 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.250
 range for the criterion of 1 will be 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.920
 again sex as we are with the 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.680
 men will be masculine 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.910
 the range for criterion 2 will be the 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:23.060
 age range I select the whole range 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:27.380
 and I tell you it's 8 years old 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:30.139
 I accept and he tells me that I have 6 and we do 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:35.750
 the last of the men we are going to 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:40.160
 formulas I open more functions I choose the 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:45.620
 function tell if joint I accept 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:48.340
 ask for rank 1 that will be the sex we are 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:55.870
 with names will be m 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:05:01.150
 rank 2 will be the ages the son and you 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:04.600
 I say that they are going to be 9 years old accepted and I 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:07.810
 says they are 3 the same would do for the 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:13.150
 women, we are going to see in this case the 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:16.710
 math scores for saying 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:21.910
 we use the same function formulas 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:23.440
 we open more functions and choose to count 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.020
 without sets 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.230
 I agree 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.150
 asks me for the first rank that will be 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.889
 the sex 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:36.949
 in this case it will be masculine 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:40.719
 Rank 2 is in this case the 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:40.719
 math grades 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.659
 I choose the range where the 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:50.039
 mathematical qualifications and I tell him that 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:53.060
 students who have taken 7 accepted and 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:57.050
 he tells me that we have 4 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:06:00.889
 we will now do 1 of women women of 10 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:03.090
 years of 10 with qualification I'm going to 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:06.700
 formulas 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:09.930
 there will be more functions 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:15.610
 I choose the function to count and set 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:19.620
 I accept asks me the range of criteria 1 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:24.129
 selected sex what will be the criterion 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:27.669
 women in this case female the rank 

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:29.710
 two will be the qualifications of 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:33.070
 maths 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:36.220
 and I will tell you that those who have 10 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:40.480
 qualification I accept and he tells me that 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:43.789
 we have one and so we will do with each one 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:47.299
 of the 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:50.789
 qualifications that are asking us 

00:06:47.299 --> 00:06:53.669
 these two functions are extremely useful 

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:57.269
 for us as teachers at the time of 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:07:01.039
 yield statistical data I hope that they 

00:06:57.269 --> 00:07:01.039
 have served this tutorial
