00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
a faster defensive lineman or maybe a

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.560 
a faster defensive lineman or maybe a

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
that's probably something that you would

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.299 
that's probably something that you would
do<00:01:03.180> with<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.690> defensive<00:01:04.229> tackle<00:01:04.409> or<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.220> know

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
another thing that you can practice with

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.249 
another thing that you can practice with
defensive<00:01:32.729> lineman<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.270> pass<00:01:33.540> rushing<00:01:33.900> is

defensive lineman and pass rushing is
