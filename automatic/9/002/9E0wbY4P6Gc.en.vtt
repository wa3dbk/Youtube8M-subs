00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:07.330
 how good, then, to start with 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:10.660
 modeling the details so much what 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.730
 it would be the furniture like the landscape of 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.590
 this scene for the contest of axes 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.930
 record let's start with what 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.960
 would be the details of the garden or 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.480
 plants the first detail that we're going to 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.000
 basically good modeling are going to be 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.170
 some stones that would be like these 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.660
 who are here 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.700
 and the stones that are in this part 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.470
 of the garden because we're going to start with 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.579
 this good element is the element 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:39.640
 simple to start 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:42.489
 So now I'm going to decorate the scene and 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:46.179
 then let's go to the lawn and 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:49.239
 details a bit more complex in that 

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:51.729
 in time that you have to dedicate to 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.379
 produce the good for modeling stones 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:56.799
 how are we going to do this is very simple 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:59.920
 we are going to go to tri dimax / mcs i go 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:01.960
 to create a sphere 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.290
 This may be the size that we 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:08.200
 we said later what we can scale is 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.610
 very simple and good here the most 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.250
 important that we have to have in 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.770
 account is the segments here we have for 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.619
 default 32 segments I normally 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:21.700
 when I model a rock or something by the 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:24.640
 style increased it to 64 segments 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.590
 since we have added the segments what 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.479
 next thing we're going to do is apply 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.479
 a noise modifier we are going to 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:34.409
 modify the modifier lists in neo 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:38.070
 so that it sends us directly to noise 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.500
 and well good here is already applied 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.409
 in an instance we do not see anything good 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.080
 so that we can see the effect 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:49.560
 we must increase in stream either in xy 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.540
 in zeta the values ​​good for the case 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.380
 of the stones in particular and I use 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.460
 fractal so while we will 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.430
 add point 1 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.220
 in each of the coordinates with this 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:08.229
 we have already changed the way now our 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:10.509
 sphere because it has a strange noise 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.920
 truth is already a little bit passionate without 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.170
 however being still is too much 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:20.620
 spherical what are we going to do now let's 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:22.270
 apply a 2 x 2 ff modifier 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.569
 this modifier what will we 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.550
 allow is thus manipulate the geometry 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:31.110
 as if it were some kind of plasticine 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.880
 we are going to click on + and control points 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.250
 selected the tool to move and 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.140
 here it is already according to the 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.180
 creativity that each one of us 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.180
 apply to generate our rocks 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:54.400
 a bit of time before we will be 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.400
 devoting to these details yes 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.200
 Also, it is not necessary for us to be 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.740
 very obsessive with the behavior of 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.740
 these same 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.750
 if we want here instead of 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:15.020
 I'm going to deactivate this 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:18.670
 and have a little more control over this 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.960
 sphere is simple 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:25.390
 although I'm going to clone what 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:29.670
 over here and ok instead of two times two 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:33.030
 I could use 3 x 3 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:37.010
 or 4x4 this modifier I use it 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:41.390
 a lot when I want to apply for example 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.390
 I had a scene here, look for it 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.290
 a kid 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.030
 and here is the good scene this is the 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.740
 render for example when I want to put 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.660
 this newspaper that is here and give the 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.330
 feeling that he fell on the chair and 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.030
 is hanging or I want to give him movement 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.700
 is the same modifier for this case 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.880
 without control point I know that I grab and here 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.520
 I already have 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.130
 a greater number of points with which 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:16.160
 may be playing for me because how is 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:20.600
 something that is important in our 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:23.390
 in our figure but not really 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.090
 does not require so many points of 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:28.170
 control to be modifying the then 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:32.280
 really not 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:35.490
 do not use other simply with 2 x 2 as 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:40.510
 we have an excellent result to my 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:43.690
 It seems that everyone is free to 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:46.940
 do your own experiments and be 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.070
 playing with these details and 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.390
 well here we have them this would be the 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.730
 way we can model 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:55.430
 rocks here the important thing would be that 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:58.490
 we at least had about 12 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.350
 types or about 12 different models of 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.180
 these same for example here I can 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.390
 grab it and ok 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.250
 for here 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:10.760
 and if I'm going to change it , I'm not going to give it 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:13.990
 here point 3 for the noise to change and 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.990
 here at this point 5 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:19.710
 point 5 because I exaggerate 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.710
 with point 2 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:24.110
 control points 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.640
 finally it is a little bit of dedicating 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.960
 some time to generate our 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:39.540
 our rocks have several distinct and 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:43.130
 finally let's give the file 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.130
 save as rocks 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.140
 they will wait for a desk 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:57.839
 since the next the next stage 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:57.839
 what would we have 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.320
 here is the scene 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.759
 go to our model 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:13.220
 embed or good merge of those of 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:16.610
 the rocks on the stage 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:19.750
 create the forgiveness of scaling those of 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:23.660
 according to the measure and what will be 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:26.360
 with what is the live art plugin 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.620
 we will see how to apply them within the 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.630
 scene so that they fall in a 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.180
 random and therefore if it is necessary to erase 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:34.070
 some extras that we do not need good 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.850
 with this we conclude the video of how 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.920
 model rocks 

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:39.190
 let's go step by step to model 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.030
 all the details we will continue with 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.320
 the memories that we will be 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.450
 continue working with the details 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.430
 for garden and gardening we will be 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.860
 looking at some grass some plants 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:51.170
 and the importance of so many polygons 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.710
 we need or that so many do not need 

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.710
 In the scene
