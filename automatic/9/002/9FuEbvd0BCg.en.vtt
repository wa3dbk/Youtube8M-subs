00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:10.440
 talk company is this video lesson class 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:15.960
 here i am going to teach show a way 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:18.779
 easy of you drawing that enjoy 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.710
 make realistic drawings to make 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:26.279
 checkered in pictures with photos 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.429
 this technique is called a grid that 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.070
 if multiple lines are drawn 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.399
 forming a grid over the photo 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.879
 here of whether to designing and making 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.680
 same way on paper there is you want 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.950
 to draw 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.829
 this way, it avoids committing several 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.489
 errors of proportion that in my opinion 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.750
 are the most grotesque drug errors that 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.600
 we can commit when making a drawing 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.820
 Convince us, I do not know anything cool about you. 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.219
 make a drawing and is for example 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.530
 eye on the deceased to one side or the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:10.439
 other or higher than the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:15.180
 and this can easily be avoided. 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:18.509
 making use of the grid technique and 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.640
 several people do not know is a way 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.740
 practice of doing this to take off 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.080
 in the photos mainly sofas 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.350
 digitized 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.369
 so this tutorial here will help 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.100
 those people 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.909
 Ok, so let's go, I'll use the 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.030
 photoshop 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:40.799
 What I have to do is 7 6 first 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:43.020
 I'll open the image I want here 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:49.890
 make my next designer who is like this 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:58.530
 here I am going to cut these subtitles here 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:02:02.850
 underneath it I want only one ad 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:09.979
 highlight the team a little here in 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.979
 Up there the following staff 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.360
 if photoshop you need to check 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:21.849
 if you will be present in these rules here 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:25.629
 above if you do not just have to 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.379
 found found r r appeared to 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:29.650
 rules 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:34.090
 then what you do 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:38.530
 first is this come here I click 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:42.129
 I got here because I hit the button. 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.680
 left high 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.930
 From here I have two feelings as if 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.790
 can you see like this 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.019
 the ruler scale in centimeters after I 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.870
 I prefer to use centimeters but you can 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:03:00.220
 choose other measures have to 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.540
 percentage in inches here as well 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.109
 change position 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:10.379
 I prefer to use centimeters there myself 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:13.829
 I continue to do this until I complete all 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.829
 all the photo 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:25.690
 I will not do all not to stretch 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:28.419
 much the right video pull until you reach the 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:33.989
 end here and in the same way as above 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:37.120
 pulling by putting linen 22 to get another 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.560
 and another below who I'm going to stop for 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.900
 here to not stretch the video too much 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.489
 get too big and not get lost 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.090
 repetitive thing time 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.290
 now the next step the way it is 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.459
 here already when it's getting 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.290
 checkered 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:55.209
 however if you want to save this image 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:58.359
 not to open photoshop the 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:02.440
 all time to power is doing the 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:06.760
 drawing save a jpeg file 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:09.519
 these lines called guide lines 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:13.299
 they will not be saved they are not 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:15.699
 when drawing the photo or 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:18.039
 What are we going to do now is do with 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:22.180
 that they are on the same plane as the 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:26.259
 drawing the photo as follows 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:31.050
 in this tool I click and safe 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:39.850
 This is to select the first view from here. 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:41.169
 from above and pressing the shift key gives 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.050
 a little bit here to get easy 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:47.560
 and press 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:51.340
 shift key and click on five 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:54.419
 you are seeing that you have selected this line 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:58.800
 I do this in all those who are in the 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:01.630
 diagonal diagonal in the horizontal plane 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:05.259
 ready now I come here with this 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:07.930
 securely and select the other 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:13.110
 low pressure shift again and now 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.110
 select the ones that are vertically 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:29.349
 that way after selecting it we are 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:36.210
 we are going to edit and fill in or 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:36.210
 I would prefer a boss 5 is standard 55 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:53.320
 now we can choose the color of the 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:55.539
 more alive nails for example , and in some 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:06:01.599
 places I could not get right so I 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:06:04.630
 left yellow here and ok and ready 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:06.550
 Who can not see for all of them? 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.139
 these lines and this selection that is 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:13.570
 so let's remove the lines now 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:18.090
 guides and so it is only good to remove 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:21.669
 this selection it is enough to see that in 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:28.659
 select and by selection 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:32.159
 ready now the guide lines is we have to 

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:32.159
 saw this in viewing 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:44.510
 is here and is selected 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:48.670
 just click to let iraq ready 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:51.200
 He used it for you, he got a little 

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:53.120
 deleted because I used that yellow but 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.520
 I could have used another one. 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:58.310
 red 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.290
 I believe that if I would call taste 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.870
 could have also placed more lines 

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:03.470
 any centimeter to centimeter 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:10.070
 also 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:18.910
 now when I save here save only 

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:18.910
 as you can only see on foot 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:34.130
 I'll show you that you're staying. 

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:35.830
 there the lines saved and that the image 

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:42.700
 original 

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:45.470
 I just hope it helped you guys. 

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:48.020
 This video really helped by 

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:49.130
 civil engineering companies to let them 

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.780
 little joy 

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:56.210
 share also with that your friend 

00:07:50.780 --> 00:08:01.210
 I like to draw and will practice in 

00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:01.210
 galera worth until the next champions
