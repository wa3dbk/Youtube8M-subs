00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 and possibly one of the rarest 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.569
 cars of the time zis 8 truck 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.610
 this modification is trying 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.349
 reconstruct historians businessman 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.110
 Alexander Scherba met with 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.000
 enthusiasts now this wooden 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.770
 construction more reminiscent of suburban 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.320
 house and a few years ago she was 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.029
 im like the legendary bus here 8 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.039
 turned out to be in a deaf village and turned 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.930
 it is hard to remember now 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.910
 if the remains of the bus were not caught 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.920
 eyes lovers of retro cars fate 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.800
 technology would be sad and predictable 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.320
 from 8 buses did not go 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.530
 in Leningrad on the Nevsky route 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.000
 Avenue in the center of them was very much in 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.820
 35 36 years they worked quite 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.860
 enhanced post-war time too they 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.890
 mean a lot to the history of our city 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.440
 but these buses are not preserved as 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.449
 such in St. Petersburg they do not exist at all 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.579
 they burned four times already almost 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.559
 finished body structure and here are 5 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.420
 finally came under the wheel 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.610
 frame it means that now there is 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.470
 one hundred percent certainty that here 8 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.509
 will be restored despite the fact that 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.310
 the release of technology stopped for more than 70 years 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.590
 back and many details lost 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.070
 I have been practicing for almost three years 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.740
 spare parts 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.820
 no rocks different driveshaft are rare 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.190
 bumper 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.660
 many elements of which were not as 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.759
 say restorer if you change 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.509
 principles of authenticity your environment immediately 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.460
 get a nickname 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.960
 amateur replica for them is the most 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.670
 unpleasant that's why even 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.679
 minor details and those are just 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.360
 must be from that time here 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:37.800
 so try to abide by the principle 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.239
 originality that even two people 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.750
 who works on this body 

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:41.069
 the bus 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.110
 has no special education 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:44.550
 for woodwork they say themselves 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.530
 what if they worked here 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.099
 professional carpenters it would not 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.679
 bus 

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:51.780
 thirties from luxury furniture them 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.099
 released almost 600 units to start 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.140
 thirties it was the most 

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:56.970
 common bus in the ussr 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.099
 This technique looks clear from the frame 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.840
 replacing this movie zis 8 in pursuit of 

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:03.920
 american style becker on which 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.920
 trying to hide fox 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.030
 ironically today in the garage 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.459
 restorers near the bus stands 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.989
 the same kinoshka film Studebaker despite 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.430
 what is now only with very good 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.430
 imagination you can imagine the future 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.500
 bus restorer say May 9 he 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.420
 Alexander Shcherba will enter the line 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.090
 alexander heroes and the world about the character diva 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.569
 petersburg there bye everyone thanks for being 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.569
