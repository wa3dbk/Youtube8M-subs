getting<00:00:17.400> used<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:18.050> but<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.109> had<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.439> real<00:00:19.740> big

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
getting used to but I had a real big

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.830 
getting used to but I had a real big
problem<00:00:20.250> with<00:00:20.580> this<00:00:20.699> one<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:21.119> think<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:21.480> just

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
problem with this one I think I just

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.359 
problem with this one I think I just
couldn't<00:00:22.230> concentrate<00:00:22.439> for<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.070> length<00:00:23.220> of

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
couldn't concentrate for the length of

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.890 
couldn't concentrate for the length of
time<00:00:23.519> required<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:24.060> make<00:00:24.210> sure<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.539> actually

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
time required to make sure it actually

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.640 
time required to make sure it actually
worked<00:00:25.460> this<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.670> my<00:00:26.820> first<00:00:27.150> attempt<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:28.529> I

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
worked this is my first attempt and I

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.919 
worked this is my first attempt and I
was<00:00:28.740> doing<00:00:29.010> really<00:00:29.310> really<00:00:29.519> well<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.599> about

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
was doing really really well to about

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.900 
was doing really really well to about
here<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.590> then<00:00:32.279> something<00:00:32.550> really

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
here and then something really

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.310 
here and then something really
interesting<00:00:33.120> came<00:00:33.510> on<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.750> telly<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.170> I

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
interesting came on the telly and I

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.010 
interesting came on the telly and I
decided<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.860> try<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.579> knit<00:00:36.239> not<00:00:36.660> looking

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
decided that I try and knit not looking

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.450 
decided that I try and knit not looking
at<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.350> as<00:00:37.469> much<00:00:37.770> because<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.160> have<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.309> friend

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
at it as much because I have a friend

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.889 
at it as much because I have a friend
you<00:00:38.700> can<00:00:38.879> knit<00:00:39.059> without<00:00:39.300> looking<00:00:39.660> at<00:00:39.780> the

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
you can knit without looking at the

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.160 
you can knit without looking at the
omitting<00:00:40.320> went<00:00:41.280> wrong<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.989> completely<00:00:42.989> lost

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
omitting went wrong and completely lost

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.279 
omitting went wrong and completely lost
my<00:00:43.320> place<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:43.800> pull<00:00:44.070> back<00:00:44.309> tried<00:00:44.789> again<00:00:45.120> got<00:00:46.079> as

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
really all over the pattern and then I

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.140 
really all over the pattern and then I
was<00:01:05.339> getting<00:01:05.519> really<00:01:05.640> excited<00:01:05.939> because<00:01:06.000> we

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
was getting really excited because we

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.640 
was getting really excited because we
were<00:01:06.210> getting<00:01:06.299> towards<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.720> end<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.140> then

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
were getting towards the end and then

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.620 
were getting towards the end and then
that<00:01:07.920> happened<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.610> don't<00:01:08.729> know<00:01:08.970> what<00:01:09.060> happened

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
that happened I don't know what happened

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.310 
that happened I don't know what happened
but<00:01:10.340> it<00:01:11.340> just<00:01:11.670> basically<00:01:12.150> has<00:01:12.479> gone<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.900> little

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
but it just basically has gone a little

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.070 
but it just basically has gone a little
bit<00:01:13.470> pear-shaped<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:15.030> frustration<00:01:15.659> I

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
bit pear-shaped so in frustration I

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.499 
bit pear-shaped so in frustration I
decided<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.369> wool<00:01:17.580> was<00:01:18.000> jinxed<00:01:18.420> or

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
decided that it the wool was jinxed or

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.219 
decided that it the wool was jinxed or
something<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.200> just<00:01:19.799> cast<00:01:20.729> off<00:01:21.000> hoping<00:01:21.720> that

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
something so I just cast off hoping that

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.080 
something so I just cast off hoping that
this<00:01:22.409> was<00:01:22.590> going<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.890> be<00:01:23.009> 15<00:01:23.460> centimeter

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
this was going to be 15 centimeter

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.670 
this was going to be 15 centimeter
square<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.630> can<00:01:24.780> see<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.470> obviously

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
square you can see that it obviously

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.060 
square you can see that it obviously
isn't<00:01:26.460> especially<00:01:27.420> if<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.049> compare<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.680> my

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
isn't especially if you compare it to my

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.700 
isn't especially if you compare it to my
absolutely<00:01:29.700> dead<00:01:30.090> 15<00:01:30.750> square<00:01:31.110> it's<00:01:31.380> lacking

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
absolutely dead 15 square it's lacking

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.039 
absolutely dead 15 square it's lacking
about<00:01:32.509> two<00:01:33.509> centimetres<00:01:34.549> so<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.750> going

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
about two centimetres so that is going

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.219 
about two centimetres so that is going
to<00:01:37.110> have<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.380> just<00:01:37.619> go<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.670> I've<00:01:39.210> now<00:01:39.570> managed

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
to have to just go and I've now managed

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.429 
to have to just go and I've now managed
on<00:01:40.590> an<00:01:41.430> hour<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.970> really<00:01:42.750> concentrated

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
on an hour of really concentrated

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.050 
on an hour of really concentrated
knitting<00:01:43.770> absolutely<00:01:44.520> not<00:01:44.670> looking<00:01:44.970> at

scarf if you doubled the length of it so

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.399
