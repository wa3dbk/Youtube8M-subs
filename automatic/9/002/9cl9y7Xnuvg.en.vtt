00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
because they do have a shorter lifetime

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.910 
because they do have a shorter lifetime
then<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:50.039> rabbit<00:00:50.550> for<00:00:50.700> example<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.860> they<00:00:52.860> do

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
then I rabbit for example and they do

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.740 
then I rabbit for example and they do
require<00:00:53.190> less<00:00:53.670> worker<00:00:54.059> than<00:00:54.180> say<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.510> guinea

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
require less worker than say a guinea

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.450 
require less worker than say a guinea
pig<00:00:54.989> or<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.260> rabbit<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:55.800> they<00:00:55.949> are<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.129> good

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
it then the child will probably not want
