far
and<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:19.049> really<00:01:19.290> find<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.710> it's<00:01:20.220> interesting

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
and I really find it it's interesting

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.249 
and I really find it it's interesting
it's<00:01:20.880> definitely<00:01:21.240> definitely<00:01:21.869> complete<00:01:22.229> a

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
it's definitely definitely complete a

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.390 
it's definitely definitely complete a
new<00:01:22.380> challenge<00:01:22.799> all<00:01:22.950> different<00:01:23.250> things

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
new challenge all different things

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.770 
new challenge all different things
throughout<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.670> map<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.450> think<00:01:24.600> it's

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
throughout the map and I think it's

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.880 
throughout the map and I think it's
gonna<00:01:24.869> take<00:01:25.020> forever<00:01:25.200> for<00:01:25.409> everybody<00:01:25.830> to

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
gonna take forever for everybody to

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.649 
gonna take forever for everybody to
learn<00:01:26.009> exactly<00:01:26.340> how<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:26.970> map<00:01:27.150> works<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.600> how

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
learn exactly how this map works and how

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.990 
learn exactly how this map works and how
everywhere<00:01:28.500> everything<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.159> how<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.820> do

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
everywhere everything is and how to do

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.859

actually<00:01:55.619> very<00:01:55.829> powerful<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.430> notice<00:01:56.670> when<00:01:56.790> I

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
actually very powerful you notice when I

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.580 
actually very powerful you notice when I
reload<00:01:57.149> I'm<00:01:57.450> shocking<00:01:57.960> them<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.380> that's
