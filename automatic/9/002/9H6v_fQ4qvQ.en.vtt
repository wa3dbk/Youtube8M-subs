there's<00:01:54.280> a<00:01:54.340> whole<00:01:54.460> bunch<00:01:54.640> of<00:01:54.700> orbs<00:01:54.940> up<00:01:55.060> there

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
there's a whole bunch of orbs up there

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.060 
there's a whole bunch of orbs up there
like<00:01:55.900> when<00:01:56.020> you<00:01:56.110> get<00:01:56.229> to<00:01:56.320> the<00:01:56.409> top<00:01:56.440> you<00:01:56.710> end<00:01:57.010> up

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
like when you get to the top you end up

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.800 
like when you get to the top you end up
getting<00:01:57.190> like<00:01:57.460> 20<00:01:57.820> orbs<00:01:58.180> out<00:01:58.330> of<00:01:58.450> it<00:01:58.540> so<00:01:58.659> it's

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
getting like 20 orbs out of it so it's

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.859 
getting like 20 orbs out of it so it's
really<00:01:59.140> really<00:01:59.590> worth<00:02:00.340> it<00:02:00.640> but<00:02:00.970> uh<00:02:01.000> yeah<00:02:01.659> let's

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
really really worth it but uh yeah let's

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.510 
really really worth it but uh yeah let's
look<00:02:01.960> at<00:02:02.080> the<00:02:02.170> middle<00:02:02.409> part<00:02:02.590> we<00:02:02.890> just<00:02:03.100> saw<00:02:03.250> we

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
look at the middle part we just saw we

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.160 
look at the middle part we just saw we
just<00:02:03.700> saw<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:03.850> airport<00:02:04.450> on<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:04.659> other<00:02:04.840> side

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
just saw the airport on the other side

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.870 
just saw the airport on the other side
so<00:02:05.470> the<00:02:05.590> middle<00:02:05.799> part<00:02:05.979> still<00:02:06.310> has<00:02:06.430> most<00:02:06.640> its

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
so the middle part still has most its

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.570 
so the middle part still has most its
buildings<00:02:07.299> besides<00:02:08.080> your<00:02:08.319> main<00:02:08.619> hub<00:02:09.069> which

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
buildings besides your main hub which

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.790 
buildings besides your main hub which
has<00:02:09.759> been<00:02:09.939> taken<00:02:10.299> down<00:02:10.330> and<00:02:10.780> I<00:02:11.500> don't<00:02:11.620> know<00:02:11.709> if

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
has been taken down and I don't know if

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.500 
has been taken down and I don't know if
you<00:02:11.860> get<00:02:11.980> it<00:02:12.069> back<00:02:12.190> later<00:02:12.340> on<00:02:12.610> or<00:02:12.760> not<00:02:12.910> but<00:02:13.240> we

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
you get it back later on or not but we

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.199 
you get it back later on or not but we
also<00:02:13.630> have<00:02:13.780> this<00:02:13.870> huge<00:02:14.260> alien<00:02:14.470> ship<00:02:15.130> above<00:02:15.970> all

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
also have this huge alien ship above all

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:16.690 
also have this huge alien ship above all
the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
the

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.089 
the
thickness<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.270> I<00:02:18.200> don't<00:02:18.590> know<00:02:18.680> if<00:02:18.830> we<00:02:18.950> can<00:02:19.040> get

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
thickness and I don't know if we can get

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:20.860 
thickness and I don't know if we can get
above<00:02:19.340> it<00:02:19.489> or<00:02:19.580> not<00:02:19.700> we'll<00:02:19.849> try<00:02:20.090> but<00:02:20.480> this<00:02:20.510> huge

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
above it or not we'll try but this huge

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.350 
above it or not we'll try but this huge
alien<00:02:21.019> ship<00:02:21.500> is<00:02:21.769> a<00:02:21.800> bitch<00:02:22.640> because<00:02:22.910> you<00:02:23.120> can't

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
alien ship is a bitch because you can't

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.780 
alien ship is a bitch because you can't
can't<00:02:23.750> get<00:02:23.840> over<00:02:24.080> it<00:02:24.200> so<00:02:25.099> okay<00:02:25.340> you<00:02:25.400> can't<00:02:25.670> get

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
can't get over it so okay you can't get

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.880 
can't get over it so okay you can't get
over<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.030> alien<00:02:26.330> ship<00:02:26.360> it's<00:02:27.140> above<00:02:27.590> your

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
over the alien ship it's above your

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.430 
over the alien ship it's above your
radius<00:02:28.610> but<00:02:28.970> maybe<00:02:29.120> we<00:02:29.239> be<00:02:29.660> able<00:02:29.930> to<00:02:30.230> when<00:02:30.379> we

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
radius but maybe we be able to when we

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.380 
radius but maybe we be able to when we
play<00:02:30.650> a<00:02:30.680> little<00:02:30.769> bit<00:02:30.950> more<00:02:31.160> so<00:02:32.090> this<00:02:32.239> is<00:02:32.330> the

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
play a little bit more so this is the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.059 
play a little bit more so this is the
normal<00:02:32.569> City<00:02:32.930> it<00:02:33.170> still<00:02:33.440> looks<00:02:33.470> great<00:02:33.920> as

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
normal City it still looks great as

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.890 
normal City it still looks great as
always<00:02:34.280> but<00:02:34.580> it<00:02:34.670> just<00:02:34.819> it's<00:02:35.060> always<00:02:35.420> nighttime
