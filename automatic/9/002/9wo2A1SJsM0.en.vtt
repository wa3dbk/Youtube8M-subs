00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:23.779
 not just a party not just warm hands and a beer and you name it 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:24.390
 on 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.890
 but really think in the overall complex of eating drinks in the directions 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.479
 decorate you 

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:34.999
 especially entertainment everything that is needed to say those guests 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.730
 that it should be avoided in this way that they will be happy to think back afterwards 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.460
 You can most enjoy the fact that people within this organization 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.430
 do things that I can't think of myself 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.340
 so there is a certain way to buy here for this 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.019
 the aluminum makes it think that well you know that 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:01.760
 we are very proud of their city 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.120
 that you can think of a company that can be a vehicle for people to 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.080
 to develop whatever vision went out the results of it 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.450
 the facts cannot just be a business 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.450
 both courses are very important to us 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.730
 we wanted to hit 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.690
 be a player who made you fresh and artisanal 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.670
 the sales adorn the kitchen 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.810
 that actually 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.070
 yes be qualitatively creative and innovatively read 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.880
 entrance happy with these products a number of markets could take advantage of that 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.659
 and then you have to think of 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.729
 With that goes the region you have to think about the care you can think about applying for 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.100
 it is a profession with applause and I would almost say 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.620
 we are so i am more often stating that you really like everything 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.930
 well this is one of them so it gives a lot of satisfaction 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.430
 and of course greater dogmas as the fact that you have to hunt and the film 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.060
 work and the fact that you and ultimately always work like another 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.950
 free senna that certainly does not apply according to chain companies 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.959
 he is still playing tennis 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.049
 if this can solve that problems that really do not exist 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:15.979
 the vvd state 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.629
 we are going to come with its own regional label 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.159
 the products make video 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:28.729

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:32.659
 the foundation may 4 healthy authenticity foundation got yellow 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:36.429
 but above all, of course 

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:37.929
 especially tasty 

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:40.240
 bleker said martijn the film is present 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.269
 he sets the young 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.769
 he is so i am just able 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.010
 to view his side just as much contact even has a better contract 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.999
 if we do that 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:54.549
 that makes them I would not
