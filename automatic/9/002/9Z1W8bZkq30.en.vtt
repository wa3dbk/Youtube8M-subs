00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.049
 trial session 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.989
 from the screen that picks up 

00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:12.959
 until then brief it'll be a little after this long test we hope everything 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:15.449
 just I just bought something a little trick and then a little 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:19.110
 multimedia platform I needed it because I wanted to store I'm 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.720
 the fair movies 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.259
 my music and my photos 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:26.640
 I wanted to go external hard drives 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.569
 what I have people 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:32.180
 sexy to store data not sure that one meter away from the goal he gave 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.670
 so we stay with him 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.870
 mountain machine 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.340
 she adds one more copy which is tidy in our turn what is still 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.160
 rougher 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.729
 especially a lot of plants that I do a lot of documents 

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:45.060
 a platform that can connect to the TV 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.170
 a computer screen 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.290
 the computer itself years 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.430
 I wanted something that all pass at the same time 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.569
 well what is it 

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:55.979
 it's the apple tv in apple tv for some that three weeks for 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:57.060
 others it is useful 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.630
 for me these encounters concerned the utility 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.580
 it is useful in the sense 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.520
 it's a multimedia platform or to store my videos 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.240
 pictures 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.240
 I took my music it will communicate with my computer but the screens 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.230
 so asked that everything be nickel so 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.300
 I find it perfect 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.870
 % -50% off completely mind-blowing advantage for campaigning 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.500
 eclectic 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.420
 the big signs clear cells because that's the truth 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.049
 the high school student before all the peace they did not miss and it was half price 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.700
 so I bought for cheap 75 euros 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.260
 so we're going to look at that aside do you keep from the direction the 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.200
 candidates for epic battles 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.200
 it was not done it looks pretty fashionable then 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.440
 a box or that it is perfect 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.470
 the very nice design very nice 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.690
 my ass cardboard years 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.320
 a real little jewel 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.580
 it looks like it's a jewel that's packed 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.540
 a lot then 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.290
 m with all that it's behind accepted the wifi or a little 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.780
 little 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.620
 remote control can rent motte 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.469
 we spent half an hour - that's because in this brief election 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.289
 we looked at age because that's what interests us it's a trick 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.219
 which is normal 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:12.930
 the inverted would be someone who is longer than expected good advise to 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.639
 values 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:14.659
 it's good 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.659
 cope so we take away the small screen 

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:21.259
 banking goals in this way 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.289
 bag it's not practical 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:27.289
 people 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.689
 here is apple tv a selection that does not regale 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:32.519
 so we need attention on Tuesday 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.569
 occupation sees well 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.519
 in short it's marked by design and barrels after California 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.719
 the eu is perfect 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:48.930
 then we do not comment sita footprints and cranials on the green bio 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:52.669
 as with rarely park on the side at indexing 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:57.229
 really like a command that will play it's really like damask 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:02.679
 you have your own interest 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:03.980
 with the wiimote 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.310
 who here and then the equities side the purpose of these external hard drive cautions 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.669
 no more no less 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:12.849
 those who feel a mini mac his oracles 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:14.659
 I wanted to buy MPs 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.359
 because his dear studies for contempt I could buy a mac or a 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:18.339
 mac line 

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:21.499
 the top-15 

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:23.639
 a dynamic platform 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.639
 what the city had fought price and that the fishermen 

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:28.959
 it always happens 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.059
 Kazakhmys 

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:34.899
 in short that being said that's why a beautiful a little he said 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.349
 all the connections there behind 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.289
 he was defeated 

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:46.729
 so those of aluminum 

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:49.859
 frankly it's nice these comedians on tuesday 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.929
 and in the Americas so from the moon it was a bit long 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:56.039
 it remains heavy 

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:58.159
 his four children is too good 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:59.169
 I find it super beautiful 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.119
 so there we have what 

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:04.279
 % receipt in 

00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:05.759
 for the world 

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:08.069
 lulu that I discuss a lot 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.249
 the infrared the host commune 

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:13.679
 the time of the fight by all behind 

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:16.370
 as a mains plug 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.299
 the usb socket and a large usb port 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.449

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:26.229
 stage dennis cooke and with my new screen pressing others i 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.409
 thought it was now Latvia 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:32.689
 according to this video to avoid it and still audio for unity a socket 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:33.710
 optical 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.710
 for those who are still short of cash so here we go 

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:40.400
 if a nice relaxation frankly I find it frankly pretty 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.930
 I too thought it was useless but in fact it's nice and that 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.229

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:47.310

 he figures the game 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.259

 now all languages 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:06.559
 a little tripled 

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:09.469

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:12.499
 little stickers 

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:16.429
 of course that if one day you buy something that has not retained it 

00:05:16.429 --> 00:05:18.029
 supports stickers 

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:20.190
 I took a taxi in their youth 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.089
 to be simple 

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:22.620

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:36.300
 if we continue our way of a faultless 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.999
 ear small power cable of course but that's it 

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:44.020
 That's what happens 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.020
 it did not pay coc coco 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.659
 never seen that 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:51.509
