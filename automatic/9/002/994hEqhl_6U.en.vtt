g<00:04:22.770> e<00:04:24.980> minor

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:36.100 

see<00:04:31.410> again<00:04:32.410> to<00:04:32.650> Z

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.950 

and<00:04:36.230> the<00:04:36.800> outro<00:04:37.370> is<00:04:37.640> the<00:04:38.030> same<00:04:38.240> as<00:04:38.420> the<00:04:38.510> intro

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
and the outro is the same as the intro

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:46.450 
and the outro is the same as the intro
so<00:04:39.530> it's<00:04:39.740> D<00:04:40.220> minor<00:04:42.790> G

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:53.839 

d<00:04:47.000> minor<00:04:49.750> t

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:53.849 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:57.679 

and<00:04:54.539> I<00:04:55.289> believe<00:04:55.349> she<00:04:56.129> may<00:04:56.399> end<00:04:56.639> on<00:04:56.969> the<00:04:57.149> C<00:04:57.389> chord

00:04:57.679 --> 00:04:57.689 
and I believe she may end on the C chord

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:00.739 
and I believe she may end on the C chord
here<00:04:58.229> I've<00:04:59.189> seen<00:04:59.669> some<00:04:59.909> versions<00:05:00.330> where<00:05:00.599> it

00:05:00.739 --> 00:05:00.749 
here I've seen some versions where it

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:03.709 
here I've seen some versions where it
actually<00:05:00.899> fades<00:05:01.379> out<00:05:01.589> on<00:05:01.800> that<00:05:02.039> so<00:05:02.610> that's<00:05:03.569> up

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:03.719 
actually fades out on that so that's up

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:05.389 
actually fades out on that so that's up
