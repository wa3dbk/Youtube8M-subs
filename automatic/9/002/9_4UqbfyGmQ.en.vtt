00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.759
 if i'm broken i'm roxy and in this video 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:23.829
 I will show you how to make a costume 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:26.680
 like a clown without spending a 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:30.210
 penny and for other videos with costumes 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.210
 do it yourself click here 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.620
 let's start with make up first 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.420
 I put a foundation a little lighter 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.449
 of my complexion always be 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.820
 possible as they are super pale and 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:47.129
 this in particular is also primer e 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.129
 face powder so I don't need anything else 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.269
 then I take this white pencil and the 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.720
 put on all the mobile eyelid like 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.720
 basis 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.650
 and then also under the arch 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.650
 eyebrow 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:34.040
 then i take my eyebrow set of the 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.040
 elf and I'm going to fill them up 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.840
 after which I take this eye shadow 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:58.540
 white and put it just above the base 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:02:00.370
 that I had put before then I take this 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.740
 gray and I put it in the fold 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.740
 of the eye with a gradient brush 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.640
 then I take the black and go to 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.640
 intensify the fold even more 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:41.099
 with a smaller brush I bring 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.099
 the black eye shadow below in this way 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.120
 and then I go to join with the part of 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.120
 above so 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.700
 all faded well 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.700
 then I take this bright turquoise and it 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.540
 put on the mobile eyelid from the goal 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.540
 outwards 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.569
 then I take this purple and put it on 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.569
 the gray 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:17.540
 then with this morning from black eyeliner 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.540
 I'm going to darken my eyebrows 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.350
 and then the help of a small brush 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.480
 angled 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.470
 I add these lines to complete the 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.470
 clown's eyes 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.420
 if you want even darker lines and 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.240
 that last even longer with it 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.870
 proceed over an eyeliner 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.870
 liquid 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:26.460
 for the lips I decided to use this 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:26.460
 red pencil in the center only 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:39.810
 and then os cleared the corners with a 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:43.199
 corrector finally I must admit 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:48.289
 abundantly a beautiful blush on 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:48.289
 like this and the trick is over 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.129
 as far as hair is concerned, they are 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.629
 messy the better 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:05.539
 so I simply decided to 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:05.539
 separate them into three pigtails like this 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:49.690
 final touch the red nose for lautsi 

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:53.379
 take things out of the closet 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:56.379
 colored that you have plain can a 

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:58.509
 striped ties and suspenders bow ties 

00:06:56.379 --> 00:07:03.069
 etc. and mix everything together 

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:05.440
 and here is my final result I hope 

00:07:03.069 --> 00:07:08.490
 that this video tutorial is useful to you 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.490
 happy halloween
