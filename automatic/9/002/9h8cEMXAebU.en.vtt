00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
before I plant my raspberry canes I'm

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.950 
before I plant my raspberry canes I'm
going<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.640> leave<00:00:50.850> them<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.270> bucket<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.750> water

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.639 
going to leave them in a bucket of water
to<00:00:52.680> soak<00:00:52.890> whilst<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.579> dig<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.940> trench<00:00:54.469> once<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
to soak whilst I dig the trench once the

to soak whilst I dig the trench once the
trench<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.070> dug<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.640> will<00:00:57.480> then<00:00:57.690> plant<00:00:58.170> my<00:00:58.379> canes

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
trench is dug I will then plant my canes

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.920 
trench is dug I will then plant my canes
so<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.910> they<00:01:00.030> are<00:01:00.149> really<00:01:00.329> quite<00:01:00.570> close

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930

next because many of the Canes may fail
and<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.729> better<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.119> plant<00:01:09.390> too<00:01:09.689> many<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.320> be

been thoroughly mixed in with the soil

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.209 
been thoroughly mixed in with the soil
and<00:01:53.119> I'm<00:01:53.390> going<00:01:53.569> to<00:01:53.630> just<00:01:53.840> make<00:01:54.560> sure<00:01:54.619> that

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
and I'm going to just make sure that

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:00.609 
and I'm going to just make sure that
it's<00:01:55.929> reasonably<00:01:56.929> well<00:01:57.369> tamp<00:01:58.369> down<00:01:59.319> so<00:02:00.319> that

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
it's reasonably well tamp down so that

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.260 
it's reasonably well tamp down so that
when<00:02:00.890> I<00:02:00.979> dig<00:02:01.189> a<00:02:01.219> trench<00:02:01.899> to<00:02:02.899> put<00:02:03.140> my<00:02:04.270> raspberry

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
when I dig a trench to put my raspberry

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.400 
when I dig a trench to put my raspberry
canes<00:02:05.479> into<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:07.520> ground<00:02:07.880> we'll<00:02:08.209> be<00:02:08.410> just

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
canes into the ground we'll be just

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.130 
canes into the ground we'll be just
right<00:02:09.649> now<00:02:09.920> raspberry<00:02:10.489> canes<00:02:10.729> are<00:02:11.660> very

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
right now raspberry canes are very

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.619 
right now raspberry canes are very
shallow<00:02:12.470> rooting<00:02:13.180> and<00:02:14.180> they<00:02:14.299> have<00:02:14.480> the

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
shallow rooting and they have the

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:17.170 
shallow rooting and they have the
terrible<00:02:14.959> habit<00:02:15.410> of<00:02:16.040> running<00:02:16.670> all<00:02:16.849> over<00:02:16.879> the

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
terrible habit of running all over the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.440 
terrible habit of running all over the
place<00:02:17.379> so<00:02:18.379> when<00:02:18.590> you<00:02:18.739> plant<00:02:19.099> them<00:02:19.310> you<00:02:19.549> need<00:02:20.390> to

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
place so when you plant them you need to

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.850 
place so when you plant them you need to
make<00:02:20.750> sure<00:02:21.049> that<00:02:22.010> they<00:02:22.220> are<00:02:22.810> planted<00:02:23.810> in<00:02:24.019> elite

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
make sure that they are planted in elite

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.180 
make sure that they are planted in elite
line<00:02:25.220> which<00:02:25.640> is<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.910> same<00:02:26.180> as<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:27.049> roots<00:02:27.290> the

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
line which is the same as the roots the

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.740 
line which is the same as the roots the
way<00:02:28.340> that<00:02:28.549> they<00:02:28.670> grew<00:02:28.910> before<00:02:29.269> they<00:02:29.390> would<00:02:29.540> dug

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
way that they grew before they would dug

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.830 
way that they grew before they would dug
up<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:31.340> I<00:02:31.489> will<00:02:31.670> dig<00:02:31.910> down<00:02:32.209> the<00:02:32.420> trench<00:02:32.780> about

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
up and I will dig down the trench about

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.910 
up and I will dig down the trench about

next year now just scrape out the bottom
of<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:40.360> trench<00:03:43.080> looks<00:03:44.080> like<00:03:44.260> there's<00:03:44.470> an

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
awful sore but by the time you've got

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.050 
awful sore but by the time you've got
the<00:03:48.940> plants<00:03:49.450> in<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:51.040> soil<00:03:51.250> back<00:03:51.580> and

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
the plants in the soil back and

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.720 
the plants in the soil back and
everything<00:03:52.450> will<00:03:53.140> trot<00:03:53.440> them<00:03:53.560> down<00:03:53.770> it's

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
everything will trot them down it's

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:02.160 
everything will trot them down it's
amazing<00:03:55.180> how<00:03:55.300> it<00:03:55.330> disappears<00:04:00.750> so<00:04:01.750> the

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
amazing how it disappears so the

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.310 
amazing how it disappears so the
raspberry<00:04:02.650> canes<00:04:02.890> have<00:04:03.340> been<00:04:03.580> cut<00:04:03.910> of<00:04:04.320> mother

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
raspberry canes have been cut of mother

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.900 
raspberry canes have been cut of mother
plants<00:04:05.860> and<00:04:06.070> as<00:04:06.490> you<00:04:06.640> can<00:04:06.820> see<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:09.190> root<00:04:09.520> run

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
plants and as you can see the root run

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.290 
plants and as you can see the root run
of<00:04:10.210> the<00:04:10.390> cane<00:04:10.660> is<00:04:11.500> like<00:04:11.830> this<00:04:12.100> so<00:04:12.700> when<00:04:12.880> I<00:04:12.910> plant

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
of the cane is like this so when I plant

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.170 
of the cane is like this so when I plant
them<00:04:13.570> I<00:04:13.750> need<00:04:14.440> to<00:04:14.560> plant<00:04:14.890> all<00:04:15.190> my<00:04:15.370> canes<00:04:15.700> in<00:04:16.060> a

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
them I need to plant all my canes in a

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.960 
them I need to plant all my canes in a
line<00:04:16.510> and<00:04:16.840> that<00:04:17.590> will<00:04:17.799> mean<00:04:18.010> that<00:04:18.310> when<00:04:18.790> they

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
line and that will mean that when they

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.690 
line and that will mean that when they
grow<00:04:19.390> up<00:04:19.420> next<00:04:20.350> year<00:04:20.590> hopefully<00:04:21.160> they<00:04:21.549> will

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
grow up next year hopefully they will

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.430 
grow up next year hopefully they will
stay<00:04:21.940> close<00:04:22.270> together<00:04:22.630> and<00:04:22.840> not<00:04:23.020> spread<00:04:23.410> out

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
stay close together and not spread out

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:48.120 
stay close together and not spread out
too<00:04:23.830> much<00:04:24.010> in<00:04:24.190> the<00:04:24.280> bed

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:56.470 

now<00:04:49.130> as<00:04:50.350> I<00:04:51.350> am<00:04:51.680> pleased<00:04:52.010> down<00:04:54.280> hopefully<00:04:55.480> most

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
now as I am pleased down hopefully most

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.210 
now as I am pleased down hopefully most
of<00:04:56.660> them<00:04:56.840> will<00:04:56.990> grow<00:04:57.140> well<00:04:57.500> but<00:04:57.980> I<00:04:58.010> have<00:04:58.190> a

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
of them will grow well but I have a

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.300 
of them will grow well but I have a
chance<00:04:58.550> as<00:04:58.790> they<00:04:59.540> grow<00:04:59.750> to<00:04:59.810> select<00:05:00.440> the

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
chance as they grow to select the

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.010 
chance as they grow to select the
strongest<00:05:01.820> and<00:05:02.090> best<00:05:02.300> growths<00:05:03.130> to<00:05:04.130> keep<00:05:04.840> and<00:05:05.840> I

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
strongest and best growths to keep and I

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.760 
strongest and best growths to keep and I
can<00:05:06.200> always<00:05:06.380> cut<00:05:06.830> out<00:05:07.040> any<00:05:07.370> link<00:05:08.770> feeble

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
can always cut out any link feeble

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.230 
can always cut out any link feeble
plants<00:05:11.680> to<00:05:12.680> give<00:05:12.830> my<00:05:13.010> bed<00:05:13.280> the<00:05:13.550> best<00:05:13.760> chance<00:05:14.060> of

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
plants to give my bed the best chance of

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.370 
plants to give my bed the best chance of
high<00:05:14.810> productivity
