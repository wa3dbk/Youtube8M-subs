00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.439 
coconut oil is almost identical to the
one<00:03:28.620> found<00:03:28.799> in<00:03:28.979> breast<00:03:29.250> milk<00:03:29.459> so<00:03:30.120> clearly

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:30.449 
one found in breast milk so clearly

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:31.969 
one found in breast milk so clearly
we're<00:03:30.780> supposed<00:03:31.079> to<00:03:31.139> be<00:03:31.259> eating<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.560> coconut

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:31.979 
we're supposed to be eating the coconut

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:33.800 
we're supposed to be eating the coconut
the<00:03:32.459> thing<00:03:32.669> that's<00:03:32.849> great<00:03:32.939> about<00:03:33.030> coconut<00:03:33.540> oil

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
the thing that's great about coconut oil

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.469 
the thing that's great about coconut oil
is<00:03:34.079> it's<00:03:34.290> comprised<00:03:35.189> of<00:03:35.370> medium<00:03:35.759> fatty<00:03:36.000> chain

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:36.479 
is it's comprised of medium fatty chain

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:38.390 
is it's comprised of medium fatty chain
acids<00:03:37.049> and<00:03:37.290> what<00:03:37.379> that<00:03:37.560> means<00:03:37.829> is<00:03:38.009> it's<00:03:38.189> really

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
acids and what that means is it's really

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.490 
acids and what that means is it's really
easy<00:03:38.579> for<00:03:38.729> our<00:03:38.939> livers<00:03:39.269> to<00:03:39.540> convert<00:03:40.019> into

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
easy for our livers to convert into

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.740 
easy for our livers to convert into
energy<00:03:40.530> in<00:03:41.519> fact<00:03:41.699> a<00:03:41.819> lot<00:03:42.000> of<00:03:42.030> people<00:03:42.150> find<00:03:42.629> when

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
energy in fact a lot of people find when

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.960 
energy in fact a lot of people find when
they<00:03:42.870> replace<00:03:43.199> all<00:03:43.409> their<00:03:43.829> fats<00:03:44.069> with<00:03:44.400> coconut

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
they replace all their fats with coconut

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.429 
they replace all their fats with coconut
oil<00:03:45.120> that<00:03:45.629> they<00:03:45.720> actually<00:03:45.870> lose<00:03:46.439> weight<00:03:47.120> great

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:48.439 
oil that they actually lose weight great

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:50.629 
oil that they actually lose weight great
the<00:03:49.439> coconut<00:03:49.799> oil<00:03:49.829> is<00:03:50.040> great<00:03:50.099> too<00:03:50.430> because

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
the coconut oil is great too because

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.099 
the coconut oil is great too because
it's<00:03:50.790> saturated<00:03:51.000> so<00:03:51.479> it's<00:03:51.599> good<00:03:51.750> in<00:03:51.870> cooked

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
it's saturated so it's good in cooked

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.199 
it's saturated so it's good in cooked
foods<00:03:52.439> it's<00:03:52.709> good<00:03:52.889> in<00:03:53.009> raw<00:03:53.220> foods<00:03:53.609> I<00:03:53.819> like<00:03:54.090> it

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
foods it's good in raw foods I like it

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.530 
foods it's good in raw foods I like it
in<00:03:54.329> smoothies<00:03:55.049> and<00:03:55.349> soups<00:03:55.739> and<00:03:56.040> even<00:03:56.370> tea<00:03:56.729> the

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
in smoothies and soups and even tea the

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.119 
in smoothies and soups and even tea the
one<00:03:57.750> thing<00:03:57.900> about<00:03:58.079> coconut<00:03:58.319> oil<00:03:58.500> though<00:03:58.799> is<00:03:58.979> it

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
one thing about coconut oil though is it

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.039 
one thing about coconut oil though is it
does<00:03:59.250> have<00:03:59.430> a<00:03:59.459> strong<00:03:59.669> coconut<00:04:00.209> flavor<00:04:00.540> so<00:04:00.959> you

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
does have a strong coconut flavor so you

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.509 
does have a strong coconut flavor so you
might<00:04:01.469> want<00:04:01.650> to<00:04:01.680> be<00:04:01.799> careful<00:04:02.040> with<00:04:02.250> savory

might want to be careful with savory

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.030 
might want to be careful with savory
foods<00:04:02.909> because<00:04:03.120> it<00:04:03.239> kind<00:04:03.419> of<00:04:03.449> competes<00:04:04.040> you

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
foods because it kind of competes you
