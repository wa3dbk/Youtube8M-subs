very very easily with your hands I was
playing<00:01:52.680> with<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.040> picking<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.549> off

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
playing with it and picking it off

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.620 
playing with it and picking it off
earlier<00:01:55.350> so<00:01:55.799> yeah<00:01:56.759> it's<00:01:56.939> not<00:01:57.060> coming<00:01:57.270> off<00:01:57.420> as

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
earlier so yeah it's not coming off as

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.219 
earlier so yeah it's not coming off as
easy<00:01:58.340> right<00:01:59.340> now<00:01:59.369> for<00:01:59.790> y'all<00:01:59.939> but<00:02:00.750> usually

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
easy right now for y'all but usually

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.350 
easy right now for y'all but usually
it's<00:02:01.409> just<00:02:01.710> once<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.189> take<00:02:02.369> them<00:02:02.549> off<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:03.119> gets

it's just once you take them off it gets

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.480 
it's just once you take them off it gets
it<00:02:03.570> gets<00:02:03.600> really<00:02:03.960> hard<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.770> it's<00:02:05.340> like<00:02:05.460> a

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
it gets really hard and it's like a

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.419 
it gets really hard and it's like a
thick<00:02:05.939> coating<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.810> can<00:02:06.990> just<00:02:07.280> pull<00:02:08.280> it

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
thick coating and you can just pull it

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.850 
thick coating and you can just pull it
pull<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.729> right<00:02:09.000> off<00:02:09.060> it's<00:02:09.750> not<00:02:09.929> like<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.500> lab

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
pull it right off it's not like the lab

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.220 
pull it right off it's not like the lab
glue<00:02:11.220> are<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.850> hair<00:02:12.060> glue<00:02:12.300> because<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:13.020> know<00:02:13.140> it

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
glue are the hair glue because I know it

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.660 
glue are the hair glue because I know it
takes<00:02:13.380> a<00:02:13.560> while<00:02:13.710> especially<00:02:14.160> when<00:02:14.580> you're

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
takes a while especially when you're

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.480 
takes a while especially when you're
using<00:02:14.820> human<00:02:15.240> hair<00:02:15.420> lashes<00:02:16.020> it's<00:02:16.980> even<00:02:17.190> more

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
using human hair lashes it's even more

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.980 
using human hair lashes it's even more
harder<00:02:17.910> than<00:02:18.090> using<00:02:18.270> synthetic<00:02:19.230> lashes<00:02:20.040> y'all

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
harder than using synthetic lashes y'all

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.560 
harder than using synthetic lashes y'all
