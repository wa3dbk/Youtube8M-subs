00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:32.290
 and they only took it because he pays 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.290
 much more than you for our loyalty 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.260

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.800
 you do not know the dangers of 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.170
 depths if you develop gando to your 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.010
 friends by continuing to challenge my 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.980

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.300
 rivalry between brothers 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.500
 He says about everything that you 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.130

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.130
 I am a pirate 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.189

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.260

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:42.849
 he already know but we do not know this well 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:45.430
 place and it's the only opportunity 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:48.510
 surprise flag work against him is 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.939
 a big risk but we still need it 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.669
 we have to try what terrible the 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:58.060
 dilemma that has I would not stay 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:04:00.900

 time you call as always good 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:12.040

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.910

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.710
 platform 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.020
 but first we'll end the henchmen 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.850
 of blank which would not be impossible if 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.100

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.720
 of all his pirates good at least 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.950
 we know that there is someone who is going to 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.950

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.810

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.080

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.039

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.039

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:51.300
 that I do not break it, they give it to me 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.300
 the day of my birthday 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:07:01.870
 I think you're right, that's how it was 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.870
 and now that it's coming 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:07.920

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.920
