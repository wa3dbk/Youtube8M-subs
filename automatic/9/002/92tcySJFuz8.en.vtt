00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
weather boot on it right now so the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.370

buttons on either side it is a little

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.880 
buttons on either side it is a little
tricky<00:01:48.360> but<00:01:48.810> once<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.350> get<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.530> hang<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.770> it

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
tricky but once you get the hang of it

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.350 
tricky but once you get the hang of it
it's<00:01:50.070> pretty<00:01:50.189> easy<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.790> take<00:01:50.909> on<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.299> off

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.660 
it's pretty easy to take on and off
although<00:01:52.140> we<00:01:52.409> don't<00:01:52.530> use<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.979> much<00:01:53.130> there's

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
although we don't use it much there's

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.639 
although we don't use it much there's
also<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:54.030> bar<00:01:54.450> that's<00:01:54.750> in<00:01:55.079> between<00:01:55.380> the

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
um keyfit 30 I'm not sure if it works

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.780 
um keyfit 30 I'm not sure if it works
with<00:05:21.730> the<00:05:21.820> key<00:05:22.060> fit<00:05:22.480> 22<00:05:23.260> just<00:05:23.950> because<00:05:24.340> it

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
with the key fit 22 just because it

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.090 
with the key fit 22 just because it
didn't<00:05:25.180> specify<00:05:25.480> but<00:05:26.080> I<00:05:26.140> would<00:05:26.410> assume<00:05:26.530> just

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
didn't specify but I would assume just

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.460 
didn't specify but I would assume just
because<00:05:27.160> I've<00:05:27.820> heard<00:05:28.360> that<00:05:28.510> the<00:05:28.630> key<00:05:28.870> fit<00:05:29.140> 30

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
because I've heard that the key fit 30

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.240 
because I've heard that the key fit 30
works<00:05:30.340> the<00:05:30.730> same<00:05:31.060> with<00:05:31.750> the<00:05:31.870> same<00:05:32.080> base<00:05:32.380> as<00:05:32.680> the

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
works the same with the same base as the

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.080 
works the same with the same base as the
key<00:05:33.460> fit<00:05:33.670> 22<00:05:34.210> and<00:05:35.370> this<00:05:36.370> is<00:05:36.610> just<00:05:36.820> how<00:05:37.030> you
