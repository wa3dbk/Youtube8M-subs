person<00:02:57.570> who<00:02:57.750> is<00:02:57.930> left-handed

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.370 

if<00:03:02.050> they're<00:03:02.380> right<00:03:02.680> handed<00:03:03.900> then<00:03:04.900> you<00:03:05.110> look

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
if they're right handed then you look

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.320 
if they're right handed then you look
towards<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.640> left<00:03:08.550> look<00:03:09.550> towards<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.060> left

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
towards the left look towards the left

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:16.320 
towards the left look towards the left
hand<00:03:10.630> is<00:03:11.280> what<00:03:12.280> they<00:03:12.430> were<00:03:12.490> born<00:03:12.850> with<00:03:14.640> so<00:03:15.640> the

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
hand is what they were born with so the

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.750 
hand is what they were born with so the
lines<00:03:16.570> are<00:03:16.870> very<00:03:19.830> minor<00:03:20.830> in<00:03:21.130> this<00:03:21.310> one<00:03:21.550> they

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
lines are very minor in this one they

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.990 
lines are very minor in this one they
have<00:03:21.940> more<00:03:22.390> lines<00:03:22.720> in<00:03:23.080> the<00:03:23.260> other<00:03:23.410> hand<00:03:23.770> so<00:03:24.670> the

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
have more lines in the other hand so the

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.720 
have more lines in the other hand so the
left<00:03:25.210> hand<00:03:25.360> now<00:03:25.980> because<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.130> person<00:03:27.370> is

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
left hand now because the person is

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.720

when they're from Earth when they've
grown<00:05:42.169> and<00:05:42.790> if<00:05:43.790> they're<00:05:44.060> left<00:05:44.300> handed<00:05:44.840> it's

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
grown and if they're left handed it's

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:52.030 
grown and if they're left handed it's
reverse<00:05:46.450> so<00:05:47.450> always<00:05:48.020> look<00:05:50.530> from<00:05:51.530> left<00:05:51.860> to

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:52.040 
reverse so always look from left to

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.650 
reverse so always look from left to
right

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
right

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.110

left-handed<00:05:56.780> right<00:05:57.740> to<00:05:58.040> left<00:05:59.050> so<00:06:00.050> you<00:06:00.110> read

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
left-handed right to left so you read

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.860 
left-handed right to left so you read
the<00:06:00.710> left<00:06:01.070> hand<00:06:01.370> if<00:06:01.610> they're<00:06:01.910> left<00:06:02.150> handed<00:06:02.690> and

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
the left hand if they're left handed and

the left hand if they're left handed and
right<00:06:03.290> and<00:06:03.890> if<00:06:04.310> they're<00:06:04.580> right<00:06:04.820> handed<00:06:06.850> I've

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:07.850 
right and if they're right handed I've

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:14.370 
right and if they're right handed I've
been<00:06:08.000> many<00:06:08.300> questions<00:06:08.930> asked<00:06:09.410> about<00:06:09.710> it<00:06:10.040> the

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.380 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.590 

repeated<00:06:15.380> it<00:06:15.560> before<00:06:16.100> about<00:06:16.850> left<00:06:17.210> and<00:06:17.420> right

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.600 
repeated it before about left and right

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.720 
repeated it before about left and right
and<00:06:18.470> I<00:06:18.650> could<00:06:18.950> because<00:06:19.190> they<00:06:19.370> give<00:06:19.580> you<00:06:19.700> a

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:19.730 
and I could because they give you a

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.040 
and I could because they give you a
better<00:06:20.030> idea<00:06:20.210> on<00:06:21.730> reading<00:06:22.730> of<00:06:22.880> the<00:06:23.030> hand<00:06:23.270> and

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 
better idea on reading of the hand and

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.580 
better idea on reading of the hand and
left<00:06:24.290> to<00:06:24.560> right<00:06:25.720> don't<00:06:26.720> forget<00:06:27.110> if<00:06:27.380> you're
