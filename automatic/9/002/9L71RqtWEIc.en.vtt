windscreen<00:00:15.360> wash<00:00:15.630> system<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.170> basically

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
windscreen wash system and basically

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.279 
windscreen wash system and basically
what<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.160> heat<00:00:17.310> Chuck<00:00:17.520> does<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:17.990> after<00:00:18.990> turn

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
what the heat Chuck does is after turn

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.900 
what the heat Chuck does is after turn
on<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.529> vehicle<00:00:19.859> within<00:00:20.039> 30<00:00:20.279> seconds<00:00:20.730> of

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
on the vehicle within 30 seconds of

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.490 
on the vehicle within 30 seconds of
turning<00:00:21.180> on<00:00:21.270> your<00:00:21.330> vehicle<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:22.050> shoots<00:00:22.350> out

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
turning on your vehicle it shoots out

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.009 
turning on your vehicle it shoots out
hot<00:00:22.680> water<00:00:22.890> 57<00:00:23.609> degrees<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:24.449> clears<00:00:24.720> up<00:00:24.869> all

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
hot water 57 degrees so clears up all

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.870 
hot water 57 degrees so clears up all
the<00:00:25.140> ice<00:00:25.260> frost<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.859> snow<00:00:25.949> so<00:00:26.490> basically<00:00:26.760> that

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
the ice frost and snow so basically that

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.429 
the ice frost and snow so basically that
means<00:00:26.939> array<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.480> drive<00:00:27.660> within<00:00:28.140> 30

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
means array of the drive within 30

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.169 
means array of the drive within 30
seconds<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:29.039> operating<00:00:29.580> your<00:00:29.640> vehicle<00:00:29.699> and

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
seconds of operating your vehicle and

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.120 
seconds of operating your vehicle and
that<00:00:30.570> scent<00:00:31.050> shoots<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.679> out<00:00:31.769> through<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
that scent shoots it out through the

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.190 
that scent shoots it out through the
existing<00:00:32.700> washer<00:00:33.180> system<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.780> existing

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
existing washer system to the existing

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.950 
existing washer system to the existing
washer<00:00:34.440> system<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:35.100> each<00:00:35.309> other<00:00:35.550> slowly

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
washer system is each other slowly

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.600 
washer system is each other slowly
heated<00:00:36.960> system<00:00:37.290> it's<00:00:37.590> not<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.800> pump<00:00:38.070> so

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
heated system it's not a pump so

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.250 
heated system it's not a pump so
everything<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.120> exact<00:00:39.390> same<00:00:39.570> process<00:00:39.809> so

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
everything is exact same process so

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.810 
everything is exact same process so
basically<00:00:40.530> what<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.829> do<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.430> coach<00:00:41.670> a

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
basically what you do is you coach a

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.580 
basically what you do is you coach a
washer<00:00:42.120> pipe<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.870> fill<00:00:43.079> down<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.350> your<00:00:43.469> heat

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
washer pipe you fill down to your heat

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.380 
washer pipe you fill down to your heat
shot<00:00:43.829> you're<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.370> your<00:00:44.460> outlet<00:00:44.760> yeah<00:00:45.210> I

want you to pull the trigger then you're

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.819 
want you to pull the trigger then you're

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
stark it shoots out the hot water at 57

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.990 
stark it shoots out the hot water at 57
degrees<00:00:51.260> coming<00:00:52.260> out<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.559> most<00:00:52.800> Paris<00:00:53.160> exactly

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
degrees coming out of most Paris exactly

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000 
degrees coming out of most Paris exactly
and<00:00:54.210> how<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.510> works<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.289> shoots<00:00:55.649> out<00:00:55.800> for

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
and how it works is it shoots out for

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.590 
and how it works is it shoots out for
three<00:00:56.219> seconds<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.940> three<00:00:57.120> seconds<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.570> a

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
three seconds and the three seconds is a

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.090 
three seconds and the three seconds is a
fail-safe<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.289> stop<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.590> from<00:00:58.649> cracking<00:00:58.890> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
fail-safe to stop it from cracking the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.439 
fail-safe to stop it from cracking the
windscreen<00:00:59.370> because<00:01:00.000> it's<00:01:00.120> not<00:01:00.210> too<00:01:00.329> hot

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
windscreen because it's not too hot

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.880 
windscreen because it's not too hot
water<00:01:00.660> cracks<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.140> windscreen<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.620> too

if you kept your hand on it where we'd

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.160 
if you kept your hand on it where we'd
save<00:01:05.640> 20<00:01:06.000> seconds<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.510> will<00:01:06.659> shoot<00:01:06.810> out<00:01:06.990> for

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
save 20 seconds it will shoot out for

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.690 
save 20 seconds it will shoot out for
three<00:01:07.320> seconds<00:01:07.680> but<00:01:08.010> then<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.220> cold<00:01:08.430> water

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
three seconds but then the cold water

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.280 
three seconds but then the cold water
will<00:01:08.880> stay<00:01:09.030> calm<00:01:09.270> intrude<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:09.990> could<00:01:10.140> take

will stay calm intrude so you could take

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.230 
will stay calm intrude so you could take
your<00:01:10.409> hand<00:01:10.470> off<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.770> let<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.580> system<00:01:11.760> reheat

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
your hand off it let the system reheat

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.730 
your hand off it let the system reheat
again<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.720> then<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.110> water<00:01:13.260> will<00:01:13.470> come<00:01:13.650> out

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.770 
again and then the water will come out
then<00:01:13.979> again<00:01:14.369> huh<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.790> lot<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.360> people<00:01:15.540> would<00:01:15.659> say

that<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.020> competitions<00:01:16.560> in<00:01:16.650> heated

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
that the competitions in heated

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:17.899 
that the competitions in heated
windscreen<00:01:17.040> but<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.580> fact<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.880> actually

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
windscreen but in fact it actually

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.280 
windscreen but in fact it actually
complements<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.720> heater<00:01:18.869> win<00:01:19.049> screen

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
complements the heater win screen

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.810 
complements the heater win screen
because<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.950> heated<00:01:20.220> windscreen<00:01:20.400> what<00:01:20.700> it

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
because the heated windscreen what it

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.640 
because the heated windscreen what it
does<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.210> it'll<00:01:21.630> be<00:01:21.720> faster<00:01:22.140> windscreen<00:01:22.470> very

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
does is it'll be faster windscreen very

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.200 
does is it'll be faster windscreen very
quickly<00:01:22.890> but<00:01:23.280> what<00:01:23.460> does<00:01:23.640> heat<00:01:23.790> shock<00:01:24.030> those

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
quickly but what does heat shock those

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.910 
quickly but what does heat shock those
an<00:01:24.420> order<00:01:24.750> system<00:01:25.020> in<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.200> world<00:01:25.320> does<00:01:25.590> is

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
an order system in the world does is

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.499 
an order system in the world does is
when<00:01:26.130> you're<00:01:26.220> driving<00:01:26.400> along<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.000> road<00:01:27.180> it's
