exaggerated but what you could see was

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.190 
exaggerated but what you could see was
the<00:05:27.410> legs<00:05:28.010> tank<00:05:28.460> in<00:05:28.850> so<00:05:29.330> when<00:05:29.570> I<00:05:29.600> when<00:05:30.170> I

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
the legs tank in so when I when I

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.170 
the legs tank in so when I when I

remember and I saw his legs come in like
this<00:05:32.330> when<00:05:32.510> they<00:05:32.630> were<00:05:32.690> turned<00:05:32.960> out<00:05:33.290> which

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:33.920 
this when they were turned out which

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.070 
this when they were turned out which
should<00:05:34.130> be<00:05:34.310> the<00:05:34.430> opposite<00:05:34.850> I<00:05:35.060> either<00:05:35.750> said

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
determined through him walking was that

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.870

had<00:05:44.810> a<00:05:44.840> navicular<00:05:45.320> drum<00:05:45.980> this<00:05:46.280> basically

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
had a navicular drum this basically

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.720 
had a navicular drum this basically
means<00:05:47.150> that<00:05:47.330> he<00:05:47.720> has<00:05:47.960> no<00:05:48.860> arches<00:05:49.430> he<00:05:49.640> has

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
really flat feet and through that you

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.940 
really flat feet and through that you
can<00:05:52.520> seal<00:05:52.910> typically<00:05:53.540> see<00:05:53.780> that<00:05:53.810> when<00:05:54.590> you<00:05:54.710> see

building<00:06:07.040> up<00:06:07.280> his<00:06:07.430> arches<00:06:07.910> which<00:06:08.360> will

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570 
building up his arches which will

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.480 
building up his arches which will
produce<00:06:08.750> more<00:06:09.170> torque<00:06:09.470> out<00:06:09.680> of<00:06:09.800> that<00:06:09.950> squat<00:06:10.250> as

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
produce more torque out of that squat as

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.790 
produce more torque out of that squat as
well<00:06:10.820> put<00:06:11.420> them<00:06:11.480> in<00:06:11.630> the<00:06:11.720> right<00:06:11.870> position<00:06:12.050> this

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800

was<00:06:13.010> a<00:06:13.040> little<00:06:13.310> bit<00:06:13.400> more<00:06:13.580> extensive<00:06:13.850> but<00:06:14.210> I

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
was a little bit more extensive but I
