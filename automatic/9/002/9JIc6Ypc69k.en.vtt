00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 good to all I'm trans and we 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.259
 We found on Channel 15 programming 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:12.469
 in Spanish and I'll show you how to create 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.469
 a fully automatic level portal 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.320
 the sun rises and time to work then 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.900
 well I will teach you how to do this 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.140
 cosilla here is worth as you see is a 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.180
 bit simple you should not have much 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.700
 difficulty and simple sight surely 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.640
 with which cope is this image so aerial 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.770
 surely you already know how to do it but good 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.200
 that is to teach the operation first 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.670
 and then we started to build it for 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.820
 turn it on as you see I have to give it 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.890
 click here and release you have seen a ball 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.809
 of charge and great that how to activate 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.650
 this circuit goes through here for the rest and 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.589
 it does quite 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.089
 off until torch when turning off the 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:59.360
 it turns crazy to ignite and dissolved a 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:03.269
 charge line how to turn off the circuit 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.830
 turn it off here you turn off the 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:06.960
 torch is turned on to take out the 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.450
 bucket of water as you see in this version 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.280
 the water is removed and then it is flooded 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.450
 flooded in this block only in these 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.840
 of up not so I have to 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.580
 down to have here below the water apa 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.710
 if we want to turn it on again what 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.930
 we will have to remove the water so 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.590
 we give another clip and we give it again 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.009
 turn on 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.880
 well all this I have taught in 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:32.259
 this video we chop the materials 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.950
 the materials that we will need to 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:38.859
 create the generator are 10 obsidian 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.770
 two dispensers a bucket of water load 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:45.969
 ignia two torches of rest three of 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:49.329
 rest two buttons a poster and without more 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:50.659
 doubt a block that is not the nose ton nor 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:53.270
 wood 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.450
 well once you know the materials 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.490
 we take ourselves in this case I 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.310
 stone than normal to use 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.390
 visual bricks and we proceed to 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.979
 make the port 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.770
 to eat two pieces of land because 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.060
 they're going to need to be worth it because it's a 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.410
 clear material in this case I do not have 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.090
 peak and one thing here 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.420
 with other blocks with a block of 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.420
 land 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.550
 one of the three effects I remove the block 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.840
 ground 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:32.129
 I put it here go upstairs 1 2 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.129
 to the world what earth 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.670
 so perfect will matter and I suppose 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.459
 that you know all is worth 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.560
 so it 's because I put the block to 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.390
 do in the year but the goalkeeper is coming 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.700
 something like that if you want to put here 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.380
 continue to put it but the most economic 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.599
 is to do so and well we proceed to 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.110
 next step now what would that 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.690
 to do is take the stone and do the 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.180
 way where are we going to have things 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.670
 not for example so that the load would go 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.160
 pass and they can have the portal you need 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.650
 have two goals like this weed like that 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.450
 perfect then that behind we have to 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.090
 put the base so that it is as you see the 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.660
 bucket of water what of the dispenser that yes 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:18.020
 we want then we remove it and two blocks 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.700
 so that the load passes there 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.730
 another block here because I think here 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.040
 there is a torch and here will pass the 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.650
 three of iu 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.930
 Well the next step will be and 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.780
 place the dispensers worth we're going to 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.269
 place a here and another that you want is that 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.390
 let's put water you have to go to 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:40.180
 put the load and there it is 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.010
 the next step to put the posters is 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.970
 say they put the poster here because what 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.670
 we do not want 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:49.900
 we do not want the water to come out here 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.310
 ok and we bother circuit and as you see 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.380
 around here you can also leave so in 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.270
 this case we are going to put a block here or 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.590
 a poster is worth in this case I put a 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.680
 block because because it comes out much more 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.680
 economic 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.390
 now we had to put the circuits 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.380
 very simple did not subtract the rest of the 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.810
 rest and button this pure kraft 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.290
 turn on the rest and what to do as 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.300
 so they know is as much as a 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.090
 previous portal isle pulse you are going to see 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.709
 what happens, it goes off and it is re-tended and 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.490
 release another load and so right now 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.169
 we have 20 now we have 19 18 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.880
 for this very reason I said that I do not want 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.840
 have wood because you can fuck 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.419
 enteric gender whole 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.760
 ok we put a button on this side and 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:36.630
 we put in torch here behind 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.180
 you have already seen that you have paid 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.580
 with water is we give it again 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.380
 to catch water so we already have our 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.330
 automatic portal but you must is a bit 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.330
 bland not as arranged well 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.620
 so to fix a little bit we are going to 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.729
 catch myself in my case going to see win 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.559
 a little bit with stairs 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:05:00.689
 I put a ladder here and I put it 

00:04:56.559 --> 00:05:03.449
 here this this covered him if a little 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:05.189
 so one thing you can decorate it like 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:06.779
 you want to even put 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:10.309
 posters instead of a line poster 

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:10.309
 we can catch and put 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.370
 understands 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.919
 turns off 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.990
 an example not saying that that engine 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:23.070
 turn on and this button then turns off me 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.070
 I have 7 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:28.450
 I was not wrong, backwards, it's worth imagining 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.730
 that you are upside down, thus saying in 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:33.370
 the Ghanaian I come and then I turn it off 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:35.680
 I want what advantages this has 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.020
 compared to normal, it is worth once 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.750
 spend a lot of cargo line and load line 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.729
 it's a thing that is not very cheap or very 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:46.419
 face worth 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:48.699
 is one of coal one of gunpowder and one of 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:51.550
 magma which is to say what you take the place 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:53.169
 is the character and catch more but good 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.729
 here what I have done has been to do the 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:57.189
 portal tutorial not how to do it 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:58.900
 this so well I suppose I already 

00:05:57.189 --> 00:06:01.360
 you know how to do if you have doubts you can 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.249
 put it in the comment and well it 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.469
 dismiss troche and see you in the 

00:06:03.249 --> 00:06:07.569
 next tutorial next machinima 

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:08.939
 next what comes to channel 15 of you 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:13.040
 who as always quality 

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:15.440
 entertainment and above all 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.700
 thank you very much for watching the video 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.270
 you are the ones that make this channel follow 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:22.270
 in front so I was inspired again 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.270
 goodbye
