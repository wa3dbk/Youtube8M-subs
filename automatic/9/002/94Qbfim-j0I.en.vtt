00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.380 
most of the stuff kind of looks a little
funky<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.559> me<00:00:53.690> pretty<00:00:54.690> much<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.530> only<00:00:56.390> maces

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
funky to me pretty much the only maces

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.819 
funky to me pretty much the only maces
that<00:00:57.510> are<00:00:57.629> pretty<00:00:57.780> cool<00:00:58.050> are<00:00:58.350> like<00:00:58.649> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
that are pretty cool are like the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.500 
that are pretty cool are like the
battlefury<00:00:59.340> that's<00:00:59.640> probably<00:00:59.910> my<00:01:00.030> favorite

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
battlefury that's probably my favorite

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.560 
battlefury that's probably my favorite
but<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.230> pretty<00:01:01.739> expensive<00:01:02.190> if<00:01:02.609> you

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
but that is pretty expensive if you

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.820 
but that is pretty expensive if you
don't<00:01:03.840> have<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.110> money<00:01:04.260> for<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.680> think

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
don't have the money for it I think

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.710 
don't have the money for it I think
though<00:01:04.949> there's<00:01:05.100> like<00:01:05.360> even<00:01:06.360> like<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
though there's like even like the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.719 
though there's like even like the
auspicious<00:01:07.229> ones<00:01:07.409> are<00:01:07.560> like<00:01:07.680> 35<00:01:08.130> bucks<00:01:08.369> so

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
auspicious ones are like 35 bucks so

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.789 
auspicious ones are like 35 bucks so
it's<00:01:09.090> pretty<00:01:09.540> crazy<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.990> prices<00:01:10.110> for<00:01:10.619> that

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
it's pretty crazy the prices for that

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.770 
it's pretty crazy the prices for that

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
that stuff it's a little sloppy with the

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.920 
that stuff it's a little sloppy with the
paint<00:02:49.590> you<00:02:50.070> know<00:02:50.160> I<00:02:50.190> don't<00:02:50.520> I<00:02:50.820> see<00:02:51.420> some<00:02:51.660> parts

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
paint you know I don't I see some parts

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.390 
paint you know I don't I see some parts
where<00:02:52.050> they<00:02:52.140> could<00:02:52.380> have<00:02:52.470> done<00:02:52.770> a<00:02:53.130> little

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
where they could have done a little

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.000 
where they could have done a little
better<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:53.850> know<00:02:53.970> I'm<00:02:54.750> being<00:02:55.320> a<00:02:55.410> little<00:02:55.740> picky

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
better I know I'm being a little picky

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.890 
better I know I'm being a little picky
here<00:02:56.160> but<00:02:56.370> just<00:02:56.580> kind<00:02:56.910> of<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.090> painting<00:02:57.750> down

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
here but just kind of the painting down

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.230 
here but just kind of the painting down
here<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:58.830> I<00:02:59.190> just<00:02:59.220> think<00:02:59.700> it<00:02:59.910> could<00:02:59.940> have<00:03:00.150> been

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
here and I just think it could have been

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.410 
here and I just think it could have been
a<00:03:00.300> little<00:03:00.810> bit<00:03:00.959> better<00:03:01.200> than<00:03:01.500> this

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
a little bit better than this

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.790 
a little bit better than this
but<00:03:03.420> either<00:03:03.630> way<00:03:03.780> in-game<00:03:04.320> you're<00:03:04.560> not<00:03:04.650> gonna

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
but either way in-game you're not gonna

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.949 
but either way in-game you're not gonna
notice<00:03:04.980> it<00:03:05.280> that<00:03:05.310> much<00:03:05.700> you<00:03:05.880> know<00:03:05.910> you<00:03:06.600> see<00:03:06.840> the

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
notice it that much you know you see the

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.530 
notice it that much you know you see the
item<00:03:07.230> from<00:03:07.350> a<00:03:07.410> certain<00:03:07.740> way<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:08.130> you<00:03:08.700> know

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
item from a certain way and you know

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.880 
item from a certain way and you know
it's<00:03:09.690> not<00:03:09.810> too<00:03:09.959> bad<00:03:10.140> it's<00:03:10.470> not<00:03:10.530> too<00:03:10.740> bad

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
it's not too bad it's not too bad

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.770 
it's not too bad it's not too bad
there's<00:03:11.190> some<00:03:11.430> texture<00:03:12.300> painting<00:03:12.540> that<00:03:12.660> could

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
there's some texture painting that could

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.960 
there's some texture painting that could
have<00:03:12.870> been<00:03:12.959> a<00:03:13.020> little<00:03:13.320> bit<00:03:13.590> nicer<00:03:13.950> but<00:03:14.220> overall

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
have been a little bit nicer but overall

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.699 
have been a little bit nicer but overall
the<00:03:15.240> items<00:03:15.480> are<00:03:15.630> done<00:03:15.780> well<00:03:16.020> and<00:03:16.200> I<00:03:16.320> really

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
the items are done well and I really

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.130 
the items are done well and I really
like<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:17.010> effect<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:17.370> gives<00:03:17.400> void<00:03:17.820> and<00:03:18.150> yeah

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
like the effect it gives void and yeah
