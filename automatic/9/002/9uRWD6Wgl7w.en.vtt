place<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:36.000> different<00:01:36.119> galaxy<00:01:36.420> you'll

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
place in a different galaxy you'll

a whole host of new worlds to Tromp

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.670 
a whole host of new worlds to Tromp
around<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.850> but<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.750> gameplay<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.200> basically

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
around in but the gameplay is basically

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.560 
around in but the gameplay is basically
the<00:01:43.920> same<00:01:44.130> ratchets<00:01:44.820> armed<00:01:45.090> with<00:01:45.210> his<00:01:45.299> wrench

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
the same ratchets armed with his wrench

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.870 
the same ratchets armed with his wrench
you<00:01:45.810> still<00:01:46.020> have<00:01:46.170> objectives<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.799> complete

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
you still have objectives to complete

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.219 
you still have objectives to complete
you<00:01:47.880> still<00:01:48.119> don't<00:01:48.270> have<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.479> do<00:01:48.600> backtracking

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
you still don't have to do backtracking

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.620 
you still don't have to do backtracking
and<00:01:49.759> basically<00:01:50.759> you'll<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:51.240> make<00:01:51.390> your<00:01:51.540> way

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
and basically you'll just make your way

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.240 
and basically you'll just make your way
through<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.960> levels<00:01:52.229> with<00:01:52.470> your<00:01:52.710> wrench<00:01:52.920> and

these objectives as you encounter them

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.490 
these objectives as you encounter them
the<00:01:57.450> main<00:01:57.600> difference<00:01:57.930> in<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.140> game<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.469> that

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
the main difference in the game is that

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.289 
the main difference in the game is that
a<00:01:58.649> whole<00:01:58.890> lot<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.070> upgrades<00:01:59.610> have<00:01:59.759> been<00:01:59.820> added

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
a whole lot of upgrades have been added

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.149 
a whole lot of upgrades have been added
to<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.540> game<00:02:00.719> so<00:02:01.409> each<00:02:01.649> one<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.860> these<00:02:01.979> new

gain experience and when you reach a
certain<00:02:06.810> threshold<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.469> experience<00:02:07.920> points

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
certain threshold of experience points

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.529 
certain threshold of experience points
it<00:02:08.250> will<00:02:08.340> upgrade<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.759> into<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:08.970> new<00:02:09.179> weapon

it will upgrade it into a new weapon
that's<00:02:09.690> more<00:02:09.840> powerful<00:02:10.229> all<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.400> new<00:02:11.520> weapons

that's more powerful all the new weapons
can<00:02:12.030> pretty<00:02:12.180> much<00:02:12.270> be<00:02:12.510> upgraded<00:02:12.959> in<00:02:13.050> this<00:02:13.170> way

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
can pretty much be upgraded in this way

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.140 
can pretty much be upgraded in this way
with<00:02:13.470> a<00:02:13.530> couple<00:02:13.740> of<00:02:13.890> exceptions<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:14.940> also

run into a few weapons from the first
game<00:02:16.800> that<00:02:17.040> can't<00:02:17.250> be<00:02:17.310> upgraded<00:02:17.760> at<00:02:17.880> all<00:02:18.030> in

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
game that can't be upgraded at all in

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.030 
game that can't be upgraded at all in
addition<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:19.050> that<00:02:19.170> ratchet<00:02:19.500> actually

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
addition to that ratchet actually

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.440 
addition to that ratchet actually
collects<00:02:20.340> experience<00:02:20.820> points<00:02:21.150> as<00:02:21.240> well

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
collects experience points as well

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.450 
collects experience points as well
though<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:22.380> isn't<00:02:22.590> really<00:02:22.680> ever<00:02:22.890> shown<00:02:23.190> on<00:02:23.370> the

screen other than a meter when this
meter<00:02:25.200> fills<00:02:25.500> up<00:02:25.710> basically<00:02:26.100> you'll<00:02:26.220> earn<00:02:26.400> one

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
meter fills up basically you'll earn one

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
kind of makes you more powerful as the

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.630 
kind of makes you more powerful as the
game<00:02:31.170> goes<00:02:31.380> on<00:02:31.590> so<00:02:31.950> your<00:02:32.160> weapons<00:02:32.520> are

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
game goes on so your weapons are

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.460 
game goes on so your weapons are
becoming<00:02:32.940> more<00:02:33.060> powerful<00:02:33.240> you<00:02:34.020> only<00:02:34.050> kind<00:02:34.380> of

damage<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.870> you<00:02:39.870> know<00:02:39.960> basically<00:02:40.260> the

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
damage and you know basically the

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.630 
damage and you know basically the
difficulty<00:02:40.860> of<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:40.980> game<00:02:41.010> ramps<00:02:41.520> up

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
difficulty of the game ramps up

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.820 
difficulty of the game ramps up
alongside<00:02:41.910> this<00:02:42.510> but<00:02:43.260> it<00:02:43.350> does<00:02:43.500> this<00:02:43.650> in<00:02:43.770> a

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
alongside this but it does this in a

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.100 
alongside this but it does this in a
pretty<00:02:44.040> clever<00:02:44.280> way<00:02:44.610> it's<00:02:45.150> not<00:02:45.330> just<00:02:45.360> that<00:02:45.780> the

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
pretty clever way it's not just that the

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.660 
pretty clever way it's not just that the
enemies<00:02:46.410> take<00:02:46.620> more<00:02:46.830> hits<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:47.190> kill<00:02:47.220> you

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
enemies take more hits to kill you

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.250 
enemies take more hits to kill you
actually<00:02:47.970> have<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.150> vary<00:02:48.360> up<00:02:48.510> your<00:02:48.660> tactics<00:02:49.170> a

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
actually have to vary up your tactics a

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.780 
actually have to vary up your tactics a
lot<00:02:49.440> as<00:02:49.620> you<00:02:49.650> proceed<00:02:49.920> because<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.520> enemies

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
lot as you proceed because the enemies

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.090 
lot as you proceed because the enemies
just<00:02:50.940> get<00:02:51.150> more<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.450> more<00:02:51.600> challenging<00:02:52.230> the

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
just get more and more challenging the

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.130 
just get more and more challenging the
crazy<00:02:53.670> crab<00:02:54.030> looking<00:02:54.480> creatures<00:02:54.870> that<00:02:55.050> will

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
crazy crab looking creatures that will

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.050 
crazy crab looking creatures that will
attack<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.800> know<00:02:55.890> they're<00:02:56.340> tougher<00:02:56.760> than

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
attack you you know they're tougher than

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.200 
attack you you know they're tougher than
the<00:02:57.210> early<00:02:57.510> monsters<00:02:58.130> both<00:02:59.130> in<00:02:59.460> hit<00:02:59.760> points

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
the early monsters both in hit points

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.060 
the early monsters both in hit points
and<00:03:00.450> in<00:03:00.810> their<00:03:00.960> tactics<00:03:01.470> so<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:01.680> really<00:03:01.950> have

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
and in their tactics so you really have

up-tempo music that you'll find in the
first<00:04:45.669> game<00:04:46.000> some<00:04:46.780> of<00:04:46.810> the<00:04:46.900> tracks<00:04:47.110> are<00:04:47.289> really

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
first game some of the tracks are really

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.050 
first game some of the tracks are really
reminiscent<00:04:48.129> of<00:04:48.159> those<00:04:48.280> of<00:04:48.520> those<00:04:48.639> songs<00:04:48.909> from

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
reminiscent of those of those songs from

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.159 
reminiscent of those of those songs from
the<00:04:49.150> first<00:04:49.360> game

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
the first game

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:52.200 
the first game
so<00:04:50.500> really<00:04:50.979> the<00:04:51.550> game<00:04:51.699> really<00:04:51.970> kind<00:04:52.150> of

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
so really the game really kind of

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.969 
so really the game really kind of
maintains<00:04:52.539> a<00:04:52.659> cohesive<00:04:53.199> atmosphere<00:04:53.710> with<00:04:53.949> the

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
maintains a cohesive atmosphere with the

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:56.550 
maintains a cohesive atmosphere with the
first<00:04:54.400> game<00:04:54.610> and<00:04:54.940> at<00:04:55.780> times<00:04:56.050> it<00:04:56.169> almost<00:04:56.289> feels

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
first game and at times it almost feels

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.920 
first game and at times it almost feels
like<00:04:56.680> more<00:04:56.979> of<00:04:57.009> a<00:04:57.129> mission<00:04:57.370> pack<00:04:57.759> with<00:04:58.509> some

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
like more of a mission pack with some

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.480 
like more of a mission pack with some
cool<00:04:59.139> upgrades<00:04:59.530> and<00:04:59.710> new<00:04:59.770> levels<00:05:00.250> than<00:05:00.460> a

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
cool upgrades and new levels than a

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.490 
cool upgrades and new levels than a
full-on<00:05:00.759> new<00:05:01.090> game<00:05:01.330> but<00:05:01.990> in<00:05:02.110> the<00:05:02.199> end<00:05:02.349> even

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
full-on new game but in the end even

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.899 
full-on new game but in the end even
though<00:05:02.680> the<00:05:02.800> game<00:05:02.949> doesn't<00:05:03.310> feel<00:05:03.460> quite<00:05:03.759> as

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:03.909 
though the game doesn't feel quite as

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:06.570 
though the game doesn't feel quite as
new<00:05:04.300> as<00:05:04.509> it<00:05:04.599> probably<00:05:04.810> could<00:05:05.199> have<00:05:05.460> you<00:05:06.460> know
