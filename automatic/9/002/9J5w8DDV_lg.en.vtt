 hello everyone today we will meet 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.330
 smartphone fly iykyu 45 14 its so 4 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.890
 This is a new model for its range. 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.050
 hits the average price patterns 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.000
 segment let's see what it can 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.320
 offer the user a smartphone 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 packed in a simple box and 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.740
 comes with charger documentation 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.869
 device for 1 ampere cable and 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.730
 headset design most fly 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.309
 ranges from very boring 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.160
 to the usual today we are lucky it is so 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.750
 4 will usually pull on the plastic case with 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.910
 face looks rectangular 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.620
 although the corners are rounded away from 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.420
 bottom edge of the case to the screen a bit 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.890
 less than usual therefore may first 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.510
 It seems that fly decided to release 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.460
 model with on- screen keys 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.739
 control unfortunately touch keys 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.329
 under the screen remained in place but 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.129
 the backlight is not visible at all 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.989
 physical power buttons and 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.430
 volume controls on the left side they 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.989
 remember barely noticeable protrudes 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.309
 it is convenient to use the body 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.860
 affects the usual location 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.509
 fingers know where to look for them on the bottom 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.700
 butt there is a single microphone all 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:08.170
 the connectors are on top of this familiar 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.780
 place for mini jack but to placement 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.159
 microusb and have to get used back 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.900
 lid with a gloss on it remain 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.880
 fingerprints but they rush into 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.990
 eyes are not as strong as on smartphones with 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.909
 glass wall 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.830
 plastic stylized metal is 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.810
 slightly refreshing total sulfur and no 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.240
 battery is removable it closes access 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.520
 to slot 1 micro sim and memory card 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.840
 body sizes generally usual except 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.240
 that is seventy-three millimeters wide 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.290
 it would be possible to do less on it 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.570
 pay attention during 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.310
 use but the screen frame hints 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.869
 that they are an expensive smartphone so far away 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.180
 up to the standard of elegance 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:43.360
 smartphone received and ps screen diagonal 5 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.430
 inches with a resolution of 1280 by 720 pixels 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.799
 the matrix covers the unknown defensive 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.780
 there is no air gap glass 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.549
 oleophobic coating hard to call it 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.689
 quality because it is weak 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.649
 opposes prints 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.990
 fingers 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.880
 but the finger slides well according to the results 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.520
 measurement of the display brightness varies from 7 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.710
 and 7 to 255 shackles on gator square 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.420
 contrast is 1 to 600 8 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.890
 calibration quality is average but 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.899
 quite acceptable for an inexpensive 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.729
 smartphone is worth noting good angles 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.440
 Review pleasant color reproduction at medium 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.730
 brightness values most noticeable 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.920
 the disadvantage is low

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.890
 enough butt 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.660
 otherwise the display is absolutely normal 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.160
 plus or minus the same screens stand in 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.750
 all smartphones under review 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.920
 price segment found in such 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.440
 devices something fundamentally 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.710
 featuring better and can not be 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.310
 for the worse quite 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.860
 smartphone running 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.960

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.950
 the phone 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.190
 hardware platform is painfully familiar

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.510
 fast enough by modern standards 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.730
 fly aikyu 45 14 hard to call 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.350
 lightning fast smartphone but in general he 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.510
 runs fast noticeably faster 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.410
 low cost models but slower devices 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.060
 middle class 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.459

 average volume of stock is not well 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.130
 maximum volume can be comfortable

 communicate in virtually any environment 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.910
 Similarly, we can characterize and you 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.860
 me speaker and his quality speak 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.480
 It does not have to sound inexpressive with 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.430
 medium loudness in a noisy street 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.860
 incoming call can be skipped

 enough for a day of work in relatively 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.940
 active mode when you use 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.930

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.800
 take a little more economical 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.170
 users who mostly 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:00.520
 call charge may be enough for 2 days 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:02.140
 work chamber 2 is set smartphone 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.959
 the main one has a resolution of 8 megapixels 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.180
 there is autofocus and single flash 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.130
 front camera modest only 2 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.870
 megapixel main camera makes 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.000
 photos of acceptable quality in 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.770
 globally and quite normal with 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.419
 considering the cost of the smartphone she 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.700
 focuses at medium speed in 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.290
 any lighting conditions but for shooting in 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.970
 dark or twilight 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.620
 the module is not adapted at all 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.810
 front camera will not please 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.400
 fans of selfie though she is noticeable 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.229
 better than modules with a resolution of 0 3 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.819
 megapixels which left the smartphone 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:35.429
 a year or two ago 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:37.919
 fly iyku 45 14 is a simple smartphone 

00:04:35.429 --> 00:04:39.509
 which justifies its value in it 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.249
 there is absolutely nothing fundamentally 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.899
 new or revolutionary 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:44.519
 actually the same smartphones already 

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:46.619

 most affordable models with 5 inch hd

00:04:58.049 --> 00:05:01.979
 disadvantages average cameras saving on 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.619
 speakers simple design 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:06.209
 exit in such situations 1 or try 

00:05:04.619 --> 00:05:08.069
 find something more attractive and 

00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:09.959
 among gray models with a warranty from
