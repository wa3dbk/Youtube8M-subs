00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.630
 monsters to see we are here in one today 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:07.849
 we are in the beanie marley channel 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.850
 to promote our channel channel 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:13.310
 massive killers and good first thing before 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.980
 nothing to thank them for these 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:18.230
 two pair of cracks because the truth is 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.510
 difficult to get you production in 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.400
 help you get to know youtube and the 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.830
 true then thanks to these others 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.930
 many thanks guys and good in 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.699
 our good channel now I'm going to 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.369
 comment what it is about and all this is 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.920
 similar to beanie mari but not 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.809
 so very brutal games already already what 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.850
 you will see now that I am going to comment 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.010
 and well I tell you what you are seeing 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.069
 in the background you have a double standard when 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.699
 totally alone in low fulfill nothing and 

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:48.920
 playing with the 901 acm that is a weapon 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.289
 pretty yellow I believe in modern 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.999
 warfare 3 because it is the game that most 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.949
 we go up to the channel and better we are given 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:57.139
 I think and good as was being discussed 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.420
 is playing totally alone and low 

00:00:57.139 --> 00:01:01.699
 confirmed therefore therefore has I 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.350
 I think a lot more merit than if 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.660
 outside for example in domain and in group 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.470
 and good was not bad a double 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.990
 move 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.520
 minutes and peak and good for it to be done 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.280
 a little more entertaining is cut a 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.990
 poquillo some pieces to make it more 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.810
 entertaining and good as always 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.210
 you know and well in this channel we are two 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.470
 and good times and what you can see in 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.450
 our channel the truth we 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.090
 We would appreciate very much that you will spend 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.180
 because the truth is not achieved very 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.040
 easy subscribers you already know that it is for 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.410
 say it so they are quite expensive that 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.340
 people go through your channel and good 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:39.260
 we go up heading back as 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.810
 double moex we have three or four 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.550
 rises good many more factors 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.640
 we have a series that is one for the 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.010
 letter that will attend we act with us 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.020
 because well well we know what you like 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.300
 you like videos more and all these 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.180
 things that you want that not because the videos 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.220
 they like me more I believe in these series and 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.840
 good apart from mobile luckily they 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.509
 we have apart from this series we have 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.210
 so different new ones that we upload 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:08.030
 double fashions and good all these things 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.399
 that you already know we also raise games 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.330
 well more bulky with quite the most 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.740
 low and all these things 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.320
 It is part of many factors too 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.620
 we went up carlos and ticos that we have climbed 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.320
 also some that with the sea and all 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.270
 these weapons then new in one passes and 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.220
 warriors but that already depends on 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.440
 you if you like more of the 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.970
 factorial are carlos crops and by 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.920
 those more fertile modern rhythms but 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.200
 we could also raise the other when 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.930
 christi that you do not get lost and 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.890
 good apart from all this of the 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.830
 games we also raise many trophies 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.350
 we arrived that you can leave a good time 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.480
 and well you laugh a lot 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.940
 pretty good that you think not so good 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.770
 they can cheer up to a day and then they are 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.290
 some very funny theorists for 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:58.590
 example controlling Spanish there are 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.900
 Many good to spend and so you see them 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.450
 and well the series is called trolling 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.400
 people and we're going to pick it up again and 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.620
 well apart from these series we have 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.660
 assemblies we already have three or four of 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.180
 I guess they already know what it is 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.280
 ninjas and good is pretty good or 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.070
 you think but I think you'll like it 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.170
 quite the games because I think that 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.190
 we are also going 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.599
 I think it's pretty good between 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.220
 mons and good sometimes is my last 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:28.370
 whites two although less frequently 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.080
 but that depends on you depends what 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.640
 that you tell us by the 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.489
 comments and all these things then 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.560

 these things that are pretty 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.680
 entertaining 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.350
 although you know how they are stored in 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.090

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.560
