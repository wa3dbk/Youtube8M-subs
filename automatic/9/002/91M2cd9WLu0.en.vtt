00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:10.759 
so I'm easing down the little gravel

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:15.490 
so I'm easing down the little gravel
road<00:00:11.290> fairly<00:00:12.290> slow<00:00:13.030> and<00:00:14.080> as<00:00:15.080> a<00:00:15.139> kind<00:00:15.349> of

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
road fairly slow and as a kind of

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.590 
road fairly slow and as a kind of
rounded<00:00:15.860> a<00:00:15.950> bend<00:00:15.980> in<00:00:16.400> the<00:00:16.490> road<00:00:16.640> I've<00:00:17.210> seen<00:00:17.570> a

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
rounded a bend in the road I've seen a

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.179 
rounded a bend in the road I've seen a
transformer<00:00:18.500> out<00:00:18.590> of<00:00:18.650> the<00:00:18.710> corner<00:00:18.980> of<00:00:19.010> my<00:00:19.070> eye

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
transformer out of the corner of my eye

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.340 
transformer out of the corner of my eye
and<00:00:19.220> so<00:00:20.150> I<00:00:20.210> just<00:00:20.420> kind<00:00:20.570> of<00:00:20.750> glanced<00:00:20.960> down<00:00:21.050> to

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
and so I just kind of glanced down to

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.339 
and so I just kind of glanced down to
see<00:00:21.529> if<00:00:21.619> my<00:00:21.800> primary<00:00:22.070> war<00:00:22.519> was<00:00:22.760> up<00:00:23.260> and<00:00:24.260> I

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:24.349 
see if my primary war was up and I

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:26.950 
see if my primary war was up and I
looked<00:00:24.529> back<00:00:24.590> around<00:00:24.920> and<00:00:25.310> the<00:00:26.300> road<00:00:26.480> had<00:00:26.689> kind

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
looked back around and the road had kind

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.330 
looked back around and the road had kind
of<00:00:27.140> looked<00:00:27.380> like<00:00:27.470> they<00:00:27.740> had<00:00:27.830> narrowed<00:00:28.220> a

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
of looked like they had narrowed a

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.300 
of looked like they had narrowed a
little<00:00:28.670> so<00:00:29.509> I<00:00:29.539> started<00:00:29.990> to<00:00:30.080> try<00:00:30.259> to<00:00:30.289> slow<00:00:31.130> down

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
little so I started to try to slow down

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.560 
little so I started to try to slow down
because<00:00:31.550> I'm<00:00:31.670> prayed<00:00:31.880> I'm<00:00:32.029> will<00:00:32.180> drop<00:00:32.390> my

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
because I'm prayed I'm will drop my

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.100

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
front wheel drops off and about

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.910 
front wheel drops off and about
immediately<00:00:38.780> when<00:00:38.960> it<00:00:39.080> stopped<00:00:39.350> I<00:00:39.530> felt<00:00:39.770> the

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:28.950 
as to how long my eyes were off the road
I<00:04:27.070> thought<00:04:27.520> was<00:04:27.789> just<00:04:27.910> like<00:04:28.120> a<00:04:28.150> split<00:04:28.510> second

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
I thought was just like a split second

each<00:04:29.080> time<00:04:29.350> it<00:04:29.680> was<00:04:29.740> over<00:04:30.580> two<00:04:30.729> seconds<00:04:31.270> you

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
each time it was over two seconds you

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.360 
each time it was over two seconds you
know<00:04:32.169> about<00:04:32.289> two<00:04:32.560> or<00:04:32.680> three<00:04:32.710> different<00:04:33.010> times

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
know about two or three different times

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.210 
know about two or three different times
and<00:04:34.060> then<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:35.139> wreck<00:04:35.350> happens<00:04:35.770> you<00:04:36.070> know

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
and then the wreck happens you know
