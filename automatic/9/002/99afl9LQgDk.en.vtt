I<00:01:28.729> bought<00:01:29.090> these<00:01:29.330> already<00:01:29.720> pre<00:01:30.380> thin<00:01:30.740> sliced

I bought these already pre thin sliced

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.670 
I bought these already pre thin sliced
just<00:01:32.180> because<00:01:32.479> I<00:01:32.570> think<00:01:32.630> it<00:01:32.840> helps<00:01:32.960> out<00:01:33.229> in<00:01:33.260> the

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
just because I think it helps out in the

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.440 
just because I think it helps out in the
old<00:01:33.950> thinning<00:01:34.369> process<00:01:34.610> however<00:01:35.090> a<00:01:35.270> lot<00:01:35.420> of

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
old thinning process however a lot of

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.850 
old thinning process however a lot of
them<00:01:35.600> aren't<00:01:35.780> really<00:01:36.020> thin<00:01:36.229> enough<00:01:36.470> this<00:01:36.680> one

them aren't really thin enough this one
certainly<00:01:37.159> is<00:01:37.220> into<00:01:37.580> a<00:01:37.610> flat<00:01:38.060> enough<00:01:38.710> to<00:01:39.710> stuff

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
certainly is into a flat enough to stuff

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.890 
certainly is into a flat enough to stuff
