00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:09.290
 Hello everyone is a white cat this time 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:11.900
 We will introduce a technique called a fan using cards 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:18.890
 There is also a commentary 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:22.550
 The way it is Oh-before that fans are like this technique If you spread the card in a fan shape 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.880
 It's such a technique but it's cool, isn't it? 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:29.660
 First of all I will explain it 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:33.890
 Well if it is right handed 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.310
 If you go to bed, hirohiro, please take your right hand out of the large experimenter 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:42.040
 And take 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:43.230
 This Japanese index finger and the middle finger are fine it is also here on 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.440
 In this way 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.000
 I put my thumb in this state 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.070
 The Those who left the month 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.900
 This state is Fukui little one 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.210
 so 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.190
 I thought this way 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:04.239
 Right thumb 3 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:08.320
 It is a thumb of the left hand, it is a feeling that the left-handed person puts out and follows the card 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.970
 I feel that we drew him this while turn while holding down the card 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:16.140
 Hmm 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:19.330
 This is a fan that can only really practice this already 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:24.350
 How about going with a few sheets ? 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:29.210
 When I was in the practice stage , 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:34.490
 It doesn't flatten in a fan shape- sometimes it ends in about half of this 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.509
 But whether anywhere in the cars so as not to not to do it in they've stopped curl which way using 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:41.550
 Think about 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:43.000
 Then I tried to make it brown by thinking about doing something like this here 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.670
 This is already 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 It is easy to do anyone, such as bicycle, etc. 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.460
 Eh plastic playing cards 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.460
 Such as painting HyakuHitoshi 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.690
 Playing cards 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.150
 Is not good at sliding 4 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.190
 Can not be like this 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.620
 So 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.840
 a 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.250
 Here is no matter how much you get on board 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.220
 I think maybe difficult 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:14.470
 So if you don't have one 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:17.350
 Weiss clear chari for bicycle is sold at quite various places 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.290
 Good sound and toys of Yamada Denki 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.790
 We also sell it for sale 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.590
 Well 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.090
 a 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.120
 Oh dear 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:33.400
 This Kiho 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:36.659
 This technique is so cool, so why not try mastering it by all means 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.659
 So everyone like Raa
