there are a lot of new features as new
technologies<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.390> my<00:00:34.230> technology<00:00:34.739> can

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
technologies this is my technology can

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.770 
technologies this is my technology can
advance<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.760> airplane

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
advance it airplane

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.170 
advance it airplane
of<00:00:36.840> course<00:00:37.230> it's<00:00:37.440> 50%<00:00:37.920> composite<00:00:38.700> material

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
of course it's 50% composite material

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.990 
of course it's 50% composite material
much<00:00:39.600> lighter<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.440> as<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.070> result<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.790> it

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
much lighter and as a result of that it

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.350 
much lighter and as a result of that it
is<00:00:42.030> more<00:00:42.809> fuel<00:00:43.350> efficient<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.879> consumes

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
is more fuel efficient it is it consumes

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.130 
is more fuel efficient it is it consumes
20%<00:00:46.350> less<00:00:46.860> fuel<00:00:47.160> than<00:00:47.430> its<00:00:47.879> category<00:00:48.480> plane

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
20% less fuel than its category plane

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.200 
20% less fuel than its category plane
today<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.460> business<00:00:50.910> case<00:00:51.180> for

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
today so is that the business case for

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.240 
today so is that the business case for
buying<00:00:51.780> this<00:00:52.050> for<00:00:52.320> purchasing<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:52.980> plane

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
buying this for purchasing this plane

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.700 
buying this for purchasing this plane
because<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.120> efficient<00:00:54.719> because<00:00:55.050> it's<00:00:55.260> it

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
because it is efficient because it's it

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.119 
because it is efficient because it's it
uses<00:00:56.460> less<00:00:56.670> fuel<00:00:56.699> etc<00:00:57.629> yes<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> business

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
uses less fuel etc yes it is a business

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.970 
uses less fuel etc yes it is a business
case<00:00:59.510> when<00:01:00.510> we<00:01:00.719> made<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.109> decision<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.800> two

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
at that time it will be cheaper to

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.999 
at that time it will be cheaper to
operate<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:15.240> will<00:01:15.390> be<00:01:15.540> more<00:01:15.720> efficient<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.470> it

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
operate it will be more efficient and it

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.330 
operate it will be more efficient and it
can<00:01:17.220> fly<00:01:17.460> longer<00:01:18.150> range<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:18.869> its<00:01:19.080> category<00:01:19.439> for

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
challenges you are right the first one I

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.280 
challenges you are right the first one I
would<00:03:18.709> say<00:03:18.860> is<00:03:19.280> infrastructure

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
would say is infrastructure

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.440 
would say is infrastructure
if<00:03:21.290> airport<00:03:21.950> infrastructure<00:03:22.579> or<00:03:22.970> efficient

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
if airport infrastructure or efficient

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.440 
if airport infrastructure or efficient
infrastructure<00:03:24.140> in<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.410> continent<00:03:25.239> it<00:03:26.239> is

infrastructure in the continent it is

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.600 
infrastructure in the continent it is
not<00:03:26.630> as<00:03:26.840> well<00:03:27.049> as<00:03:27.200> developed<00:03:27.920> as<00:03:28.040> in<00:03:28.310> the<00:03:28.430> rest

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
not as well as developed as in the rest

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.770 
not as well as developed as in the rest
of<00:03:28.730> the<00:03:28.880> world<00:03:29.120> so<00:03:31.030> much<00:03:32.030> work<00:03:32.299> is<00:03:32.510> needed

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
of the world so much work is needed

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.740 
of the world so much work is needed
there<00:03:33.170> and<00:03:33.880> we<00:03:34.880> are<00:03:34.910> working<00:03:35.120> with<00:03:35.360> African

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
there and we are working with African

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.620 
there and we are working with African
governments<00:03:36.410> to<00:03:36.920> improve<00:03:37.250> on<00:03:37.430> that<00:03:37.640> whether

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
governments to improve on that whether

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.479 
governments to improve on that whether
it's<00:03:38.900> airport<00:03:39.440> infrastructure<00:03:40.070> or

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
it's airport infrastructure or

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.539 
it's airport infrastructure or
navigational<00:03:41.620> services<00:03:42.650> air<00:03:43.220> traffic

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
navigational services air traffic

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.870 
navigational services air traffic
controlling<00:03:44.150> and<00:03:44.630> so<00:03:45.140> on<00:03:45.290> the<00:03:46.070> second<00:03:46.459> one<00:03:46.610> as

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
controlling and so on the second one as

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.039 
controlling and so on the second one as
you<00:03:47.150> said<00:03:47.360> is<00:03:48.250> brain<00:03:49.250> drain<00:03:49.400> from<00:03:50.269> Africa<00:03:50.840> to

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
you said is brain drain from Africa to

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.250 
you said is brain drain from Africa to
developed<00:03:51.920> world<00:03:52.220> and<00:03:52.810> particularly<00:03:53.810> the

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
developed world and particularly the

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.620 
developed world and particularly the
Gulf<00:03:55.420> so<00:03:56.420> this<00:03:57.019> has<00:03:57.200> been<00:03:57.440> a<00:03:57.709> problem<00:03:58.160> for<00:03:58.630> most

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
Gulf so this has been a problem for most

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.509 
Gulf so this has been a problem for most
of<00:03:59.810> the<00:03:59.959> car<00:04:00.109> carriers<00:04:00.500> I<00:04:00.739> think<00:04:01.040> for<00:04:01.250> all<00:04:01.370> of

of the car carriers I think for all of

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.789 
of the car carriers I think for all of
us<00:04:01.640> in<00:04:01.850> Africa<00:04:02.000> your<00:04:02.660> company<00:04:03.079> is<00:04:03.320> owned<00:04:03.680> by

us in Africa your company is owned by
the<00:04:03.890> government<00:04:04.459> yes<00:04:04.820> it's<00:04:05.000> hundred<00:04:05.329> percent

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
the government yes it's hundred percent

country so privatization is not a
burning<00:04:35.000> issue<00:04:35.150> right<00:04:35.449> now<00:04:35.690> so<00:04:35.990> it's<00:04:36.680> not<00:04:36.770> our

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.280 
making money yeah you apparently are one
of<00:04:45.620> the<00:04:45.770> few<00:04:46.130> profitable<00:04:46.700> airlines<00:04:47.510> in<00:04:47.930> Africa

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
of the few profitable airlines in Africa

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.920 
of the few profitable airlines in Africa
and<00:04:48.440> even<00:04:48.560> in<00:04:48.800> the<00:04:48.919> world<00:04:49.130> so<00:04:50.090> what's<00:04:50.570> your

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
and even in the world so what's your

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.840 
and even in the world so what's your
secret<00:04:51.940> many<00:04:52.940> many<00:04:53.450> factors<00:04:54.169> but<00:04:54.410> I<00:04:55.130> think<00:04:55.729> the

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
secret many many factors but I think the

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.510 
secret many many factors but I think the
biggest<00:04:56.540> one<00:04:56.870> would<00:04:57.260> be<00:04:57.520> corporate

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
biggest one would be corporate

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.659 
biggest one would be corporate
governance<00:04:59.110> meaning<00:05:00.110> it's<00:05:00.830> government-owned

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
governance meaning it's government-owned

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:04.960 
governance meaning it's government-owned
but<00:05:02.600> totally<00:05:03.560> managed<00:05:04.039> and<00:05:04.340> operated<00:05:04.400> as<00:05:04.940> a

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
but totally managed and operated as a

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.600 
but totally managed and operated as a
private<00:05:05.419> business<00:05:05.650> so<00:05:06.650> the<00:05:06.830> government<00:05:07.370> has<00:05:07.430> a

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
private business so the government has a

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:13.719 
private business so the government has a
board<00:05:09.310> to<00:05:10.310> oversee<00:05:10.910> and<00:05:11.770> give<00:05:12.770> strategic

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
board to oversee and give strategic

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:16.180 
board to oversee and give strategic
directions<00:05:14.080> but<00:05:15.080> not<00:05:15.350> interfering<00:05:16.070> the

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
directions but not interfering the

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.719 
directions but not interfering the
day-to-day<00:05:17.139> operation<00:05:18.139> of<00:05:18.229> the<00:05:18.410> airline<00:05:18.729> we

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:19.729 
day-to-day operation of the airline we

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:23.170 
day-to-day operation of the airline we

manage the executive manage it fully on

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.960 
manage the executive manage it fully on
our<00:05:23.419> own<00:05:23.690> so<00:05:24.440> this<00:05:24.620> is<00:05:24.800> a<00:05:24.830> big<00:05:25.130> plus<00:05:25.370> a<00:05:25.700> big

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
our own so this is a big plus a big

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.560 
our own so this is a big plus a big
success<00:05:28.970> factor<00:05:29.389> reason<00:05:30.200> for<00:05:30.380> our<00:05:30.410> success
