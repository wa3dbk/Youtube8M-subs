00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.270 
that I've used I've used the I've used
like<00:06:45.120> the<00:06:45.300> Nivea<00:06:45.630> tinted<00:06:46.229> moisturizer<00:06:46.919> and

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 
like the Nivea tinted moisturizer and

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.339 
like the Nivea tinted moisturizer and
I've<00:06:47.400> used<00:06:47.759> the<00:06:49.699> Gagne<00:06:50.720> BB<00:06:51.720> cream<00:06:51.990> and<00:06:52.259> I

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:52.349 
I've used the Gagne BB cream and I

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:53.900 
I've used the Gagne BB cream and I
really<00:06:52.680> like<00:06:52.889> this<00:06:53.099> one<00:06:53.310> because<00:06:53.490> it<00:06:53.669> actually

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:53.910 
really like this one because it actually

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:57.110 
really like this one because it actually
comes<00:06:54.300> and<00:06:54.690> this<00:06:55.199> light<00:06:55.470> color<00:06:55.770> for<00:06:56.699> my<00:06:56.819> skin

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 
comes and this light color for my skin

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.689 
comes and this light color for my skin
and<00:06:57.360> I<00:06:57.660> think<00:06:58.650> it<00:06:58.710> goes<00:06:58.889> on<00:06:59.099> nicer<00:06:59.550> and

00:06:59.689 --> 00:06:59.699 
and I think it goes on nicer and

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:01.850 
and I think it goes on nicer and
smoother<00:07:00.180> than<00:07:00.449> those<00:07:01.110> two<00:07:01.500> that<00:07:01.710> I've<00:07:01.830> used

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:01.860 
smoother than those two that I've used

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.719 
smoother than those two that I've used
