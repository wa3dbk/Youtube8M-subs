very different in size the ue mini boom
is<00:01:59.150> a<00:01:59.360> lot<00:01:59.600> smaller<00:01:59.930> obviously<00:02:00.560> than<00:02:00.710> the<00:02:00.800> i

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
is a lot smaller obviously than the i

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.560 
is a lot smaller obviously than the i
loud<00:02:01.160> they<00:02:01.520> obviously<00:02:01.670> both<00:02:01.970> have<00:02:02.000> speaker

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
loud they obviously both have speaker

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.060 
loud they obviously both have speaker
grills<00:02:02.900> but<00:02:03.260> on<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:03.440> front<00:02:03.710> of<00:02:03.830> the<00:02:03.920> ayah

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
grills but on the front of the ayah

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.609 
grills but on the front of the ayah
there<00:02:04.400> is<00:02:04.490> a<00:02:04.640> controlled<00:02:05.060> dial<00:02:05.360> for<00:02:05.990> adjusting

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
there is a controlled dial for adjusting

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.770 
there is a controlled dial for adjusting
the<00:02:06.710> volume<00:02:06.920> went<00:02:07.520> on<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.760> ue<00:02:07.940> mini<00:02:08.209> boom<00:02:08.510> the

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
the volume went on the ue mini boom the

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.240 
the volume went on the ue mini boom the
buttons<00:02:09.110> and<00:02:09.260> controls<00:02:09.380> are<00:02:09.649> at<00:02:09.709> the<00:02:09.830> top<00:02:10.010> look

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
buttons and controls are at the top look

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.890 
buttons and controls are at the top look
it<00:02:10.340> on<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.490> back<00:02:10.610> both<00:02:10.820> them<00:02:11.030> have<00:02:11.209> bass<00:02:11.480> ports

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
it on the back both them have bass ports

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.350 
it on the back both them have bass ports
though<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:12.560> I<00:02:12.590> loud<00:02:13.070> has<00:02:13.459> other<00:02:13.760> inputs<00:02:14.270> like

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
though the I loud has other inputs like

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.590 
though the I loud has other inputs like
a<00:02:14.600> guitar<00:02:14.750> input<00:02:15.140> unlike<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:15.950> mini<00:02:16.130> boom<00:02:16.600> also

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
a guitar input unlike the mini boom also

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.870 
a guitar input unlike the mini boom also
has<00:02:17.750> bluetooth<00:02:18.100> so<00:02:19.100> let's<00:02:19.250> test<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.610> range

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
has bluetooth so let's test the range

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:32.420 
has bluetooth so let's test the range
now<00:02:20.150> of<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.510> I

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:41.360 

okay<00:02:38.540> as<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.959> kind<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.349> see<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.709> range<00:02:41.040> of<00:02:41.250> the

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
okay as you kind of see the range of the

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.220 
okay as you kind of see the range of the
I<00:02:41.400> loud<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.209> mini<00:02:42.390> boom<00:02:42.599> are<00:02:42.900> actually

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
I loud and the mini boom are actually

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.170 
I loud and the mini boom are actually
kind<00:02:43.439> of<00:02:43.469> similar<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:44.189> eyelid<00:02:44.549> probably<00:02:45.000> gets

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
kind of similar the eyelid probably gets

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.880 
kind of similar the eyelid probably gets
around<00:02:45.450> 10<00:02:45.810> feet<00:02:46.049> more<00:02:46.260> than<00:02:46.319> a<00:02:46.500> mini<00:02:46.680> boom

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
around 10 feet more than a mini boom

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.860 
around 10 feet more than a mini boom
that's<00:02:47.310> no<00:02:47.519> big<00:02:47.700> deal<00:02:47.909> also<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.510> might<00:02:48.599> notice

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
that's no big deal also you might notice

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.140 
that's no big deal also you might notice
these<00:02:49.139> sound<00:02:49.560> is<00:02:49.739> very<00:02:49.859> different<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.760> I<00:02:50.790> log

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
these sound is very different the I log

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.420 
these sound is very different the I log
gets<00:02:51.359> a<00:02:51.450> lot<00:02:51.900> louder<00:02:52.170> than<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:52.739> mini<00:02:52.950> boom<00:02:53.159> the

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
gets a lot louder than the mini boom the

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.039 
gets a lot louder than the mini boom the
sound<00:02:53.670> quality<00:02:53.790> of<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.299> aisle<00:02:54.450> out<00:02:54.599> is<00:02:54.750> better

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
sound quality of the aisle out is better

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.629 
sound quality of the aisle out is better
than<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.319> mini<00:02:55.500> boom<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:56.099> base<00:02:56.400> is

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:56.639 
than the mini boom the base is

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.670 
than the mini boom the base is
definitely<00:02:57.209> more<00:02:57.359> present<00:02:57.870> also<00:02:58.109> it<00:02:58.530> just

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
definitely more present also it just

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.500 
definitely more present also it just
seems<00:02:58.889> more<00:02:59.069> accurate<00:02:59.609> just<00:03:00.120> from<00:03:00.239> probably

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
seems more accurate just from probably

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.089 
seems more accurate just from probably
both<00:03:00.689> test<00:03:00.989> out<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.349> bottom<00:03:01.680> grips<00:03:01.889> on<00:03:02.010> the

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
both test out the bottom grips on the

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.039 
both test out the bottom grips on the
speaker's<00:03:02.459> because<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.540> mini<00:03:03.719> boom<00:03:03.870> is

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
speaker's because the mini boom is

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.929 
speaker's because the mini boom is
lighter<00:03:04.379> and<00:03:04.620> smaller<00:03:04.889> it<00:03:05.340> actually<00:03:05.609> held<00:03:05.790> on

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:05.939 
lighter and smaller it actually held on

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:07.879 
lighter and smaller it actually held on
a<00:03:05.970> lot<00:03:06.090> better<00:03:06.269> unlike<00:03:07.139> the<00:03:07.260> eyelid<00:03:07.650> which

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:07.889 
a lot better unlike the eyelid which

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.610 
a lot better unlike the eyelid which
actually<00:03:08.189> fell<00:03:08.579> off<00:03:09.019> anyway<00:03:10.019> all<00:03:10.169> fun<00:03:10.409> stuff

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
actually fell off anyway all fun stuff

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.409 
actually fell off anyway all fun stuff
aside<00:03:10.889> which<00:03:11.400> do<00:03:11.609> you<00:03:11.639> get<00:03:11.909> do<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.180> get<00:03:12.299> the
