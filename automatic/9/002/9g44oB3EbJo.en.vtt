00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.030 
economic production goes each holding
basically<00:00:03.179> half<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:03.600> map<00:00:03.840> and<00:00:04.620> really<00:00:04.920> though

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
basically half the map and really though

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.559 
basically half the map and really though
the<00:00:05.220> difference<00:00:05.520> here<00:00:05.580> I<00:00:05.759> would<00:00:06.270> say<00:00:06.390> they're

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
the difference here I would say they're

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.690 
the difference here I would say they're
dead<00:00:06.750> even<00:00:07.049> except<00:00:07.470> for<00:00:07.500> wow<00:00:07.799> that<00:00:08.189> massive

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700

dropship<00:00:09.269> force<00:00:09.570> for<00:00:10.110> mania<00:00:10.320> so<00:00:10.559> i'm<00:00:10.650> going<00:00:10.740> to

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
dropship force for mania so i'm going to

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.959 
dropship force for mania so i'm going to
put<00:00:10.920> mania<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.250> little<00:00:11.460> bit<00:00:11.550> ahead<00:00:11.639> here<00:00:11.910> is

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
put mania a little bit ahead here is

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.600 
put mania a little bit ahead here is
going<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.179> drop<00:00:12.360> all<00:00:12.599> over<00:00:12.990> that<00:00:13.110> force<00:00:13.519> just<00:00:14.519> a

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
going to drop all over that force just a

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.960 
going to drop all over that force just a
huge<00:00:15.179> huge<00:00:15.990> force<00:00:16.529> there<00:00:16.800> managing<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.789> take

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
huge huge force there managing to take

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.040 
huge huge force there managing to take
that<00:00:18.090> out<00:00:18.150> so<00:00:18.390> he's<00:00:18.539> going<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.720> be<00:00:18.810> able<00:00:18.900> to

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
that out so he's going to be able to

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.630 
that out so he's going to be able to
gain<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.619> economic<00:00:20.100> advantage<00:00:20.400> here<00:00:20.520> by

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
gain the economic advantage here by

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.250 
gain the economic advantage here by
taking<00:00:21.000> us<00:00:21.150> this<00:00:21.570> northern<00:00:21.930> base<00:00:22.050> unless

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
taking us this northern base unless

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.279 
taking us this northern base unless
unless<00:00:23.150> yeah<00:00:24.150> this<00:00:24.570> force<00:00:24.779> comes<00:00:24.990> up<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.199> is

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
unless yeah this force comes up and is

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.830 
unless yeah this force comes up and is
able<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.619> repel<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.240> but<00:00:27.240> really<00:00:27.390> if<00:00:27.599> he<00:00:27.689> can

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
able to repel it but really if he can

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.359 
able to repel it but really if he can
manage<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.109> even<00:00:28.380> take<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.560> gas<00:00:28.920> out<00:00:29.160> that's

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
manage to even take that gas out that's

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.040 
manage to even take that gas out that's
going<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.550> put<00:00:29.760> him<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.539> little<00:00:30.840> bit<00:00:30.929> ahead

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
going to put him a little bit ahead

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.420 
going to put him a little bit ahead
that's<00:00:31.380> what<00:00:31.500> he<00:00:31.560> needs<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.890> focus<00:00:32.009> on<00:00:32.279> he

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
that's what he needs to focus on he

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.590 
that's what he needs to focus on he
doesn't<00:00:32.669> need<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.820> worry<00:00:32.940> about<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.300> minerals

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
doesn't need to worry about the minerals

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.790 
doesn't need to worry about the minerals
and<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.809> just<00:00:33.960> needs<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.200> focus<00:00:34.320> on<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.680> gas

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
and it just needs to focus on that gas

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.200 
and it just needs to focus on that gas
he's<00:00:35.070> trying<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.309> take<00:00:35.399> out<00:00:35.550> some<00:00:35.700> sem<00:00:35.969> easier

some turrets going down in the

some turrets going down in the
background<00:00:38.309> there<00:00:38.460> interestingly<00:00:39.360> enough

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
background there interestingly enough

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.209 
background there interestingly enough
i'm<00:00:39.989> not<00:00:40.050> sure<00:00:40.320> what<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.590> isn't<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.040> Wraith

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
i'm not sure what that isn't that Wraith

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.430 
i'm not sure what that isn't that Wraith
is<00:00:41.250> going<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.579> push<00:00:41.760> up<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.390> attack<00:00:43.320> on

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
is going to push up and attack on

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.500 
is going to push up and attack on
another<00:00:43.800> huge<00:00:44.250> grouping<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.059> drop<00:00:45.270> ships

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
another huge grouping of drop ships

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.910 
another huge grouping of drop ships
coming<00:00:45.690> down<00:00:45.870> I'm<00:00:45.960> going<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.140> drop<00:00:46.320> all<00:00:46.590> over

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
coming down I'm going to drop all over

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.639 
coming down I'm going to drop all over
that<00:00:47.010> force<00:00:47.340> there<00:00:47.840> and<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:49.410> Wraith<00:00:49.620> is

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
that force there and that Wraith is

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:50.810 
that force there and that Wraith is
probably<00:00:50.160> going<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.399> end<00:00:50.430> up<00:00:50.550> getting

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
probably going to end up getting

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.000 
probably going to end up getting
absolutely<00:00:51.270> half<00:00:51.660> work<00:00:51.960> there<00:00:52.320> but<00:00:52.800> there's

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
absolutely half work there but there's

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.770 
absolutely half work there but there's
Goliath<00:00:53.340> mania<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:53.789> firm<00:00:54.090> control<00:00:54.149> I'm<00:00:54.539> doing

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
Goliath mania in firm control I'm doing

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.270 
Goliath mania in firm control I'm doing
what<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:54.930> said<00:00:55.199> basically<00:00:55.620> what<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.010> was<00:00:56.160> hoping

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
what I said basically what I was hoping

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.350 
what I said basically what I was hoping
you<00:00:56.550> would<00:00:56.640> do<00:00:56.730> at<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.850> beginning<00:00:56.969> and

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
you would do at the beginning and

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.299 
you would do at the beginning and
focusing<00:00:58.050> on<00:00:58.170> what<00:00:58.379> works<00:00:58.620> for<00:00:58.920> him<00:00:59.129> he's

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
focusing on what works for him he's

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.650 
focusing on what works for him he's
going<00:00:59.579> with<00:00:59.820> those<00:00:59.940> dropships<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.570> he's

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
going with those dropships and he's

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.840 
going with those dropships and he's
turning<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.079> into<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.649> fantastic<00:01:02.280> magic<00:01:02.609> feel

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
turning this into a fantastic magic feel

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
turning this into a fantastic magic feel
like<00:01:02.969> he<00:01:03.059> definitely<00:01:03.359> has<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.570> upper<00:01:03.840> hand

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
like he definitely has the upper hand

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.929 
like he definitely has the upper hand
here<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.350> now<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:04.830> think<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.339> he's<00:01:05.729> done

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
here and now I think that he's done

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.130 
here and now I think that he's done
enough<00:01:06.030> pressure<00:01:06.330> at<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.659> northern

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
enough pressure at that northern

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.380 
enough pressure at that northern
location<00:01:07.590> he<00:01:08.490> stopped<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.909> gas<00:01:09.090> production

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
location he stopped the gas production

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.580 
location he stopped the gas production
you<00:01:09.630> don't<00:01:09.840> need<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.020> worry<00:01:10.080> about<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.530> anymore

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
you don't need to worry about it anymore

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.399 
you don't need to worry about it anymore
now<00:01:11.220> go<00:01:11.460> for<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.880> killer<00:01:12.150> drop<00:01:12.510> on<00:01:12.750> me<00:01:13.170> on

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
now go for that killer drop on me on

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.830 
now go for that killer drop on me on
mines<00:01:13.799> main<00:01:14.130> while<00:01:15.030> mind<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.450> out<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.630> position

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
mines main while mind is out of position

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.149 
mines main while mind is out of position
and<00:01:16.110> trying<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.560> drop<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.770> knowing<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
and trying to drop that knowing the

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.460 
and trying to drop that knowing the
location<00:01:17.280> just<00:01:18.060> switch<00:01:18.299> back<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.780> just<00:01:19.229> keep

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
location just switch back and just keep

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.899 
location just switch back and just keep
him<00:01:19.619> off<00:01:19.770> balance<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.340> think<00:01:20.549> mania<00:01:20.850> is

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
him off balance and I think mania is

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.700 
him off balance and I think mania is
very<00:01:21.119> good<00:01:21.270> at<00:01:21.360> doing<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.200> think<00:01:22.619> he

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
very good at doing that and I think he

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.100 
very good at doing that and I think he
will<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:23.070> fact<00:01:23.250> with<00:01:24.150> his<00:01:24.330> next<00:01:24.659> drop<00:01:24.840> kind<00:01:25.049> of

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
will in fact with his next drop kind of

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.260 
will in fact with his next drop kind of
go<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.439> different<00:01:25.590> location<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.790> push<00:01:27.119> up

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
go to a different location and push up

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.569 
go to a different location and push up
and<00:01:27.689> really<00:01:27.990> as<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.439> can<00:01:28.619> see<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.159> this

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
and really as you can see this is this

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.249 
and really as you can see this is this
is<00:01:29.729> what<00:01:29.909> he's<00:01:30.060> very<00:01:30.329> skilled<00:01:30.659> at<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.049> think

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
is what he's very skilled at and I think

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.870 
is what he's very skilled at and I think
that<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.409> kind<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.710> his<00:01:31.860> forte<00:01:32.280> looks<00:01:32.729> like

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
that is kind of his forte looks like

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.700 
that is kind of his forte looks like
he's<00:01:33.000> going<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.150> dedicate<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:34.049> try<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.380> take

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
he's going to dedicate and try to take

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.859 
he's going to dedicate and try to take
out<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> little<00:01:35.009> bit<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.369> raise<00:01:35.579> coming<00:01:36.060> up<00:01:36.180> but

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
out a little bit to raise coming up but

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.390 
out a little bit to raise coming up but
again<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.380> raise<00:01:37.530> against<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:37.920> large<00:01:38.159> force

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
again to raise against that large force

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
again to raise against that large force
of<00:01:38.460> goliaths<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:38.939> don't<00:01:39.060> think<00:01:39.210> they're<00:01:39.329> going

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
of goliaths I don't think they're going

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.609 
of goliaths I don't think they're going
to<00:01:39.479> be<00:01:39.570> very<00:01:39.750> successful<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.229> think<00:01:40.259> he's<00:01:40.500> just

upper left-hand corner he's going to

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.670 
upper left-hand corner he's going to
lose<00:02:17.580> that<00:02:17.610> expansion<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:19.080> I<00:02:19.440> think

economic Holdings that mania has now
otherwise<00:02:24.480> he's<00:02:24.780> going<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:24.930> fall<00:02:25.080> back

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
otherwise he's going to fall back

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.570 
otherwise he's going to fall back
economically<00:02:25.770> this<00:02:25.920> is<00:02:26.010> going<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.220> force<00:02:26.400> mine

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
economically this is going to force mine

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.210 
economically this is going to force mine
to<00:02:26.670> be<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.819> lot<00:02:27.030> more<00:02:27.060> aggressive<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:28.130> as<00:02:29.130> you

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
to be a lot more aggressive and as you

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.590 
to be a lot more aggressive and as you

think<00:02:42.930> it's<00:02:43.020> a<00:02:43.050> little<00:02:43.110> bit<00:02:43.260> late<00:02:43.730> it<00:02:44.730> looks

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
think it's a little bit late it looks

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
think it's a little bit late it looks
like<00:02:44.970> all<00:02:45.150> those<00:02:45.180> that<00:02:45.390> seem<00:02:45.540> he's<00:02:45.660> done<00:02:45.780> I

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
like all those that seem he's done I

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.540 
like all those that seem he's done I
take<00:02:46.110> back<00:02:46.260> not<00:02:46.500> not<00:02:46.739> too<00:02:46.920> late<00:02:47.100> here<00:02:47.280> but<00:02:47.430> Wow

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
take back not not too late here but Wow

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.580 
take back not not too late here but Wow
dropping<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:48.000> little<00:02:48.209> bit<00:02:48.300> out<00:02:48.390> of<00:02:48.420> position

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
dropping a little bit out of position

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.500 
dropping a little bit out of position
where<00:02:49.590> mines<00:02:50.250> tanks<00:02:50.580> basically<00:02:50.970> kind<00:02:51.390> of

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
where mines tanks basically kind of

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.150 
where mines tanks basically kind of
still<00:02:52.110> at<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.290> forefront<00:02:52.500> so<00:02:52.830> he's<00:02:52.950> going<00:02:53.100> to

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
still at the forefront so he's going to

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.740 
still at the forefront so he's going to
lose<00:02:53.280> that<00:02:53.340> grouping<00:02:53.880> so<00:02:54.300> going<00:02:54.510> back<00:02:54.690> to

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
lose that grouping so going back to

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.110 
lose that grouping so going back to
basically<00:02:55.470> reload<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.040> just<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.310> ton<00:02:56.580> of<00:02:56.610> tanks

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
basically reload and just a ton of tanks

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
basically reload and just a ton of tanks
for<00:02:57.150> mine<00:02:57.330> in<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.570> ground<00:02:57.750> that's<00:02:57.870> basically

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
for mine in the ground that's basically

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.930 
for mine in the ground that's basically
all<00:02:58.260> he's<00:02:58.500> dedicated<00:02:58.980> about<00:02:59.250> two<00:02:59.459> raids<00:02:59.700> and

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
all he's dedicated about two raids and

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.460 
all he's dedicated about two raids and
just<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.540> ton<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:00.720> tanks<00:03:01.019> and<00:03:01.080> he's<00:03:01.260> going<00:03:01.410> to

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
just a ton of tanks and he's going to

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.190 
just a ton of tanks and he's going to
siege<00:03:02.040> up<00:03:02.190> again<00:03:02.489> I<00:03:03.030> kind<00:03:03.660> of<00:03:03.690> hop<00:03:03.930> scotching

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
siege up again I kind of hop scotching

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.860 
siege up again I kind of hop scotching
and<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:04.590> command<00:03:05.400> center<00:03:05.730> floating<00:03:06.660> back

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
and that command center floating back

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.720 
and that command center floating back
back<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:07.830> upper<00:03:08.100> left<00:03:08.250> hand<00:03:08.310> corner<00:03:08.459> and

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
back to the upper left hand corner and

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.729 
back to the upper left hand corner and
I'm<00:03:09.630> not<00:03:09.810> sure<00:03:09.840> if<00:03:10.019> this<00:03:10.110> is<00:03:10.170> equalized<00:03:10.590> though

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
I'm not sure if this is equalized though

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.550 
I'm not sure if this is equalized though
I<00:03:10.769> think<00:03:10.890> mania<00:03:11.850> is<00:03:12.030> now<00:03:12.269> out<00:03:12.480> producing<00:03:12.989> at

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
I think mania is now out producing at

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.680 
I think mania is now out producing at
least<00:03:13.769> is<00:03:14.000> economically<00:03:15.000> out<00:03:15.180> producing<00:03:15.510> mine

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
least is economically out producing mine

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.210 
least is economically out producing mine
and<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:15.900> still<00:03:16.140> think<00:03:16.290> he's<00:03:16.410> winning<00:03:17.100> the

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
and I still think he's winning the

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.440 
and I still think he's winning the
production<00:03:17.640> battle<00:03:17.880> as<00:03:17.970> well<00:03:18.150> as<00:03:18.269> you<00:03:18.329> can<00:03:18.390> see

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
production battle as well as you can see

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.229 
production battle as well as you can see
a<00:03:18.600> lot<00:03:18.810> of<00:03:18.840> dropships<00:03:19.380> up<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:20.120> mania<00:03:21.120> in<00:03:21.180> the

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
a lot of dropships up and mania in the

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.310 
a lot of dropships up and mania in the
meantime<00:03:21.390> going<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:21.720> decide<00:03:21.959> to<00:03:22.079> take<00:03:22.200> that

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
meantime going to decide to take that

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.630 
meantime going to decide to take that
total<00:03:22.620> clock<00:03:22.769> position<00:03:22.950> instead<00:03:23.370> of<00:03:23.519> worrying

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
total clock position instead of worrying

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.069 
total clock position instead of worrying
about<00:03:23.820> that<00:03:24.030> that<00:03:24.480> kind<00:03:24.690> of<00:03:24.720> that<00:03:24.900> three

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
about that that kind of that three

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.569 
about that that kind of that three
o'clock<00:03:25.320> outward<00:03:25.709> position<00:03:26.100> I<00:03:26.250> think<00:03:26.489> he's

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
o'clock outward position I think he's

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.520 
o'clock outward position I think he's
going<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:26.760> try<00:03:26.940> to<00:03:26.970> do<00:03:27.150> another<00:03:27.390> drop<00:03:27.720> maybe<00:03:28.290> on

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
going to try to do another drop maybe on

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.009 
going to try to do another drop maybe on
the<00:03:28.650> natural<00:03:29.010> secondary<00:03:29.600> looks<00:03:30.600> like<00:03:30.780> he<00:03:30.870> is

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
the natural secondary looks like he is

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.300 
the natural secondary looks like he is
still<00:03:31.140> kind<00:03:31.350> of<00:03:31.410> posing<00:03:31.769> there<00:03:31.890> he's<00:03:32.040> still

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
still kind of posing there he's still

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.970 
still kind of posing there he's still
but<00:03:32.910> Wow<00:03:33.120> mind<00:03:33.600> bringing<00:03:33.840> a<00:03:34.019> lot<00:03:34.320> of<00:03:34.620> Tanks

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
but Wow mind bringing a lot of Tanks

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.310 
but Wow mind bringing a lot of Tanks
back<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:35.850> just<00:03:35.940> gonna<00:03:36.090> basically<00:03:36.269> do<00:03:36.959> a<00:03:36.989> tank

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
back and just gonna basically do a tank

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.130 
back and just gonna basically do a tank

and<00:03:40.290> yeah<00:03:40.410> it<00:03:40.530> looks<00:03:40.709> like<00:03:41.180> he's<00:03:42.180> coming<00:03:42.420> back

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510

and yeah it looks like he's coming back
and<00:03:42.690> he's<00:03:42.810> going<00:03:42.959> to<00:03:43.019> drop<00:03:43.170> all<00:03:43.380> over<00:03:43.590> that<00:03:43.709> but

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
and he's going to drop all over that but

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.530 
and he's going to drop all over that but
not<00:03:44.370> being<00:03:44.579> very<00:03:44.700> successful<00:03:44.850> dropping<00:03:45.450> that

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
not being very successful dropping that

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.360 
not being very successful dropping that
especially<00:03:46.079> true<00:03:46.260> really<00:03:46.709> where<00:03:46.860> he<00:03:46.890> did<00:03:47.130> not

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
especially true really where he did not

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.759 
especially true really where he did not
want<00:03:47.850> to<00:03:47.910> drop<00:03:48.120> them<00:03:48.329> kind<00:03:48.840> of<00:03:48.900> in<00:03:49.140> between<00:03:49.260> the

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
want to drop them kind of in between the

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.220 
want to drop them kind of in between the
two<00:03:49.920> siege<00:03:50.160> tank<00:03:50.459> positions<00:03:50.870> so<00:03:51.870> he's<00:03:52.110> going

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
two siege tank positions so he's going

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.720 
two siege tank positions so he's going
to<00:03:52.290> lose<00:03:52.410> a<00:03:52.470> lot<00:03:52.680> of<00:03:52.739> forces<00:03:53.130> there<00:03:53.310> but<00:03:53.519> mine

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
to lose a lot of forces there but mine

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.580 
to lose a lot of forces there but mine
has<00:03:53.940> a<00:03:53.970> lot<00:03:54.209> of<00:03:54.239> forces<00:03:54.600> reinforced<00:03:55.140> that<00:03:55.290> and

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
has a lot of forces reinforced that and

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.080 
has a lot of forces reinforced that and
really<00:03:55.920> uh<00:03:56.040> I<00:03:56.370> don't<00:03:56.670> think<00:03:56.790> he<00:03:56.850> should<00:03:56.880> be

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
really uh I don't think he should be

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.220 
really uh I don't think he should be
concerned<00:03:57.390> there<00:03:57.600> i<00:03:57.630> think<00:03:57.720> you<00:03:57.959> should<00:03:57.989> have

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
concerned there i think you should have

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.199 
concerned there i think you should have
pushed<00:03:58.440> that<00:03:58.590> drop<00:03:58.890> into<00:03:59.610> that<00:03:59.790> natural

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
pushed that drop into that natural

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.090 
pushed that drop into that natural
secondary<00:04:00.660> of<00:04:00.900> mines<00:04:01.170> or<00:04:01.350> maybe<00:04:01.500> even<00:04:01.560> on

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
secondary of mines or maybe even on

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.380 
secondary of mines or maybe even on
those<00:04:02.220> factories<00:04:02.760> that<00:04:02.790> are<00:04:02.940> out<00:04:03.150> of<00:04:03.269> position

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
those factories that are out of position

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.199 
those factories that are out of position
there<00:04:04.100> so<00:04:05.100> let's<00:04:05.310> see<00:04:05.430> if<00:04:05.519> we<00:04:05.610> can<00:04:05.730> get<00:04:05.820> on<00:04:06.000> let

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
there so let's see if we can get on let

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.460 
there so let's see if we can get on let
me<00:04:06.269> see<00:04:06.390> if<00:04:06.480> i<00:04:06.510> can<00:04:06.540> do<00:04:06.720> a<00:04:06.750> count<00:04:06.989> your<00:04:07.170> one<00:04:07.320> two

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
me see if i can do a count your one two

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.310 
me see if i can do a count your one two
three<00:04:07.739> four<00:04:08.030> so<00:04:09.030> I<00:04:09.060> think<00:04:09.390> about<00:04:09.930> five

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
three four so I think about five

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.349 
three four so I think about five
holdings<00:04:10.650> for<00:04:11.100> mine<00:04:11.430> but<00:04:11.730> one<00:04:11.910> of<00:04:12.030> them<00:04:12.120> is<00:04:12.239> his

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
holdings for mine but one of them is his

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:13.550 
holdings for mine but one of them is his
main<00:04:12.510> and<00:04:12.720> I<00:04:12.780> think<00:04:12.959> it's<00:04:13.079> entirely<00:04:13.350> out<00:04:13.530> of

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
main and I think it's entirely out of

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.870 
main and I think it's entirely out of
resources<00:04:14.010> i<00:04:14.100> don't<00:04:14.250> know<00:04:14.340> how<00:04:14.459> his<00:04:14.579> natural

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
resources i don't know how his natural

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.640 
resources i don't know how his natural
secondaries<00:04:15.299> doing<00:04:15.540> but<00:04:16.109> i<00:04:16.140> mean<00:04:16.410> in<00:04:16.530> the

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
secondaries doing but i mean in the

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.029 
secondaries doing but i mean in the
meantime<00:04:16.880> 120<00:04:17.880> man<00:04:18.359> another<00:04:19.229> attack<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:19.739> mind

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
meantime 120 man another attack and mind

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:21.529 
meantime 120 man another attack and mind
doing<00:04:20.370> exactly<00:04:20.669> what<00:04:20.880> he<00:04:21.000> needs<00:04:21.180> to<00:04:21.209> do<00:04:21.330> he's

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
doing exactly what he needs to do he's

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.390 
doing exactly what he needs to do he's
going<00:04:21.690> to<00:04:21.780> open<00:04:22.320> up<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:22.560> economic<00:04:22.710> game<00:04:23.220> going

going to open up the economic game going

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.740 
going to open up the economic game going

simultaneous

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.369 
simultaneous
here<00:04:25.729> and<00:04:26.090> take<00:04:26.270> out<00:04:26.389> as<00:04:26.509> many<00:04:26.629> stds<00:04:27.110> as<00:04:27.289> you

there going to be able to take out those

there going to be able to take out those
two<00:04:33.050> tanks<00:04:33.199> let's<00:04:33.440> see<00:04:33.590> I<00:04:33.889> really<00:04:34.280> would<00:04:34.460> have

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
two tanks let's see I really would have

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.830 
two tanks let's see I really would have
split<00:04:34.759> that<00:04:34.879> force<00:04:35.120> into<00:04:35.389> you<00:04:35.509> don't<00:04:35.659> have<00:04:35.750> to

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
split that force into you don't have to

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.240 
split that force into you don't have to
dump<00:04:36.080> all<00:04:36.289> of<00:04:36.319> those<00:04:36.590> on<00:04:36.830> just<00:04:37.039> a<00:04:37.129> single

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
dump all of those on just a single

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.059 
dump all of those on just a single
grouping<00:04:38.139> maybe<00:04:39.139> just<00:04:39.349> you<00:04:39.530> know<00:04:39.620> half<00:04:39.889> and

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:40.069 
grouping maybe just you know half and

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:42.550 
grouping maybe just you know half and
half<00:04:40.220> but<00:04:41.150> yeah<00:04:42.020> it<00:04:42.080> looks<00:04:42.229> like<00:04:42.349> he's<00:04:42.470> going

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
half but yeah it looks like he's going

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.080 
half but yeah it looks like he's going
to<00:04:42.650> just<00:04:42.889> kind<00:04:43.069> of<00:04:43.099> siege<00:04:43.310> and<00:04:43.490> take<00:04:43.849> care<00:04:44.030> of

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
to just kind of siege and take care of

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.119 
to just kind of siege and take care of
what's<00:04:44.300> left<00:04:44.360> here<00:04:44.599> but<00:04:45.500> but<00:04:45.800> i<00:04:45.860> still<00:04:46.069> think

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:46.129 
what's left here but but i still think

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:47.980 
what's left here but but i still think
mania<00:04:46.639> is<00:04:46.819> is<00:04:47.330> definitely<00:04:47.900> ahead

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
mania is is definitely ahead

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.869 
mania is is definitely ahead
economically<00:04:48.710> he's<00:04:48.979> got<00:04:49.220> more<00:04:49.370> Holdings<00:04:49.759> but

00:04:49.869 --> 00:04:49.879 
economically he's got more Holdings but

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:52.029 
economically he's got more Holdings but
more<00:04:50.090> tanks<00:04:50.330> coming<00:04:50.509> in<00:04:50.690> in<00:04:51.500> the<00:04:51.560> background

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
more tanks coming in in the background

and he's just going to ferry them in on
the<00:04:53.330> ground<00:04:53.509> so<00:04:54.050> go<00:04:54.259> and<00:04:54.710> really<00:04:54.979> trying<00:04:55.970> to

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
the ground so go and really trying to

wow he's going to try to take over that
three<00:04:57.800> o'clock<00:04:58.039> expansion<00:04:58.580> and<00:04:58.729> take<00:04:59.150> that

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
three o'clock expansion and take that

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.399 
three o'clock expansion and take that
comps<00:04:59.569> at<00:04:59.659> center<00:04:59.870> he<00:04:59.960> can<00:05:00.110> land<00:05:00.289> it<00:05:00.380> right

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:00.409 
comps at center he can land it right

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:01.749 
comps at center he can land it right
there<00:05:00.680> and<00:05:00.800> take<00:05:00.949> that<00:05:00.979> over<00:05:01.280> and<00:05:01.460> a<00:05:01.520> lot<00:05:01.729> of

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759 
there and take that over and a lot of

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:03.999 
there and take that over and a lot of
tanks<00:05:02.150> down<00:05:02.270> there<00:05:02.509> and<00:05:03.289> really<00:05:03.560> just<00:05:03.680> that<00:05:03.979> a

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:04.009 
tanks down there and really just that a

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:06.129 
tanks down there and really just that a
large<00:05:05.000> force<00:05:05.330> have<00:05:05.449> you<00:05:05.539> decided<00:05:05.720> to<00:05:05.900> press

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
large force have you decided to press

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.680 
large force have you decided to press
down<00:05:06.169> I<00:05:06.349> think<00:05:06.620> he<00:05:06.740> could<00:05:07.120> go<00:05:08.120> down<00:05:08.300> and<00:05:08.539> take

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
down I think he could go down and take

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.120 
down I think he could go down and take
that<00:05:08.870> he<00:05:08.990> might<00:05:09.139> try<00:05:09.289> to<00:05:09.349> see<00:05:09.530> over<00:05:09.919> the<00:05:10.009> ridge

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
that he might try to see over the ridge

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.070 
that he might try to see over the ridge
here<00:05:10.340> yeah<00:05:11.240> he<00:05:11.389> is<00:05:11.479> going<00:05:11.599> to<00:05:11.690> try<00:05:11.780> to<00:05:11.840> siege

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
here yeah he is going to try to siege

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.390 
here yeah he is going to try to siege
over<00:05:12.319> the<00:05:12.409> ridge<00:05:12.560> here<00:05:12.740> going<00:05:12.979> to<00:05:13.039> put<00:05:13.159> up<00:05:13.250> some

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
over the ridge here going to put up some

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.180 
over the ridge here going to put up some
turrets<00:05:13.669> and<00:05:14.479> a<00:05:14.720> really<00:05:15.229> interesting<00:05:15.830> battle

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
turrets and a really interesting battle

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.439 
turrets and a really interesting battle
here<00:05:16.490> it<00:05:16.550> looks<00:05:16.699> like<00:05:16.759> manias<00:05:17.210> going<00:05:17.389> to

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:17.449 
here it looks like manias going to

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:19.600 
here it looks like manias going to
attack<00:05:18.289> to<00:05:18.409> the<00:05:18.469> north<00:05:18.650> to<00:05:18.860> siege<00:05:19.039> tanks<00:05:19.400> kind

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
attack to the north to siege tanks kind

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.520 
attack to the north to siege tanks kind
of<00:05:19.699> going<00:05:20.180> to<00:05:20.240> get<00:05:20.360> worked<00:05:21.169> a<00:05:21.259> little<00:05:21.349> bit

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
of going to get worked a little bit

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:22.749 
of going to get worked a little bit
there<00:05:21.680> I'm<00:05:21.740> surprised<00:05:21.979> he<00:05:22.130> didn't<00:05:22.340> dedicated

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:22.759 
there I'm surprised he didn't dedicated

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:24.820 
there I'm surprised he didn't dedicated
one<00:05:23.090> of<00:05:23.180> his<00:05:23.270> dropships<00:05:23.719> there<00:05:23.870> and<00:05:24.590> kind<00:05:24.770> of

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
one of his dropships there and kind of

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.020 
one of his dropships there and kind of
splitting<00:05:25.129> as<00:05:25.310> you<00:05:25.400> can<00:05:25.520> see<00:05:25.669> splitting

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
splitting as you can see splitting
