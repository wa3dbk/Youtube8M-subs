know<00:01:05.549> because<00:01:06.420> he's<00:01:07.409> one<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.710> those<00:01:08.060> powerful

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
know because he's one of those powerful

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.350 
know because he's one of those powerful
power<00:01:10.710> forwards<00:01:11.340> more<00:01:11.490> than<00:01:11.610> he<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.880> center

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
power forwards more than he is a center

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.120 
power forwards more than he is a center
in<00:01:12.390> my<00:01:12.630> mind<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.110> noel<00:01:13.560> they<00:01:13.740> say<00:01:13.950> he's<00:01:14.100> a

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
in my mind this noel they say he's a

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.190 
in my mind this noel they say he's a
center<00:01:14.580> but<00:01:15.240> i<00:01:15.299> think<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.689> him<00:01:15.810> as<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.930> power

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
center but i think of him as a power

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.420 
center but i think of him as a power
forward<00:01:16.610> so<00:01:17.610> if<00:01:17.670> he<00:01:17.820> could<00:01:18.000> be<00:01:18.450> one<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.780> those

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
forward so if he could be one of those

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.359 
forward so if he could be one of those
superstars<00:01:20.430> at<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.330> position<00:01:21.540> Allah<00:01:22.439> Kevin

that'll<00:01:27.570> open<00:01:27.810> up<00:01:28.049> some<00:01:28.229> things<00:01:28.439> for<00:01:28.650> Andrew

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
that'll open up some things for Andrew

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.230 
that'll open up some things for Andrew
Bynum<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.460> maybe<00:01:29.579> make<00:01:29.820> him<00:01:29.939> want<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.180> stay

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
Bynum and maybe make him want to stay

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.749 
Bynum and maybe make him want to stay
because<00:01:31.020> if<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.320> get<00:01:31.500> two<00:01:31.710> superstars<00:01:32.130> and

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
because if you get two superstars and

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.640 
because if you get two superstars and
the<00:01:33.060> NBA<00:01:33.329> then<00:01:33.600> you're<00:01:33.750> relevant<00:01:34.079> again<00:01:34.439> and
