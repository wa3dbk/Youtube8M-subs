00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.570
 Ranged years already here, the Irish's no to Blackberry 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.679
 Playbook the seven is to be sold 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:17.679
 with the new Tablet OS operating system 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.899
 how do you see also some heart animal have Michael Knaus Tabbert also in the 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.819
 even if he or she lets the engine drift the whole thing has to mix too 

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:28.739
 unlike the Ion 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:31.210
 and Herberts of course compete too 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.180
 you see, the whole thing runs wonderfully smoothly the animations are super 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.540
 this left media 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.560
 also some games of course if you take even more Storm the store 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.050
 but currently the sports fair is now that we are on it 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.790
 instead of your own browser 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.330
 because I think that's one of the most important things you can do with the 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.320
 Prohibition is Jamie Lynn Pascoe Kamps 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.570
 Of course, if we go to the top of the bar you can enter the URL like that 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:59.429
 keyboard 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:02.429
 on the wonderful can write 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.380
 Steffen Lehmann you Gerd ripped point de 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.360
 I hope we play with and fast enough 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.100
 Here you see, we also have more Power Laeisz Berlin introduces 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.100
 from loading the website 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.300
 So it takes a little bit longer and whole sentences to say I have here 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.830
 on four Flash content on it 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.830
 And with that, of course, Herbert is also clear 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.880
 so obscured 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.979
 smart, smart front looks great works we have here 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.979
 synonymous same flash video that will 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.190
 Pölten and Herbert, for example, if Apple iPad does not appear 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.950
 The size reduced and with wonderful 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.280
 and yes, for example, we have a youtube video just on the 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.470
 Rating points are not 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.880
 because of course also several windows open to this we have this bar 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.090
 have meanwhile 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.510
 the web pages and switch 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.240
 and a very special feature of 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.140
 McQueen was 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.230
 he is almost sensitive frame youngest son now, for example, he from above 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.030
 wipe the middle and already has the power to change the website 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.220
 Brégier from below in the middle to show the cameras running 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:19.379
 public mali proven techniques 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.379
 you have to dissolve the prehistory here 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.359
 it looks pretty good the 7-inch display has a resolution of 1024 times 600 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:29.719
 pixel 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:31.089
 and here again 

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:34.089
 because here switch between running applications 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.670
 Of course there is also a camera recognizing the PlayBook has two cameras 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:42.920
 a 5-megapixel camera on the back and a 3-megapixel camera 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:47.540
 front for video conferencing central now so much about it 

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:51.629
 very simply designed top right you can between camera 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.649
 and video camera Lexington we have big picture Bartl 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.429
 but here you see 

00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:01.999
 all multitasking it runs in the background Niklas etc it runs 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:04.999
 really in the background 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.099
 SU 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.269
 videos 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.779
 full hd videos of his players no problem because synonymous of the camera 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:14.969
 recorded 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:15.949
 and 7 

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:18.859
 Glory's kid looks awesome 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:22.439
 with the mini HDMI port in the videos are of course also a TV 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:24.259
 look at 

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:28.229
 not every house already pre-installed namely not that the camera and the 

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:31.619
 Point of view, it is also pretty disrespectful region 

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:34.349
 Now we have to go to the next games 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.869
 in California, Josh would not show it 

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:39.869
 who more so the game of the mirror still slightly 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:43.539
 in the course in Malta 

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:47.409
 already it can start in September then keep open like a steering wheel so how 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:50.459
 on most tablets and racing games 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.549
 and we're ready to go Power looks pretty good 

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:58.409
 and everyone can see that I do not tie a good driver but people just 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:59.100
 demonstrate 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.100
 how the whole thing looks like 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.289
 and if Janko wants to shoot she can sank to push up 

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:10.029
 and it's already closed 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:14.239
 and of course you can not miss your own Yaya Toure 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:17.120
 what should I do here 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.120
 Children also look at us for the main videos 

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:25.849
 Niamey my video from the ju-member is probably one of the smallest netbooks of the 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:26.439
 world 

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:29.879
 Here, however, I see moving good quality selected 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:33.059
 and that was already a video for the Blackberry Playbook 

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:34.550
 to make the connection 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.409
 but definitely not my youtube-channel room visit one 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:40.160
