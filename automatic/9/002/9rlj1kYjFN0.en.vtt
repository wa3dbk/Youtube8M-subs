00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
don't know whether you can really see

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.660 
don't know whether you can really see
that<00:02:41.959> in<00:02:42.230> this<00:02:42.380> fly<00:02:45.160> this<00:02:46.160> one's<00:02:46.400> going<00:02:46.550> to<00:02:46.610> be

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
that in this fly this one's going to be

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.090 
that in this fly this one's going to be
used<00:02:46.970> extensively<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:48.080> why<00:02:48.410> is<00:02:48.470> it<00:02:48.650> time<00:02:51.100> yeah

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
used extensively and why is it time yeah

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.030 
used extensively and why is it time yeah
this<00:02:52.400> is<00:02:52.550> going<00:02:52.640> to<00:02:52.760> be<00:02:52.910> doing<00:02:53.239> a<00:02:53.420> fair<00:02:53.630> bit<00:02:53.660> of

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
this is going to be doing a fair bit of

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.380 
this is going to be doing a fair bit of
work<00:02:55.040> as<00:02:55.220> far<00:02:55.430> as<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:55.670> experiments<00:02:56.300> are

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
work as far as the experiments are

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.710 
work as far as the experiments are

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
does the sound from the string actually

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.850 
does the sound from the string actually
make<00:03:07.400> it<00:03:07.580> into<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.300> body<00:03:08.870> of<00:03:09.050> the<00:03:09.200> guitar<00:03:09.319> and

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
make it into the body of the guitar and

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.980 
make it into the body of the guitar and
back<00:03:10.819> again<00:03:11.240> and<00:03:11.450> if<00:03:12.170> so<00:03:12.970> does<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.270> density<00:03:14.870> of

dozen electric guitars pickups really

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.020 
dozen electric guitars pickups really
only<00:03:24.569> pick<00:03:24.840> up<00:03:25.050> the<00:03:26.010> vibrations<00:03:26.760> of<00:03:26.910> the

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
only pick up the vibrations of the

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.180 
only pick up the vibrations of the
strings<00:03:27.390> or<00:03:27.870> are<00:03:28.260> there<00:03:28.440> other<00:03:28.650> things<00:03:29.010> that

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
strings or are there other things that

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.400 
strings or are there other things that
are<00:03:29.280> going<00:03:29.459> on<00:03:29.730> that<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.870> pickups<00:03:31.260> are

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
are going on that the the pickups are

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.000 
are going on that the the pickups are
actually<00:03:31.770> picking<00:03:32.040> up<00:03:32.250> well<00:03:33.680> this<00:03:34.680> is<00:03:34.860> what

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
actually picking up well this is what

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.360 
actually picking up well this is what
we'll<00:03:35.190> find<00:03:35.370> out<00:03:35.640> with<00:03:35.849> this<00:03:35.970> experiment

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.920 

also<00:03:40.370> I'm<00:03:40.490> going<00:03:40.730> to<00:03:40.880> do<00:03:41.090> an<00:03:41.180> experiment<00:03:41.780> where

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
also I'm going to do an experiment where

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.410 
also I'm going to do an experiment where
we<00:03:42.110> test<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:43.040> frequency<00:03:43.610> response<00:03:43.820> of<00:03:44.270> the

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
we test the frequency response of the

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.570 
we test the frequency response of the
output<00:03:44.990> from<00:03:45.200> two<00:03:45.980> different<00:03:46.190> warning

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
output from two different warning

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.220 
output from two different warning
materials<00:03:47.180> with<00:03:47.330> everything<00:03:47.870> otherwise

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
materials with everything otherwise

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.420 
materials with everything otherwise
being<00:03:48.560> identical

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.370 

and<00:03:53.430> also<00:03:53.610> I<00:03:53.820> want<00:03:54.060> to<00:03:54.090> do<00:03:54.210> a<00:03:54.240> blind<00:03:54.510> a/b<00:03:55.050> test

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
and also I want to do a blind a/b test

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.020 
and also I want to do a blind a/b test
so<00:03:55.650> we<00:03:55.770> can<00:03:55.800> test<00:03:56.130> those<00:03:56.370> two<00:03:56.700> different

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
so we can test those two different

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.690 
so we can test those two different
materials<00:03:57.180> and<00:03:58.170> that's<00:03:59.040> where<00:03:59.220> your<00:03:59.430> help

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
materials and that's where your help

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.440 
materials and that's where your help
comes<00:04:00.030> in

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
comes in

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.110 
comes in
I'll<00:04:00.810> need<00:04:01.110> your<00:04:01.380> ease<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:02.430> try<00:04:02.670> and<00:04:02.790> decipher

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
I'll need your ease to try and decipher

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.140 
I'll need your ease to try and decipher
and<00:04:03.420> tell<00:04:03.660> me<00:04:03.810> which<00:04:03.990> is<00:04:04.200> which<00:04:04.440> so<00:04:04.800> I<00:04:05.790> hope<00:04:06.030> you

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
and tell me which is which so I hope you

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.660 
and tell me which is which so I hope you
can<00:04:06.300> stick<00:04:06.540> around<00:04:06.860> and<00:04:07.860> join<00:04:08.220> me<00:04:08.430> on<00:04:08.460> this

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
can stick around and join me on this

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.700 
can stick around and join me on this
journey<00:04:08.970> to<00:04:09.330> find<00:04:09.360> out<00:04:09.750> does<00:04:10.020> would<00:04:10.320> really

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:10.710 
journey to find out does would really

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.310 
journey to find out does would really
affect<00:04:11.040> electric<00:04:11.730> guitar<00:04:12.060> tone<00:04:12.330> and<00:04:12.690> if<00:04:13.200> you

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
affect electric guitar tone and if you

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.380 
affect electric guitar tone and if you
have<00:04:13.500> any<00:04:13.620> suggestions<00:04:14.340> for<00:04:14.430> for<00:04:15.180> other

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
have any suggestions for for other

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.060 
have any suggestions for for other
experiments<00:04:16.320> and<00:04:16.500> things<00:04:16.739> that<00:04:16.859> you<00:04:17.040> might

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
experiments and things that you might

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.670 
experiments and things that you might
want<00:04:17.489> me<00:04:17.609> to<00:04:17.640> do<00:04:17.930> put<00:04:18.930> them<00:04:19.049> in<00:04:19.140> the<00:04:19.230> comments

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
want me to do put them in the comments

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.590 
want me to do put them in the comments
below<00:04:19.820> so<00:04:20.820> at<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.030> end<00:04:21.150> of<00:04:21.269> the<00:04:21.330> series

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
below so at the end of the series

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.180 
below so at the end of the series
hopefully<00:04:22.019> we<00:04:22.380> draw<00:04:22.590> some<00:04:22.830> kind<00:04:23.040> of

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
hopefully we draw some kind of

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.720 
hopefully we draw some kind of
conclusion<00:04:23.450> and<00:04:24.620> with<00:04:25.620> a<00:04:25.650> bit<00:04:25.830> of<00:04:25.860> luck<00:04:26.070> the

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
conclusion and with a bit of luck the

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.580 
conclusion and with a bit of luck the
majority<00:04:27.330> of<00:04:27.360> us<00:04:27.570> will<00:04:27.600> be<00:04:27.930> happy<00:04:28.050> with<00:04:28.380> that

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
majority of us will be happy with that

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.680 
majority of us will be happy with that
of<00:04:29.580> course<00:04:29.880> there's<00:04:30.120> always<00:04:30.270> going<00:04:30.540> to<00:04:30.600> be

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
of course there's always going to be

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.160 
of course there's always going to be
somebody<00:04:30.990> or<00:04:31.830> a<00:04:31.890> few<00:04:32.340> that<00:04:32.700> is<00:04:33.660> going<00:04:34.080> to

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
somebody or a few that is going to

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.320 
somebody or a few that is going to
disagree<00:04:34.500> and<00:04:35.160> you<00:04:35.310> get<00:04:35.490> that<00:04:35.700> that's<00:04:36.060> just

disagree and you get that that's just

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.330 
disagree and you get that that's just
how<00:04:36.540> it<00:04:36.690> is

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340
