00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
criminalization of course is one way of

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.130 
criminalization of course is one way of
doing<00:05:07.370> that<00:05:07.550> but<00:05:07.700> that<00:05:08.030> must<00:05:08.390> not<00:05:08.660> be<00:05:08.720> at<00:05:08.960> the

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
doing that but that must not be at the

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.410 
doing that but that must not be at the

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640 
strategy because we want to support and

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.640 
strategy because we want to support and

the United Kingdom to be able to come
forward<00:05:17.930> and<00:05:18.200> it's<00:05:18.410> quite<00:05:18.680> correct<00:05:19.130> to<00:05:19.220> assert

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:19.670 
forward and it's quite correct to assert

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.110 
forward and it's quite correct to assert
that<00:05:20.090> criminalization<00:05:20.960> may<00:05:21.650> actually

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
that criminalization may actually

that criminalization may actually
ironically<00:05:23.120> be<00:05:23.720> a<00:05:23.750> deterrent<00:05:24.320> for<00:05:24.380> some

ironically be a deterrent for some
children<00:05:24.950> coming<00:05:25.160> forward<00:05:25.550> so<00:05:25.670> there's<00:05:25.820> a

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
children coming forward so there's a

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.180 
children coming forward so there's a
range<00:05:26.150> of<00:05:26.360> measures<00:05:26.690> that<00:05:26.840> we<00:05:26.960> can<00:05:26.990> employ<00:05:27.410> to

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
range of measures that we can employ to

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.060 
range of measures that we can employ to
tackle<00:05:28.550> this<00:05:28.640> issue<00:05:28.840> here<00:05:29.840> in<00:05:29.960> the<00:05:30.050> UK<00:05:30.260> but<00:05:30.680> the

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
tackle this issue here in the UK but the

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.920 
tackle this issue here in the UK but the
extent<00:05:31.520> of<00:05:31.640> it<00:05:31.760> is<00:05:31.940> enormous<00:05:32.300> you<00:05:32.510> know<00:05:32.690> we

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
extent of it is enormous you know we

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.300 
extent of it is enormous you know we
estimate<00:05:33.230> that<00:05:33.380> there's<00:05:33.590> something<00:05:33.740> like<00:05:33.890> 10

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
estimate that there's something like 10

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.730

million<00:05:34.520> children<00:05:35.090> around<00:05:35.450> the<00:05:35.930> world<00:05:36.140> who

million children around the world who

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.280 
million children around the world who
are<00:05:36.920> affected<00:05:37.460> by<00:05:37.490> this<00:05:37.670> practice<00:05:38.330> and<00:05:39.110> the

are affected by this practice and the

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.770 
are affected by this practice and the
most<00:05:39.640> severe<00:05:40.640> consequence<00:05:41.210> that<00:05:41.420> I've<00:05:41.540> seen

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
most severe consequence that I've seen

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.900 
most severe consequence that I've seen
in<00:05:41.900> my<00:05:42.050> experience<00:05:42.140> aplan<00:05:42.920> overseas

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
in my experience aplan overseas

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.880 
in my experience aplan overseas
especially<00:05:44.510> is<00:05:44.720> that<00:05:44.900> it<00:05:45.170> ends<00:05:45.590> a<00:05:45.680> girl's

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:45.890 
especially is that it ends a girl's

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.010 
especially is that it ends a girl's
education<00:05:46.670> it<00:05:46.820> denies<00:05:47.270> her<00:05:47.660> the<00:05:47.780> opportunity

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
education it denies her the opportunity

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.620 
education it denies her the opportunity
to<00:05:48.470> fulfill<00:05:48.800> her<00:05:49.190> potential<00:05:49.580> to<00:05:50.090> be<00:05:50.300> all<00:05:50.450> that

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
to fulfill her potential to be all that

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.330 
to fulfill her potential to be all that
she<00:05:50.780> can<00:05:51.020> be<00:05:51.260> it's<00:05:51.590> not<00:05:51.740> only<00:05:52.040> a<00:05:52.070> gross

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
she can be it's not only a gross

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.250 
she can be it's not only a gross
violation<00:05:52.580> of<00:05:53.090> a<00:05:53.120> girl's<00:05:53.330> rights<00:05:53.660> but<00:05:54.140> it

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260 
violation of a girl's rights but it

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.800 
violation of a girl's rights but it
effectively<00:05:54.980> ends<00:05:55.400> her<00:05:55.550> future<00:05:56.030> that<00:05:56.390> simply
