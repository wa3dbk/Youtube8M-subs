00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.900

 vin santo with tour and pink pepper 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.480
 let's see the ingredients for 4 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.400
 people cheek beef 600 grams 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.539
 carrot onion celery and a clove of 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.029
 tomato paste garlic 50 grams 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:33.710

 red rosemary bay sage thyme 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:42.629
 potatoes already boiled a glass of milk 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.309
 50 g of pink pepper butter salt pepper and 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.530
 oil 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.870
 like all classic recipes 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.449
 let's start with our once upon a time 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.970
 celery carrot onion and garlic we go there 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.860
 to clean peel and cut into 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.949
 small pieces what the French 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.030
 they call mire can practically pieces 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.960
 coarse 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.670
 let's go and put it in our pot 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.220
 as you can see I added the vegetables first 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.079
 and then I add the oil I recommend it 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.240
 do it all because this way 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:16.009
 we guarantee you know that the vegetables will be 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.009
 cooked well and that the oil does not spoil 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.289
 we use induction to the maximum 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:26.060
 speed and you will see that it will be a 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.060
 fun in three minutes is ready to 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.170
 At this point we begin to work with 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.170
 the cheek we take a pan 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.780
 in this case we do it instead 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.240
 heat we take our cheek of 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:47.410
 beef and we will have cleaned all of his 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:49.510
 waste add salt pepper a 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.640
 advice and scraps of the cheek that 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.010
 let's go to remove or see the nerves and 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.900
 what are its most callous parts 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.830
 we brown them together with the 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:08.920
 vegetables when the pan is hot 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:10.780
 add a little oil only when there 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.670
 vegetables will already be a little colorful 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.350
 add the aromatic herbs 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.940
 don't do it before because otherwise 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.120
 the oil would be too aggressive and 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:24.390
 it would burn our herbs 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:29.150
 we said thyme a sprig of sage 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:31.900
 laurel and rosemary 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.430
 [Music] 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.350
 as you see our cheek stands 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.430
 becoming beautiful and colored us 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:42.910
 we still have a little must have been 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.090
 and beautiful brownish at this point the 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.200
 our meat is ready and colorful 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.820
 add some tomato to vegetables 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.840
 obviously concentrated 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:58.780
 [Music] 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:03.970
 let's go put our cheek with 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:10.810
 the vegetables themselves and the frying pan 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:13.360
 with red wine in this way 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.210
 we will take off the alcohol and take all the 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.470
 sauces and we do the same procedure 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.470
 also with vin santo 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.069
 [Music] 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.800
 cook everything for 10 minutes 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.170
 about 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:51.320
 done this we put the whole pot 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:54.080
 in the beater we removed from the bottom 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.550
 from the batter the cheek with the 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.380
 vegetables because we put it in 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.510
 blast chiller because now we go to 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.120
 close our cheek in a vacuum 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.100
 when the product is still hot not 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.450
 I can close it in the envelope because 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.550
 otherwise at the time of the draw 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.840
 area would come out too much steam 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.590
 and it would cause me problems 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.070
 we introduce our cheek and all 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.070
 its perfumes 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.009
 [Music] 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:25.350
 I remind you to always do this 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.130
 operation when the product is well 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.540
 cold 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.070
 let's go and put our own 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.070
 vacuum cheek 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:42.850
 [Music] 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:47.160
 let's go and put our own 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.160
 vacuum cheek in the oven 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:05:01.300
 [Music] 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:09.220
 we leave our cheek in the oven at 85 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:11.560
 serious in the steam oven for eight hours 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.140
 because why in this way the whole 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.300
 collagen will have already collapsed 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:22.480
 8 hours passed and we go to see the 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:25.900
 our cheek as it has become it is 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.760
 here ready soft super soft 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.040
 now we have two options or so 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.140
 we use immediately and keep it warm 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.910
 in our water or we put it 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.070
 in the batter and we can get it 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.380
 aside for the next ten days 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.360
 I want to use it right away for 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.270
 which I will go to put a pot of 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:46.540
 warm water that will keep it imprinted 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:50.830
 at the time of service then I will go to 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:52.870
 take the bag we support 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:57.520
 inside the pot 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:06:00.030
 we are going to cut our bag e 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.510
 we'll get our cheek out 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:08.640
 [Music] 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:10.410
 and place it on a saucer the 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:15.920
 liquid is left we will carry it 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:18.440
 boil and we will filter it 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:27.120
 let us therefore reduce ours 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:28.530
 sauce and we pass it to the strainer a 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.580
 this point depends on how long 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.820
 we have available 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.960
 or let the sauce reduce slowly 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.990
 add a pinch of cornstarch 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:40.380
 dissolved in water to make ours 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:42.840
 sauce still fidenza while the sauce 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:45.450
 it will be getting smaller we would have taken some 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.150
 boiled potatoes and we will have passed them 

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:49.800
 through the sieve 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:52.230
 so let's add to the potatoes 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.450
 pass a little milk and some little ones 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:56.900
 the only flakes of butter there 

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.900
 grant 

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:06.270
 [Music] 

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:09.539
 it's time to dish up let's start from the 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:13.550
 our pure made only with potatoes 

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:16.589
 milk pastries is a bit of butter 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:19.680
 we are going to perfume them with pink pepper 

00:07:16.589 --> 00:07:22.229
 only externally 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:27.990

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:31.099

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:36.479
 cooking bottom and we have slightly 

00:07:31.099 --> 00:07:39.150
 tied with corn starch for the most 

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:41.999
 greedy I grant you the gardener of 

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:45.479
 vegetables for which in this case we have 

00:07:41.999 --> 00:07:48.360
 Cauliflower some carrot and 

00:07:45.479 --> 00:07:52.169
 slightly blanched celery 

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:54.749
 preserved a bit of sprouts in vinegar 

00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:59.099
