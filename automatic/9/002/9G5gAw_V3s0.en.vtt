00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
the roof the floor is made of galvanized

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.410 
the roof the floor is made of galvanized
steel<00:00:44.700> over<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.899> plaque<00:00:46.350> over<00:00:46.379> plywood<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.430> the

plywood is on top of a 2x4 frame so it's
it's<00:00:52.590> above<00:00:52.920> ground<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.399> little<00:00:53.520> bit<00:00:53.899> the<00:00:54.899> fence

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
it's above ground a little bit the fence

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.680 
it's above ground a little bit the fence
is<00:00:55.980> actually<00:00:56.399> at<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.610> moment<00:00:56.640> unattached<00:00:57.390> to

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
is actually at the moment unattached to

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.150 
is actually at the moment unattached to
the<00:00:57.780> floor<00:00:58.050> but<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.440> can<00:00:58.590> all<00:00:58.680> listen<00:00:58.829> forth

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
the floor but you can all listen forth

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.840 
the floor but you can all listen forth
it<00:00:59.340> down<00:01:00.590> the<00:01:01.590> whole<00:01:01.920> fence<00:01:02.309> all<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.760> the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
it down the whole fence all of the

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.390 
it down the whole fence all of the
panels<00:01:03.300> come<00:01:03.510> apart<00:01:03.870> with<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.439> bow<00:01:04.769> with<00:01:05.129> 8

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.210 
panels come apart with a bow with 8
bolts<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.030> it's<00:01:06.180> all<00:01:06.330> modular<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:08.010> roof

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
bolts so it's all modular and the roof

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.300 
bolts so it's all modular and the roof
is<00:01:08.640> actually<00:01:08.939> at<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.720> moment<00:01:09.750> just<00:01:10.260> not<00:01:10.950> not

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
is actually at the moment just not not

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.789 
is actually at the moment just not not
fastened<00:01:11.880> down<00:01:12.000> but<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.420> it's<00:01:13.290> connected

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
fastened down but it it's connected

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.380 
fastened down but it it's connected
through<00:01:13.979> some<00:01:14.130> little<00:01:14.400> pegs<00:01:14.820> that's<00:01:15.180> like<00:01:15.360> a

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
through some little pegs that's like a

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:23.450 
through some little pegs that's like a
hot<00:01:15.930> lift<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.229> them<00:01:21.740> we<00:01:22.740> used<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.040> keep<00:01:23.189> a

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
hot lift to them we used to keep a

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:32.300 
hot lift to them we used to keep a
parent<00:01:24.240> inside<00:01:25.310> a<00:01:26.720> military<00:01:27.720> macaw<00:01:29.360> and<00:01:31.310> yeah

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
parent inside a military macaw and yeah

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.330 
parent inside a military macaw and yeah
and<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.640> gates<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.770> didn't<00:01:34.770> measure<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.130> gate

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
and the gates I didn't measure the gate

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.899 
and the gates I didn't measure the gate
but<00:01:35.670> it's<00:01:36.360> kind<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.720> standard<00:01:37.200> door<00:01:37.950> you

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
but it's kind of a standard door you

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.100 
but it's kind of a standard door you
shouldn't<00:01:39.240> have<00:01:39.600> any<00:01:39.750> trouble<00:01:39.780> getting

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
shouldn't have any trouble getting

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.649 
shouldn't have any trouble getting
anything<00:01:43.430> well<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.640> game<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.420> same

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
anything well the game is the same

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.010 
anything well the game is the same
height<00:01:45.960> as<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.649> height<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.790> cage<00:01:48.030> which

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
height as the height of the cage which

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.510 
height as the height of the cage which
is<00:01:49.049> 7<00:01:49.500> feet<00:01:50.000> and<00:01:51.000> one<00:01:51.210> last<00:01:51.420> thing<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:52.100> as<00:01:53.100> part

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
is 7 feet and one last thing is as part

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.270 
is 7 feet and one last thing is as part
of<00:01:53.640> on<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.509> inside<00:01:54.630> we<00:01:55.290> also<00:01:55.439> have<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:56.009> gate

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
of on the inside we also have this gate

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.190 
of on the inside we also have this gate
which<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.520> about<00:01:56.850> three<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.420> half<00:01:57.450> feet<00:01:57.930> by

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
which is about three and a half feet by

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.950 
which is about three and a half feet by
four<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.829> half<00:01:58.860> feet<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.969> it's<00:02:00.149> just<00:02:00.360> it

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
four and a half feet and it's just it

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.660 
four and a half feet and it's just it
happens<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.469> be<00:02:01.560> attached<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.579> the

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
happens to be attached to that to the

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.050 
happens to be attached to that to the
fence<00:02:02.909> but<00:02:03.149> with<00:02:03.329> well<00:02:04.250> it<00:02:05.250> comes<00:02:05.490> with<00:02:05.759> the

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
fence but with well it comes with the

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.089 
fence but with well it comes with the
with<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.899> thing<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.320> it's<00:02:07.560> actually<00:02:08.069> a

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
with the thing and it's actually a

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.520 
with the thing and it's actually a
plastified<00:02:08.729> chain-link<00:02:09.660> whereas<00:02:10.080> this<00:02:10.289> is<00:02:10.349> a

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
plastified chain-link whereas this is a

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.280 
plastified chain-link whereas this is a
galvanized<00:02:11.250> chain-link
