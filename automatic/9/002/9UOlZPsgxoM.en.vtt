00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.630
 let's wait to see cost has come on this new voice product the kibo 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:11.980
 I like it a lot because it is above all it is small and manageable there are not many times 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.320
 that tools like they are big wings that people cause them a certain 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.359
 rejection not because he believes that in are more complicated when even more 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.569
 little ones more by the way in quotes toy type 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:27.669
 people are encouraged to use them and this new level is tiny 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:29.199
 fix anywhere 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.519
 in what you can hook a lamp in the door 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:36.350
 and it's very easy to use if you do not have anything then you get scared and 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.839
 I think it's good to encourage a lot of people 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:41.839
 Do decorative work at home not to paint stripes 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.230
 those stripes look good if your horizontal and frontal perfect and 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.280
 vertical to vertical perfect if you are going to place paper it is okay to be 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.840
 right because there is nothing more awful than a badly done min work 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.590
 no chile was shown before we are going to do it well and as it is not difficult 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.360
 do them well and in the end it almost costs us the same 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.430
 we are going to do this penalty in shots to look great 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.939
 It also seems that this has been very thought to welcome this 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.070
 Well, nowadays I think that decoration 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.690
 it's a thing of men that of women formerly the DIY if it was more 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.140
 thing of men but all that me and I think that has been in the past not 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.080
 i anyone can use these simple tools then 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.660
 anyone can be encouraged to decorate by itself 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.560
 because yes we all have a personality we all have to have 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.500
 also a house because to us the houses can not be equal no 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.259
 We are each as we are and we like some good things because our 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.759
 house I think sometimes it's the reflection of it from us and we have to have 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.369
 custom houses 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:40.500
 what we like and for 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.700
 for that the important thing is that we work on it 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.520
 that nobody takes is decision is for us not 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.310
 steven when you are also we encourage ourselves to do things because when they go well 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.659
 in all of that she is very proud of her work, not 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.420
 i 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.220
 and people are encouraged to know a little thing and others get me out of the way but another 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.009
 i how beautiful is how rewarding is that 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.119
 that you have a good time while you do it and then that you can know 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.019
 we'll see in coward 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.750
 Well, I think I'm going to make the witness that, of course, we're going to see it 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:16.310
 pitino vote similar intendancies the clock that this one had placed the 12 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:17.980
 I liked the contestants a lot 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.739
 and that they are also in the anime to place it in a room at a 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.659
 room if we are so bad taste 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:24.289
 but keep in mind
