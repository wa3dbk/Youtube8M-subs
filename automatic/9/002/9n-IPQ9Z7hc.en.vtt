00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.120
 the place tor press there once 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.040
 Let's go back to the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.579
 standard screen where you land 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.000
 would 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.860
 First of all, it's here 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.809
 They first time an outline of what 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.789
 new releases are available for games 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.100
 new books because here you will find only 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.300
 times all the google products themselves and 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.300
 google has not only apps but 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.770
 also music or books and you can 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.940
 in the meantime also films 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.989
 we are now interested in the 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.550
 apps and here you end up in this one 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.000
 these tabs rider announced there 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.699
 above 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.470
 if you have one more right after 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.020
 second left then you have here 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.729
 look at a category overview now 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.270
 Let's see what else there is 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.090
 still announced that is one 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.549
 categorized selection of google itself 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.890
 then there is the top for a fee 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.979
 Free also the most successful app 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.890
 is the top paid apps new 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.420
 then the top free new and the 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.080
 trends I think that was one thing 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.170
 whole lot 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.369
 It always pays to rummage through 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.869
 but if you are looking for new ones 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.000
 apps is we are here now 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.829
 the standard stuff here, there is a 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.150
 selection and also a recommendation of 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.310
 there are also quite a time 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.229
 beautiful things in here worth calm 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.920
 a bit to rummage 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.229
 so also how do you find your own 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.630
 apps quite simply they go down here 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.180
 on the menu and get a choice and 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.280
 There you can choose my apps and here 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.500
 On the one hand, you will find all of them 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.140
 installed apps so that's all 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.659
 I did not include them 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.750
 now additionally installed here 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.489
 especially google search google books 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.140
 and so what you also extra installed 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.450
 once they go right 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.220
 they have all the apps they have ever 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.800
 and here are the ones with buy 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.330
 they bought them but they did 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.310
 currently not installed here 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.310
 So you always find them very fast 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.290
 again what else is there among the 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.120
 menus you can choose different accounts 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.080
 set up 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.540
 I currently have an account here 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.890
 I have installed several google 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.090
 I also used their play 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.400
 store can shop 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.570
 they just have to be warned because that 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.510
 then have different 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.220
 bank account for 21 on one 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.550
 children's menu, for example, this is how it works 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.920
 Not 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.840
 ok now warmer than last time again 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.330
 install an app to look like this 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.000
 how that works and there we go in the 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:56.700
 free apps in and missed 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.750
 now here's just the piano 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.730
 Here you get an overview 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.709
 first a few screenshots then the 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.840
 rating it gets downloaded 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.910
 and they go over 10 million times 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.560
 was downloaded so can not 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.000
 be so bad then you can 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.950
 even the latest ones evaluate themselves 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.680
 functions look at the description of the 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.590
 rating from the people and still the 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.570
 various comments he held it 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.680
 always purely pure sugar becomes 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.930
 to look in too 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.120
 Here you can always find things that 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.170
 the similar are so if you with the 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.150
 What you did not find completely 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.650
 then you should be satisfied 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.940
 scroll down as again 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.780
 back to his list immediately 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.420
 Take this and go up 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.390
 install here above and then said 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.400
 okay because introduce yourself times sharp so you ok 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.140
 You can install it but you can see it 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.239
 the authority to want that 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.670
 he wants to record audio 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:51.310
 query access the internet images 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.950
 can and on the memory card that it 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.750
 insofar first time okay so I say 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.370
 Download and accept that whole 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.019
 and if you're up here now 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.239
 notification bar looks see you 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.799
 aha there the app is straight 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:06.640
 she is still downloading 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:07.989
 instantly he tells me that 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.400
 it is installed so now you can 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.680
 get on here then you start the 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.290
 automatically we go again 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.630
 on the homescreen because that is too 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.160
 important for android in some makes 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.169
 the new on the homescreen if the 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.820
 things do not count in some 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.880
 This cellphone is now that way 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.590
 not power as well 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.840
 Now you would get the corresponding icon 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.010
 from the fdp degree installed on 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.920
 they'll go back to the screen 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.040
 try in their app overview 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.870
 here's the app out there she is 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.670
 hold with the finger pressed 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.800
 then the app overview disappears and 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.930
 you can just place it here 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.310
 if they have it somewhere else 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.870
 Just go to the edge 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.910
 then he automatically jumps to the 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.290
 next screen and you can do it yourself 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.270
 there bursts where they would like it 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.650
 Now look at the app also times to 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.650
 to see if it works 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:04.070
 works wonderfully so installed 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.140
 you look at apps I can only advise them 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.180
 They always look in regularly 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.770
 or above all, I would say 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.810
 would like that my mobile somehow that 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:15.110
 and do it here they have one 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:19.040
 very very good apps overview also in 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.420
 the categories here are always worthwhile 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.430
 Let's take a look if they say yes me 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.450
 looking for something about photography or for 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.220
 theme health 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.660
 Here you will always find and search 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.800
 she also diligently after I am keying 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.370
