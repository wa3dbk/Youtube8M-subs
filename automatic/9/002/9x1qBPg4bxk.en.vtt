00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.830
 this link 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.680
 let's start first let's 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.120
 remove the skin of the cod 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.140
 If you have a spine, it is also 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.140
 the moment of that jail 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.710
 we have to chop the cod you can 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.330
 do by hand cutting and if not then with 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.330
 any crusher that we have 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.600
 we will also put the garlic 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.100
 if you do it if you say it by hand 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.100
 you have 10,520 fifth 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.730
 to put Vatican we started in 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.080
 four pieces 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.080
 and so on that letter 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.200
 we also put parsley 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.750
 we cry 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.420
 we split the egg in a bowl 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.830
 we add the cod 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.420
 we are going to put the pine nuts 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.830
 and Spain 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.550
 i 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.320
 we have to get a thick mass 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.420
 we will add a little more developed 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.290
 and we will continue to knead 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.390
 Now let's check if the texture 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.569
 what we have is the right one to do 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.489
 the nails 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.269
 we will see a little with your hands always 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.269
 very clean 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.489
 and we will make a habit 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.590
 let's now fry the meatballs 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.960
 we will put a little olive oil in 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.820
 the pan 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.820
 in flour, the monads 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.590
 we will highlight the one that you are work and 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.590
 change 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.069
 we have the hot oil and we put 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.459
 back to the world we will fry them for all 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.459
 the sides 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.500
 as they are cooked we will put them 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.140
 on absorbent paper so that it is 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.790
 strong in all the oil left over let's 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.610
 to prepare a bite and so now 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.270
 we will have ready 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:00.440
 we got a couple of garlic 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:03.569
 cut into small pieces 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:11.730
 we are not going to have a pinch of salt 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:13.620
 so that they do not jump to chop we put the 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:19.900
 hazelnuts 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:22.020
 we also count when we already have the 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.830
 crushed hazelnuts we are going to cut 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.830
 also movie 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:40.199
 and we continue pounding until we get 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:40.199
 a thick paste we will reserve 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.880
 we put now a fire pot what 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.730
 we will incorporate the homemade tomato sauce 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.870
 that we had prepared we will hope that 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.560
 be hot 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.450
 ah 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.360
 when the sauce is already hot 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:05:00.770
 let's put a teaspoon of flour 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.770
 no teaspoon coming 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:08.419
 we will take a few turns to integrate 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.419
 well and a little bit is told 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.810
 and we put the water 

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:18.229
 and crumble the cube broth 

00:05:15.859 --> 00:05:21.319
 fish you can also put broth 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:25.070
 directly what little fish 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:27.500
 quantity so we solve it better 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:31.180
 we will tap so that it 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.180
 go integrating everything 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.669
 mix and 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.669
 to the world 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.349
 let's also throw the peas 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.000
 and the chopped 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.640
 we will lower the fire 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:02.969
 and we 'll let it cook, I think about 10 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.369
 minutes more or less 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:08.270
 if necessary we add a little 

00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:12.580
 more water 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.580
 we will catch him and let him do 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:18.370
 10 minutes have passed and now 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:21.550
 we have ready the cod meatballs 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:24.069
 above all you have to check that no 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:27.039
 stick because when you bring the flour 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:29.289
 you can paste more easily if before 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:31.800
 they already tell us that if necessary you go 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:34.470
 adding a little water 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:37.139
 we have not put salt because 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.550
 the broth moment already takes salt and 

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:41.280
 bring both knees being of 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:43.229
 cod already have enough good 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.360
 we have already less already we have ready for 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:47.699
 eat our plate of almonte and those of 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.520
 finished you have already seen that it is a plate 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:53.490
 It is super easy to prepare at home and if 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:56.509
 you are going to love it I hope that you 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.509
