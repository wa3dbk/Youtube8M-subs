00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.600
 There is no more traffic, no one deserves it. 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.770
 nobody deserve 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.539
 Calm down, breathe, boy, it's no use. 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.920
 stay stressed business elson business 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.920
 and relax 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:42.930
 If I had in the backlands 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.930
 none were my love 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:53.200
 and so far everything wet ground and rain 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.790
 we started at the beginning of the year with 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.710
 this free composition business 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.420
 we decided to extend the project and make 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.059
 addition a band that could 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.440
 presentations had material ready there 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.720
 emerged backwoods 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.700
 then we get back, we're leaving. 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.640
 stayed one more month working on that 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.290
 video and on that audio and then rolled a 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.140
 strong hangover yes stay everybody 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.270
 tired and half not knowing what to do 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.430
 From this, we decided to make a 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.750
 video of we will finish but without 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.750
 stop producing 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.770
 and color 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:31.229
 is to copy 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.500
 our pyre even so ours than 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.420
 It makes us create what is perhaps joined in 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.689
 This is what we started making music. 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.299
 together spontaneously and we saw that 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.170
 many cool things came so many 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.609
 wine things 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.719
 so we started recording those 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:48.689
 moments that we gathered to 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:51.360
 to make a sound in itapira was to enter the 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.479
 doors build them in and that's it 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.969
 that our song of the we will fear 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.179
 to locate her is like the incarnation so 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:03.149
 that this idea and while having 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:05.819
 It has been very massive to see the 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:09.119
 people with the backlands so was the 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:12.660
 Music that just did not know, there everybody. 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.900
 kind of different ages jep's liked 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.599
 one felt well and this is commendable 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.140
 feel part of it also at 10 and this 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.819
 almost insane mix in 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.370
 some point that I do not know which is still 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.239
 more that we are looking for and think 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.230
 that we are beginning to find 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.230
 From Rio 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.410
 nothing can see the world 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.989
 in relation to rhythm I think one thing 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.580
 that our band has different from the 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.870
 what we see there is the fact that 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.780
 to be a drummer right? 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.640
 so when the poulson drummer he 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.160
 fills the rite much easier because 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.840
 it's a lonely person and the battery is a 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.890
 instrument that has a legal scope 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.890
 and has a weight 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.239
 only we started in percussion a 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.760
 good job genes we wanted 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.650
 explore this and leave the maximum sound 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:11.430
 possible our musicality 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:13.870
 if we only have roots here and 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.390
 although not if it is not reduced to that 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.880
 Why did I kill you so short? 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.010
 quite a jazz 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.670
 So I think this ends up like this. 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:28.209
 na na na difference even this difference 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:32.160
 ends up being a well- played sound that 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.160
 Now, people, just like our sound. 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:45.480
 the value depends on the time 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:54.379
 I just know around here. 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:57.349
 the question of the letter to us and she has 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:04:01.069
 several points so the first is that it 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:05.180
 emerges from the spontaneous and 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:10.880
 then the letter is made on time 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:12.830
 on the eve aftere lr 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.500
 we do a rereading on top of it 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.150
 to see what we really want to talk about 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.489
 What do you mean, it all started 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.109
 that's the way we were talking together 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.720
 a lot of nonsense composing your 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.880
 music by Lucas and made it easy to 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.400
 a cool thing ago said in that pact 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.260
 if we can polish a bit 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.760
 make it a very interesting thing but 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.310
 this process is very nice that people 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.810
 learns not to judge and accept 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.610
 mistakes of others I think it's one thing 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.400
 very interesting that we have this way 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:43.490
 I 've never had it with many other people. 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.900
 because it's half the music 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.900
 feeling is not just technical 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:03.330
 Our music has a lot of fun, right? 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.970
 and this letter thing I think she 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.970
 comes much from the joke because the 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:11.250
 people like to play with words and 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.230
 It's very cool because poetry 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.070
 thales in this joke with the 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.230
 words 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:19.110
 So we play with these things. 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:22.020
 without bothering to fit in 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:25.800
 so I do not know if the poetry if the lyrics are 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:28.730
 is an end to it and I think this is a 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.730
 pretty rich thing 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.810
 We are going to focus a lot on these vacations. 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.820
 produce enough material because 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.530
 wanting or not we have seen that 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.980
 has had very massive support in 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:45.350
 internet and music she loses herself a lot 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.600
 easy then so entertainment one 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.820
 time you think it's legal and how you have it 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.280
 much information then passes to us 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.750
 always trying to produce, I think it's 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:06:00.550
 What we've been doing so far is 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:06:00.550
 that we have not satisfied so
