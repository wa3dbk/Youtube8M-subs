00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
you and I believe if they get destroyed

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.549 
you and I believe if they get destroyed
by<00:00:56.399> an<00:00:56.550> enemy<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:57.120> there<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.899> certain

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
by an enemy in there in the certain

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.549 
by an enemy in there in the certain
radius<00:00:58.859> they<00:00:59.460> would<00:00:59.670> get<00:00:59.820> taken<00:01:00.629> damage<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.260> I

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
radius they would get taken damage and I

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.170 
radius they would get taken damage and I
think<00:01:02.039> rooted<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.489> could<00:01:02.699> be<00:01:02.789> wrong<00:01:02.910> but<00:01:02.969> I

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
think rooted I could be wrong but I

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.240 
think rooted I could be wrong but I
think<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.809> think<00:01:04.049> they<00:01:04.140> just<00:01:04.260> take<00:01:04.920> some<00:01:05.070> minor

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
think I think they just take some minor

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.789 
think I think they just take some minor
damage<00:01:05.430> from<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:06.110> so<00:01:07.110> that's<00:01:07.439> what<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.680> know

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
damage from that so that's what I know

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.090 
damage from that so that's what I know

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.179 
issue so it's a pretty nice skill to see
and<00:01:49.890> finally<00:01:50.670> his<00:01:50.850> ulti<00:01:51.329> it's<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.950> looks<00:01:53.130> a

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
and finally his ulti it's a it looks a

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.910 
and finally his ulti it's a it looks a
little<00:01:53.280> blurry<00:01:53.549> but<00:01:53.659> it's<00:01:54.659> basically<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.710> gab

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
little blurry but it's basically the gab

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.380 
little blurry but it's basically the gab
ulti<00:01:56.280> except<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:56.700> doesn't<00:01:56.729> stun<00:01:57.149> it

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
ulti except that doesn't stun it

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.969 
ulti except that doesn't stun it
actually<00:01:57.899> knocks<00:01:58.170> up<00:01:58.380> people<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.829> also

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
actually knocks up people and also

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.520 
actually knocks up people and also
dealing<00:01:59.460> damage<00:01:59.700> it's<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.719> pretty<00:02:00.930> epic<00:02:01.110> ulti

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
dealing damage it's a pretty epic ulti

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.130 
dealing damage it's a pretty epic ulti
so<00:02:02.250> epic<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.670> got<00:02:02.939> pixelized<00:02:03.479> in<00:02:03.659> screenshot

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
so epic it got pixelized in screenshot

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.319 
so epic it got pixelized in screenshot
and<00:02:04.439> there's<00:02:04.890> another<00:02:05.040> little<00:02:05.579> screenshot<00:02:06.119> of

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
and there's another little screenshot of

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.479 
and there's another little screenshot of
the<00:02:06.869> pole<00:02:07.259> in<00:02:08.000> and<00:02:09.000> then<00:02:09.119> his<00:02:09.330> passive<00:02:10.489> every

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
the pole in and then his passive every

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.700 
the pole in and then his passive every
tenth<00:02:11.819> every<00:02:12.120> 12<00:02:12.390> seconds<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:12.810> think<00:02:12.900> it<00:02:13.050> is<00:02:13.170> his

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
tenth every 12 seconds I think it is his

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.860 
tenth every 12 seconds I think it is his
bar<00:02:13.950> fills<00:02:14.280> up<00:02:14.580> right<00:02:14.910> above<00:02:15.150> his<00:02:15.420> portrait

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
bar fills up right above his portrait

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.160 
bar fills up right above his portrait
there<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:17.000> if<00:02:18.000> an<00:02:18.180> enemy<00:02:18.300> basic<00:02:18.780> attacks<00:02:19.020> in

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
there and if an enemy basic attacks in

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.530 
there and if an enemy basic attacks in
Pete<00:02:19.350> gets<00:02:19.560> her<00:02:19.680> routed<00:02:20.070> I<00:02:20.190> believe<00:02:20.460> for<00:02:21.420> one

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
Pete gets her routed I believe for one

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.020 
Pete gets her routed I believe for one
second<00:02:22.020> and<00:02:22.110> oh<00:02:22.470> yeah<00:02:22.830> also<00:02:23.010> on<00:02:23.250> his<00:02:23.460> one<00:02:23.760> he

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
second and oh yeah also on his one he

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.090 
second and oh yeah also on his one he
could<00:02:24.180> throw<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.600> plant<00:02:24.930> on<00:02:25.200> an<00:02:25.470> enemy<00:02:25.590> target

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
could throw the plant on an enemy target

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.340 
could throw the plant on an enemy target
and<00:02:26.250> routing<00:02:26.550> them<00:02:26.760> for<00:02:27.300> one<00:02:27.630> second<00:02:28.110> so<00:02:28.200> it's

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
and routing them for one second so it's

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.560 
and routing them for one second so it's
an<00:02:28.410> instant<00:02:28.590> little<00:02:28.940> roots<00:02:29.940> so<00:02:30.210> that's<00:02:30.330> cool

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
an instant little roots so that's cool

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.720 
an instant little roots so that's cool
to<00:02:30.690> have<00:02:30.840> on<00:02:31.050> him<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.710> his<00:02:31.920> basic<00:02:32.340> attacks<00:02:32.400> are

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
to have on him and his basic attacks are

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.210 
to have on him and his basic attacks are
very<00:02:33.030> unique<00:02:33.390> instead<00:02:34.050> of<00:02:34.140> having<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.710> basic

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
very unique instead of having the basic

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.610 
very unique instead of having the basic
melee<00:02:35.640> basic<00:02:36.630> attacks<00:02:36.900> that<00:02:37.050> all<00:02:37.170> guardians

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
melee basic attacks that all guardians

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.010 
melee basic attacks that all guardians
have<00:02:37.740> he<00:02:38.040> actually<00:02:38.340> has<00:02:38.520> long<00:02:39.060> ranged<00:02:39.570> basic

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
have he actually has long ranged basic

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.680 
have he actually has long ranged basic
attacks<00:02:40.290> I<00:02:40.410> do<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.590> week<00:02:41.240> so<00:02:42.240> if<00:02:42.360> you<00:02:42.390> can<00:02:42.570> get

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
attacks I do a week so if you can get

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.540 
attacks I do a week so if you can get
like<00:02:42.780> Teleca<00:02:43.230> in<00:02:43.290> that<00:02:43.950> would<00:02:44.070> greatly

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
like Teleca in that would greatly

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.890 
like Teleca in that would greatly
increase<00:02:44.910> his<00:02:45.510> basic<00:02:46.170> attack<00:02:46.740> damage<00:02:47.010> so<00:02:47.900> if

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
increase his basic attack damage so if

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.840 
increase his basic attack damage so if
you're<00:02:49.110> laning<00:02:49.440> with<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.010> ADC<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.400> hunter

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
you're laning with the ADC and hunter

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.450 
you're laning with the ADC and hunter
with<00:02:51.840> your<00:02:51.990> hunter<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:52.380> can<00:02:52.590> actually<00:02:52.890> just

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
with your hunter you can actually just

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.220 
with your hunter you can actually just
do<00:02:53.820> some<00:02:54.000> basic<00:02:54.120> attacks<00:02:54.510> on<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.840> backline

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
do some basic attacks on the backline

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.400 
do some basic attacks on the backline
archer<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:55.920> it's<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:56.640> pretty<00:02:56.850> unique<00:02:57.080> new<00:02:58.080> basic

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410
