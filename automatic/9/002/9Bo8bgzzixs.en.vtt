this bit and this is the bit the 5/10
edge<00:02:49.810> mounting<00:02:50.530> bracket<00:02:50.950> this<00:02:51.310> is<00:02:51.370> a<00:02:51.549> bit

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
edge mounting bracket this is a bit

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.490 
edge mounting bracket this is a bit
you've<00:02:51.939> gotta<00:02:52.150> go<00:02:52.329> and<00:02:52.359> buy<00:02:52.629> from<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:53.019> shop

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.780 

and<00:03:25.930> that's<00:03:26.110> it<00:03:26.320> you<00:03:26.890> can<00:03:26.920> just<00:03:27.220> set<00:03:27.430> it<00:03:27.460> up<00:03:27.610> to

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
and that's it you can just set it up to

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.640 
and that's it you can just set it up to
whichever<00:03:28.030> angle<00:03:28.270> you<00:03:28.420> can<00:03:28.570> still<00:03:28.810> use<00:03:29.050> the

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
two here to go this way so you can tilt

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.510 
two here to go this way so you can tilt
the<00:03:33.790> camera<00:03:34.030> up<00:03:34.210> and<00:03:34.420> down<00:03:34.510> this<00:03:34.810> way<00:03:35.050> and<00:03:35.520> with

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
the camera up and down this way and with

this one here you can turn it whichever

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.180 
this one here you can turn it whichever
way<00:03:38.590> you<00:03:38.650> like<00:03:38.920> and<00:03:39.930> then<00:03:41.040> obviously<00:03:42.040> before

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
way you like and then obviously before

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.780 
way you like and then obviously before
you<00:03:42.430> clamp<00:03:42.700> it<00:03:42.790> down<00:03:42.880> on<00:03:43.210> the<00:03:43.390> on<00:03:44.350> the<00:03:44.710> bike<00:03:44.950> you

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
you clamp it down on the on the bike you

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.060 
you clamp it down on the on the bike you
just<00:03:46.080> adjust<00:03:47.080> this<00:03:47.230> to<00:03:47.440> wherever<00:03:47.740> you<00:03:47.830> want<00:03:47.980> it

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
just adjust this to wherever you want it

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.250 
just adjust this to wherever you want it
to<00:03:48.190> sit<00:03:48.370> her<00:03:49.240> mind<00:03:49.450> just<00:03:49.690> stays<00:03:49.870> pretty<00:03:50.110> much

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
to sit her mind just stays pretty much

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.010 
to sit her mind just stays pretty much
in<00:03:50.380> the<00:03:50.500> same<00:03:50.680> spot<00:03:51.100> all<00:03:51.850> the<00:03:52.420> time<00:03:52.630> so<00:03:52.840> I<00:03:52.900> don't

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
in the same spot all the time so I don't

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.480 
in the same spot all the time so I don't
move<00:03:53.350> any<00:03:53.590> of<00:03:53.770> this<00:03:53.920> I<00:03:54.959> also<00:03:56.130> got<00:03:57.130> just<00:03:57.370> a<00:03:57.459> bit

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
move any of this I also got just a bit

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.540 
move any of this I also got just a bit
of<00:03:57.730> foam<00:03:58.350> and<00:03:59.350> I've<00:03:59.620> just<00:03:59.800> glued<00:04:00.100> it<00:04:00.340> at<00:04:00.490> the

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
of foam and I've just glued it at the

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.670 
of foam and I've just glued it at the
front<00:04:00.700> there<00:04:01.030> says<00:04:01.930> it<00:04:02.050> doesn't<00:04:02.290> come<00:04:02.410> off<00:04:02.530> if

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
front there says it doesn't come off if

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.140 
front there says it doesn't come off if
you're<00:04:02.830> riding<00:04:03.010> because<00:04:03.340> sometimes<00:04:03.820> I<00:04:03.940> take

the camera off the bike when I'm riding
into<00:04:06.760> a<00:04:06.880> bit<00:04:07.030> of<00:04:07.060> a<00:04:07.150> pan<00:04:07.360> round<00:04:08.400> and<00:04:09.400> all<00:04:09.550> it

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
into a bit of a pan round and all it

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.670 
into a bit of a pan round and all it

does is I've found that this bracket

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.510 
does is I've found that this bracket
actually<00:04:12.370> vibrates<00:04:13.470> alright<00:04:14.470> so<00:04:14.739> having<00:04:15.310> that

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
actually vibrates alright so having that

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.789 
actually vibrates alright so having that
foam<00:04:15.880> underneath<00:04:16.269> it<00:04:16.690> just<00:04:16.930> stops<00:04:17.560> it

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
foam underneath it just stops it

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.610 
foam underneath it just stops it
rattling<00:04:18.310> the<00:04:18.850> two<00:04:19.060> hard<00:04:19.840> bits<00:04:20.079> of<00:04:20.200> plastic

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
rattling the two hard bits of plastic

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.490 
rattling the two hard bits of plastic
touching<00:04:20.919> each<00:04:21.190> other<00:04:21.459> so<00:04:22.000> that's<00:04:22.930> literally

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
touching each other so that's literally

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.409 
touching each other so that's literally
all<00:04:23.860> there<00:04:24.220> is<00:04:24.340> to<00:04:24.520> it<00:04:24.730> just<00:04:24.910> going<00:04:25.120> to<00:04:25.180> put<00:04:25.330> it
