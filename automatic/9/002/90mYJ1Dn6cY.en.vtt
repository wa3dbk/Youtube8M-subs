00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
we've come along with and how how it

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.140 
we've come along with and how how it
looks<00:00:28.410> basically<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:29.160> think<00:00:29.670> it's<00:00:29.760> pretty<00:00:29.880> cool

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
looks basically I think it's pretty cool

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.510 
looks basically I think it's pretty cool
we<00:00:30.359> built<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.689> few<00:00:31.560> slide<00:00:31.800> phones<00:00:32.040> in<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.279> past

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
we built a few slide phones in the past

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.850 
we built a few slide phones in the past
but<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.420> definitely<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.780> best<00:00:33.899> one<00:00:34.170> so

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
but this is definitely the best one so

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.440 
but this is definitely the best one so
what<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.100> can<00:00:35.219> do<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.340> have<00:00:35.610> my<00:00:35.730> map<00:00:35.940> out<00:00:36.149> here

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
what you can do I have my map out here

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.639 
what you can do I have my map out here
you<00:00:37.200> uh<00:00:37.230> find<00:00:38.129> your<00:00:38.340> coordinates<00:00:38.820> basically

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
you uh find your coordinates basically

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.500 
you uh find your coordinates basically
there's<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.710> website<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.940> can<00:00:41.969> type<00:00:42.300> in

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
there's a website that you can type in

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.090 
there's a website that you can type in
if<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.899> even<00:00:43.050> if<00:00:43.170> you're<00:00:43.290> playing<00:00:43.440> on<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.620> 360

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
if you even if you're playing on the 360

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.860 
if you even if you're playing on the 360
works<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.180> works<00:00:45.300> for<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.660> computer

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
works and it works for the computer

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.389 
works and it works for the computer
that's<00:00:46.140> what<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.440> was<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.920> game<00:00:47.070> frisky

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
that's what it was the game frisky

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.190 
that's what it was the game frisky
mountain<00:00:47.670> but<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.879> does<00:00:48.059> work<00:00:48.090> on<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.480> 360<00:00:48.930> you

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
mountain but it does work on the 360 you

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.869 
mountain but it does work on the 360 you
type<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:49.590> your<00:00:49.710> X<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.129> Y<00:00:50.160> or<00:00:50.219> Z<00:00:50.370> coordinates

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
type in your X and Y or Z coordinates

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.369 
type in your X and Y or Z coordinates
and<00:00:52.670> search<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:54.059> think<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.360> searched<00:00:54.600> 64<00:00:55.110> blocks

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
and search I think I searched 64 blocks

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.319 
and search I think I searched 64 blocks
around<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.430> will<00:00:56.550> show<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.760> clusters

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
around and it will show you clusters

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.720 
around and it will show you clusters
that<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.800> slime<00:00:58.800> can<00:00:59.129> spawn<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.640> then

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
that a slime can spawn and then

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.069 
that a slime can spawn and then
basically<00:00:59.940> just<00:01:00.329> build<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.629> room<00:01:00.809> out<00:01:00.899> like

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
basically just build a room out like

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.810 
basically just build a room out like
this<00:01:01.230> light<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.649> with<00:01:01.770> torches<00:01:02.070> or<00:01:02.340> glowstone

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
this light it with torches or glowstone

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.969 
this light it with torches or glowstone
how<00:01:03.030> we<00:01:03.090> have<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.629> make<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.379> block<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.890> if<00:01:04.920> you

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
how we have it make the block and if you

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.149 
how we have it make the block and if you
want<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.220> do<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.369> canal<00:01:05.640> system<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.750> get<00:01:06.930> the

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
want to do the canal system you get the

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.820 
want to do the canal system you get the
spawn<00:01:08.159> trapper<00:01:08.960> let's<00:01:09.960> be<00:01:10.260> look<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.799> up

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
spawn trapper let's be look that up

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.609 
spawn trapper let's be look that up
online<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.369> how<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.670> do<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.350> just<00:01:13.350> built
