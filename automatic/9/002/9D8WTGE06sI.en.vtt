me a bit longer to kind of get this one
sorted<00:00:48.210> out<00:00:48.270> because<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:49.219> you<00:00:50.219> know<00:00:50.340> you

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
sorted out because it is you know you

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.400 
sorted out because it is you know you
can<00:00:50.670> change<00:00:51.000> everything<00:00:51.180> whereas<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.780> 300<00:00:52.289> is

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
can change everything whereas the 300 is

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.709 
can change everything whereas the 300 is
very<00:00:52.590> much<00:00:52.739> plug<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.370> play<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:54.449> there<00:00:54.690> are

and the model I think on it on that one
is<00:02:13.660> I<00:02:14.660> believe<00:02:15.110> that's<00:02:15.590> just<00:02:15.890> a<00:02:16.040> fender

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
is I believe that's just a fender

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.130 
is I believe that's just a fender
defender<00:02:17.870> clean<00:02:18.140> sound<00:02:19.330> I'm<00:02:20.330> going<00:02:20.720> into

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
defender clean sound I'm going into

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.640 
defender clean sound I'm going into
probably<00:02:21.860> I<00:02:21.890> think<00:02:21.980> it's<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.190> Vox<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:24.410> Vox

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
probably I think it's the Vox the Vox

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.380 
probably I think it's the Vox the Vox
calves<00:02:25.300> and<00:02:26.300> then<00:02:26.570> into<00:02:27.520> into<00:02:28.520> the<00:02:28.550> doctors

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390

eight<00:02:29.920> heads<00:02:31.480> and<00:02:32.480> it's<00:02:32.690> in<00:02:33.230> terms<00:02:33.440> of<00:02:33.560> setting

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
eight heads and it's in terms of setting

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.060 
eight heads and it's in terms of setting
it's<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.460> combo<00:02:34.880> front<00:02:35.390> setting<00:02:35.950> which<00:02:36.950> you

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
it's the combo front setting which you

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.240 
it's the combo front setting which you
can<00:02:37.250> specify<00:02:38.380> so<00:02:39.380> yeah<00:02:39.590> perhaps<00:02:39.890> kind<00:02:40.070> of<00:02:40.160> the

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
can specify so yeah perhaps kind of the

00:02:40.250 --> 00:03:03.800 
can specify so yeah perhaps kind of the
basic<00:02:40.580> clean<00:02:40.760> sound<00:02:42.640> on<00:02:43.640> this<00:02:43.790> Bakura<00:02:44.360> sound

of<00:06:44.520> sound<00:06:44.760> as<00:06:44.940> 2<00:06:45.120> to<00:06:45.530> 2<00:06:46.530> amps<00:06:46.830> there<00:06:46.890> that<00:06:47.340> was

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 
of sound as 2 to 2 amps there that was

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.600 
of sound as 2 to 2 amps there that was
the<00:06:47.700> the<00:06:47.940> vox<00:06:48.120> ac30<00:06:48.690> as<00:06:49.170> the<00:06:49.350> edge<00:06:49.470> uses<00:06:50.720> /<00:06:51.720> 13

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:52.610 
the the vox ac30 as the edge uses / 13

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.250 
the the vox ac30 as the edge uses / 13
bit<00:06:53.610> of<00:06:53.700> compression<00:06:53.940> compression<00:06:54.510> to<00:06:55.110> delays

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:57.260

two-thirds<00:07:02.970> and<00:07:04.670> quarter<00:07:05.670> notes<00:07:05.850> all<00:07:06.060> over

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:06.150 
two-thirds and quarter notes all over

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.720 
two-thirds and quarter notes all over
for<00:07:06.420> what<00:07:06.720> have<00:07:06.870> you<00:07:06.990> took<00:07:07.860> a<00:07:07.980> lot<00:07:08.130> of<00:07:08.160> time<00:07:08.280> to

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:08.730 
for what have you took a lot of time to

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:10.190 
for what have you took a lot of time to
get<00:07:08.850> that<00:07:09.030> kind<00:07:09.300> of<00:07:09.360> get<00:07:09.450> close<00:07:09.630> to<00:07:09.840> sound<00:07:10.080> but

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:10.200 
get that kind of get close to sound but

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.690 
get that kind of get close to sound but
really<00:07:10.560> really<00:07:10.590> close<00:07:10.950> kind<00:07:11.250> of<00:07:11.340> sound<00:07:11.550> I

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:11.700 
really really close kind of sound I

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:17.140 
really really close kind of sound I
think<00:07:13.220> so<00:07:14.220> yeah<00:07:14.550> really<00:07:15.030> really<00:07:15.240> cool<00:07:15.630> devices

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:17.150 
think so yeah really really cool devices

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.400 
think so yeah really really cool devices
