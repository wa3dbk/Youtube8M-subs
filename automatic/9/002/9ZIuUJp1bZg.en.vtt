00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
probably have to replace it soon but

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.450 
probably have to replace it soon but
I'll<00:00:16.500> show<00:00:16.800> you<00:00:16.859> how<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.070> work<00:00:17.220> these<00:00:17.400> things

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
I'll show you how to work these things

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.760 
I'll show you how to work these things
they're<00:00:18.029> great<00:00:18.359> you<00:00:18.720> don't<00:00:18.869> have<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.230> use<00:00:19.439> the

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
they're great you don't have to use the

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.310 
they're great you don't have to use the
starter<00:00:20.430> fuel<00:00:20.580> or<00:00:20.789> anything<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.869> just<00:00:22.109> use

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
starter fuel or anything you just use

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.779 
starter fuel or anything you just use
the<00:00:22.590> chimney<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.130> works<00:00:23.970> like<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.330> charm

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
the chimney and works like a charm

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.570 
the chimney and works like a charm
so<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.880> way<00:00:27.000> these<00:00:27.330> work<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.189> put<00:00:29.460> in

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
so the way these work is that you put in

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.299 
so the way these work is that you put in
your<00:00:29.670> coals<00:00:29.939> here<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:31.289> put<00:00:31.500> newspaper<00:00:32.070> or

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
your coals here you put newspaper or

and<00:00:34.380> just<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.219> heat<00:00:35.430> generated<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.300> keep<00:00:36.570> the

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
and just the heat generated to keep the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.310 
and just the heat generated to keep the
coals<00:00:37.460> burning<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.790> heated<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.719> continuing

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
coals burning and heated and continuing

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.780 

and<00:02:35.519> the<00:02:36.030> paper<00:02:36.299> will<00:02:36.659> start<00:02:37.099> heating<00:02:38.099> up<00:02:38.400> the

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
and the paper will start heating up the

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.440 
and the paper will start heating up the
coals<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:40.849> it'll<00:02:41.849> generate<00:02:42.209> this<00:02:44.239> the<00:02:45.239> heat

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
coals and it'll generate this the heat

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.930 
coals and it'll generate this the heat
will<00:02:45.599> rise<00:02:45.810> heating<00:02:46.709> up<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:47.010> upper<00:02:47.340> coals<00:02:47.580> and

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
will rise heating up the upper coals and

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.199 
will rise heating up the upper coals and
it'll<00:02:48.750> just<00:02:49.019> kind<00:02:49.650> of<00:02:49.739> have<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.209> perpetual

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
it'll just kind of have a perpetual

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.100 
it'll just kind of have a perpetual
heating<00:02:52.110> process<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:52.829> without<00:02:53.819> any<00:02:54.120> starter

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
heating process and without any starter

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.039 
heating process and without any starter
fluid<00:02:55.260> they<00:02:56.190> should<00:02:56.489> in<00:02:57.000> about<00:02:57.269> 20<00:02:57.870> minutes

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
fluid they should in about 20 minutes

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.819 
fluid they should in about 20 minutes
they<00:02:58.349> should<00:02:58.379> be<00:02:58.650> really<00:02:59.190> really<00:02:59.459> hot<00:02:59.640> so<00:03:00.829> the

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
they should be really really hot so the

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.500 
they should be really really hot so the
newspaper<00:03:02.069> is<00:03:02.400> almost<00:03:02.670> completely<00:03:03.090> burnt

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
newspaper is almost completely burnt

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.800 
newspaper is almost completely burnt
away<00:03:03.799> but<00:03:04.799> is<00:03:05.010> smoking<00:03:05.940> nicely<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.659> it's

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
away but is smoking nicely and it's

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.750 
away but is smoking nicely and it's
starting<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.590> generate<00:03:07.769> quite<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:08.310> bit<00:03:08.519> of<00:03:08.609> heat

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
starting to generate quite a bit of heat

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.289 
starting to generate quite a bit of heat
and<00:03:08.940> it'll<00:03:09.569> just<00:03:09.720> get<00:03:09.840> hotter<00:03:10.109> with<00:03:10.379> time<00:03:10.620> and

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
and it'll just get hotter with time and

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.330 
and it'll just get hotter with time and
we'll<00:03:12.299> see<00:03:12.599> it<00:03:12.720> in<00:03:12.840> a<00:03:12.900> few<00:03:13.079> minutes<00:03:13.200> and<00:03:13.500> here

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
we'll see it in a few minutes and here

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.449 
we'll see it in a few minutes and here
it<00:03:14.459> is<00:03:14.489> burning<00:03:15.180> very<00:03:15.359> nicely<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.980> coals<00:03:17.250> on

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
it is burning very nicely the coals on

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.789 
it is burning very nicely the coals on
the<00:03:17.549> bottom<00:03:17.579> are<00:03:18.090> quite<00:03:18.450> white<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:19.319> the<00:03:19.620> top

ones<00:03:20.040> are<00:03:20.220> starting<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.549> get<00:03:20.640> there<00:03:20.849> probably

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
ones are starting to get there probably

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.839 
ones are starting to get there probably
another<00:03:22.049> five<00:03:23.040> or<00:03:23.220> ten<00:03:23.340> more<00:03:23.459> minutes<00:03:23.609> and
