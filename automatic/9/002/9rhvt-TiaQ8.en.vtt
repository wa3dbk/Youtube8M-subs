00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
Weasley take the wand oh I'm not too

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.539

fond<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.090> this<00:01:00.210> wand<00:01:00.480> uh<00:01:01.640> not<00:01:02.640> my<00:01:02.820> favorite<00:01:03.300> I

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
fond of this wand uh not my favorite I

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.160 
fond of this wand uh not my favorite I
guess<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.729> handle<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.090> cool<00:01:06.240> but<00:01:06.450> it's<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:06.869> big

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
guess the handle is cool but it's so big

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.740 
guess the handle is cool but it's so big
I<00:01:07.530> mean<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.670> don't<00:01:08.880> like<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.210> at<00:01:09.360> all

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
I mean I don't like that at all

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.380 
I mean I don't like that at all
like<00:01:10.110> here<00:01:10.590> if<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.860> put<00:01:11.010> my<00:01:11.130> bottom<00:01:11.490> finger<00:01:11.820> like

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
like here if I put my bottom finger like

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.770 
like here if I put my bottom finger like
I<00:01:12.570> hold<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.140> fist

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
I hold it in the fist

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.410 
I hold it in the fist
it's<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.990> handles<00:01:16.409> huge

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
it's the handles huge

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.090 
it's the handles huge
there's<00:01:18.420> no<00:01:18.570> way<00:01:18.720> Arthur<00:01:19.110> has<00:01:19.290> hands<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.860> big

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
there's no way Arthur has hands that big

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.630 
there's no way Arthur has hands that big
I<00:01:20.390> mean<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.450> guess<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.840> handle<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.170> pretty<00:01:22.350> cool

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
I mean I guess the handle is pretty cool

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.490 
I mean I guess the handle is pretty cool
it<00:01:23.640> just<00:01:23.909> twirls<00:01:24.600> all<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.869> way<00:01:24.960> up<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.350> it's

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
it just twirls all the way up and it's

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.770 
it just twirls all the way up and it's
got<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:25.740> cool<00:01:26.040> texture<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.729> show<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.659> the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
got this cool texture and show you the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.780 
got this cool texture and show you the
back<00:01:27.930> first<00:01:28.290> right<00:01:28.710> there<00:01:28.970> then<00:01:29.970> we<00:01:30.119> just

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
back first right there then we just

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.880 
back first right there then we just
follow<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:33.150> up

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.610 

pretty<00:01:38.890> cool<00:01:39.100> text<00:01:39.460> ring<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.930> comes<00:01:41.170> to<00:01:41.350> an<00:01:41.440> end

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
pretty cool text ring it comes to an end

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.880 
pretty cool text ring it comes to an end
right<00:01:41.830> there<00:01:42.070> there's<00:01:42.880> a<00:01:43.000> little<00:01:43.090> knob<00:01:43.890> what

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
right there there's a little knob what

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.140 
right there there's a little knob what
can<00:01:45.070> I<00:01:45.130> cut<00:01:45.369> out<00:01:45.490> right<00:01:45.670> there<00:01:46.800> and<00:01:47.800> then<00:01:48.150> it

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
can I cut out right there and then it

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.770 
can I cut out right there and then it
goes<00:01:49.330> to<00:01:49.390> a<00:01:49.570> really<00:01:50.080> kind<00:01:50.260> of<00:01:50.409> narrow<00:01:50.800> shaft

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
goes to a really kind of narrow shaft

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.969 
goes to a really kind of narrow shaft
which<00:01:52.780> I<00:01:52.930> don't<00:01:53.080> like<00:01:53.229> it<00:01:53.380> just<00:01:53.500> kind<00:01:53.710> of<00:01:53.770> goes

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
which I don't like it just kind of goes

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.240 
which I don't like it just kind of goes
I<00:01:54.190> think<00:01:54.369> it<00:01:54.460> should<00:01:54.610> kind<00:01:54.850> of<00:01:55.290> like<00:01:56.290> get<00:01:56.860> be

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
I think it should kind of like get be

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.730 
I think it should kind of like get be
big<00:01:57.460> here<00:01:57.820> and<00:01:57.970> then<00:01:58.090> kind<00:01:58.420> of<00:01:58.570> slowly<00:01:59.200> get<00:01:59.650> it

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
big here and then kind of slowly get it

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.890 
big here and then kind of slowly get it
small<00:02:00.009> I<00:02:00.250> think<00:02:00.460> that<00:02:00.700> would<00:02:00.820> look<00:02:00.850> cooler<00:02:01.240> but

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
small I think that would look cooler but

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.899 
small I think that would look cooler but
I<00:02:02.259> pointed<00:02:02.830> this<00:02:02.890> out<00:02:03.130> oh<00:02:03.250> here's<00:02:03.550> the<00:02:03.670> trade

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
I pointed this out oh here's the trade

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.780 
I pointed this out oh here's the trade

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.620 
you hold it the handle is just too big I
don't<00:02:33.490> know<00:02:33.670> why<00:02:33.820> they<00:02:34.000> wanted<00:02:34.240> to<00:02:34.300> make<00:02:34.480> it

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
don't know why they wanted to make it

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.140 
don't know why they wanted to make it
that<00:02:34.780> big

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.460 

I<00:02:40.980> think<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.220> shaft<00:02:43.180> is<00:02:43.300> a<00:02:43.330> little<00:02:43.630> crooked<00:02:43.960> as

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
I think the shaft is a little crooked as

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.500 
I think the shaft is a little crooked as
well<00:02:44.800> I<00:02:47.820> haven't<00:02:48.820> really<00:02:49.000> checked<00:02:49.209> what<00:02:49.450> it

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
well I haven't really checked what it

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.060 
well I haven't really checked what it
looks<00:02:49.660> like<00:02:49.780> it's<00:02:49.959> traced<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.410> one<00:02:50.590> side<00:02:50.860> and<00:02:51.010> I

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
looks like it's traced to one side and I

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.070 
looks like it's traced to one side and I
don't<00:02:51.100> think<00:02:51.280> it's<00:02:51.490> supposed<00:02:51.670> to

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
don't think it's supposed to

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.330 
don't think it's supposed to
