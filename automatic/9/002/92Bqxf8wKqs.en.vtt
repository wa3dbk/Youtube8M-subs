00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.349
 heading personal experience hello let's 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.490
 agree that the atmosphere at the photo shoot 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.190
 very important 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.400
 mood photographer mood models 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.350
 just the surrounding aura and you like 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.150
 one of the most important organizers 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.000
 this event 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.670
 there is a direct interest to all 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.920
 there are pleasant memories that all 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.619
 then he talked so cool with him 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.510
 work so well was so fun 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.870
 the setting we had so good time 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.390
 when good atmosphere is always good 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.579
 result but almost always in this 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.329
 depends on you and on the model but still 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.579
 let's talk about one of the elements 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.270
 good atmosphere is just one 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.820
 element 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.890
 perhaps this is not worth much 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.440
 bother it maybe 5 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.780
 percent or 10 percent of the whole 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.350
 the atmosphere for today we talk about 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.390
 music there are probably three categories of people 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.180
 the first is like playing a procession 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.540
 doesn't turn on the radio and maybe he's for 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.250
 is right but it is also an option, there are those 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.799
 who connect your mobile 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.710
 phone and listen there is some kind of compilation 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.560
 also there are probably those who 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.049
 pick up music to the tastes of the client they 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.659
 ask what you like and include 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.570
 music that customers like all three 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.729
 the options are good all three options 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:33.210
 work for me personally optimal 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.640
 the choice is my own choice 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.220
 yes songs I work as a DJ for me 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.470
 tightly connected work with music i'm not 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.930
 I say that it is worth so much 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.630
 bother but still we watch 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.850
 we remove children for children is better to take 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.250
 some fun childish playful 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.380
 music is the main thing of course so that she is nobody 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.140
 not annoying not annoying not 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.390
 photographer and not annoyed models but in 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.030
 generally assume that children's photo session 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.860
 let it be to this fun dynamic 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.740
 music for children to dance so as not to 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.619
 moved so they didn't want to fall asleep 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.530
 can mom ask in advance what is she 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.670
 listen it's okay if the photo shoot in 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.260
 love-story style 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.140
 maybe worth putting something 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.510
 romantic on let's shoot with such 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.819
 mood and then change the music to 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.180
 more dynamic if you need more 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.910
 movement if the pair is more lively that's all 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.739
 so varied from me personally in 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.190
 the studio is such a daddy about 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.560
 It costs 200 rubles per se and here 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.900
 a lot of different disks are there now 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.480
 whole there is a direct warehouse they are all 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.000
 scratched but there are different styles of music 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.370
 this place rock and roll is and let's say 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.830
 something calm and slow to eat and 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.319
 club music why not club music 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.260
 also sets the rhythm there boom boom nice 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:55.440
 well that's good i mean i'm not talking 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.750
 that it costs a lot of time right 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.959
 spend but just do let's say 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.659
 selection of 10 discs or playlists there 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.459
 on the phone ask customers have they 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.050
 quite wooden let's say a man 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.629
 that he likes a friend then you need to put 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.340
 to you Philip Kirkorov and to you under 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:14.720
 he was photographed if he told you 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.890
 help of course let's say for me 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.200
 photo session for some let's say 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.050
 the repertoire of Olya radio luck will be very 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.110
 fatigueless but for a client i think i 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:28.019
 I can take such a step if he will 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.810
 Well, well, if I get bored, I switch 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.299
 usually certainly no customer no photographer no 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.450
 I ask that is, they are there radio includes 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:39.120
 and she plays but agree it seems to me 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.680
 it's not very interesting to shoot what is 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.879
 tender and pleasant under and say 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.340
 super dance tracks 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:49.769
 There with a radio, let's say rooms are a record or 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.200
 europe plus or vice versa playing there 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:55.560
 you have a very sad photo session 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.560
 that is not worth this little moment 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.819
 I straightforwardly overlook 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.069
 pass one evening 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.290
 invest in this daddy 500 rubles that is 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.390
 the folder itself costs 200 rubles to drive 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.310
 not scratched well and the wheels themselves are 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.490
 down there five rubles a nurse cost 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.420
 either 7 generally recorded there and 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:17.180
 3 step pieces do not know 10-15 piled here in 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.070
 daddy yourself and just thrown in a photo bag 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.590
 either left in the studio in my studio 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.510
 lies near the tape recorder my folder but there 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.690
 my very old discs are given to a woman 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.430
 wrote down tell the truth but in general it 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.740
 works that is, I love to work 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.890
 let's say under one music if creative 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.960
 a profession then i pick myself if 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:39.290
 photo shoot for clients then I them 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.700
 I ask the moment controversial here everything 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.850
 rests your taste 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.560
 Your desire to do this, I recommend 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.680
 just at least pay attention to it 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.350
 think about it because it's true 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.970
 many don't think about it personally 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.160
 for me again if you have music 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.970
 you can not care to work decision 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.070
 this thing and purely individual okay in 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.690
 anyways 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:05.410
 Best regards 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.410
 attention goodbye
