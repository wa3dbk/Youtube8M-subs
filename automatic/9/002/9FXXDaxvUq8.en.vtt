00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 There are other technologies for 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.150
 implement the tactile systems every 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.460
 one based on different phenomena and with 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.860
 different applications the systems 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.590
 the most important touch are the screen 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.299
 infrared touch the system more 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.640
 old and easy to understand is the 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.740
 above mentioned system at the edges 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.840
 of the screen in the housing of it 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.000
 There are some transmitters and receivers of 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.250
 infrared on one side of the screen 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.949
 are the issuers and the opposite the 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.349
 receptors when you press with your finger or with 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.570
 any object on the screen 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:36.210
 we interrupted a vertical infrared and 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.340
 another horizontal the computer detects what 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.649
 rays have been interrupted knows of 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.460
 this mode where we have pressed and acts on 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.920
 consequence another on the touch screen 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.960
 resistive this is formed by two 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.120
 layers of transparent conductive material 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.129
 with a certain resistance to 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.739
 electric current and with a separation 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.930
 between the two layers when they touch each 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.910
 outer layer contact occurs 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.309
 between the two conductive layers a 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.439
 electronic system detects the contact 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.020
 and measuring the resistance can calculate 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.359
 the point of contact 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.829
 the last of the most important in the 

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:13.679
 touch screen acoustic wave 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:15.329
 surface through the surface 

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:17.939
 of the crystal two waves are transmitted 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:19.049
 acoustic inaudible for man a 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.759
 of the waves is transmitted 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.549
 horizontally and the other vertically 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.200
 each wave is scattered on the surface 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.210
 of the screen bouncing around 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.280
 acoustic reflectors 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.619
 but why are so important 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.600
 touch screens because it is form 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:38.050
 of other technologies such as 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.720
 tablet pc there are many who assure that the 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.970
 future is in the tablet pc that hybrid 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.040
 halfway between the laptop and the 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.560
 electronic agenda that allow 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.290
 interact with him through a pencil 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.450
 optical and a touch screen between them 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.399
 begins to highlight the convertibles that 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.680
 they are laptops that have the keyboard 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:00.180
 and mouse but that can be used as 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.180
 tablet pc turning the 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.760
 this mode of laptop computers 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.320
 It has been a significant advance in 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.660
 application of studies in 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.150
 computational linguistics 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.100
 the operating system that these use 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.650
 devices is an evolution of 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.690
 windows xp professional optimized for 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.670
 work with mobile processors that 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.050
 consume less energy 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.060
 the special software that we 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.520
 they provide the operating system us 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.800
 allows you to perform manual writing take 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.040
 freehand notes and draw on the 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.490
 screen so it's useful to do jobs 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.490
 field 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.920
 all this undoubtedly leads to a 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.020
 immersion method in the integration of 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.880
 the tics in the teaching processes and 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.260
 learning propitiating the 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.510
 transformation of materials 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.330
 traditional methodologies and roles 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.890
 a much more logical and natural way the 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.140
 new society the technology of the 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.210
 information and communication is us 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.810
 moving towards a new paradigm of 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.580
 teaching the tablet pc provides the 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:05.340
 technological basis on which 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.340
 sustains the so-called school of the future
