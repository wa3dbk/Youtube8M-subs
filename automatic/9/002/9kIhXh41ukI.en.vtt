difficult it is difficult and those are
the<00:03:34.890> things<00:03:35.100> that<00:03:35.190> we<00:03:35.370> are<00:03:35.790> seeking<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.180> change

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
the things that we are seeking to change

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.140 
the things that we are seeking to change
we're<00:03:37.290> changing<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.190> paradigm<00:03:38.519> that<00:03:38.880> we<00:03:39.030> are

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
we're changing the paradigm that we are

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.090 
we're changing the paradigm that we are
not<00:03:39.269> the<00:03:39.450> problem<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:40.290> problem<00:03:40.590> is<00:03:40.799> that<00:03:40.860> our

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
not the problem the problem is that our

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.860 
not the problem the problem is that our
world<00:03:41.310> doesn't<00:03:41.610> accommodate<00:03:41.910> a<00:03:42.150> diversity<00:03:42.720> of

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.720 
world doesn't accommodate a diversity of
bodies<00:03:43.230> so<00:03:43.440> that's<00:03:43.980> what<00:03:44.190> we<00:03:44.280> need<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:44.519> change

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
bodies so that's what we need to change

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.550 
bodies so that's what we need to change
not<00:03:44.970> so<00:03:45.209> much<00:03:45.390> changing<00:03:45.840> who<00:03:45.989> we<00:03:46.019> are<00:03:46.320> and

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
not so much changing who we are and

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.310 
not so much changing who we are and
changing<00:03:47.280> our<00:03:47.430> body<00:03:47.700> but<00:03:48.420> instead<00:03:48.780> changing

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
changing our body but instead changing

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.070 
changing our body but instead changing

okay with you to to exercise more maybe
lose<00:04:01.260> some<00:04:01.440> weight<00:04:01.470> or<00:04:01.799> do<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.070> have<00:04:02.250> no

desire<00:04:02.700> to<00:04:02.730> I<00:04:03.180> think<00:04:03.750> that<00:04:03.959> exercising<00:04:04.799> is

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
desire to I think that exercising is

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.789 
desire to I think that exercising is
good<00:04:05.160> activity<00:04:05.910> is<00:04:06.030> good<00:04:06.299> my<00:04:06.989> thought<00:04:07.290> is<00:04:07.470> that

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
good activity is good my thought is that

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.009 
good activity is good my thought is that
weight<00:04:08.370> needs<00:04:08.580> to<00:04:08.760> be<00:04:08.880> set<00:04:09.060> aside<00:04:09.180> and<00:04:09.660> that

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
weight needs to be set aside and that

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.840 
weight needs to be set aside and that
regardless<00:04:10.170> if<00:04:10.650> I<00:04:10.769> gain<00:04:11.040> lose<00:04:11.280> or<00:04:11.519> stay<00:04:11.700> the

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
regardless if I gain lose or stay the

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.850 
regardless if I gain lose or stay the
same<00:04:12.030> that's<00:04:12.360> not<00:04:12.630> important<00:04:13.110> to<00:04:13.200> me<00:04:13.230> what's

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
same that's not important to me what's

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.740 
same that's not important to me what's
important<00:04:14.340> to<00:04:14.400> me<00:04:14.519> is<00:04:14.610> that<00:04:14.640> I'm<00:04:14.910> getting<00:04:15.299> the

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
important to me is that I'm getting the

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.659 
important to me is that I'm getting the
nourishment<00:04:16.140> the<00:04:16.620> nutrition<00:04:17.130> the<00:04:17.310> sleep<00:04:17.640> the

activity<00:04:18.419> that<00:04:18.570> my<00:04:18.660> body<00:04:18.870> needs<00:04:19.200> and<00:04:19.530> I<00:04:19.590> think

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
activity that my body needs and I think

activity that my body needs and I think
there's<00:04:20.040> an<00:04:20.130> important<00:04:20.579> assumption<00:04:20.910> there

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
there's an important assumption there

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.390 
there's an important assumption there
right<00:04:21.479> that<00:04:21.720> you<00:04:21.840> said<00:04:22.160> gain<00:04:23.160> a<00:04:23.190> little

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
right that you said gain a little

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.130 
right that you said gain a little
activity<00:04:23.970> and<00:04:24.090> lose<00:04:24.240> a<00:04:24.270> little<00:04:24.450> weight<00:04:24.570> for

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
activity and lose a little weight for

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.770 
activity and lose a little weight for
example<00:04:25.590> I<00:04:25.620> did<00:04:26.220> a<00:04:26.250> marathon<00:04:26.700> right<00:04:27.120> 20

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780

zero<00:04:31.440> zero<00:04:31.889> I<00:04:32.280> got<00:04:33.170> much<00:04:34.170> better<00:04:34.440> shape<00:04:34.710> I<00:04:34.920> was

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
zero zero I got much better shape I was

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.680 
zero zero I got much better shape I was
much<00:04:35.250> healthier<00:04:35.700> but<00:04:35.910> I<00:04:35.940> didn't<00:04:36.300> lose<00:04:36.450> weight

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
much healthier but I didn't lose weight

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.500 
much healthier but I didn't lose weight
and<00:04:36.960> how<00:04:37.470> sad<00:04:37.860> like<00:04:38.160> if<00:04:38.310> I<00:04:38.430> had<00:04:38.669> tied<00:04:38.940> the<00:04:38.970> idea

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
and how sad like if I had tied the idea

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.379 
and how sad like if I had tied the idea
of<00:04:39.720> success<00:04:40.220> to<00:04:41.220> the<00:04:41.340> idea<00:04:41.580> of<00:04:41.669> weight<00:04:41.910> loss<00:04:42.150> I

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
of success to the idea of weight loss I

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:44.720 
of success to the idea of weight loss I
would<00:04:42.600> have<00:04:42.690> gone<00:04:42.980> 26.2<00:04:43.980> miles<00:04:44.220> in<00:04:44.430> one<00:04:44.580> day

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
would have gone 26.2 miles in one day

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.250 
would have gone 26.2 miles in one day
without<00:04:44.910> dying<00:04:45.419> right

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
without dying right

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.930 
without dying right
and<00:04:46.530> I<00:04:46.740> still<00:04:47.070> would<00:04:47.250> feel<00:04:47.430> like<00:04:47.580> a<00:04:47.639> failure

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
and I still would feel like a failure

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.780 
and I still would feel like a failure
and<00:04:48.330> that<00:04:48.540> would<00:04:48.660> be<00:04:48.810> so<00:04:49.050> sad<00:04:49.380> we<00:04:50.340> really<00:04:50.610> want

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
and that would be so sad we really want

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.879 
and that would be so sad we really want
to<00:04:50.850> decouple<00:04:51.330> the<00:04:51.690> ideas<00:04:52.110> of<00:04:52.139> health<00:04:52.620> and

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
to decouple the ideas of health and

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:54.710 
to decouple the ideas of health and
doing<00:04:53.160> healthy<00:04:53.520> things<00:04:53.550> from<00:04:54.510> weight<00:04:54.690> loss

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720
