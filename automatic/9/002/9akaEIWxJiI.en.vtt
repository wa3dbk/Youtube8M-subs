above<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.000> you're<00:01:36.180> just<00:01:36.390> making<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.930> huge<00:01:37.229> file

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
above it you're just making a huge file

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.850 
above it you're just making a huge file
and<00:01:38.479> because<00:01:39.479> youtube<00:01:39.930> does<00:01:40.140> not<00:01:40.350> accept

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
and because youtube does not accept

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.840 
and because youtube does not accept
anything<00:01:41.540> like<00:01:42.540> they<00:01:42.720> do<00:01:42.930> except<00:01:43.369> about<00:01:44.369> 30

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
anything like they do except about 30

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.910 
anything like they do except about 30
frames<00:01:45.060> per<00:01:45.270> second<00:01:45.780> but<00:01:45.960> they<00:01:46.710> will<00:01:46.890> just

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
frames per second but they will just

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.990 
frames per second but they will just
make<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.640> through<00:01:48.360> 30<00:01:48.630> frames<00:01:48.960> per<00:01:49.020> second

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
make it through 30 frames per second

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.359 
make it through 30 frames per second
there's<00:01:51.000> just<00:01:51.180> waste<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.780> time<00:01:52.130> you<00:01:53.130> want<00:01:53.280> to

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
there's just waste of time you want to

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.580 
there's just waste of time you want to
leave<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.700> off<00:01:53.939> obviously<00:01:54.299> unless<00:01:54.899> it's

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
leave that off obviously unless it's

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.039 
leave that off obviously unless it's
like<00:01:55.799> 3d<00:01:57.500> and<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.829> wouldn't<00:01:59.100> put<00:01:59.340> the<00:02:00.049> compas

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
like 3d and you wouldn't put the compas

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.410 
like 3d and you wouldn't put the compas
a<00:02:01.790> cam

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
a cam

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.690 
a cam
on<00:02:03.680> one<00:02:06.020> you<00:02:07.020> look<00:02:07.200> at<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.409> pixel<00:02:07.890> format<00:02:08.459> on

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
on one you look at the pixel format on

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.090 
on one you look at the pixel format on
32-bit<00:02:09.600> floating-point<00:02:10.140> full<00:02:10.709> range<00:02:12.740> and<00:02:13.740> you

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
32-bit floating-point full range and you

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.120 
32-bit floating-point full range and you
want<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.459> motion<00:02:14.700> blur<00:02:15.060> type<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:16.110> be<00:02:16.260> Gaussian

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
want the motion blur type to be Gaussian

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.680 
want the motion blur type to be Gaussian
and<00:02:18.440> full<00:02:19.440> resolution<00:02:20.070> written<00:02:20.640> equality<00:02:21.209> you

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
and full resolution written equality you

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.100 
and full resolution written equality you
want<00:02:21.930> best<00:02:23.209> leave<00:02:24.209> these<00:02:24.630> two<00:02:24.840> boxes

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
want best leave these two boxes

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.630 
want best leave these two boxes
unchecked<00:02:25.500> go<00:02:26.490> to<00:02:26.550> audio<00:02:28.070> make<00:02:29.070> this<00:02:29.310> best<00:02:29.700> I

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
unchecked go to audio make this best I

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.630 
unchecked go to audio make this best I
think<00:02:32.640> yeah<00:02:33.209> just<00:02:33.660> leave<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.050> rest<00:02:35.000> and<00:02:37.610> yeah

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
think yeah just leave the rest and yeah

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.070 
think yeah just leave the rest and yeah
let's<00:02:38.940> then<00:02:39.239> you<00:02:40.020> click<00:02:40.500> OK<00:02:41.450> now<00:02:42.450> when<00:02:42.989> you
