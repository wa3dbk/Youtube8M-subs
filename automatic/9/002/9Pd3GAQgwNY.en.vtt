00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.620 
pieces for everything else but that just
looks<00:02:17.530> crazy<00:02:17.739> to<00:02:18.100> me<00:02:18.220> because<00:02:18.610> why<00:02:19.450> would<00:02:19.600> I

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
looks crazy to me because why would I

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.390 
looks crazy to me because why would I
want<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:19.930> use<00:02:20.200> this<00:02:20.380> guy<00:02:20.590> on<00:02:20.739> a<00:02:20.770> base<00:02:21.040> when<00:02:21.280> he

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
want to use this guy on a base when he

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.430 
want to use this guy on a base when he
looks<00:02:21.610> just<00:02:21.670> fine<00:02:22.030> without<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.540> base<00:02:22.720> now<00:02:23.380> you

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
looks just fine without the base now you

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.979 
looks just fine without the base now you
can<00:02:23.799> in<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.040> advanced<00:02:24.400> game<00:02:24.730> add<00:02:25.090> bases<00:02:25.900> to

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
can in the advanced game add bases to

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.509 
can in the advanced game add bases to
some<00:02:26.170> of<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.320> cats<00:02:26.530> some<00:02:26.830> of<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.040> things<00:02:27.370> of

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
some of the cats some of the things of

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.210 
some of the cats some of the things of
your<00:02:27.580> choice<00:02:28.060> which<00:02:28.420> makes<00:02:28.750> them<00:02:28.989> doubly<00:02:29.950> hard

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
your choice which makes them doubly hard

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.270 
your choice which makes them doubly hard
to<00:02:30.519> hit<00:02:30.850> now<00:02:31.750> I<00:02:32.049> hope<00:02:32.320> I<00:02:32.500> have<00:02:32.680> this<00:02:32.830> correct

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
to hit now I hope I have this correct

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.310 
to hit now I hope I have this correct
here's<00:02:34.000> how<00:02:34.239> the<00:02:34.299> different<00:02:34.750> pieces<00:02:34.900> move

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
here's how the different pieces move

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.410 
here's how the different pieces move
that<00:02:35.530> you<00:02:35.680> have<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.940> you<00:02:37.000> have<00:02:37.030> many<00:02:37.239> pieces

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
that you have and you have many pieces

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.300 
that you have and you have many pieces
here<00:02:37.720> in<00:02:37.810> your<00:02:37.900> object<00:02:38.200> is<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.410> catch<00:02:38.590> your

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
here in your object is to catch your

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.910 
here in your object is to catch your
opponent's<00:02:39.880> main<00:02:40.540> piece<00:02:40.930> here<00:02:41.200> but<00:02:41.650> you<00:02:41.799> have

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
opponent's main piece here but you have

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.259 
opponent's main piece here but you have
your<00:02:42.040> own<00:02:42.100> phibian<00:02:42.549> x'<00:02:42.580> and<00:02:42.700> then<00:02:42.820> phibian<00:02:43.120> can

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
your own phibian x' and then phibian can

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.000 
your own phibian x' and then phibian can
move<00:02:43.420> one<00:02:43.660> space<00:02:43.840> forward<00:02:44.320> in<00:02:44.590> any<00:02:44.739> direction

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
move one space forward in any direction

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.699 
move one space forward in any direction
if<00:02:45.640> he<00:02:46.030> hits<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:46.360> other<00:02:46.510> side<00:02:46.810> he<00:02:47.049> becomes<00:02:47.440> a

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
if he hits the other side he becomes a

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.160 
if he hits the other side he becomes a
king<00:02:48.519> and<00:02:48.730> phibian<00:02:49.120> in<00:02:49.299> which<00:02:49.480> case<00:02:49.750> then<00:02:50.019> he

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
king and phibian in which case then he

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.009 
king and phibian in which case then he
can<00:02:50.350> go<00:02:50.530> in<00:02:50.850> multiple<00:02:51.850> directions<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:52.720> he<00:02:52.870> can

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
can go in multiple directions and he can

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.640 
can go in multiple directions and he can
move<00:02:53.140> two<00:02:53.470> spaces<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.810> submarines<00:02:56.260> they

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
move two spaces the the submarines they

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.580 
move two spaces the the submarines they
can<00:02:56.830> only<00:02:57.040> move<00:02:57.340> in<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:58.510> water<00:02:58.780> so<00:02:59.290> your<00:02:59.440> first

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
can only move in the water so your first

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.550 
can only move in the water so your first
move<00:03:00.060> your<00:03:01.060> out<00:03:01.180> into<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.450> water<00:03:01.600> and<00:03:02.049> after

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
move your out into the water and after

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.560 
move your out into the water and after
that<00:03:02.680> a<00:03:02.739> submarine<00:03:03.040> can<00:03:03.370> go<00:03:03.489> two<00:03:03.549> spaces<00:03:03.970> in

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
that a submarine can go two spaces in

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.930 
that a submarine can go two spaces in
any<00:03:04.840> direction<00:03:05.110> a<00:03:05.620> destroyer<00:03:06.310> can<00:03:06.549> also<00:03:06.700> only

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
any direction a destroyer can also only

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.780 
any direction a destroyer can also only
go<00:03:07.180> in<00:03:07.299> the<00:03:07.420> water<00:03:07.630> so<00:03:08.230> its<00:03:08.440> first<00:03:08.650> space<00:03:08.790> you

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
go in the water so its first space you

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.430 
go in the water so its first space you
know<00:03:09.880> goes<00:03:10.239> out<00:03:10.450> into<00:03:10.570> the<00:03:10.660> water<00:03:10.840> one<00:03:11.170> spot

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
know goes out into the water one spot

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.170 
know goes out into the water one spot
and<00:03:11.560> then<00:03:11.650> after<00:03:11.860> that<00:03:11.980> it<00:03:12.190> can<00:03:12.310> go<00:03:12.459> one<00:03:12.760> space

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
and then after that it can go one space

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.440 
and then after that it can go one space
in<00:03:13.510> any<00:03:14.290> direction<00:03:16.200> then<00:03:17.310> we<00:03:18.310> have<00:03:18.519> the<00:03:18.790> tanks

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
in any direction then we have the tanks

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.600 
in any direction then we have the tanks
tanks<00:03:19.810> can<00:03:19.989> only<00:03:20.110> go<00:03:20.290> on<00:03:20.320> the<00:03:20.500> land<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:20.950> tanks

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
tanks can only go on the land and tanks

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.130 
tanks can only go on the land and tanks
can<00:03:21.760> go<00:03:21.880> two<00:03:21.940> spaces<00:03:22.269> any<00:03:22.720> direction<00:03:22.959> the

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
can go two spaces any direction the

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.680 
can go two spaces any direction the
tanks<00:03:23.440> can't<00:03:23.709> be<00:03:23.860> jumped<00:03:24.430> so<00:03:25.269> that's<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.540> neat

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
tanks can't be jumped so that's the neat

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.180 
tanks can't be jumped so that's the neat
thing<00:03:25.840> about<00:03:25.930> a<00:03:26.079> tank<00:03:26.320> not<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:26.650> mention<00:03:26.829> tanks

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
thing about a tank not to mention tanks

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.250 
thing about a tank not to mention tanks
are<00:03:27.310> just<00:03:27.459> cool<00:03:27.750> then<00:03:28.750> we<00:03:28.900> have<00:03:29.080> the

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
are just cool then we have the

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.110 
are just cool then we have the
helicopters<00:03:30.040> the<00:03:30.220> helicopter<00:03:30.730> can<00:03:30.940> go<00:03:31.060> to

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
helicopters the helicopter can go to

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.510 
helicopters the helicopter can go to
spaces

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
spaces

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.560 
spaces
in<00:03:32.640> any<00:03:32.910> direction<00:03:34.700> the<00:03:35.700> problem<00:03:36.180> is<00:03:36.330> they

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
in any direction the problem is they

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.240 
in any direction the problem is they
can't<00:03:36.600> go<00:03:36.960> less<00:03:37.200> than<00:03:37.380> two<00:03:37.530> spaces<00:03:37.980> so<00:03:38.100> this

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
can't go less than two spaces so this

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.270 
can't go less than two spaces so this
helicopter<00:03:38.730> can<00:03:39.000> go<00:03:39.120> here<00:03:39.420> here<00:03:39.660> here<00:03:40.280> here

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
helicopter can go here here here here

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.940 
helicopter can go here here here here
here<00:03:41.310> he<00:03:42.180> can<00:03:42.450> go<00:03:42.840> basically<00:03:43.050> in<00:03:43.440> a<00:03:43.530> square

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
here he can go basically in a square

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.590 
here he can go basically in a square
around<00:03:44.280> it<00:03:44.460> so<00:03:44.670> this<00:03:44.850> helicopters<00:03:45.330> here<00:03:45.510> he

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
around it so this helicopters here he

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.810 
around it so this helicopters here he
can<00:03:45.690> go<00:03:45.780> here<00:03:45.990> here<00:03:46.110> here<00:03:46.290> here<00:03:46.400> here<00:03:47.400> here

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
can go here here here here here here

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.440 
can go here here here here here here
here<00:03:48.180> here<00:03:48.210> here<00:03:48.540> here<00:03:48.900> so<00:03:49.560> a<00:03:49.590> helicopter<00:03:49.860> is

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
here here here here so a helicopter is

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.180 
here here here here so a helicopter is
kind<00:03:51.450> of<00:03:51.480> restricted<00:03:52.200> to<00:03:52.350> where<00:03:52.590> he<00:03:52.770> can<00:03:52.980> go

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
kind of restricted to where he can go

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.430 
kind of restricted to where he can go
although<00:03:53.940> they<00:03:54.390> can<00:03:54.540> be<00:03:54.570> blocked<00:03:54.780> by<00:03:54.990> tanks

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
although they can be blocked by tanks

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.780 
although they can be blocked by tanks
which<00:03:55.590> doesn't<00:03:55.860> really<00:03:55.950> make<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.340> Matic

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
which doesn't really make the Matic

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.610 
which doesn't really make the Matic
sense<00:03:57.030> then<00:03:57.510> the<00:03:57.540> fighters<00:03:58.050> of<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.200> bombers

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
sense then the fighters of the bombers

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.470 
sense then the fighters of the bombers
can<00:03:58.830> move<00:03:59.070> different<00:03:59.580> spaces<00:03:59.970> fighters<00:04:00.300> can

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
can move different spaces fighters can

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.720 
can move different spaces fighters can
move<00:04:00.660> two<00:04:01.260> or<00:04:01.560> three<00:04:02.010> spaces<00:04:02.490> in<00:04:02.580> the<00:04:02.640> air

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
move two or three spaces in the air

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:03.950 
move two or three spaces in the air
depending<00:04:03.060> on<00:04:03.150> what<00:04:03.240> direction<00:04:03.390> they<00:04:03.810> go

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960 
depending on what direction they go

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.020 
depending on what direction they go
bombers<00:04:04.380> can<00:04:04.500> move<00:04:04.650> three<00:04:04.920> spaces<00:04:04.950> and<00:04:05.610> then

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
bombers can move three spaces and then

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.830 
bombers can move three spaces and then
your<00:04:06.180> commander<00:04:06.870> can<00:04:07.560> go<00:04:07.770> two<00:04:08.430> spaces<00:04:08.820> if<00:04:09.360> he's

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
your commander can go two spaces if he's

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.380 
your commander can go two spaces if he's
in<00:04:10.140> the<00:04:10.410> water<00:04:10.920> or<00:04:11.280> on<00:04:11.520> your<00:04:11.700> land<00:04:12.000> but<00:04:12.180> once

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
in the water or on your land but once

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.760 
in the water or on your land but once
he's<00:04:12.510> on<00:04:12.630> your<00:04:12.720> opponent's<00:04:13.110> land<00:04:13.260> he<00:04:13.440> can<00:04:13.620> only

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
he's on your opponent's land he can only

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.180 
he's on your opponent's land he can only
go<00:04:14.040> one<00:04:14.310> space<00:04:14.670> in<00:04:14.940> any<00:04:15.120> direction<00:04:15.570> and<00:04:16.260> so

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
go one space in any direction and so

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.130 
go one space in any direction and so
what<00:04:17.700> we're<00:04:17.850> looking<00:04:18.180> at<00:04:18.270> here<00:04:18.330> essentially

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
what we're looking at here essentially

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.539 
what we're looking at here essentially
is<00:04:19.260> and<00:04:19.440> I<00:04:19.530> know<00:04:19.590> that<00:04:19.920> the<00:04:20.040> designer<00:04:20.370> would

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
is and I know that the designer would

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:21.860 
is and I know that the designer would
argue<00:04:20.880> with<00:04:21.000> me<00:04:21.120> about<00:04:21.150> this<00:04:21.480> but<00:04:21.660> it's<00:04:21.810> just

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
argue with me about this but it's just

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.810 
argue with me about this but it's just
simply<00:04:22.230> the<00:04:22.290> truth<00:04:22.590> you're<00:04:23.340> simply<00:04:23.760> looking

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
simply the truth you're simply looking

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.940 
simply the truth you're simply looking
at<00:04:24.210> chess<00:04:24.630> where<00:04:24.930> you've<00:04:25.050> rotated<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.680> board

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
at chess where you've rotated the board

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.100 
at chess where you've rotated the board
and<00:04:26.160> given<00:04:26.490> the<00:04:26.610> pieces<00:04:27.030> different<00:04:27.480> movement

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
and given the pieces different movement

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.320 
and given the pieces different movement
abilities<00:04:28.560> and<00:04:28.590> there<00:04:29.370> is<00:04:29.550> some<00:04:29.700> restrictions

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
abilities and there is some restrictions

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.450 
abilities and there is some restrictions
because<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:31.440> errors<00:04:31.740> can<00:04:31.920> go<00:04:32.040> anywhere<00:04:32.400> but

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
because the errors can go anywhere but

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.910 
because the errors can go anywhere but
the<00:04:32.700> land<00:04:32.910> units<00:04:33.120> can<00:04:33.720> only<00:04:33.930> the<00:04:34.230> tanks<00:04:34.710> can

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
the land units can only the tanks can

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.770 
the land units can only the tanks can
only<00:04:35.010> stay<00:04:35.220> on<00:04:35.250> land<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:36.030> infinite<00:04:36.480> units

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
only stay on land the infinite units

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.390 
only stay on land the infinite units
they<00:04:36.870> can<00:04:36.990> go<00:04:37.080> anywhere<00:04:37.110> the<00:04:37.620> water<00:04:37.800> units<00:04:38.220> can

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
they can go anywhere the water units can

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.670 
they can go anywhere the water units can
only<00:04:38.520> go<00:04:38.700> in<00:04:38.730> the<00:04:38.940> water<00:04:39.210> so<00:04:39.660> that<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.500> board

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
only go in the water so that the board

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.990 
only go in the water so that the board
is<00:04:40.830> colored<00:04:41.190> to<00:04:41.250> help<00:04:41.490> you<00:04:41.640> out<00:04:41.790> in<00:04:41.940> that

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
is colored to help you out in that

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.350 
is colored to help you out in that
regard<00:04:42.270> but<00:04:42.720> there<00:04:43.410> is<00:04:43.710> more<00:04:44.250> restrictions<00:04:45.210> in

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
regard but there is more restrictions in

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.820 
regard but there is more restrictions in
this<00:04:45.450> regard<00:04:45.900> in<00:04:46.080> fact<00:04:46.260> I<00:04:46.350> think<00:04:46.410> there's<00:04:46.650> even

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
this regard in fact I think there's even

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.290 
this regard in fact I think there's even
more<00:04:46.980> restrictions<00:04:47.670> than<00:04:47.790> this<00:04:47.940> then<00:04:48.150> there

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
more restrictions than this then there

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.870 
more restrictions than this then there
isn't<00:04:48.480> in<00:04:48.750> Chinese<00:04:49.590> chess<00:04:49.920> so<00:04:50.550> that<00:04:50.730> is

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
isn't in Chinese chess so that is

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.770 
isn't in Chinese chess so that is
basically<00:04:51.090> how<00:04:51.330> you<00:04:51.510> play

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
basically how you play

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.710 
basically how you play
commander-in-chief<00:04:53.060> eyes<00:04:54.060> and<00:04:54.390> friends<00:04:54.660> who

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
commander-in-chief eyes and friends who

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.060 
commander-in-chief eyes and friends who
have<00:04:54.780> some<00:04:55.020> boys<00:04:55.230> and<00:04:55.260> I'm<00:04:55.560> gonna<00:04:55.680> give<00:04:55.920> them

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
have some boys and I'm gonna give them

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.750 
have some boys and I'm gonna give them
commander-in-chief<00:04:57.200> and<00:04:58.220> that<00:04:59.220> is<00:04:59.370> not<00:04:59.550> in

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
commander-in-chief and that is not in

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.040 
commander-in-chief and that is not in
any<00:04:59.880> way<00:05:00.000> a<00:05:00.860> promotion<00:05:01.860> of<00:05:01.980> me<00:05:02.130> for<00:05:02.640> the<00:05:02.790> game

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
any way a promotion of me for the game

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.670 
any way a promotion of me for the game
because<00:05:04.050> I'm<00:05:04.230> gonna<00:05:04.350> give<00:05:04.530> the

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
because I'm gonna give the

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.680 
because I'm gonna give the
commander-in-chief<00:05:05.130> because<00:05:05.760> I<00:05:05.790> think<00:05:06.060> they

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
commander-in-chief because I think they

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.780 
commander-in-chief because I think they
will<00:05:06.960> enjoy<00:05:07.080> playing<00:05:08.040> with<00:05:08.160> the<00:05:08.280> tanks<00:05:08.700> and

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
will enjoy playing with the tanks and

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.790 
will enjoy playing with the tanks and
ships<00:05:08.850> and<00:05:09.210> boats<00:05:09.300> and<00:05:09.600> stuff<00:05:09.720> so<00:05:10.290> they're

games throughout history to have done

the<00:05:53.759> same<00:05:53.909> thing<00:05:53.969> where<00:05:54.389> they've<00:05:54.509> taken<00:05:54.719> chess

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 
the same thing where they've taken chess

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:57.799 
the same thing where they've taken chess
and<00:05:55.409> they<00:05:55.979> were<00:05:56.279> oh<00:05:56.339> and<00:05:57.209> they<00:05:57.300> said<00:05:57.479> and<00:05:57.779> they

00:05:57.799 --> 00:05:57.809 
and they were oh and they said and they

00:05:57.809 --> 00:05:59.299 
and they were oh and they said and they
made<00:05:58.110> a<00:05:58.139> game<00:05:58.379> that's<00:05:58.529> pretty<00:05:58.679> much<00:05:58.919> the<00:05:59.099> same

00:05:59.299 --> 00:05:59.309 
made a game that's pretty much the same

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:01.159 
made a game that's pretty much the same
thing<00:05:59.550> as<00:05:59.669> chess<00:05:59.999> just<00:06:00.599> the<00:06:00.689> pieces<00:06:00.899> move

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
thing as chess just the pieces move

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:03.589 
thing as chess just the pieces move
differently<00:06:01.739> now<00:06:02.369> that<00:06:02.399> could<00:06:02.879> be<00:06:03.059> good<00:06:03.360> but

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:03.599 
differently now that could be good but

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:06.169 
differently now that could be good but
the<00:06:04.259> problem<00:06:04.409> with<00:06:04.800> it<00:06:04.919> is<00:06:05.069> is<00:06:05.309> it<00:06:05.819> lacks

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:06.179 
the problem with it is is it lacks

00:06:06.179 --> 00:06:08.809 
the problem with it is is it lacks
finesse<00:06:06.779> you<00:06:07.110> are<00:06:07.709> constantly<00:06:08.339> having<00:06:08.610> to

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:08.819 
finesse you are constantly having to

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:10.429 
finesse you are constantly having to
look<00:06:08.939> at<00:06:09.089> this<00:06:09.209> because<00:06:09.599> the<00:06:10.019> pieces

00:06:10.429 --> 00:06:10.439 
look at this because the pieces

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:12.290 
look at this because the pieces
themselves<00:06:10.639> yes<00:06:11.639> it<00:06:11.849> makes<00:06:11.969> sense<00:06:12.209> that

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
themselves yes it makes sense that

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.639 
themselves yes it makes sense that
submarines<00:06:12.689> and<00:06:12.809> destroyers<00:06:13.199> go<00:06:13.319> into<00:06:13.439> water

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:13.649 
submarines and destroyers go into water

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:15.049 
submarines and destroyers go into water
and<00:06:13.860> that<00:06:13.979> the<00:06:14.099> airplanes<00:06:14.489> and<00:06:14.639> bombers<00:06:14.969> can

00:06:15.049 --> 00:06:15.059 
and that the airplanes and bombers can

00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:16.339 
and that the airplanes and bombers can
go<00:06:15.209> anywhere<00:06:15.479> and<00:06:15.599> that<00:06:15.629> tanks<00:06:15.929> can<00:06:16.080> only<00:06:16.199> go

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:16.349 
go anywhere and that tanks can only go

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:17.989 
go anywhere and that tanks can only go
on<00:06:16.469> land<00:06:16.649> but<00:06:17.129> you<00:06:17.279> cannot<00:06:17.489> remember<00:06:17.819> how<00:06:17.939> many

00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:17.999 
on land but you cannot remember how many

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:19.549 
on land but you cannot remember how many
pieces<00:06:18.300> each<00:06:18.569> one<00:06:18.779> moves<00:06:18.959> you're<00:06:19.079> constantly

00:06:19.549 --> 00:06:19.559 
pieces each one moves you're constantly

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:21.919 
pieces each one moves you're constantly
having<00:06:19.829> a<00:06:19.979> look<00:06:20.099> at<00:06:20.249> here<00:06:20.489> now<00:06:21.179> granted<00:06:21.749> you

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:21.929 
having a look at here now granted you

00:06:21.929 --> 00:06:24.350 
having a look at here now granted you
might<00:06:22.649> have<00:06:22.889> to<00:06:23.069> constantly<00:06:23.519> look<00:06:23.759> at<00:06:23.909> here<00:06:24.149> if

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
might have to constantly look at here if

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.249 
might have to constantly look at here if
the<00:06:24.539> first<00:06:24.719> time<00:06:24.869> you<00:06:24.989> play<00:06:25.169> chess<00:06:25.499> too<00:06:25.800> but<00:06:26.759> I

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:27.259 
the first time you play chess too but I

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:31.129 
the first time you play chess too but I
didn't<00:06:28.259> I<00:06:28.469> I<00:06:29.459> I<00:06:29.969> just<00:06:30.389> found<00:06:30.749> this<00:06:30.929> game

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:31.139 
didn't I I I just found this game

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:33.559 
didn't I I I just found this game
somewhat<00:06:31.679> non-intuitive<00:06:32.219> not<00:06:33.119> to<00:06:33.329> mention

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:33.569 
somewhat non-intuitive not to mention

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:36.409 
somewhat non-intuitive not to mention
and<00:06:33.989> maybe<00:06:34.979> I'm<00:06:35.279> not<00:06:35.459> a<00:06:35.519> good<00:06:35.610> strategist<00:06:36.269> but

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 
and maybe I'm not a good strategist but

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:37.969 
and maybe I'm not a good strategist but
I<00:06:36.479> just<00:06:36.869> didn't<00:06:37.169> see<00:06:37.289> a<00:06:37.319> lot<00:06:37.499> of<00:06:37.559> the<00:06:37.709> point

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:37.979 
I just didn't see a lot of the point

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:40.219 
I just didn't see a lot of the point
that<00:06:38.550> tanks<00:06:39.089> can<00:06:39.360> only<00:06:39.509> say<00:06:39.779> in<00:06:39.839> your<00:06:39.959> own<00:06:40.050> land

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:40.229 
that tanks can only say in your own land

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:42.379 
that tanks can only say in your own land
so<00:06:40.379> they<00:06:40.499> sit<00:06:40.649> there<00:06:40.769> and<00:06:40.889> defend<00:06:41.009> and<00:06:41.519> the

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:42.389 
so they sit there and defend and the

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:44.389 
so they sit there and defend and the
unit's<00:06:42.899> moving<00:06:43.169> the<00:06:43.259> ocean<00:06:43.529> so<00:06:43.679> why<00:06:43.860> not<00:06:44.069> pull

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:44.399 
unit's moving the ocean so why not pull

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:45.919 
unit's moving the ocean so why not pull
back<00:06:44.639> and<00:06:44.849> just<00:06:44.909> defend<00:06:45.389> and<00:06:45.569> wait<00:06:45.659> for<00:06:45.839> your

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:45.929 
back and just defend and wait for your

00:06:45.929 --> 00:06:47.089 
back and just defend and wait for your
opponent<00:06:45.989> to<00:06:46.289> come<00:06:46.439> and<00:06:46.559> get<00:06:46.679> you

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:47.099 
opponent to come and get you

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:48.889 
opponent to come and get you
it<00:06:47.459> wasn't<00:06:47.789> like<00:06:47.879> they<00:06:47.999> can<00:06:48.149> trap<00:06:48.419> your<00:06:48.599> king

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:48.899 
it wasn't like they can trap your king

00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:50.509 
it wasn't like they can trap your king
in<00:06:49.019> the<00:06:49.110> corner<00:06:49.499> type<00:06:49.739> situation<00:06:50.249> like<00:06:50.399> in

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:50.519 
in the corner type situation like in

00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:54.379 
in the corner type situation like in
chess<00:06:50.789> I<00:06:52.219> just<00:06:53.219> didn't<00:06:53.429> get<00:06:53.579> it<00:06:53.639> it<00:06:54.089> wasn't

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:54.389 
chess I just didn't get it it wasn't

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:55.969 
chess I just didn't get it it wasn't
very<00:06:54.659> fun<00:06:54.990> it<00:06:55.199> was<00:06:55.289> interesting<00:06:55.769> entertaining

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:55.979 
very fun it was interesting entertaining

00:06:55.979 --> 00:06:57.859 
very fun it was interesting entertaining
the<00:06:56.550> way<00:06:56.639> we<00:06:56.849> played<00:06:57.149> it<00:06:57.300> cuz<00:06:57.419> we<00:06:57.539> made<00:06:57.689> big

00:06:57.859 --> 00:06:57.869 
the way we played it cuz we made big

00:06:57.869 --> 00:07:00.319 
the way we played it cuz we made big
noises<00:06:58.409> and<00:06:58.619> splashes<00:06:59.550> and<00:06:59.699> stuff<00:06:59.909> but<00:07:00.149> and

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:00.329 
noises and splashes and stuff but and

00:07:00.329 --> 00:07:02.779 
noises and splashes and stuff but and
the<00:07:01.050> game<00:07:01.229> even<00:07:01.439> comes<00:07:01.769> with<00:07:01.889> a<00:07:02.009> timer<00:07:02.399> where

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:02.789 
the game even comes with a timer where

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:04.669 
the game even comes with a timer where
you<00:07:02.879> can<00:07:03.029> time<00:07:03.240> the<00:07:03.360> other<00:07:03.479> person<00:07:03.869> this<00:07:04.379> great

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:04.679 
you can time the other person this great

00:07:04.679 --> 00:07:06.139 
you can time the other person this great
thing<00:07:04.889> you<00:07:05.009> know<00:07:05.129> for<00:07:05.309> many<00:07:05.550> different<00:07:05.759> games

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:06.149 
thing you know for many different games

thing you know for many different games
of<00:07:06.360> this<00:07:06.479> genre<00:07:06.539> but<00:07:07.139> the<00:07:07.860> pieces<00:07:08.249> are<00:07:08.369> nice

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:08.519 
of this genre but the pieces are nice

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:10.489 
of this genre but the pieces are nice
and<00:07:08.879> it's<00:07:09.240> cool<00:07:09.479> that<00:07:09.509> you<00:07:09.749> can<00:07:09.869> play<00:07:10.050> chess<00:07:10.349> or

00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:11.819 
checkers although like I said playing

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:13.609 
checkers although like I said playing
chess<00:07:12.119> with<00:07:12.329> a<00:07:12.360> set<00:07:12.929> of<00:07:12.959> pieces<00:07:13.289> like<00:07:13.379> this

00:07:13.609 --> 00:07:13.619 
chess with a set of pieces like this

00:07:13.619 --> 00:07:16.009 
chess with a set of pieces like this
doesn't<00:07:14.219> really<00:07:14.490> work<00:07:14.729> that<00:07:14.909> well<00:07:15.149> but<00:07:15.899> the

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:16.019 
doesn't really work that well but the

00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:19.219 
doesn't really work that well but the
third<00:07:16.229> game<00:07:16.529> I<00:07:17.119> don't<00:07:18.119> think<00:07:18.389> it's<00:07:18.539> a<00:07:18.689> very

00:07:19.219 --> 00:07:19.229 
third game I don't think it's a very

00:07:19.229 --> 00:07:22.519 
third game I don't think it's a very
good<00:07:19.619> one<00:07:19.860> I<00:07:20.129> just<00:07:20.879> am<00:07:21.089> not<00:07:21.449> seeing<00:07:21.779> it<00:07:21.989> it's

00:07:22.519 --> 00:07:22.529 
good one I just am not seeing it it's

00:07:22.529 --> 00:07:23.989 
good one I just am not seeing it it's
gonna<00:07:22.709> be<00:07:22.769> too<00:07:23.069> confusing<00:07:23.279> for<00:07:23.610> new<00:07:23.759> people

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:26.039 
and even if you understand the nuance of

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:28.279 
and even if you understand the nuance of
it<00:07:26.249> what<00:07:26.759> does<00:07:26.879> it<00:07:27.029> offer<00:07:27.239> that<00:07:27.569> chest<00:07:27.959> doesn't

00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:28.289

restrictions on how the PIAT pieces move

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.419 
restrictions on how the PIAT pieces move
