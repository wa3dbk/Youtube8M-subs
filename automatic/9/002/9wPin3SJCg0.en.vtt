00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.660
 hi everyone, continue our series about 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.730
 gaming components and this homeland 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.420
 final clips will be about block 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.410
 power supply from the company a p to namely model 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.570
 strike-x 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.150
 why was this model chosen because 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.100
 what is the initial world level how are you 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.100
 remember we are collecting budget gaming 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.610
 the computer has this power supply 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:42.580
 500 watt power is bronze + 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.210
 which is very good you need money 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.490
 was taken 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:50.950
 this rarity is also every channel 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:55.750
 I recall 2 channels of 12 each 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:57.820
 equipped with 40 1 amps at the load that 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.180
 very pleased also these two channels can 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.220
 pass 400 watts of power for 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.379
 cpu it will be fine because 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.960
 what if he exchange his nasty memory 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.950
 processor and will need to be consumed 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:15.689
 a great need will be empire with good then 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.759
 how could this very beautiful depth of this 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.130
 also let's unpack see what 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.460
 what is the appearance 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.259
 what goes with it what is not present 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.609
 now i will pause unpack and 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:32.409
 continue here is a plan packed unit 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:42.009
 power as you see here we are 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:44.079
 wire cable 220 go on block 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.850
 power supply 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:49.159
 some kind of polypropylene is packed 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.509
 amazing for me the first time I see 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:56.539
 power supply sponge bob power to touch 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.579
 nice let's i pause 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:01.880
 again or stopped this box husband 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:04.130
 inconvenient to get a little bit we continue 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.869
 our video is such a power unit with it 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.640
 more and bolts were surprisingly in 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.090
 complete 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.890
 different colors of a cherry like that 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.830
 the grid is unscrewed so that you can 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:19.220
 had to clean the fan and and took down 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.840
 stay stay exactly these screws here 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.890
 need to unscrew these don't need our 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:30.470
 the warranty will come off it also radiators 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:34.810
 good by weight it weighs decently if with 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:37.819
 nothing about eternity configuration it 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.410
 let's take a closer look at specificity 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.840
 to make it clearer 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:46.069
 who wants can pause 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:50.230
 maybe it's interesting to see someone 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.350
 there will be a cover here waiting for us 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:03:00.530
 bright red 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:03:04.640
 and himself behind the exit to the power wires at 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:11.600
 us on the motherboard goes sata dreams and 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:18.200
 Connectors should be here are four more 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:21.459
 to f4 and dh not for old samples on 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:25.160
 flop movie card readers 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:28.890
 so this is on our video card and even 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.920
 additionally there are 8 contacts needed 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:36.460
 or this video card 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:42.040
 this stage and yes taytona medicare on 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:43.740
 the processor itself is power all that is needed 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.240
 there is 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.540
 I liked that such a mesh 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:53.080
 nice every wire mesh without 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:57.460
 any defects are shrouded with heat shrinkage 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:00.280
 it is also very pleasantly pleased because 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:03.160
 that you don't often see quality so 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.060
 it was done usually wire just without 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.990
 any netting 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:10.410
 and it looks so beautiful 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:13.210
 we will try this power supply 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:16.470
 test the car and the last movie 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:20.410
 probably will be with counting how much 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.090
 This system unit cost completely 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.970
 together with a monitor with a mouse and 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.700
 keyboard fully system unit 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.410
 In short, I did not buy the body 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.520
 used my old body just 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.000
 repainted him 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:37.500
 and a little refined that's all nothing 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.230
 there is not much of it , but 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:44.440
 the next video will be about the percentage and 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:46.230
 performance and penny 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.320
 flax price 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.830
 all while wait for the next video
