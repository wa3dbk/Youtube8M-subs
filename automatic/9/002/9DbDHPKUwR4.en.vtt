we're gonna have to find another one see
I<00:04:04.810> guess<00:04:05.079> as<00:04:05.230> what<00:04:05.379> happens<00:04:05.680> on<00:04:05.829> a<00:04:05.920> mumble<00:04:06.190> on

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
I guess as what happens on a mumble on

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.960 
I guess as what happens on a mumble on
here<00:04:06.700> I<00:04:06.730> run<00:04:07.090> past<00:04:07.390> the<00:04:07.599> things<00:04:07.840> they<00:04:08.019> need

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
here I run past the things they need

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.479 
here I run past the things they need
haha<00:04:10.200> at<00:04:11.200> least<00:04:11.290> it's<00:04:11.590> not<00:04:11.650> like<00:04:11.920> Starly<00:04:12.340> where

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
haha at least it's not like Starly where

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.660 
haha at least it's not like Starly where
I<00:04:12.579> found<00:04:12.700> every<00:04:13.390> other<00:04:13.569> one<00:04:13.900> except<00:04:14.739> the<00:04:15.190> one<00:04:15.430> I

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
I found every other one except the one I

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:21.629 
I found every other one except the one I
was<00:04:15.849> looking<00:04:16.030> for<00:04:16.389> I<00:04:20.130> think<00:04:21.130> that's<00:04:21.280> just<00:04:21.489> a

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
was looking for I think that's just a

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.250 
was looking for I think that's just a
sign<00:04:21.850> and<00:04:22.060> you<00:04:22.120> just<00:04:22.240> slow<00:04:22.750> down<00:04:22.780> and<00:04:23.110> make

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
sign and you just slow down and make

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:29.909 
sign and you just slow down and make
clicking<00:04:26.729> but<00:04:27.729> then<00:04:27.880> that<00:04:28.030> takes<00:04:28.180> all<00:04:28.419> day<00:04:28.919> but

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
clicking but then that takes all day but

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.500 
clicking but then that takes all day but
I<00:04:30.130> guess<00:04:30.310> we<00:04:30.430> have<00:04:30.520> to<00:04:30.550> make<00:04:30.729> sacrifices<00:04:30.910> from

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
I guess we have to make sacrifices from

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:38.150 
I guess we have to make sacrifices from
