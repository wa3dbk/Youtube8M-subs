00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
fuel economy the question is is it

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.340 
fuel economy the question is is it
faster<00:01:05.610> than<00:01:06.060> our<00:01:06.210> returning<00:01:06.720> champ<00:01:07.080> which

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
faster than our returning champ which

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.370 
faster than our returning champ which
happens<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.920> be<00:01:07.950> our<00:01:08.600> project<00:01:09.600> pickup<00:01:10.200> which

is an old Silverado that we flash tuned
to<00:01:13.619> God<00:01:13.800> knows<00:01:13.979> how<00:01:14.160> much<00:01:14.369> torque<00:01:15.000> and

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
to God knows how much torque and

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.840 
to God knows how much torque and
horsepower<00:01:15.240> but<00:01:16.050> it<00:01:16.350> pulled<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> vote<00:01:17.430> from<00:01:17.640> 0

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
I think it can I think it won't make a

here<00:02:11.980> we<00:02:12.070> go

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.090 

makes<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:16.020> difference<00:02:16.050> when<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.800> don't<00:02:17.010> have

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
makes a difference when you don't have

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.370 
makes a difference when you don't have
it<00:02:17.250> until<00:02:17.370> hall<00:02:17.700> mode<00:02:17.990> sings<00:02:18.990> downright

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
it until hall mode sings downright

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.880 
it until hall mode sings downright
sprightly<00:02:22.160> now<00:02:23.420> keep<00:02:24.420> in<00:02:24.570> mind<00:02:24.780> how<00:02:24.960> enormous

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
sprightly now keep in mind how enormous

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.020 
sprightly now keep in mind how enormous
this<00:02:26.190> truck<00:02:26.460> is<00:02:27.020> and<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.200> fact<00:02:28.410> that<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:29.130> little

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
this truck is and the fact that a little

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.370 
this truck is and the fact that a little
windy<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.540> little<00:02:31.110> heavy

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
windy a little heavy

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.480 
windy a little heavy
it<00:02:31.560> doesn't<00:02:31.920> care<00:02:32.310> eight<00:02:32.820> point<00:02:33.240> nine<00:02:33.330> one

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.580 

so<00:02:37.480> this<00:02:37.960> is<00:02:38.110> about<00:02:38.380> 6,000<00:02:39.070> feet<00:02:39.520> elevation

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
so this is about 6,000 feet elevation

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.350 
so this is about 6,000 feet elevation
even<00:02:41.590> though<00:02:41.710> it<00:02:41.890> is<00:02:42.040> turbocharged<00:02:42.970> you<00:02:43.150> still

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
even though it is turbocharged you still

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.540 
even though it is turbocharged you still
lose<00:02:43.540> a<00:02:43.570> little<00:02:43.930> tiny<00:02:44.050> bit<00:02:44.230> of<00:02:44.290> power<00:02:44.550> so

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
lose a little tiny bit of power so

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.470 
lose a little tiny bit of power so
that's<00:02:45.790> pretty<00:02:45.970> temp<00:02:46.390> this<00:02:46.960> thing<00:02:47.140> is<00:02:47.260> huge<00:02:47.680> I

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
that's pretty temp this thing is huge I

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.290 
that's pretty temp this thing is huge I
was<00:02:49.480> truly<00:02:49.810> expecting<00:02:50.440> something<00:02:50.650> like<00:02:51.300> 9.1

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
was truly expecting something like 9.1

00:02:52.300 --> 00:03:02.910 
was truly expecting something like 9.1
and<00:02:52.330> 9.2<00:02:53.040> so<00:02:54.040> that's<00:02:54.190> impressive<00:03:01.830> you<00:03:02.830> know

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
and 9.2 so that's impressive you know

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.440 
and 9.2 so that's impressive you know
what<00:03:03.070> maybe<00:03:03.220> there's<00:03:03.610> more<00:03:03.670> induction<00:03:04.300> noise

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
what maybe there's more induction noise

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.350 
what maybe there's more induction noise
and<00:03:04.840> there<00:03:04.960> is<00:03:05.200> exhaust<00:03:06.100> noise<00:03:06.310> yes<00:03:06.970> but<00:03:07.270> it

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
and there is exhaust noise yes but it

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.240 
and there is exhaust noise yes but it
sounds<00:03:07.660> like<00:03:07.720> a<00:03:07.810> military<00:03:08.530> vehicle<00:03:08.740> you<00:03:09.160> know

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
sounds like a military vehicle you know

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.670 
sounds like a military vehicle you know
it's<00:03:09.400> got<00:03:09.550> that<00:03:09.670> like<00:03:09.990> gurgling<00:03:10.990> undertone<00:03:11.650> of

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
it's got that like gurgling undertone of

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:20.610 
it's got that like gurgling undertone of
power

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:30.759 

so<00:03:22.299> folks<00:03:23.739> 9.02<00:03:27.819> that<00:03:28.819> was<00:03:29.810> me<00:03:30.140> giving<00:03:30.560> it<00:03:30.650> as

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
so folks 9.02 that was me giving it as

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.809 
so folks 9.02 that was me giving it as
much<00:03:31.069> juice<00:03:31.760> as<00:03:31.879> I<00:03:32.030> could<00:03:32.799> before<00:03:33.799> the<00:03:34.099> RPM

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
much juice as I could before the RPM

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.640 
much juice as I could before the RPM
simply<00:03:35.150> stopped<00:03:35.450> a<00:03:35.629> little<00:03:35.780> over<00:03:35.959> 3,000<00:03:36.349> rpm

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
simply stopped a little over 3,000 rpm

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.509 
simply stopped a little over 3,000 rpm
and<00:03:36.859> away<00:03:37.640> I<00:03:37.670> win<00:03:38.030> that's<00:03:38.959> fast<00:03:39.260> but<00:03:39.799> the<00:03:40.400> other

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
and away I win that's fast but the other

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.960 
and away I win that's fast but the other
way<00:03:40.670> was<00:03:40.909> faster<00:03:41.680> so<00:03:42.680> a<00:03:43.189> little<00:03:43.549> bit<00:03:43.640> of<00:03:43.730> torque

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
way was faster so a little bit of torque

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.819 
way was faster so a little bit of torque
is<00:03:44.390> the<00:03:44.569> way<00:03:44.689> to<00:03:44.750> go<00:03:44.930> just<00:03:45.230> get<00:03:45.349> that<00:03:45.500> turbo<00:03:45.680> to

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
is the way to go just get that turbo to

00:03:45.829 --> 00:04:02.890 
is the way to go just get that turbo to
spool<00:03:46.099> up

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.130 

okay<00:04:03.900> I<00:04:03.930> don't<00:04:04.470> know<00:04:04.650> they<00:04:04.879> spin<00:04:05.879> yeah<00:04:06.540> this<00:04:06.870> is

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
quality personally I haven't felt that

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:15.979 
quality personally I haven't felt that
difference<00:04:14.909> yet<00:04:15.090> but<00:04:15.239> once<00:04:15.390> we<00:04:15.510> start<00:04:15.720> towing

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310

yeah it's a good idea but I think the

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:55.520 
yeah it's a good idea but I think the
execution<00:04:49.860> is<00:04:49.919> kind<00:04:50.070> of<00:04:50.130> like<00:04:50.280> not<00:04:50.460> so<00:04:50.639> good

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.330 
better than a lot of 2500 I'm good I'm
gonna<00:05:27.660> torque<00:05:27.960> this<00:05:28.620> engine<00:05:29.010> a<00:05:29.040> little<00:05:29.160> bit

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
gonna torque this engine a little bit

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.740 
gonna torque this engine a little bit
because<00:05:29.490> I<00:05:29.669> know<00:05:29.700> the<00:05:29.940> turbo<00:05:30.210> likes<00:05:30.390> to<00:05:30.480> spool

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
because I know the turbo likes to spool

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:31.880 
because I know the turbo likes to spool
up<00:05:30.870> that's<00:05:31.140> really<00:05:31.380> where<00:05:31.500> the<00:05:31.620> power<00:05:31.800> comes

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
up that's really where the power comes

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.500 
up that's really where the power comes
from<00:05:32.160> okay<00:05:32.700> and<00:05:32.970> we're<00:05:33.090> trying<00:05:33.330> to<00:05:33.419> get

from okay and we're trying to get

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.480 
from okay and we're trying to get
fourteen<00:05:34.050> point<00:05:34.380> two<00:05:34.470> three<00:05:34.919> which<00:05:35.130> is<00:05:35.280> the

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 
guys check it out 15 point oh three

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.839 
guys check it out 15 point oh three
fifty<00:06:09.699> point<00:06:10.060> Oh<00:06:10.120> three<00:06:11.520> you<00:06:12.520> know<00:06:12.639> I'm

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:12.849 
fifty point Oh three you know I'm

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:14.939 
fifty point Oh three you know I'm
wondering<00:06:13.060> that<00:06:13.330> if<00:06:13.509> you<00:06:13.630> started<00:06:14.050> flat<00:06:14.410> if<00:06:14.740> it

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:14.949 
wondering that if you started flat if it

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:17.580 
wondering that if you started flat if it
would<00:06:15.069> have<00:06:15.160> done<00:06:15.280> any<00:06:15.520> faster<00:06:16.319> you<00:06:17.319> know<00:06:17.440> my

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590 
would have done any faster you know my

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:18.899 
would have done any faster you know my
experience<00:06:17.710> of<00:06:18.099> this<00:06:18.190> Cummins<00:06:18.550> and<00:06:18.639> I've<00:06:18.759> done

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:18.909 
experience of this Cummins and I've done

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:20.850 
experience of this Cummins and I've done
it<00:06:19.000> a<00:06:19.060> few<00:06:19.090> times<00:06:19.240> now<00:06:19.659> is<00:06:19.840> that's<00:06:20.500> actually

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
it a few times now is that's actually

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.260 
it a few times now is that's actually
slower<00:06:21.099> if<00:06:21.310> you<00:06:21.370> just<00:06:21.580> floor<00:06:21.789> it<00:06:21.819> because<00:06:22.120> it

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
slower if you just floor it because it

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.180 
slower if you just floor it because it
does<00:06:22.449> need<00:06:22.720> to<00:06:22.780> suck<00:06:23.349> out<00:06:23.560> school<00:06:23.919> a<00:06:23.949> little

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190 
does need to suck out school a little

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:25.710 
does need to suck out school a little
bit<00:06:24.430> but<00:06:24.699> you<00:06:24.909> know<00:06:24.970> what<00:06:25.150> let's<00:06:25.300> try<00:06:25.509> it<00:06:25.630> the

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 
bit but you know what let's try it the

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.270 
bit but you know what let's try it the
other<00:06:25.750> way<00:06:25.990> and<00:06:26.169> I'll<00:06:26.319> just<00:06:26.530> floor<00:06:26.770> it<00:06:26.800> I<00:06:27.009> won't

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 
other way and I'll just floor it I won't

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.749 
other way and I'll just floor it I won't
break<00:06:27.669> target<00:06:28.090> we'll<00:06:28.569> see<00:06:28.750> how<00:06:28.810> it<00:06:28.930> does<00:06:29.729> get<00:06:30.729> a

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:30.759 
break target we'll see how it does get a

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:32.790 
break target we'll see how it does get a
second<00:06:31.150> every<00:06:31.360> time<00:06:31.569> can<00:06:31.840> you<00:06:31.930> even<00:06:32.110> tell<00:06:32.409> if

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 
second every time can you even tell if

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.960 
second every time can you even tell if
there's<00:06:33.190> anything<00:06:33.460> behind<00:06:33.880> us<00:06:34.060> no<00:06:34.870> it's<00:06:35.819> as<00:06:36.819> I

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
there's anything behind us no it's as I

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:38.790 
there's anything behind us no it's as I
said<00:06:37.030> it's<00:06:37.300> like<00:06:37.389> a<00:06:37.419> Clydesdale<00:06:37.780> pulling<00:06:38.530> a

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
said it's like a Clydesdale pulling a

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.890 
said it's like a Clydesdale pulling a
baby<00:06:39.310> stroller<00:06:39.610> and<00:06:39.940> this<00:06:40.030> is<00:06:40.150> a<00:06:40.180> 6,000<00:06:40.870> pound

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:40.900 
baby stroller and this is a 6,000 pound

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.620 
baby stroller and this is a 6,000 pound
boat<00:06:41.289> and<00:06:41.560> it's<00:06:41.979> like<00:06:42.220> whatever<00:06:43.030> you<00:06:43.509> know<00:06:43.599> I

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:43.630 
boat and it's like whatever you know I

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:44.850 
boat and it's like whatever you know I
think<00:06:43.750> this<00:06:43.930> thing<00:06:44.169> has<00:06:44.199> a<00:06:44.409> towing<00:06:44.710> capacity

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860 
think this thing has a towing capacity

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.529 
think this thing has a towing capacity
of<00:06:45.750> 70,000<00:06:46.750> pounds<00:06:48.210> 70,000<00:06:49.210> so<00:06:49.300> we<00:06:49.419> are

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:49.539 
of 70,000 pounds 70,000 so we are
