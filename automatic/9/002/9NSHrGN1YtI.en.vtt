00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.010
 hello to all of you who are watching me 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:21.240
 I'm Javier, I'm in charge of 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.240
 quotes production 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.910
 and I thought that it could be done 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.669
 tutorials of learning to play a 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.470
 musical instrument and at the moment we are going to 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:35.530
 start with a very simple instrument 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.530
 which is very easy to learn which is the 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.770
 the fleet 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.489
 It is a very simple instrument to play 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.890
 so it's good then it's easy to learn 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.989
 to play the recorder and I think it's 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.730
 a unique opportunity that people do not 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.860
 I should miss 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.850
 one thing that we will teach in the tutorial 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:02.059
 is to play the flute its sharps 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.269
 flats alterations and so on you will learn 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.070
 and a little bit of solution also costs and 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.040
 play some popular song if you're going 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:14.350
 to a party ideas and I always touched 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.350
 the song you put on your flute 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.950
 for example that song or that one for 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.950
 example a meringue 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.659
 to me 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:59.909
 or sharper chasms like that of 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.909
 we believe in prologarse 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.190
 well songs by any style of 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.190
 the beatles the diablada 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.970
 and well you go to your little party with 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.310
 your flutist plays is a song that you give 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.830
 like summer and everyone happy 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.720
 solved and well let's see that 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.400
 then we will also do a touch tutorial 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.170
 some songs on the piano learn to 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.890
 handle the piano but at the moment I do not know 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.900
 goal the sweet flute that is essential 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:54.180
 basic 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.180
 it's very easy to play it has 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.940
 12 octaves reaches up to two octaves and its 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.940
 more serious note 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.180
 and well more or less the rest of the 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.950
 I recommend that you 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.349
 subscribe to the ory goat channel 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.829

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:17.379
 get on piano flute and so on 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:21.370
 so it 's apart from what you're seeing 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:25.180
 as month and according to the reproductions and 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.099
 the valuations of the like or slyke that you 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.609
 it says to the video because it will keep going up more 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:32.109
 videos or it will delete good is also 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:34.060
 thought apart from outside 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:36.069
 as commented on the piano and maybe already 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.790
 a little later the transverse flute 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.790
 that is played like this 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.480
 for that very good because that's all 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.920
 said more or less 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.930
