is<00:01:38.350> we<00:01:38.590> have<00:01:38.800> a<00:01:38.830> an<00:01:39.520> edge<00:01:39.760> that<00:01:40.000> goes<00:01:40.030> back<00:01:40.390> and

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
is we have a an edge that goes back and

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.600 
is we have a an edge that goes back and
forth<00:01:40.690> so<00:01:41.140> when<00:01:41.290> it<00:01:41.410> when<00:01:41.950> it's<00:01:42.100> in<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.400> thing

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
forth so when it when it's in the thing

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.580 
forth so when it when it's in the thing
that<00:01:42.730> it<00:01:43.060> sharpens<00:01:43.510> back<00:01:43.720> and<00:01:43.960> forth<00:01:44.200> and<00:01:44.500> it

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
that it sharpens back and forth and it

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.980 
that it sharpens back and forth and it
puts<00:01:44.800> an<00:01:44.920> edge<00:01:45.040> back<00:01:45.280> on<00:01:45.520> the<00:01:45.640> skate<00:01:45.880> these<00:01:46.840> are

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
puts an edge back on the skate these are

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.080 
puts an edge back on the skate these are
interchangeable<00:01:47.680> even<00:01:48.430> the<00:01:48.490> market<00:01:48.820> yet<00:01:48.940> this

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
interchangeable even the market yet this

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.670 
interchangeable even the market yet this
I<00:01:49.270> normally<00:01:49.630> found<00:01:49.780> out<00:01:49.990> about<00:01:50.080> this<00:01:50.350> listen

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
I normally found out about this listen

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.930 
I normally found out about this listen
would<00:01:50.800> you<00:01:50.830> come<00:01:51.040> on<00:01:51.100> the<00:01:51.280> show<00:01:51.310> and<00:01:51.490> just<00:01:51.760> give

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
would you come on the show and just give

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.430 
would you come on the show and just give
us<00:01:52.060> a<00:01:52.300> little<00:01:52.630> bit<00:01:52.960> about<00:01:53.110> what<00:01:53.260> you're<00:01:53.410> doing

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
us a little bit about what you're doing

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.470 
us a little bit about what you're doing
see<00:01:54.250> you're<00:01:54.340> just<00:01:54.640> starting<00:01:54.940> with<00:01:55.150> this<00:01:55.270> and

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
see you're just starting with this and

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.360 
see you're just starting with this and
it's<00:01:55.570> already<00:01:55.870> picking<00:01:56.170> up<00:01:56.290> high<00:01:56.800> so<00:01:57.220> it's

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
it's already picking up high so it's

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.340 
it's already picking up high so it's
rechargeable<00:01:58.000> it's<00:01:58.450> there<00:01:58.690> for<00:01:58.900> the<00:01:58.930> trainers

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
rechargeable it's there for the trainers

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.110 
rechargeable it's there for the trainers
so<00:01:59.560> when<00:01:59.770> the<00:02:00.160> player<00:02:00.370> comes<00:02:00.610> off<00:02:00.790> the<00:02:00.970> ice

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
so when the player comes off the ice

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.000 
so when the player comes off the ice
yeah<00:02:01.450> he<00:02:01.840> puts<00:02:02.110> his<00:02:02.260> foot<00:02:02.410> up<00:02:02.470> on<00:02:02.650> the<00:02:02.800> edge<00:02:02.890> of

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
yeah he puts his foot up on the edge of

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.940 
yeah he puts his foot up on the edge of
the<00:02:03.130> boards<00:02:03.490> yep<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:04.390> player<00:02:04.630> puts<00:02:04.870> it<00:02:05.050> on

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
the boards yep the player puts it on

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.880 
the boards yep the player puts it on
and<00:02:06.219> it<00:02:06.310> goes<00:02:06.399> back<00:02:06.460> and<00:02:06.939> forth<00:02:07.080> and<00:02:08.080> itself

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
and it goes back and forth and itself

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.369 
and it goes back and forth and itself
aligns<00:02:09.310> and<00:02:09.580> sharpens<00:02:10.000> both<00:02:10.660> edges<00:02:11.140> at<00:02:11.290> the

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
aligns and sharpens both edges at the

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:12.960 
aligns and sharpens both edges at the
same<00:02:11.560> okay<00:02:11.890> now<00:02:12.069> that's<00:02:12.280> a<00:02:12.370> really<00:02:12.640> good<00:02:12.730> point

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
same okay now that's a really good point

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.940 
same okay now that's a really good point
if<00:02:13.150> it<00:02:13.269> sells<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.629> lines<00:02:13.840> because<00:02:14.260> you<00:02:14.590> know<00:02:14.709> a

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
if it sells the lines because you know a

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.229 
if it sells the lines because you know a
lot<00:02:15.220> of<00:02:15.250> us<00:02:15.400> don't<00:02:15.610> know<00:02:15.790> what<00:02:15.970> we're<00:02:16.090> doing

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
lot of us don't know what we're doing

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.240 
lot of us don't know what we're doing
because<00:02:16.720> we're<00:02:17.019> not<00:02:17.050> skate<00:02:17.349> sharpeners<00:02:17.950> how

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
because we're not skate sharpeners how

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.860 
because we're not skate sharpeners how
can<00:02:18.519> a<00:02:18.550> you<00:02:18.940> know<00:02:19.060> how<00:02:19.269> would<00:02:19.450> you<00:02:19.569> be<00:02:19.690> able<00:02:19.780> to

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
can a you know how would you be able to

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.140 
can a you know how would you be able to
trust<00:02:20.200> a<00:02:20.470> product<00:02:21.040> like<00:02:21.220> this<00:02:21.280> if<00:02:21.910> you<00:02:22.000> don't

with magnas cooperation with their

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.630 
with magnas cooperation with their
engineering<00:02:29.470> department<00:02:29.980> we<00:02:30.160> said<00:02:30.370> here's

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
engineering department we said here's

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.160 
engineering department we said here's
the<00:02:30.880> variables<00:02:31.300> that<00:02:31.360> we<00:02:31.540> need<00:02:31.690> we<00:02:31.810> need<00:02:31.840> to<00:02:32.049> be

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
the variables that we need we need to be

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.009 
the variables that we need we need to be
able<00:02:32.200> to<00:02:32.500> self<00:02:33.190> align<00:02:33.519> put<00:02:34.239> it<00:02:34.360> on<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:34.900> the

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
able to self align put it on to the

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.320 
able to self align put it on to the
skate<00:02:35.260> so<00:02:35.470> it's<00:02:35.650> a<00:02:35.739> no<00:02:35.920> brainer<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.489> trainer

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
skate so it's a no brainer the trainer

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.300 
skate so it's a no brainer the trainer
that's<00:02:37.450> behind<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:37.989> bench<00:02:38.170> can<00:02:38.319> just<00:02:38.530> massage

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
that's behind the bench can just massage

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.160 
that's behind the bench can just massage
back<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:39.849> forth<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:40.299> take<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.630> trauma<00:02:40.930> out

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
back and forth and take the trauma out

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.259 
back and forth and take the trauma out
of<00:02:41.349> the<00:02:41.440> blade<00:02:41.680> yeah<00:02:42.040> and<00:02:42.280> we<00:02:42.610> set<00:02:42.849> them<00:02:42.970> up

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
of the blade yeah and we set them up

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.930 
of the blade yeah and we set them up
with<00:02:43.299> those<00:02:43.890> those<00:02:44.890> parameters<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:45.670> they

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
with those those parameters and they

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.819 
with those those parameters and they
accomplished<00:02:46.420> it<00:02:46.599> and<00:02:46.840> we<00:02:47.140> would<00:02:47.349> not<00:02:47.470> even<00:02:47.680> be

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
accomplished it and we would not even be

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.339 
accomplished it and we would not even be
close<00:02:48.069> to<00:02:48.209> having<00:02:49.209> this<00:02:49.480> device<00:02:49.810> unless<00:02:50.049> we

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
close to having this device unless we

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.470 
close to having this device unless we
had<00:02:50.530> their<00:02:50.980> engineering<00:02:51.700> expertise<00:02:52.239> since

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
had their engineering expertise since

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.390 
had their engineering expertise since
they<00:02:52.630> are<00:02:52.690> such<00:02:52.900> a<00:02:53.040> phenomenal<00:02:54.040> company<00:02:54.340> now

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
they are such a phenomenal company now

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.550 
they are such a phenomenal company now
you<00:02:54.459> did<00:02:54.700> say<00:02:54.849> it's<00:02:55.000> rechargeable<00:02:55.510> so<00:02:55.959> how

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
you did say it's rechargeable so how

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.559 
you did say it's rechargeable so how
long<00:02:56.709> does<00:02:56.799> it<00:02:56.890> take<00:02:57.130> to<00:02:57.160> recharge<00:02:57.670> about<00:02:58.450> an

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
long does it take to recharge about an

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.750 
long does it take to recharge about an
hour<00:02:58.720> and<00:02:59.140> it's<00:02:59.290> got<00:02:59.470> an<00:02:59.590> LED<00:02:59.950> inside<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.519> so

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
hour and it's got an LED inside it so

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.960 
hour and it's got an LED inside it so
right<00:03:01.390> now<00:03:01.420> it's<00:03:01.810> green<00:03:02.079> yeah<00:03:02.620> and<00:03:03.130> if<00:03:03.579> it<00:03:03.730> goes

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
right now it's green yeah and if it goes

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.050 
right now it's green yeah and if it goes
to<00:03:04.299> a<00:03:04.329> medium<00:03:04.900> to<00:03:05.650> an<00:03:05.769> orangish<00:03:06.220> color<00:03:06.280> or<00:03:06.790> red

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
to a medium to an orangish color or red

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.699 
to a medium to an orangish color or red
we<00:03:07.390> know<00:03:07.540> that<00:03:07.569> it<00:03:07.810> needs<00:03:07.959> to<00:03:08.079> be<00:03:08.170> put<00:03:08.349> back<00:03:08.470> on

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
we know that it needs to be put back on
