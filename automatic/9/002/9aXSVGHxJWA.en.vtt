00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.219
 There is do not Kurobee of Hello administrator 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:13.800
 So we would like to continue to the forecast of Satsuki Award to be carried out on April 19, 2015 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:19.380
 It is before that 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:20.460
 I 'm expecting last week 's Masamasa's next prize, but it's still the cherry blossom award to begin 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.550
 Not 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:31.259
 It is forecast of the cherry blossom award because the video is uploaded on the day before the cherry blossom award 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.790
 Mao: It 's a bit announced that if you compare with the previous data, your horse will get in shape 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:37.040
 I would like to do 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:43.100
 It is such a feeling 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:48.530
 My favorite is No.9 &amp; Rie, and I'll counter it, but I lower it a bit 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:53.570
 It became this display because the same number that Taiko's head was in line with Ne 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:55.610
 I please tell me that the 8th rouge bag is also an excellent 1.9 times 13th 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.030
 Queens ring and 18th 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:02.430
 Sky firefly 1 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:05.010
 I wear a head with a little holey, but if it gets rough then this is interesting 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:12.450
 I do not think 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:14.430
 Well wait because there is a track record of buying the Rouge bag top price excuse stallion 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:20.380
 Popular 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:25.750
 You say you I of personally have recommended No run Queens ring the central front of No. 13 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:30.670
 Because something to win the way to the Phillies review Esper was exciting personally comes to notice 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:33.450
 Still so but now it cubes &amp; Rie go in the Well data 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:39.510
 Try to reference 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:46.020
 And this is the feeling that comes in the expectation of the Satsuki Prize. 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:50.310
 It is quite strong in the rough image is out, but the Among them, No. 14 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.670
 It is the seventh floor, and this is the largest 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:02:01.979
 But the explanation left out 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:05.310
 Green letters from the horse numbers 20 years to 11 years ago Red letters from 10 years ago to last year 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:09.810
 It is a total 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:14.280
 The number of horses that came in 3rd place in 20 people's house 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:19.940
 It is released as data and No. 14 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.940
 And it continues with the 6th 2nd misunderstanding of 6th 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:28.210
 It's difficult, but I think it would be like this if you could see it in a feeling like 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.290
 I will 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:36.400
 Is doing so 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:41.680
 It is this a win popularity of rough way as if to symbolize the rough ne another race 1 in 20 years 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:48.849
 It is a popular horse that has come to wear, but I only wear it five times, such as the best or 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.280
 There is also a chance that the 15th popular horse will win. When it gets rough , people in a leading runaway type 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.770
 series 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.240
 Say that the goal is just like a 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:03:00.760
 Not high 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:05.330
 Responsibility at a loss super I think a little and I where I want to check 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:09.980
 Of the fan wipe the wound at the time of the still next week ThatLookLikeThis
