a classic kind of elegant look some easy

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.699 
a classic kind of elegant look some easy
and<00:04:11.310> almost<00:04:11.910> anybody<00:04:12.330> could<00:04:12.750> do<00:04:12.930> it<00:04:12.959> as<00:04:13.440> long

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
and almost anybody could do it as long

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:14.750 
and almost anybody could do it as long
as<00:04:13.890> you<00:04:13.980> know<00:04:14.130> how<00:04:14.280> to<00:04:14.310> operate<00:04:14.459> a

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
as you know how to operate a

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.550 
as you know how to operate a
straightener<00:04:15.510> I<00:04:15.750> like<00:04:16.290> to<00:04:16.410> use<00:04:16.530> a

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
straightener I like to use a

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.110 
straightener I like to use a
straightener<00:04:17.070> more<00:04:17.370> than<00:04:17.580> a<00:04:17.669> curling<00:04:17.940> iron

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
straightener more than a curling iron

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.659 
straightener more than a curling iron
because<00:04:18.540> when<00:04:18.780> you<00:04:18.870> use<00:04:19.049> a<00:04:19.080> curling<00:04:19.290> iron

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
because when you use a curling iron

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.580 
because when you use a curling iron
towards<00:04:20.669> the<00:04:20.790> end<00:04:20.940> you<00:04:21.209> get<00:04:21.359> that<00:04:21.540> look<00:04:21.750> like

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
towards the end you get that look like

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.290 
towards the end you get that look like
that<00:04:22.770> little<00:04:23.480> rhythm<00:04:24.950> and<00:04:25.950> I<00:04:26.910> don't<00:04:27.030> think

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
that little rhythm and I don't think

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.340 
that little rhythm and I don't think
that<00:04:27.390> looks<00:04:27.570> very<00:04:27.690> nice<00:04:27.930> at<00:04:28.110> all

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
that looks very nice at all

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.020 
that looks very nice at all
so<00:04:28.950> with<00:04:29.100> a<00:04:29.130> straightener<00:04:29.550> you<00:04:29.730> don't<00:04:29.910> get

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
so with a straightener you don't get

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.020 
so with a straightener you don't get
that<00:04:30.710> and<00:04:32.930> so<00:04:33.930> yeah

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
that and so yeah

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.840 
that and so yeah
