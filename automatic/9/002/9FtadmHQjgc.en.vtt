00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.850 
there's a way where you think about the
journey<00:01:27.000> as<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.240> whole<00:01:27.630> or<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.350> think<00:01:28.619> of

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
journey as a whole or you think of

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.429 
journey as a whole or you think of
moving<00:01:29.340> towards<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:30.000> goal<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.780> part<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
moving towards this goal is part of the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.770 
moving towards this goal is part of the
goal<00:01:31.590> itself<00:01:32.009> like<00:01:32.400> every<00:01:33.030> present<00:01:33.570> moment

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
goal itself like every present moment

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.990 
goal itself like every present moment
that<00:01:34.170> you're<00:01:34.350> working<00:01:34.829> towards<00:01:35.400> something<00:01:35.610> is

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
that you're working towards something is

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.850 
that you're working towards something is
just<00:01:36.689> as<00:01:36.810> rewarding<00:01:36.990> as<00:01:37.290> when<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.619> finally

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
just as rewarding as when you finally

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.440 
just as rewarding as when you finally
have<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.220> thing<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.820> want<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.420> then

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
have that thing that you want and then

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.330 
have that thing that you want and then
the<00:01:39.840> other<00:01:39.869> type<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.409> thinking<00:01:40.860> about<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
the other type of thinking about it the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.800 
the other type of thinking about it the
other<00:01:41.759> way<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.210> can<00:01:42.299> think<00:01:42.450> about<00:01:42.570> is

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
other way that you can think about is

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.690 
other way that you can think about is
the<00:01:42.960> destination<00:01:43.409> which<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.430> probably

with<00:06:19.400> you<00:06:19.460> guys<00:06:19.550> but<00:06:20.000> this<00:06:20.150> is<00:06:20.270> a<00:06:20.300> pretty<00:06:20.630> short

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
with you guys but this is a pretty short

with you guys but this is a pretty short
gameplay<00:06:21.490> and<00:06:22.490> we're<00:06:22.640> already<00:06:22.790> like<00:06:23.030> past<00:06:23.420> six

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:23.870 
gameplay and we're already like past six

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.180 
gameplay and we're already like past six
minutes<00:06:24.200> into<00:06:24.290> it<00:06:24.560> but<00:06:24.680> I<00:06:24.710> hope<00:06:24.890> I<00:06:24.950> got<00:06:25.070> at

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
minutes into it but I hope I got at

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:26.560 
minutes into it but I hope I got at
least<00:06:25.250> a<00:06:25.460> few<00:06:25.640> points<00:06:26.030> out<00:06:26.150> to<00:06:26.300> you<00:06:26.360> guys<00:06:26.540> that

makes sense I think that it's really

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.550 
makes sense I think that it's really
important<00:06:29.600> to<00:06:29.660> think<00:06:29.870> about<00:06:30.050> both<00:06:30.410> the

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 
important to think about both the

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.170 
important to think about both the
journey<00:06:30.830> and<00:06:31.130> the<00:06:31.190> destination<00:06:31.730> as<00:06:32.030> you're
