00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:10.719
 [Music] 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.790
 for different I hope they feel very good 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.559
 here of blacks and with the video title 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.299
 Today I'm going to show you how to use a 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.790
 command of playstation 3 as a gateway 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.800
 on your android device so what 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.180
 need to do all this we will 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.910
 to see how it does everything needed 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.560
 obviously control not play 3 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.320
 it matters if it's original is not generic 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.630
 that's the first thing they're going to need 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.520
 They need what you should already have 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.510
 which is the cable with which they connect it to 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.300
 his play 3 with which they load their control 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.910
 that cable with which connects it also 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.910
 achieves a pair obviously need a 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:49.370
 phone with android that support 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.810
 tg ok where I give why why where not 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.280
 because you have to export this because 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.220
 let's use it through a cable or 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.600
 knitting these cables are not very expensive les 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.830
 I'm going to leave here the cheapest link that 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.080
 found in the description either of 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.730
 amazon play price guideline of 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.050
 any firm or company that 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.250
 international shipments I will leave link 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.900
 It is cheaper than under the 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.550
 The description is not very 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.810
 they are really cheap and I already had that 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.490
 over here so just how to use 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.980
 that's precisely why it has to be 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.440
 compatible your device with 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.630
 we knew it from go to be able to use 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.890
 this little cable so if you already have 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.300
 everything you need because let's start 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.950
 with him so good friends and we 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.170
 here everything we need to do 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.670
 this procedure and it is clear that 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.290
 like most impacts do not 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.460
 it works with all the games but it 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.500
 I'm going to show some of those that do 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.880
 they work and it works with all 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.770
 emulators that use either mule door 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.530
 of nintendo of game boy of nintendo ds 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.900
 of pcp etc. any emulator with 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.640
 these dysfunctional this gamepad and 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.170
 some games, so is it 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.490
 then it is very easy to do already 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.630
 can imagine more or less how is the 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:51.200
 process first took control 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.969
 play and we connect it 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.310
 to our cable what normally 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:56.980
 we do when we are going to load us ready 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.990
 from there 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.570
 we take our device and we 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:05.070
 OTG cable connect it down here to 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.110
 we connect the micro usb and finally 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.160
 simply what we do is connect 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.860
 the entry of the control to the entrance here 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.990
 and ready 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.430
 then that's all you have to 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.810
 do once they do it in fact 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.220
 start flashing over as 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.580
 you can see there and then below 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.990
 let's see how it works 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.150
 so good friends once you already 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.470
 have all done simply can 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.330
 use some keys like in bray 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.370
 press this button and it starts me 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.049
 show part of it 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.150
 of the phone as you can see the keys 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.010
 they are used there as you can see 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.349
 on the back the phone is interacting 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.989
 and now you can even navigate like this 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.310
 for the interface and everything I'm going to show 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.629
 some games after some 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.129
 simulators with which it works so 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.349
 let's start like most of the 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.360
 gamepad not all work but with 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:53.650
 some all and then this for 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.650
 example is that you racing 2 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.760
 As you can see it works without problem 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.990
 one then I'll put the phone 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.990
 here to be seen 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.670
 now we move on to another game that also 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.370
 accept this type of gamepad that is 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.310
 trigger then for you to see 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.480
 which also function as back there and 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.480
 we're playing 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.109
 not with all the interface of the game 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:43.849
 it works there are some parts that we imitate 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:47.439
 touch the screen but to be able to play 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.439
 here it works without problems 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.489
 It is worth mentioning that they can not configure 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.170
 the control keys but they have 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.780
 have to try one key to see 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.239
 which makes an option and which does not 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.680
 then it is a point to consider it 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.030
 as I said friends with all the 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.870
 emulators will work for example 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.720
 here we have a game boy emulator 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.250
 let's try it so they see there is 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.010
 as you can see we move we can 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.050
 play here we have the interaction all 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.970
 works perfectly fine not then 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.970
 if they can be playing here let's see 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.470
 [Music] 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:39.070
 [Applause] 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.300
 and good and finally to finish what 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.240
 I'm showing you how to use a 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.070
 psp emulator which is from the 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.200
 same controls that are and then here the 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.260
 Most keys work perfectly 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:54.100
 alright so let's put this let's 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:56.380
 see a blog 6 and how to put us here 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.510
 We are moving here work almost 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.470
 all the keys because it's like fsp 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.470
 everything has a functions 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.719
 and they do not even get to see 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.180
 that part of the emulator when 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:12.910
 press any key is pressed and also 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.860
 as you can see 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.860
 then all pretty well 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.599
 then it is possible 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.300
 then as you see here it works all 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.070
 perfectly fine 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.990
 [Music] 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.720
 and good friends to finish I'm going to 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.950
 teach something that I created more or 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.950
 less so that unity is what they can 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:45.930
 do if they get something witty with 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.420
 this part of creating your own 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.910
 gamepad so 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.170
 let me show you something that I did and 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.060
 as you can see friends this is a 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.530
 gamepad that I have made with articles 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.690
 I had in my house so with objects 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.760
 they have my house or using control 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.620
 this accessory that already had it and 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.600
 holding control with a clip that was 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.390
 which came to me in the case griffin 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.550
 Well that's how I have it fixed and 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:11.240
 with that it is easier and it is more practical and 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.240
 that from here 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:17.870
 can be playing and everything then like 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:20.030
 I say it is an improvised gamepad 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:23.420
 but that works without any 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:25.700
 problem is like first and 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.870
 you have a better experience not because 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.700
 because we already have here up 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.990
 cell as classic gamepad is that 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.970
 they can buy then everything they can 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.100
 do with your with articles that 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.840
 find in your home to adapt it 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.880
 better not even if you have some cover 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.940
 poster clip of the one that has these clips 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.230
 and he puts on his pants too what 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.640
 you can do I already tried it with another 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:46.400
 phone that if you have to found and 

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.780
 It worked well then as now friends 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.190
 with those mobiles asking I hope he has 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.750
 liked this video remember with 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.490
 clarity if that cable vga and then already the 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.380
 other criteria was for 8 gold and how they 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.030
 I said if you put a little abuse or 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.700
 Astute can build their own 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:00.500
 gamepad with your control as you can see 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.850
 here not then friends then with that 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.230
 moving I hope you liked this 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:07.060
 video see you in a next video peace 

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:07.060
 the very nice ciao
