00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
don't actually have one out with the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.670 
don't actually have one out with the
packaging<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.670> show<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.530> for<00:01:13.530> two

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
packaging to show you and for two

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.249 
packaging to show you and for two
reasons<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.460> one<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.060> them<00:01:15.240> being<00:01:15.540> obviously

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
reasons and one of them being obviously

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.660 
reasons and one of them being obviously
this<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.530> an<00:01:16.650> exclusive<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.460> very

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
this is an exclusive and very

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.090 
this is an exclusive and very
sought-after<00:01:18.150> figure<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:19.799> I'm<00:01:19.860> not

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
sought-after figure and so I'm not

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.770 
sought-after figure and so I'm not
really<00:01:20.280> keen<00:01:20.580> on<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.850> idea<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.180> opening<00:01:21.630> it

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
really keen on the idea of opening it

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.749 
really keen on the idea of opening it
and<00:01:21.810> checking<00:01:22.350> out<00:01:22.560> with<00:01:22.680> packaging<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.280> know

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
and checking out with packaging I know

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.609 
and checking out with packaging I know
so<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.060> second<00:01:24.420> point<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.900> fact<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.409> you

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
so the second point is the fact that you

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.330 
so the second point is the fact that you
know<00:01:25.770> this<00:01:26.130> figure<00:01:26.900> in<00:01:27.900> particular<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.740> a

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340

as a rocket-firing Boba Fett figure it's
obviously<00:03:46.630> the<00:03:46.780> backpack<00:03:47.200> would<00:03:47.380> fire<00:03:47.560> a

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
obviously the backpack would fire a

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.430 
obviously the backpack would fire a
missile<00:03:47.850> then<00:03:48.850> during<00:03:49.269> that<00:03:49.390> same<00:03:49.780> year<00:03:49.989> prior

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
missile then during that same year prior

I'll give you a comparison of the two
Boba<00:04:48.740> Fett<00:04:48.969> obviously<00:04:49.969> this<00:04:50.120> one<00:04:50.270> is<00:04:50.419> the

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
Boba Fett obviously this one is the

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.619 
Boba Fett obviously this one is the
vintage<00:04:51.860> male<00:04:52.460> away<00:04:52.729> and<00:04:53.060> this<00:04:53.270> is<00:04:53.449> the

00:04:53.619 --> 00:04:53.629 
vintage male away and this is the

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:56.709 
vintage male away and this is the
vintage<00:04:54.319> modern<00:04:55.090> so<00:04:56.090> as<00:04:56.150> you<00:04:56.240> can<00:04:56.360> see<00:04:56.509> all<00:04:56.629> the

00:04:56.709 --> 00:04:56.719 
vintage modern so as you can see all the

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:58.570 
vintage modern so as you can see all the
paint<00:04:56.960> applications<00:04:57.590> and<00:04:57.770> the<00:04:57.860> sculpting<00:04:58.430> are

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
paint applications and the sculpting are

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.499 
paint applications and the sculpting are
far<00:04:59.389> superior<00:04:59.810> today<00:05:01.180> but<00:05:02.180> the<00:05:02.240> figures

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:02.509 
far superior today but the figures

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:05.260 
far superior today but the figures
filled<00:05:02.750> with<00:05:02.990> a<00:05:03.020> lot<00:05:03.139> very<00:05:03.349> cool<00:05:03.699> and<00:05:04.699> once

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
filled with a lot very cool and once

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.790 
filled with a lot very cool and once
again<00:05:05.590> serves<00:05:06.590> as<00:05:06.800> great<00:05:07.129> nostalgia<00:05:08.590> in<00:05:09.590> terms

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
again serves as great nostalgia in terms

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.100 
again serves as great nostalgia in terms
of<00:05:09.919> articulation<00:05:10.789> obviously<00:05:11.419> it<00:05:11.539> wasn't<00:05:11.870> what

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
of articulation obviously it wasn't what

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.369 
of articulation obviously it wasn't what
it<00:05:12.139> is<00:05:12.229> today<00:05:12.349> back<00:05:13.039> in<00:05:13.069> the<00:05:13.310> 1970s<00:05:14.060> and<00:05:14.120> 1980s

00:05:14.369 --> 00:05:14.379 
it is today back in the 1970s and 1980s

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:17.110 
it is today back in the 1970s and 1980s
so<00:05:15.379> this<00:05:15.529> guy<00:05:15.710> has<00:05:15.949> the<00:05:16.129> simple<00:05:16.520> four<00:05:16.759> points

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
so this guy has the simple four points

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.179 
so this guy has the simple four points
of<00:05:17.150> articulation<00:05:17.500> you<00:05:18.500> know<00:05:18.589> the<00:05:18.710> swivel<00:05:18.860> neck

00:05:19.179 --> 00:05:19.189 
of articulation you know the swivel neck

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:21.029 
of articulation you know the swivel neck
civil<00:05:19.669> shoulders<00:05:20.060> and<00:05:20.300> swivel<00:05:20.689> hips

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 
civil shoulders and swivel hips

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:23.320 
civil shoulders and swivel hips
obviously<00:05:22.039> there<00:05:22.310> were<00:05:22.370> no<00:05:22.520> ball<00:05:22.819> joints<00:05:23.240> or

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
obviously there were no ball joints or

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.499 
obviously there were no ball joints or
anything<00:05:23.509> like<00:05:23.689> that<00:05:23.749> back<00:05:24.080> then<00:05:25.089> or<00:05:26.089> if<00:05:26.300> there

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:26.509 
anything like that back then or if there

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:28.119 
anything like that back then or if there
were<00:05:26.689> Star<00:05:27.139> Wars<00:05:27.259> figures<00:05:27.529> certainly<00:05:27.889> didn't

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:28.129 
were Star Wars figures certainly didn't

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:34.209 
were Star Wars figures certainly didn't
have<00:05:28.279> them<00:05:31.449> as<00:05:32.449> you<00:05:32.569> can<00:05:32.599> see<00:05:32.990> very<00:05:33.229> different

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:34.219 
have them as you can see very different

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:37.709 
have them as you can see very different
to<00:05:34.639> what<00:05:34.669> we<00:05:34.939> get<00:05:35.150> on<00:05:35.389> shelves<00:05:35.839> today

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:37.719 
to what we get on shelves today

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:40.149 
to what we get on shelves today
obviously<00:05:38.719> you've<00:05:38.870> got<00:05:38.899> the<00:05:39.229> rocket<00:05:39.949> firing

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:40.159 
obviously you've got the rocket firing
