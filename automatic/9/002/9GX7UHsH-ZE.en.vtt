00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
but i'll post the game place and then i

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.930 
but i'll post the game place and then i
have<00:02:41.580> like<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.380> five-game<00:02:43.380> session<00:02:43.860> on<00:02:44.040> mw3<00:02:44.700> i

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
have like a five-game session on mw3 i

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.880 
have like a five-game session on mw3 i
think<00:02:45.269> i<00:02:45.360> can't<00:02:45.540> record<00:02:45.840> like<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:46.170> live<00:02:46.380> convo

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
think i can't record like a live convo

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.250 
think i can't record like a live convo
because<00:02:47.250> it<00:02:47.970> makes<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:48.510> screen<00:02:48.810> all<00:02:48.959> choppy

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
because it makes the screen all choppy

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.750 
because it makes the screen all choppy
so<00:02:49.650> i<00:02:49.680> don't<00:02:49.950> think<00:02:50.130> you<00:02:50.190> guys<00:02:50.310> want<00:02:50.580> to<00:02:50.670> see

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
so i don't think you guys want to see

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.759 
so i don't think you guys want to see
they<00:02:50.910> really<00:02:51.120> jumpy<00:02:51.480> screen<00:02:51.780> when<00:02:52.680> i'm

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
they really jumpy screen when i'm

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.560 
they really jumpy screen when i'm
playing<00:02:52.920> but<00:02:53.640> I<00:02:53.910> had<00:02:54.209> to<00:02:54.300> see<00:02:54.450> the

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
playing but I had to see the

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.090 
playing but I had to see the
commentaries<00:02:55.170> over<00:02:55.440> them<00:02:55.590> so<00:02:55.830> it's<00:02:55.980> not<00:02:56.040> that

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
commentaries over them so it's not that

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.199 
commentaries over them so it's not that
big<00:02:56.310> of<00:02:56.459> a<00:02:56.550> deal<00:02:58.550> you'll<00:02:59.550> see<00:02:59.730> me<00:02:59.850> at<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.030> end
