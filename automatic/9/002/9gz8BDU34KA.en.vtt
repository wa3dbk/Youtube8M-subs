00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 for the release of seizures well, very important 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:06.330
 don't provoke because in 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.980
 conflict situation very often 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.099
 happens so the topic of the cat came for 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.140
 hand there by the shoulder of this people then took yes 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.360
 these are soft 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.390
 such a soft sounding she with one 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.440
 parties if we allow ourselves 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.900
 grab it already like we would 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.430
 show your weakness here on the other 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.660
 sides if i start breaking out right now 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.210
 arm it will just be leaning he 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.520
 reborn immediately year that is like this 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.480
 how to calibrate that is if 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.700
 I was not taken to me 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.380
 just just a nanny removing her hands and 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.960
 show the type departed aside not 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.300
 type do not need hands everything is fine and 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.880
 or trying to take you to the Armenians 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.890
 grab just hands removed everything and 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.260
 calm talk showed their 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.879
 own territory 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:55.680
 if the capture is more coarse 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:58.170
 so this is still the same on not too 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.750
 fight but already more aggressive thing 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.960
 so well here it is grabbing george and 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.480
 already we bring down and further very important 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.960
 explode emotionally that is show 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.480
 type chose what you throw off but not yet 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.950
 threw well and if happens already 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.460
 capture is permissible 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.600
 there you have a man there grabbed his neck well 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.670
 assume a standard version 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.710
 grabbed but here already of course only 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.220
 fight you court rf class face and so on 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.200
 this is the basic principle 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.240
 resistances ie in a fight in any 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.009
 tucked here already everything is not necessary not 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.649
 we talk than the maximum aggression 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.869
 maximum rage is one exception 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.850
 when you grab for such things 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.040
 not very good prizes for the neck 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.140
 suggested even gently here already in principle 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.369
 you can beat because everything and even 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.640
 psychologically 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.799
 as a way but a threat to life like these 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.060
 carotid arteries so on here there is still 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.189
 things that are more stringent as 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.380
 let's just punish this tack 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.060
 Here such yes it can be soft but also 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.070
 and we are in the second model that is dramatically 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.590
 We bring down what you take away your hands that is, yes 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.780
 if readiness comes 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.439
 whack completely but that way 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.660
 it will be 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:13.010
 and adequacy and well and ability later 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:20.190
 still there is such a thing yes if the person 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:22.590
 let's say it just makes sense to you . 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.150
 it makes sense to take just such a stand 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.140
 here calmly calm dude on the very 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.490
 you are standing in front 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.160
 here and in case of need 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.840
 come closer you can hit yes there in 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.590
 throat can be removed can be hit in the face 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.390
 in case you have any swing there 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.990
 there goes to the trash who can 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.060
 calmly 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.090
 put a defense down there and so on 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.950
 and that is this one 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:50.170
 fine line between fight and just 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.510
 conflict because if i'm in conflict 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.980
 I will immediately stand 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.050
 just have to have everything we will fight to 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.310
 why this is necessary and if I am on 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.030
 really stand standing at him 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.590
 is almost the same here if 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.600
 need i can respond i can 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.350
 bounce if needed I can attack 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.430
 it even happens when we are there 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.760
 conflict situation just pop hit 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.200
 man that time you can 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.540
 show calmly how much 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.750
 man gets up again you can hit 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.030
 that is, it is again important moment 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.700
 urban self defense thin fabric 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.870
 sports absolutely now in urban 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:31.299
 conditions to break the cameras is not 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.640
 the audience and the witness that is to show 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:38.070
 peaceful intends yes that is if if you 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:41.140
 permissible goin i gotta first strike 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.670
 supposedly attacking justified i must first 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.579
 hit the first case just if I miss 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.610
 the first blow of him that dared get up here and 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:50.440
 if you start beating me i mean i am 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.930
 answer I'll start it will fight one fight 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.940
 well, how to fight evenly always 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.269
 harder ie it is important to act on 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.769
 lead always i talked about it and 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:02.140
 if i'm showing up like this 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.299
 no i'm kind of soothing yes and you 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.820
 you go to me and then I start to beat 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:09.519
 the viewer and the witnesses can confirm 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.760
 what I did not want well the camera did not try yes 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:14.680
 I tried to leave before and that's when a person is not 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.970
 I understood, but I just had to defend myself 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.590
 and then you can tell me 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.600
 it seemed its own knife in the hand there and so 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.780
 Further, that is, there are such subtleties 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.340
 moments that are often due to 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.200
 violations of these rules are often 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.200
 problems everything is clear thanks mihail
