00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.029
 Beauty talks anguish Galleys was with more 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.980
 a video and good people this video here is 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.500
 to get more doubts from a galley that 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.530
 is always using the same good thing 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.260
 in this video here to decide from time to time 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:19.740
 answer is or how are they there? 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.960
 vocations of the game that each one is vocation 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.600
 uses the type of weapon that uses which 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.859
 are the powers then without further ado 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.949
 a personal side 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.349
 the first vocation is the fighter who 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.829
 uses only a normal sword but for the 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.930
 and a shield has nothing like that. 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.180
 so special you want to know I do not 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.540
 I recommend a very good class 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.040
 use only the shield and sword so let's go 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.340
 for the second class which is the steroid 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.739
 Jorge is like I said, some started 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.170
 can choose fighter history a maggi 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.710
 I recommend among these three malls 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.899
 they will be able to use a dagger and a short air 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.440
 a lot of people ask the conference 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:04.019
 registry rangers are based on the 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.860
 top recommended if you look the same warning 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.020
 is using your staff is there without 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.799
 nothing special will be able to do magic 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.380
 of conjuring some is weak attack 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.860
 elements so I do not find a class 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.369
 very strong so this game is horror 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:27.299
 that Honore is a very strong class 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:30.450
 person who is and who uses the sword 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.670
 hammer of long war and this classic 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.549
 or when you deal with it you 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.439
 earns a lot of hp and remembering this class is 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.920
 very slow and always uses a very 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.659
 heavy then it's pros and cons use is you 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.659
 to earn a lot goes life with 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.850
 she is light with her and you are going to take 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.689
 a lot of damage to use but it has changed 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.640
 this weapon 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.340
 but if I get really slow and will win 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.460
 because they are no more than leads with 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:59.009
 this is class or else to spend here is 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.380
 more totally than the rangers is me already 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.380
 I used a lot of car sales range and 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.750
 I wear mascara the arc of the rangel frame 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.789
 long this bow has a lot of staff 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.619
 mainly the support of lc that I use 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:15.049
 has 1,300 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:18.510
 66 only damages the bow and now has 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:20.610
 1,429 If I'm not mistaken it is and arranges for 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.549
 me is best class that use has the 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.890
 powers, she denies that the 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:28.530
 software uses dagger but the archaeologist 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.150
 long strip which is however much damage 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.280
 an act that has reduced speed 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.650
 You will not attack arrow so fast. 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.610
 When you let go, you're from abroad. 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.709
 murder 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.209
 people here also have the software that 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.840
 I recommend to anyone who wants to play 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.970
 of a class that the magic consortium 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.829
 The following person is the only one who is 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.319
 that the half advanced half of us the most and 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:51.269
 more days of healing and the software you most 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.540
 frequent attacks with a 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.940
 hurricane is an electric storm too 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.849
 is fire then those who want a 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.310
 class wizard and aggressive wizard 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:06.000
 know your class and missing teams 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.560
 here misc nardi was for me it's a 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.810
 best way to play for a long time 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.269
 but now unfortunately it is not over and 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.950
 Native whiskeys or it is a very good one 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.609
 Great class recommended to anyone 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.970
 Like 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:21.060
 he uses the same normal sword person 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.060
 for which the fighter uses he uses the key and 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.419
 also uses the steffi that would be the staff 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.639
 there the magician is also using this and 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:31.680
 Good folks are the following here. 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:33.329
 besides using these three types of weapons 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.030
 is not using Mexico 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:38.940
 shields is not a normal shell is a 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:42.209
 magic circle that repels and blows 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.970
 magicians is light and dark that repels 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.250
 magic blow and is a shield difference of 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.449
 Shield vision always of medium size has 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.280
 a very cool look for James 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:52.500
 knight without speaking in the attacks films that 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.780
 we have the month brings much everywhere 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.030
 good tone and do not talk but who wants to use 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.459
 A Classical Magic and Strength Story 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.919
 physics a very good class and we go here 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.319
 next to the famous killer and 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:06.060
 many people ask why it is the 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.750
 classic I'll're talking here person 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.459
 she uses a dagger uses medium sword sword 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.340
 it is the same sword that the fact is that the 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:17.340
 missionary uses she also uses the bow 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.560
 arch history course and also uses the 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.269
 dark shield the fighter 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.840
 and why this cause so good personal to 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.330
 this cause all 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.130
 today venezuela has skills are very 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.930
 good as the last one that recommends that 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.570
 you come in the last month the vocation that is 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.850
 What you become invisible is the 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.979
 invincibility is a very 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.690
 good only you not the taking of the enemies 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.880
 they do not see you 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.530
 but he likes it a lot, it's more the 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.600
 invisibility I am is for me it's a 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.449
 the best skills of the game without 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.400
 doubt we are here then in 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:50.919
 Last call of a thing I played 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.360
 I think I've been enjoying myself too. 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.889
 quite a game with this 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.889
 classy a long time ago now sundays 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:58.900
 but as I said I only use rangers more 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:04.300
 average art was one thing I played quite a bit 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:07.690
 and she uses the spare tire would be the staff 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:10.750
 the next people's spell is and is also usa 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:13.150
 the dahlia these attack weapons and the bow 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.970
 staff is the good doctor is a magic bow 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.740
 Let loose is punches marks of course and 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:21.850
 What do I recommend? 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:24.070
 art is that who is given is several danni 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:27.340
 at the same time medium art books and is 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:29.770
 clear with the damage more because it's okay 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.750
 High also arthur doctor is then I 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.389
 I think a very good thing here you can 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.550
 use from here malek the trailer that the rangers 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:38.740
 that the killer uses the doctor 's art 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.750
 also attacked the only ones then I 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.700
 I recommend to anyone who wants to get and go 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.610
 Once the doctor receives the art, the 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.090
 good is a song that asks you head I 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.240
 speak 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.820
 the difference of the software through it is 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.740
 The difference is in your staff the same 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.539
 car you use on the wizard you can not 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.780
 use the wizard to recognize a staff 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:06:01.139
 and another type of fucking channel that would be 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.940
 the cause of the attack would be the sorcerer 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:06.160
 So, you have to tell yourself too. 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.530
 but not only then is this is does not have 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.450
 mystery tac all game classes 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.880
 I wanted to know what each one does 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:16.780
 type of weapon you use is what kind of 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.099
 attack is I think it's pretty cool dg da 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.440
 People always ask one thing. 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:22.180
 little chance of using with klose I should not 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.130
 use I think this video went well 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.260
 explanatory then personal and if you 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:30.690
 liked olic favorite sign up for 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.690
 channel a big hug to all and went
