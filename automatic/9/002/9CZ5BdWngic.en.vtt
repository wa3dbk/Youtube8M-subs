00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.099
 more jobs bundesliga oracle des 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.019
 topspiels bayer 04 leverkusen against 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.210

 takes place on 14 12 05 10 and has 30 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.869
 then we always start the sound 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.150
 suppose I have bernd leno on the 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.380
 left side at bayer 04 leverkusen and 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.130

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.619
 summer 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.320
 that means yann summer has a defense 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.460
 worth of 80 teachers out of 88 that is 1 0 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.050
 for emptiness 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.500
 it continues with the right parties 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.890

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.549
 leverkusen wendel fend off with 71 and 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.530
 at borussia monchengladbach alvaro 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.790
 dominguez the last partie too 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.229
 played as a left-back because of that 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.610
 I have here as a left-back 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.799
 in every case year 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.380
 Wendel doubts more that's called yes 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.600
 leader for leverkusen 3 2 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.090
 we continue with the first six 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.420
 others like Bayer 04 leverkusen 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.880
 lars bender the surrender captain 80 defense 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.890
 44 attacked a really good card and 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.250
 near bavaria near borussia monchengladbach 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.490
 sorry we have granit shaka and 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.909
 bernhard both values ​​higher than granite 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.130
 shaka that means another hit 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.450
 namely leadership hit leverkusen builds 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.479
 the leadership is active 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.500
 42 now the second six ag are on 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.989
 I start at Borussia 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.000
 monchengladbach christoph kramer 80 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.540
 43 is almost attacking 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.579
 equally good balance 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.430
 at bayer 04 leverkusen we have for it 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:20.200
 could castro and then we turn the 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.849
 just say it's kramer 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.230
 said so five more attacks 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.319
 if he values ​​the two up here 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.709
 will turn and for that but castro 6 from 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.849
 more 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:33.519
 that means yes castro told to see here 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:35.799
 renewed strike 52 between offensive 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.829
 at bayer 04 we have leverkusen karim 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.629
 bellarabi who is already his 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:42.700
 national team flowered graduated in 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.260
 the national team with judy lions 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.450
 with the right midfield then too 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.120
 here at borussia monchengladbach 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.359
 Patrick Herrmann and Hermann have both 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.519
 values ​​are better, that is a small one 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:56.049
 connecting hit 53 so on it goes 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.409
 the left midfielder names like 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.639
 at bayer 04 leverkusen heute spielt ja 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:02.290
 However in the left midfield at 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.090
 I have leverkusen here as left 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.760
 middle fields scored 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:11.409
 at borussia monchengladbach ibrahima 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.569
 Traore and he has 17 defense more and 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:14.889
 may be worth attacking at 6 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.519
 less but still it is one 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:20.409
 difference and 11 and that means 4 5 to 4 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.060
 for leverkusen but still 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.659
 gladbach always comes a bit now 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.609
 get closer 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:27.069
 who knows, maybe people will end this 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.900
 play with the victory for leverkusen victory 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.569
 for gladbach who knows people stays on 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.310
 Anyway it goes with it 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.220
 the attacking midfielder took 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.909
 we at bayer 04 leverkusen hakan kutlu 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.709
 and met at borussia monchengladbach 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:43.419
 Raphael has fended off 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.040
 raphael starplayer you see 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:47.079
 probably and worth the attack 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.329
 Both have 81 that is 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.680
 equalizer hit gladbacher scores the 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.629
 the 55th 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.229
 so is all or nothing more love 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:58.540
 friends the strikers are tuned 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:04:01.359
 namely at Bayer 04 leverkusen have 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.069
 we stefan kießling with 83 attack 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:05.590
 all star player and borussia 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.389
 mönchengladbach we have max kruse and 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.109
 he has an intervention I'll have 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:13.359
 my hand still in front of an attack of 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:15.519
 83 that means no one gets one 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:18.970
 hits and the tops bundesliga oracle 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:20.440
 Ends five to five people like me 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.680
 said that tops bundesliga 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.930
 landed 525 leverkusen five gates 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.040
 gladbach five goals as I said 55 wrong 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.210
 and I believe 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.740
 something we had never been there are 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.780
 a draw at the end I know 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.400
 Not at all the game ends 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.000
 as I said for five years to the third 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:40.360
 times in four, I share the result 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.060
 two to four the reality of course 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.890
 clearly torn 55 ie 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.050
 either end the result as that 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.970
 result 2 23 23 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.430
 Note the conclusion a draw 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.200
 would say times tomorrow 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.000
 rhine at the advent calendar door or 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.850
 next week if you prefer the 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.230
 tops bundesliga looks in people have 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.230
 regional the risk aversion
