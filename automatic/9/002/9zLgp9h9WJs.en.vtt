from<00:04:41.390> there<00:04:41.630> I<00:04:41.660> was<00:04:41.990> really<00:04:42.230> like<00:04:42.700> throwing<00:04:43.700> up

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
from there I was really like throwing up

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.550 
from there I was really like throwing up
a<00:04:43.970> bucket<00:04:44.300> and<00:04:44.420> sweating<00:04:44.840> and<00:04:44.840> bleep<00:04:45.140> I<00:04:45.380> was

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
a bucket and sweating and bleep I was

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.590 
a bucket and sweating and bleep I was
really<00:04:45.770> paying<00:04:45.980> so<00:04:46.340> about<00:04:47.120> half<00:04:47.300> an<00:04:47.480> hour

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
really paying so about half an hour

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.510 
really paying so about half an hour
after<00:04:47.930> I<00:04:48.110> drank<00:04:48.410> the<00:04:48.530> coke<00:04:48.770> I<00:04:48.950> really<00:04:49.220> started

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
after I drank the coke I really started

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.150 
after I drank the coke I really started
to<00:04:49.669> feel<00:04:49.850> better<00:04:50.030> so<00:04:50.419> i<00:04:50.630> guess<00:04:51.230> it<00:04:51.410> was<00:04:51.560> just<00:04:51.590> my

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
to feel better so i guess it was just my

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.270 
to feel better so i guess it was just my
lacking<00:04:53.060> of<00:04:53.180> sugar<00:04:53.600> but<00:04:53.780> 27<00:04:54.560> degrees<00:04:54.919> although

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
lacking of sugar but 27 degrees although

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.920 
lacking of sugar but 27 degrees although
it's<00:04:55.760> like<00:04:56.000> eight<00:04:56.210> o'clock<00:04:56.480> in<00:04:56.660> the<00:04:56.690> evening

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
it's like eight o'clock in the evening

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.260 
it's like eight o'clock in the evening
so<00:04:57.400> actually<00:04:58.400> it's<00:04:58.550> pretty<00:04:58.760> hard<00:04:59.000> to<00:04:59.060> walk

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
so actually it's pretty hard to walk
