but<00:03:08.150> in<00:03:08.390> this<00:03:08.510> game<00:03:08.630> they<00:03:08.959> actually<00:03:09.230> throw

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
but in this game they actually throw

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.840 
but in this game they actually throw
quite<00:03:09.650> a<00:03:09.709> bit<00:03:09.890> at<00:03:09.980> you<00:03:10.130> and<00:03:10.280> I<00:03:10.340> tried<00:03:10.610> to<00:03:10.730> use

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
quite a bit at you and I tried to use

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:17.760 
quite a bit at you and I tried to use
them<00:03:11.060> more<00:03:11.780> often<00:03:11.989> than<00:03:12.260> normally<00:03:12.709> do

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.440 

but<00:03:18.770> you'll<00:03:18.920> probably<00:03:19.130> run<00:03:19.520> out<00:03:19.670> of<00:03:19.700> ammo<00:03:20.120> so

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
but you'll probably run out of ammo so

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.230 
but you'll probably run out of ammo so
just<00:03:21.440> use<00:03:21.800> cover<00:03:22.160> and<00:03:22.430> slide<00:03:22.730> from<00:03:22.940> one<00:03:22.970> piece

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
just use cover and slide from one piece

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.370 
just use cover and slide from one piece
of<00:03:23.360> cover<00:03:23.480> to<00:03:23.630> the<00:03:23.690> other<00:03:23.870> if<00:03:24.080> you<00:03:24.170> press

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
of cover to the other if you press

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.840 
of cover to the other if you press
circle<00:03:24.680> and<00:03:25.040> kind<00:03:25.220> of<00:03:25.250> hold<00:03:25.460> in<00:03:25.580> the<00:03:25.640> direction

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
circle and kind of hold in the direction

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.670 
circle and kind of hold in the direction
you<00:03:26.120> want<00:03:26.150> to<00:03:26.360> go<00:03:26.420> sometimes<00:03:27.410> you<00:03:27.530> can<00:03:27.650> just

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
and one thing that I've noticed a lot of

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.450 
and one thing that I've noticed a lot of
games<00:05:55.630> doing<00:05:55.990> now<00:05:56.110> that<00:05:56.139> I<00:05:56.620> don't<00:05:57.130> know<00:05:57.250> if

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
games doing now that I don't know if

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.850 
games doing now that I don't know if
they<00:05:58.419> kept<00:05:59.139> it<00:05:59.259> the<00:05:59.380> same<00:05:59.410> way<00:05:59.740> I'm

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
they kept it the same way I'm

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.499 
they kept it the same way I'm
multiplayer<00:06:00.370> or<00:06:00.490> even<00:06:00.789> if<00:06:00.910> there<00:06:01.030> are<00:06:01.210> turrets

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:01.509 
multiplayer or even if there are turrets

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:04.830 
multiplayer or even if there are turrets
on<00:06:01.630> multiplayer<00:06:02.050> but<00:06:02.410> I<00:06:02.680> hate<00:06:03.550> oh<00:06:03.849> I<00:06:04.509> don't

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
on multiplayer but I hate oh I don't

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.050 
on multiplayer but I hate oh I don't
hate<00:06:05.050> it<00:06:05.080> but<00:06:05.380> it<00:06:05.560> seems<00:06:05.800> kind<00:06:06.069> of<00:06:06.099> dumb<00:06:06.610> to

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
hate it but it seems kind of dumb to

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.629 
hate it but it seems kind of dumb to
have<00:06:07.240> the<00:06:07.599> overheating<00:06:08.380> turrets<00:06:08.830> when<00:06:09.550> you're

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 
have the overheating turrets when you're

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:11.939 
have the overheating turrets when you're
just<00:06:09.789> playing<00:06:09.970> single<00:06:10.389> player<00:06:10.419> for<00:06:10.840> fun<00:06:11.080> and

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:11.949 
just playing single player for fun and

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:13.499 
just playing single player for fun and
this<00:06:12.460> game<00:06:12.669> doesn't<00:06:12.849> have<00:06:13.030> the<00:06:13.150> overheating

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:13.509 
this game doesn't have the overheating

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:15.870 
this game doesn't have the overheating
turrets<00:06:13.780> but<00:06:13.930> you<00:06:13.990> have<00:06:14.139> ammo<00:06:14.650> so<00:06:15.490> I<00:06:15.520> can<00:06:15.729> just

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 
turrets but you have ammo so I can just

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.469 
turrets but you have ammo so I can just
hold<00:06:16.090> down<00:06:16.180> the<00:06:16.360> trigger<00:06:16.599> forever<00:06:16.960> yeah<00:06:17.380> so

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 
hold down the trigger forever yeah so

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:20.370 
hold down the trigger forever yeah so
for<00:06:19.479> multiplayer<00:06:19.870> I<00:06:19.930> think<00:06:20.229> that's

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
for multiplayer I think that's

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.350 
for multiplayer I think that's
reasonable<00:06:20.530> and<00:06:21.340> all<00:06:21.430> kind<00:06:21.639> of<00:06:21.669> eating<00:06:21.940> right

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360 
reasonable and all kind of eating right

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.740 
reasonable and all kind of eating right
over<00:06:22.539> yeah

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.450 

now<00:06:27.750> I'm<00:06:27.990> with<00:06:28.230> trophies<00:06:28.530> house<00:06:29.280> there<00:06:29.430> a

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
now I'm with trophies house there a

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.690
