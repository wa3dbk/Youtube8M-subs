hi Austin Davis here but trust my
mechanic<00:00:02.220> calm<00:00:02.580> and<00:00:02.820> my<00:00:02.909> honest<00:00:03.120> mechanic

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
mechanic calm and my honest mechanic

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.110 
mechanic calm and my honest mechanic
calm<00:00:03.929> I<00:00:04.170> get<00:00:05.009> a<00:00:05.040> few<00:00:05.279> questions<00:00:05.670> every<00:00:05.879> now<00:00:06.000> and

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
calm I get a few questions every now and

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.810 
calm I get a few questions every now and
then<00:00:06.180> about<00:00:06.299> water<00:00:06.810> in<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.200> gasoline<00:00:07.830> people

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
then about water in the gasoline people

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.970 
then about water in the gasoline people
think<00:00:09.660> maybe<00:00:09.870> their<00:00:10.080> car<00:00:10.290> problems<00:00:10.740> are<00:00:10.860> due

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
think maybe their car problems are due

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.459 
think maybe their car problems are due
to<00:00:11.160> water<00:00:11.370> in<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.670> fuel<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.179> that<00:00:12.469> does

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
to water in the fuel and that does

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.560 
to water in the fuel and that does
happen<00:00:13.740> it's<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.250> little<00:00:14.490> bit<00:00:14.610> rare<00:00:14.880> but<00:00:15.299> we're

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
happen it's a little bit rare but we're

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.029 
happen it's a little bit rare but we're
seeing<00:00:15.839> more<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.289> more<00:00:16.379> problems<00:00:16.920> with

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
seeing more and more problems with

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.450 
seeing more and more problems with
ethanol<00:00:17.670> based<00:00:18.240> fuel<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:19.080> this<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.100> fuel

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
ethanol based fuel and this is a fuel

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.519 
ethanol based fuel and this is a fuel
sample<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:20.970> took<00:00:21.000> some<00:00:21.300> gasoline<00:00:21.689> out<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.380> a

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
sample I took some gasoline out of a

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.609 
sample I took some gasoline out of a
four-wheeler<00:00:23.010> an<00:00:23.460> ATV<00:00:24.000> that<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.300> owned<00:00:24.619> that

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
four-wheeler an ATV that I owned that

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.630 
four-wheeler an ATV that I owned that
was<00:00:25.740> having<00:00:26.010> some<00:00:26.160> trouble<00:00:27.470> running<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:29.160> kind

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
was having some trouble running it kind

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.900 
was having some trouble running it kind
of<00:00:29.699> sputters<00:00:30.210> dies<00:00:30.810> hard<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.590> start<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:32.759> this

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
of sputters dies hard to start so this

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.910 
of sputters dies hard to start so this
is<00:00:33.149> some<00:00:33.390> fuel<00:00:33.750> that's<00:00:34.079> obviously<00:00:34.500> got<00:00:34.710> some

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
is some fuel that's obviously got some

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.590 
is some fuel that's obviously got some
dirt<00:00:35.219> in<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.579> too<00:00:35.760> but<00:00:35.790> if<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.149> look<00:00:36.329> at<00:00:36.480> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
dirt in it too but if you look at the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.950 
dirt in it too but if you look at the
very<00:00:36.809> bottom<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:38.219> jar<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:39.540> see<00:00:39.780> that

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
very bottom of this jar you see that

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.650 
very bottom of this jar you see that
blob<00:00:40.350> moving<00:00:41.250> as<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.520> move<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.989> jar<00:00:43.200> around

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
blob moving as I move the the jar around

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.709 
blob moving as I move the the jar around
you<00:00:45.660> see<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:46.020> that's<00:00:46.530> water<00:00:47.510> water<00:00:48.510> will

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
you see that that's water water will

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.560 
you see that that's water water will
sink<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.289> bottom<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.770> fuel<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.570> form

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
sink to the bottom of fuel and form

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.889 
sink to the bottom of fuel and form
little<00:00:51.770> bubbles<00:00:52.770> little<00:00:53.190> glob<00:00:53.789> let's<00:00:54.059> well

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899

this<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.230> lot<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.680> fuel<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.129> jar<00:00:56.399> was<00:00:56.520> about

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
this is a lot of fuel this jar was about

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.029 
this is a lot of fuel this jar was about
half-full<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:58.260> just<00:00:58.469> kind<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.649> allowed<00:00:58.890> it

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
half-full and I just kind of allowed it

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.610 
half-full and I just kind of allowed it
to<00:00:59.129> sit<00:00:59.370> for<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.609> few<00:00:59.640> minutes<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.469> that's<00:01:01.469> how

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
to sit for a few minutes and that's how

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.930 
to sit for a few minutes and that's how
much<00:01:01.770> water<00:01:02.100> was<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.460> fuel

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
much water was in the fuel

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.359 
much water was in the fuel
I<00:01:02.969> had<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.449> drain<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.840> fuel<00:01:04.049> tank<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.589> take

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
I had to drain the fuel tank and take

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.740 
I had to drain the fuel tank and take
the<00:01:05.519> carburetor<00:01:05.820> off<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.390> clean<00:01:06.600> the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
find its way into gasoline as well so

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.060 
find its way into gasoline as well so
this<00:01:44.820> could<00:01:45.119> be<00:01:45.270> from<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:46.259> gas<00:01:46.470> station<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:46.920> got

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
this could be from the gas station I got

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.050 
this could be from the gas station I got
it<00:01:47.189> from<00:01:47.430> or<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.420> could<00:01:48.630> be<00:01:48.810> from<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:50.310> gas<00:01:50.759> can

just sitting in my garage a little too

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.600 
just sitting in my garage a little too
long<00:01:53.520> but<00:01:53.790> that's<00:01:54.570> what<00:01:54.899> water<00:01:55.350> in<00:01:55.649> fuel<00:01:56.130> looks

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
long but that's what water in fuel looks
