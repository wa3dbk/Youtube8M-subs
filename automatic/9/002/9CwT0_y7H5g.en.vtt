00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 ubisoft attacks black eyed peas 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.750
 how much wins what creates your video games 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.309
 the new assassin's multi trailer 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.490
 creed iii hi to all and the click of 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.490
 day 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.099
 in 2011 at the height of their careers 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.650
 the incredible black eyed peas have yielded 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.840
 fashionable any star of the music of 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.120
 young self-respecting the creation of a 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.739
 video game inspired by their characters 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.559
 his name is the black eyed peas 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.730
 experience and it was developed by the 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:41.500
 ubisoft studio 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.330
 the result is a dance game rather 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.160
 convincing and we suspected that 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.690
 variations of the title would see the 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.549
 day on multiple platforms 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.949
 it was also provided by contract 

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:52.690
 ios version was developed by ubisoft 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.729
 but this version will never find the 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.890
 path of the ubisoft app store not having 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:58.690
 not received validation or even the 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.879
 least return of the group on the game of which 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.879
 development cost the bagatelle of 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.199
 170 7000 euros ubisoft attacks so the 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.240
 black eyed peas in court their 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.740
 claiming reimbursement of the cost of 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.360
 development as well as the lack of 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:16.119
 win that the publisher could have gotten 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:17.560
 on sales you are very numerous to 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.700
 dream of working one day in 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.650
 the video game industry 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.140
 whether it is on jobs related to the 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.790
 programming in design or marketing 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.070
 you are probably wondering how much 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.320
 wins what creates the games we 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.120

 it is true that if talking about trades 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.960
 is one thing talk about wages is 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.700

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.430
 wages in the sector

 early in the career a programmer can 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.870
 so hope to win thirty thousand euros 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.670
 per year and up to 40000 euros with 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.920
