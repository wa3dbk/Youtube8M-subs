00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.330
 you collected by me 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:16.550
 mercedes-benz actros production this 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.500
 relay on the chair to say on this model 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.779
 plastic is very very fragile and all that 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.420
 tender passionate for something to approach 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.580
 because only collected 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:33.290
 broke off your mirror right now 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:35.730
 mean as dota me cordon 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.680
 falls out i had to be inserted 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.860
 rotate probably all the same glue because 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.860
 what 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:45.300
 inserted it quickly drops out means 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.469
 With regards to minus in this model minus 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.410
 This model is that the door is marked 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.570
 just an opening but the door doesn't open and 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.390
 make it openable and its not difficult 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.730
 why because on the side of it 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.879
 just a solid panel and glued 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.580
 and in order to make the door 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.000
 opened or take two models in one 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:13.979
 I cut out the door 2 doorway and collects from 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.280
 one or two makes how 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.290
 you can cut out the door and then under 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:25.140
 putty clean watch in general this 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:27.630
 very laborious headache may well yes 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.110
 Okay, so with regards to this model 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:35.520
 started the model has a salon salon collected 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.920

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:43.340
 sufficiently detailed detailed 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.340
 Well, minus the fact that the door does not hide 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.750
 show more detail 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:07.479
 so that xi century was better 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:10.030

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:33.099
 radiator inserted considers to look 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:39.099

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:42.190
