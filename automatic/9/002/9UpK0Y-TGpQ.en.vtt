now at 42 that you know I learned on the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.060 
now at 42 that you know I learned on the
farm<00:00:35.489> was<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.600> when<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:37.020> got<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.530> eggs<00:00:37.680> from

the hen house you did not wash them and
the<00:00:40.860> reason<00:00:41.160> why<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.340> did<00:00:41.520> not<00:00:41.550> wash<00:00:41.910> them<00:00:42.300> was

the reason why you did not wash them was

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.130 
the reason why you did not wash them was

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
pasteurized egg and this means that it

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
to these eggs that I will say number one

to these eggs that I will say number one
I<00:03:43.020> don't<00:03:43.709> care<00:03:43.920> for<00:03:44.160> them<00:03:44.570> scrambled<00:03:45.570> or<00:03:46.610> in

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
I don't care for them scrambled or in

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.570 
I don't care for them scrambled or in
fried<00:03:49.910> because<00:03:50.910> they're<00:03:51.330> rubbery<00:03:52.160> and<00:03:53.160> I

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
fried because they're rubbery and I

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.810 
fried because they're rubbery and I
probably<00:03:53.850> wouldn't<00:03:54.330> even<00:03:54.420> poach<00:03:54.780> these<00:03:55.140> I

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
probably wouldn't even poach these I

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.190 
probably wouldn't even poach these I
guess<00:03:56.820> I<00:03:56.940> can<00:03:57.120> be<00:03:57.209> a<00:03:57.239> better<00:03:57.330> try<00:03:57.660> to<00:03:57.720> see<00:03:57.989> if<00:03:58.110> I

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
guess I can be a better try to see if I

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.990 
guess I can be a better try to see if I
poached<00:03:58.440> it<00:03:58.770> if<00:03:58.860> it<00:03:59.010> would<00:03:59.160> be<00:03:59.280> any<00:03:59.430> better<00:03:59.670> but

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
poached it if it would be any better but

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.930 
poached it if it would be any better but
they're<00:04:00.209> kind<00:04:00.540> of<00:04:00.630> rubbery<00:04:01.550> but<00:04:02.550> they're<00:04:02.760> good

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
they're kind of rubbery but they're good

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.360 
they're kind of rubbery but they're good

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.360 
you've never done it I should do a video
on<00:04:09.030> it<00:04:09.300> because<00:04:09.450> it<00:04:09.570> is<00:04:09.690> a<00:04:09.720> very<00:04:10.019> good<00:04:10.370> taste

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.460 
clear film not a white one but a clear

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.970 
clear film not a white one but a clear
one<00:06:16.640> so<00:06:17.510> if<00:06:17.600> you<00:06:17.630> can<00:06:17.840> see<00:06:18.080> that<00:06:18.290> and<00:06:18.500> here<00:06:18.830> is

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:18.980 
one so if you can see that and here is

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.040 
one so if you can see that and here is
the<00:06:19.280> other<00:06:19.430> one<00:06:19.700> if<00:06:20.180> you<00:06:20.390> notice<00:06:20.690> with<00:06:20.900> the

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
the other one if you notice with the

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.420 
the other one if you notice with the
second<00:06:21.470> one

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
second one

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.840 
second one
this<00:06:22.639> is<00:06:22.850> the<00:06:23.180> regular<00:06:23.600> egg<00:06:24.110> the<00:06:25.070> yolk<00:06:25.100> is<00:06:25.610> not

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.850 
this is the regular egg the yolk is not

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.320 
this is the regular egg the yolk is not
quite<00:06:26.270> as<00:06:26.449> uniform<00:06:27.080> round<00:06:27.759> okay<00:06:28.759> because<00:06:29.060> it

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
quite as uniform round okay because it

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.270 
quite as uniform round okay because it
has<00:06:29.479> not<00:06:29.660> been<00:06:29.720> brought<00:06:30.199> it<00:06:30.800> has<00:06:30.919> not<00:06:31.130> been

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 
has not been brought it has not been

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.999 
has not been brought it has not been
pasteurized<00:06:31.850> so<00:06:32.389> it's<00:06:33.050> a<00:06:33.169> little<00:06:33.410> bit<00:06:33.530> looser

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:34.009 
pasteurized so it's a little bit looser

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:36.249 
pasteurized so it's a little bit looser
it's<00:06:34.460> still<00:06:34.789> a<00:06:34.820> good<00:06:35.090> egg<00:06:35.300> because<00:06:35.780> the<00:06:36.050> yolk

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:36.259 
it's still a good egg because the yolk

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:39.070 
it's still a good egg because the yolk
did<00:06:36.770> not<00:06:36.919> break<00:06:37.220> and<00:06:37.490> the<00:06:37.610> yolk<00:06:37.820> is<00:06:38.080> pretty

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 
did not break and the yolk is pretty

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.560 
did not break and the yolk is pretty
much<00:06:39.259> circular<00:06:40.160> maybe<00:06:40.729> just<00:06:41.030> a<00:06:41.150> little<00:06:41.419> bit

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:41.570 
much circular maybe just a little bit

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.080 
much circular maybe just a little bit
off<00:06:41.990> center<00:06:42.410> of<00:06:42.680> circular<00:06:43.190> but<00:06:43.759> it's<00:06:43.910> still

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.090 
off center of circular but it's still

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.450 
off center of circular but it's still
circular<00:06:44.630> so<00:06:45.050> if<00:06:45.139> you<00:06:45.259> all<00:06:45.380> can<00:06:45.770> see<00:06:45.979> that<00:06:46.190> I

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:46.460 
circular so if you all can see that I

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.820 
circular so if you all can see that I
don't<00:06:47.360> know<00:06:47.479> how<00:06:47.600> to<00:06:47.690> get<00:06:47.810> both<00:06:48.169> of<00:06:48.199> these<00:06:48.440> into

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830 
don't know how to get both of these into

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.230 
don't know how to get both of these into
the<00:06:48.949> picture<00:06:49.130> at<00:06:49.340> the<00:06:49.460> same<00:06:49.639> time<00:06:49.880> but<00:06:50.120> I'm

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 
the picture at the same time but I'm

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.600 
the picture at the same time but I'm
doing<00:06:50.479> the<00:06:50.539> best<00:06:50.660> I<00:06:50.840> can<00:06:50.870> here<00:06:51.350> so<00:06:52.220> those<00:06:52.400> are

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:52.610 
doing the best I can here so those are

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.890 
doing the best I can here so those are
the<00:06:52.699> two<00:06:52.880> eggs<00:06:53.530> let<00:06:54.530> me<00:06:54.650> see<00:06:54.830> here<00:06:55.570> so<00:06:56.570> the<00:06:56.720> two

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:56.900 
the two eggs let me see here so the two

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.310 
the two eggs let me see here so the two
eggs<00:06:57.280> they<00:06:58.280> look<00:06:58.520> just<00:06:58.760> the<00:06:58.910> same<00:06:59.080> but<00:07:00.080> what

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:00.320 
eggs they look just the same but what

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.879 
eggs they look just the same but what
you<00:07:00.470> don't<00:07:00.590> want<00:07:00.740> is<00:07:01.160> a<00:07:01.190> broken<00:07:01.669> yolk<00:07:01.910> or<00:07:02.889> for

00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:03.889 
you don't want is a broken yolk or for

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:07.090 
you don't want is a broken yolk or for
it<00:07:03.979> to<00:07:04.100> have<00:07:04.250> a<00:07:04.280> weird<00:07:04.610> shape<00:07:04.910> to<00:07:05.210> it<00:07:05.360> so<00:07:06.320> that's

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:07.100 
it to have a weird shape to it so that's

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.650 
it to have a weird shape to it so that's
all<00:07:07.310> that<00:07:07.340> you<00:07:07.699> probably<00:07:07.910> ever<00:07:08.330> wanted<00:07:08.630> to

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:08.660 
all that you probably ever wanted to

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:13.300 
all that you probably ever wanted to
know<00:07:08.750> about<00:07:08.840> eggs<00:07:10.030> live<00:07:11.030> love<00:07:11.840> and<00:07:12.139> ate<00:07:12.740> until

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:13.310 
know about eggs live love and ate until

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.510 
know about eggs live love and ate until
