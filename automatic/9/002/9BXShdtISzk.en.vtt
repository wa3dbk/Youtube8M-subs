00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
just they can be a problem like that a

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.100 
just they can be a problem like that a
lot<00:02:55.790> of<00:02:55.910> teams<00:02:56.120> on<00:02:56.270> high<00:02:56.450> school<00:02:56.660> do<00:02:56.780> play<00:02:56.959> on<00:02:57.050> a

lot of teams on high school do play on a
turf<00:02:57.320> field<00:02:57.350> so<00:02:57.830> that<00:02:57.860> might<00:02:58.160> not<00:02:58.190> be<00:02:58.400> a<00:02:58.550> big<00:02:58.790> a

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
turf field so that might not be a big a

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.910 
turf field so that might not be a big a
deal<00:02:59.000> but<00:02:59.270> they<00:03:00.110> would<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:00.500> would<00:03:00.620> be<00:03:00.770> good

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
deal but they would it would be good

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.680

play on if these gloves are machine

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.640 
play on if these gloves are machine
washable<00:03:09.100> so<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.520> first<00:03:10.700> category<00:03:10.940> is

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
washable so the first category is

protection so just might judging on the
top<00:03:14.780> of<00:03:15.320> course<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:15.830> whole<00:03:16.010> top<00:03:16.250> is<00:03:16.430> protected

even the black here is kind of its just

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.710 
even the black here is kind of its just
a<00:03:19.459> thicker<00:03:19.670> material<00:03:20.090> so<00:03:20.209> you've<00:03:20.330> talked<00:03:20.690> to

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
is really nice you still have a good

is really nice you still have a good
amount<00:03:23.989> of<00:03:24.200> movement<00:03:24.350> your<00:03:24.620> thumbs<00:03:24.860> but<00:03:25.130> it's

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
amount of movement your thumbs but it's

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.310 
amount of movement your thumbs but it's
not<00:03:25.790> too<00:03:26.000> much<00:03:26.120> back<00:03:26.420> so<00:03:26.630> it<00:03:26.810> you<00:03:26.959> can't<00:03:27.200> really

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
not too much back so it you can't really

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.830 
not too much back so it you can't really
jam<00:03:27.560> that<00:03:27.860> easily<00:03:28.330> the<00:03:29.330> only<00:03:29.510> thing<00:03:29.690> that

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
jam that easily the only thing that

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.570 
jam that easily the only thing that
there<00:03:30.049> isn't<00:03:30.260> protection<00:03:30.680> is<00:03:31.040> on<00:03:31.160> the<00:03:31.250> pumps

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
there isn't protection is on the pumps

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.070 
there isn't protection is on the pumps
but<00:03:31.730> obviously<00:03:31.970> because<00:03:32.180> these<00:03:32.269> are<00:03:32.510> a<00:03:32.540> padded

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
but obviously because these are a padded

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.740 
but obviously because these are a padded
receiver<00:03:33.410> glove<00:03:33.730> you<00:03:34.730> won't<00:03:34.940> get<00:03:35.120> that<00:03:35.330> option

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
receiver glove you won't get that option

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.289 
receiver glove you won't get that option
so<00:03:36.230> for<00:03:37.160> protection<00:03:37.580> i<00:03:37.670> rated<00:03:37.880> a<00:03:38.120> 9.5<00:03:38.840> at<00:03:39.110> a<00:03:39.170> 10

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
so for protection i rated a 9.5 at a 10

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.600 
so for protection i rated a 9.5 at a 10
next<00:03:41.299> we<00:03:41.420> have<00:03:41.600> grip<00:03:41.930> so<00:03:42.650> as<00:03:42.860> you<00:03:43.010> guys<00:03:43.130> know<00:03:43.190> I

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
next we have grip so as you guys know I

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.890 
next we have grip so as you guys know I
love<00:03:44.060> the<00:03:44.870> cutters<00:03:45.250> seatac<00:03:46.250> grip<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:47.720> only

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
love the cutters seatac grip the only

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.479 
love the cutters seatac grip the only
problem<00:03:48.290> is<00:03:48.410> that<00:03:48.650> now<00:03:49.040> that<00:03:49.100> they<00:03:49.370> include

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
problem is that now that they include

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.490 
problem is that now that they include
that<00:03:49.850> recharge<00:03:50.330> feature<00:03:50.540> i<00:03:50.690> found<00:03:51.049> that<00:03:51.200> the

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
that recharge feature i found that the

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.289 
that recharge feature i found that the
grip<00:03:51.890> uh<00:03:52.989> is<00:03:53.989> a<00:03:54.230> little<00:03:54.620> bit<00:03:54.769> weaker<00:03:55.610> and<00:03:55.820> a

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
grip uh is a little bit weaker and a

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.509 
grip uh is a little bit weaker and a
little<00:03:56.690> definitely<00:03:57.560> a<00:03:57.590> lot<00:03:57.920> harder<00:03:57.980> to<00:03:58.310> keep

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
little definitely a lot harder to keep

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.090 
little definitely a lot harder to keep
clean<00:03:58.580> so<00:03:59.420> that's<00:03:59.810> one<00:04:00.049> problem<00:04:00.290> is<00:04:00.530> they<00:04:00.860> can

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
clean so that's one problem is they can

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.699 
clean so that's one problem is they can
get<00:04:01.370> very<00:04:01.690> very<00:04:02.690> unstick<00:04:03.140> you<00:04:03.260> almost<00:04:03.470> useless

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
get very very unstick you almost useless

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.640 
get very very unstick you almost useless
very<00:04:04.190> very<00:04:04.459> fast<00:04:04.760> so<00:04:05.600> up<00:04:05.959> just<00:04:06.290> because<00:04:06.410> of

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
very very fast so up just because of

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.250 
very very fast so up just because of
that<00:04:06.680> I'm<00:04:07.640> taking<00:04:07.850> my<00:04:08.180> seat<00:04:08.540> a<00:04:08.750> trip<00:04:09.049> down<00:04:09.230> to

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
that I'm taking my seat a trip down to

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.890 
that I'm taking my seat a trip down to
eight<00:04:09.739> and<00:04:09.799> a<00:04:09.980> half<00:04:10.060> okay<00:04:11.060> next<00:04:11.390> we<00:04:11.690> have

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
eight and a half okay next we have

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.370 
eight and a half okay next we have
durability<00:04:12.590> so<00:04:13.430> uh<00:04:13.730> obviously<00:04:14.720> one<00:04:15.170> good

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
durability so uh obviously one good

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.630 
durability so uh obviously one good
thing<00:04:15.410> with<00:04:15.590> these<00:04:15.829> gloves<00:04:16.070> compared<00:04:16.430> to<00:04:16.489> some

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
thing with these gloves compared to some

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.909 
thing with these gloves compared to some
of<00:04:16.669> the<00:04:16.790> nike<00:04:17.060> gloves<00:04:17.680> exclude<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:18.769> hyper

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
of the nike gloves exclude the hyper

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.039 
of the nike gloves exclude the hyper
beast<00:04:19.190> is<00:04:19.340> because<00:04:20.030> everything<00:04:20.570> on<00:04:20.720> here<00:04:20.989> is

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
beast is because everything on here is

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.900 
beast is because everything on here is
sewn<00:04:21.470> on<00:04:21.650> and<00:04:21.859> not<00:04:21.979> screen<00:04:22.280> printed<00:04:22.640> it'll

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
sewn on and not screen printed it'll

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.000 
sewn on and not screen printed it'll
last<00:04:23.090> a<00:04:23.300> lot<00:04:23.479> longer<00:04:23.539> which<00:04:24.470> is<00:04:24.560> a<00:04:24.620> really<00:04:24.770> good

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
last a lot longer which is a really good

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.560 
last a lot longer which is a really good
feature<00:04:25.280> there's<00:04:25.700> also<00:04:25.849> because

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
feature there's also because

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.500 
feature there's also because
seatac<00:04:26.930> is<00:04:27.140> a<00:04:27.200> pretty<00:04:27.590> durable<00:04:28.550> grip<00:04:29.030> which<00:04:29.360> is

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
seatac is a pretty durable grip which is

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.510 
seatac is a pretty durable grip which is
uh<00:04:29.590> you<00:04:30.590> know<00:04:30.680> just<00:04:30.830> because<00:04:30.950> there's<00:04:31.160> no<00:04:31.340> that

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
uh you know just because there's no that

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.430 
uh you know just because there's no that
top<00:04:32.030> coating<00:04:32.300> like<00:04:32.480> the<00:04:32.570> Banneker<00:04:32.960> pass<00:04:33.140> for

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
top coating like the Banneker pass for

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.230 
top coating like the Banneker pass for
their<00:04:33.560> designs<00:04:33.890> and<00:04:34.130> that<00:04:34.220> kind<00:04:34.400> of<00:04:34.430> stuff<00:04:34.490> so

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
their designs and that kind of stuff so

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.390 
their designs and that kind of stuff so
it<00:04:35.360> will<00:04:35.510> last<00:04:35.720> you<00:04:35.870> a<00:04:35.930> long<00:04:36.080> time<00:04:36.320> the<00:04:37.250> only

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
it will last you a long time the only

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.650 
it will last you a long time the only
downfall<00:04:37.580> i<00:04:37.820> see<00:04:38.030> what<00:04:38.150> these<00:04:38.270> gloves<00:04:38.510> is

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
downfall i see what these gloves is

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.450 
downfall i see what these gloves is
possibly<00:04:39.110> this<00:04:39.290> tag<00:04:39.590> the<00:04:40.070> side<00:04:40.220> here<00:04:40.340> that

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
possibly this tag the side here that

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.580 
possibly this tag the side here that
says<00:04:40.610> shock<00:04:40.880> skin<00:04:41.150> and<00:04:41.420> also<00:04:42.140> because<00:04:42.440> there's

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
says shock skin and also because there's

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.560 
says shock skin and also because there's
no<00:04:42.770> microbrews<00:04:43.250> one<00:04:43.430> here<00:04:43.670> this<00:04:43.880> grip<00:04:44.240> where's

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
no microbrews one here this grip where's

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.000 
no microbrews one here this grip where's
wait<00:04:44.750> a<00:04:44.780> lot<00:04:44.900> faster<00:04:45.320> because<00:04:45.440> it<00:04:45.620> gets<00:04:45.740> caught

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
wait a lot faster because it gets caught

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.940 
wait a lot faster because it gets caught
a<00:04:46.040> lot<00:04:46.250> of<00:04:46.310> stuff<00:04:46.900> and<00:04:47.900> there's<00:04:48.350> also<00:04:48.680> some

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
a lot of stuff and there's also some

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.410 
a lot of stuff and there's also some
rubbing<00:04:49.280> right<00:04:49.460> there<00:04:49.700> from<00:04:50.090> where<00:04:50.240> this<00:04:50.360> is

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:50.420 
rubbing right there from where this is

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.080 
rubbing right there from where this is
probably<00:04:50.750> been<00:04:50.960> flipped<00:04:51.260> over<00:04:51.410> okay<00:04:52.340> so<00:04:52.400> next

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
probably been flipped over okay so next

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.760 
probably been flipped over okay so next
is<00:04:53.360> breathability<00:04:53.840> now<00:04:54.230> obviously<00:04:54.620> these

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
is breathability now obviously these

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.680 
is breathability now obviously these
won't<00:04:55.040> be<00:04:55.130> a<00:04:55.160> very<00:04:55.430> breathable<00:04:55.760> glove<00:04:56.150> because

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
won't be a very breathable glove because

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.570 
won't be a very breathable glove because
of<00:04:56.870> all<00:04:56.990> the<00:04:57.080> padding<00:04:57.350> on<00:04:57.470> the<00:04:57.530> top<00:04:57.740> you<00:04:57.980> know

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
of all the padding on the top you know

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.890 
of all the padding on the top you know
which<00:04:58.790> obviously<00:04:59.210> makes<00:04:59.420> sense<00:04:59.690> when<00:04:59.840> you

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
which obviously makes sense when you

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.180 
which obviously makes sense when you
have<00:05:00.020> all<00:05:00.080> this<00:05:00.170> foments<00:05:00.620> going<00:05:00.740> to<00:05:00.800> insulate

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
have all this foments going to insulate

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.230 
have all this foments going to insulate
so<00:05:03.160> this<00:05:04.160> could<00:05:04.340> be<00:05:04.400> positive<00:05:04.670> for<00:05:04.910> me<00:05:05.090> cuz

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
so this could be positive for me cuz

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.610 
so this could be positive for me cuz
where<00:05:05.360> I<00:05:05.390> live<00:05:05.600> I<00:05:05.720> usually<00:05:06.020> playing<00:05:06.200> culties

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
where I live I usually playing culties

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.170 
where I live I usually playing culties
and<00:05:06.800> so<00:05:06.890> this<00:05:06.980> could<00:05:07.160> be<00:05:07.220> good<00:05:07.400> but<00:05:08.000> when<00:05:08.090> i'm

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
and so this could be good but when i'm

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.360 
and so this could be good but when i'm
looking<00:05:08.450> at<00:05:08.540> the<00:05:08.870> breathability<00:05:09.260> is<00:05:09.680> for<00:05:10.340> a

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
looking at the breathability is for a

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.360 
looking at the breathability is for a
hot<00:05:11.000> climate<00:05:11.210> rated<00:05:12.140> it<00:05:12.260> a<00:05:12.380> seven<00:05:13.100> out<00:05:13.220> of<00:05:13.250> ten

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
hot climate rated it a seven out of ten

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.080 
hot climate rated it a seven out of ten
and<00:05:14.290> the<00:05:15.290> last<00:05:15.530> quarter<00:05:15.860> category<00:05:16.520> we<00:05:16.670> have<00:05:16.700> is

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
and the last quarter category we have is

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.810
