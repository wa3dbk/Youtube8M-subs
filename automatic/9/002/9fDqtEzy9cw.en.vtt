00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 Many fitness and muscle building programs 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.730
 are now in criticism 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.219
 whether it's on TV or on the internet 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.139
 is often criticized that the 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.790
 promise too unrealistic too 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.570
 covered are these programs 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.730
 do 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.050
 it is said that the prices 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.359
 are too expensive 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.000
 it is said that it is too 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.279
 there are few or insufficient contents and 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.609
 that support of these programs is not 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.309
 My endeavor is always sufficient 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.660
 the optimal program for mine 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.300
 to create participants 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.579
 and that's why I want exactly this 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.030
 eckdaten enter and a 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.539
 Fitness program creates exactly what 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:48.329
 this criticism from the world creates that 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.239
 means first the coated ones 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.489
 to create promises from the world 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.180
 instead of doing a fitness program where 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.219
 I only call myself as the 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.559
 Transformation sell and say look 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.680
 times I have transformed myself and 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.720
 now you can do that too, I have mine 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.790
 someone was looking for the human 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.450
 corresponds to this program 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.549
 made is namely a working 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.950
 People in stress are busy 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.630
 He has a slight belly neck 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.799
 and wants to lose weight 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:26.130
 this person is aichi with tai chi 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.970
 So I'm doing this program from a to 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.750
 z through and document from the beginning to 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.170
 The End 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.270
 based on concrete video evidence of his 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.850
 transformation so that you can really 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.810
 can recognize what it actually is in the 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.920
 time of three months possible 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.320
 that is the first point of criticism 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.360
 coated ones promise it from the 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.310
 cleared away because I'm exactly one 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.290
 For example, show live what is possible 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.960
 the second point the bad 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.790
 many people researched content 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.649
 ask me all the time kolja 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.260
 when will the zero to europe finally arrive? 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.320
 program 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.840
 and they do not know that me 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.119
 sometimes complete nights before my 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.670
 computer seats and just polls 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.330
 go through results and really 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.610
 Consider is the best fitness program 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.330
 not what the participants themselves 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.180
 pretend 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.980
 So where are the strongest hurdles which 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.780
 are there really any problems I'm in 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.980
 appeal to this fitness program and 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.560
 then one comes to such results 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.350
 For example, it does not always work 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.730
 only to the best training plan but 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.170
 For example, what do you do when 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.330
 Participants in the gym when you 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.650
 fear has in the other people in the 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.570
 Gym if you dare not 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.700
 to train properly because you 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.710
 Fear has that one is laughed at or 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.570
 when the partner opposes 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.790
 or if you do not trust enough 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.640
 that is exactly what you have to score 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.440
 I will tie in and research this 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.480
 is the main work on one 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.520
 fitness program and that's why 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.320
 that takes so long and therefore take 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.209
 I also take the time to do this research 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.459
 do not do the content 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.680
 can be criticized because they are accurate 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:09.550
 according to the target group for that 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.500
 program is not made that 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.810
 the next point of criticism is often the one 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.170
 lack of support means that 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.420
 Participants who have made the program 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.040
 not enough support support you 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.480
 ask questions and after two weeks 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.459
 first comes an answer 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.440
 and that's where I want to go again 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.790
 start by saying how can 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.610
 I'm the one step actually 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.700
 and thought why 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.280
 not just regular live streams 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.250
 and live webinars with all participants 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.200
 together where you are together at one goal 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.239
 works where everyone can get involved 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.400
 and can discuss and me 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.310
 regularly once or twice a week 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.760
 make a livestream and the whole 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.920
 To even increase even a live event too 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.230
 where do all those at such a program 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.000
 Participate can come together in one 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.280
 huge for the studio for example 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.260
 all train together a composite 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.480
 make a seminar and we together 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.629
 hurdles work would not be the support 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.349
 because someone wishes and then that 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:13.930
 whole in addition to the training plans 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:16.600
 nutrition plans and so on that is 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.510
 to experience a live transformation 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.510
 not just the past of myself 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.880
 the programs manufacturer and one 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.370
 weekly live stream weekly 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:32.020
 support and, above all, live 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:34.150
 Event and the whole then for a price 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.070
 Himself a student and a 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.430
 working person who does not have that much money 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:42.580
 can also afford and that has 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.530
 I'll be together with tai chi and 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:48.010
 I'm currently in the middle of creating and 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:50.650
 to produce and on the third of april 2014 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:54.160
 the zero to hero program is official 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:56.320
 for all people go who want to participate 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.389
 tai chi if you get to know him better 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.940
 if you want to know what he wants 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:02.800
 actually does what he sings about what 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.320
 check him in his life then check 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.220
 times his youtube channel of tai chi here 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.539
 on youtube and I'm very excited 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.300
 which on which review my 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:14.680
 fitness program but I will come across 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.430
 I can only say that I will 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.680
 react 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:22.770
 that was s for this video see you 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.770
 next time and I have no regrets
