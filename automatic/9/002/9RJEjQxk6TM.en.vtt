the insects light and temperature we can

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.500 
the insects light and temperature we can
say<00:06:34.960> we<00:06:35.920> also<00:06:36.070> use<00:06:36.400> here<00:06:36.670> the<00:06:36.880> micro

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:37.510 
say we also use here the micro

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.320 
say we also use here the micro
irrigation<00:06:37.600> system<00:06:38.320> and<00:06:38.800> the<00:06:39.310> Cobras<00:06:39.940> micro

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.020 
irrigation system and the Cobras micro
irrigation<00:06:40.390> system<00:06:40.990> basically<00:06:41.410> provide<00:06:41.710> the

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.030 
irrigation system basically provide the

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.510 
irrigation system basically provide the
water<00:06:43.030> drip<00:06:43.930> by<00:06:44.110> drip<00:06:44.140> and<00:06:44.560> this<00:06:45.250> fogger

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520 
water drip by drip and this fogger

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.570 
water drip by drip and this fogger
create<00:06:46.270> the<00:06:46.450> humidity

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:49.580 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.250 

so<00:06:50.580> what<00:06:50.880> is<00:06:51.060> it<00:06:51.240> that<00:06:51.270> makes<00:06:51.750> Netafim

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:52.260 
so what is it that makes Netafim

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.290 
so what is it that makes Netafim
