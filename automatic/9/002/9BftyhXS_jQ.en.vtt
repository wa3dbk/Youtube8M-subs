00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.530
 ah 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.330
 greetings bite well the boleros now 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:16.360
 I am in the headquarters of your 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:20.380
 milonga 'reds' and I'm going to review a 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:24.490
 to a new model in 2013 that is the 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:27.780
 good towsville line this is a 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.250
 new model they were there 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.470
 trying different different styles 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.340
 forms of longboard and they came to give with 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.870
 this many people compare it to a nine 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.950
 to five but tokman 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:44.470
 could be think that you have this in your 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.860
 construction now in the dian is being 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.800
 using a layer of glass fiber 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:54.190
 final and the whole graph comes in 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.280
 it means that if you do not know the stripes 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.260
 you go through a stop the graph is going to 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.329
 last and it does not go 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.250
 and as easily as in the models 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.470
 previous where the whole chart was 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.590
 on top of the wood in this case is 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.259
 inside the fiberglass layer 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.240
 istanbul is for downhill for free 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:16.300
 running you can use it for cross without 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:20.050
 varas lights for whatever 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:24.400
 basically have some eggs carry 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:27.830
 some read here at the tips and this is 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:31.010
 so that when making a 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:34.610
 when grabbing a curve you have support in 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:37.520
 the foot to push the table also you 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.740
 It helps to identify if you're already 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.830
 going very close to the proxy you are going to leave 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.230
 the foot with this you can realize in 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.900
 what position or where is your 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.960
 standing in relation to the table without need 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.960
 of flipping down is also very 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:58.220
 good to make light payments is offered 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.890
 has a keith w lightweight but you 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.320
 ensures very well the feet also has 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.479
 something rocker means that the table 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.300
 it is planned a little bit downwards which 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.830
 even though these mice as their 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.840
 center of truth is a pipeline below 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.450
 it's like the one to make cross and for 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.390
 transport and is also very stable to 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.390
 high speeds as I told you this 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.690
 stomach means they are low 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.620
 work on the table is very good and I know 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.200
 I recommend them too 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.569
 on wind webs so that if you put me 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.049
 big tires will not cause you will 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:38.260
 Wright comes in two steps wake 36 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:40.989
 it seems to me that they come from 434 you take 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.060
 short then between longer 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.640
 stable more speeds between shorter 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.250
 more maneuverable to bend and to be 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:52.140
 in the in the city or I do not know then it's 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.140
 a good option and I recommend them
