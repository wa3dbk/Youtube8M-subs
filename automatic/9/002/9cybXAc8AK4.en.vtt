00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
alright so screen printing is much a

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.620 
alright so screen printing is much a
photo<00:00:09.090> process<00:00:09.750> design<00:00:10.440> normal<00:00:10.950> photography

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:11.630 
photo process design normal photography

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.230 
photo process design normal photography
so<00:00:12.630> this<00:00:13.469> is<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.680> screen<00:00:14.070> it's<00:00:14.820> just<00:00:15.059> like<00:00:15.210> a

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
so this is a screen it's just like a

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.200 
so this is a screen it's just like a
sliding<00:00:15.900> for<00:00:16.080> Tiger<00:00:16.439> the<00:00:16.880> maroon<00:00:17.880> on<00:00:18.090> the

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
sliding for Tiger the maroon on the

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.359 
sliding for Tiger the maroon on the
screen<00:00:18.599> is<00:00:18.840> emulsion<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:19.920> light-sensitive

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
screen is emulsion is light-sensitive

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.370 
screen is emulsion is light-sensitive
except<00:00:21.240> for<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.450> lot<00:00:21.840> less<00:00:22.230> light<00:00:22.560> sensitive

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.640 

so<00:00:26.980> in<00:00:27.550> order<00:00:27.699> to<00:00:27.880> take<00:00:28.150> this<00:00:28.359> screen<00:00:28.779> and<00:00:29.140> be

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
so in order to take this screen and be

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.600 
so in order to take this screen and be
able<00:00:29.740> to<00:00:29.980> print<00:00:30.310> artwork<00:00:31.150> with<00:00:31.329> it<00:00:31.539> what<00:00:31.689> we<00:00:31.810> do

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
able to print artwork with it what we do

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.000 
able to print artwork with it what we do
our<00:00:33.610> work<00:00:33.820> as<00:00:34.059> a<00:00:34.090> fill

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
our work as a fill

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.610 
our work as a fill
and<00:00:35.129> this<00:00:35.519> is<00:00:35.699> an<00:00:35.820> example<00:00:35.879> of<00:00:36.269> our<00:00:36.449> word

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
and this is an example of our word

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.100 
and this is an example of our word
this<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.370> positive<00:00:39.059> image<00:00:39.270> instead<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:40.050> a

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
this is a positive image instead of a

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.900 
this is a positive image instead of a
negative<00:00:40.289> film<00:00:41.070> negative<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.879> a

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
negative film negative this is a

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.540 
negative film negative this is a
positive<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:43.170> everywhere<00:00:43.620> that's<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.129> black

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
positive so everywhere that's in black

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.329 
positive so everywhere that's in black
is<00:00:44.969> where<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.360> want<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.629> print<00:00:45.840> your<00:00:46.050> design

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:46.339 
is where you want to print your design

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:48.920 
is where you want to print your design
so<00:00:47.339> what<00:00:47.460> we<00:00:47.519> do<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.670> we<00:00:47.879> take<00:00:48.089> this<00:00:48.300> positive

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
so what we do is we take this positive

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.119 
so what we do is we take this positive
image<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.710> we<00:00:50.399> attach<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.059> one<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.480> these

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
image and we attach it to one of these

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.819 
image and we attach it to one of these
emulsion<00:00:53.129> coated<00:00:53.489> screens<00:00:54.140> like<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.769> we

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
emulsion coated screens like so and we

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.560 
emulsion coated screens like so and we
expose<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.399> life

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
expose it to life

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.110 
expose it to life
and<00:00:57.690> when<00:00:57.989> we<00:00:58.140> expose<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.739> light

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
and when we expose it to light

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.360 
and when we expose it to light
everywhere<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.720> black<00:01:01.140> block<00:01:02.130> out<00:01:02.340> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
everywhere that is black block out the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.430 
everywhere that is black block out the
light<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.210> light<00:01:03.300> wall<00:01:03.750> be<00:01:03.989> able<00:01:04.229> to

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
light and the light wall be able to

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.560 
light and the light wall be able to
expose<00:01:04.769> everything<00:01:05.309> that's<00:01:05.670> not<00:01:05.910> is<00:01:06.240> all<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
expose everything that's not is all the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.410 
expose everything that's not is all the
maroon<00:01:06.840> area<00:01:07.200> what<00:01:08.190> happens

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
maroon area what happens

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.740 
maroon area what happens
do<00:01:10.630> that<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:12.430> is<00:01:12.610> the<00:01:12.729> exposed<00:01:13.119> screen<00:01:13.509> is

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
do that this is the exposed screen is

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.050 
do that this is the exposed screen is
that<00:01:14.740> everything<00:01:15.189> that's<00:01:15.490> hit<00:01:15.640> by<00:01:15.759> the<00:01:15.820> light

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
that everything that's hit by the light

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.690 
that everything that's hit by the light
is<00:01:16.210> parting<00:01:16.720> and<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:17.619> black<00:01:17.950> makes<00:01:18.250> it<00:01:18.460> so

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
is parting and the black makes it so

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.270 
is parting and the black makes it so
that<00:01:18.729> you<00:01:19.119> can<00:01:19.270> rinse<00:01:19.450> it<00:01:19.630> out<00:01:19.689> water<00:01:20.110> you<00:01:21.070> take

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
that you can rinse it out water you take

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.940 
that you can rinse it out water you take
this<00:01:21.460> off<00:01:21.670> and<00:01:21.970> you<00:01:22.030> rinse<00:01:22.299> this<00:01:22.570> out<00:01:22.840> and<00:01:23.799> what

this off and you rinse this out and what

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.740 
this off and you rinse this out and what
you're<00:01:24.100> left<00:01:24.310> with<00:01:24.520> is<00:01:24.880> this<00:01:25.149> screen

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
you're left with is this screen

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.070 
you're left with is this screen
basically<00:01:26.470> of<00:01:26.740> stencil<00:01:27.369> so<00:01:28.180> all<00:01:28.390> these<00:01:28.570> open

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
basically of stencil so all these open

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.170 
basically of stencil so all these open
yellow<00:01:29.409> areas<00:01:29.920> the<00:01:30.130> skull<00:01:30.399> off<00:01:30.549> the<00:01:30.700> words<00:01:30.940> and

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
yellow areas the skull off the words and

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.450 
yellow areas the skull off the words and
the<00:01:31.210> logos<00:01:31.690> or<00:01:32.049> where<00:01:32.289> the<00:01:32.799> light<00:01:33.009> was<00:01:33.039> blocked

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
the logos or where the light was blocked

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.020 
the logos or where the light was blocked
out<00:01:33.729> rinse<00:01:34.720> this<00:01:34.960> out<00:01:35.229> and<00:01:35.500> it's<00:01:35.950> dry<00:01:36.280> and<00:01:36.700> now

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
out rinse this out and it's dry and now

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.179 
out rinse this out and it's dry and now
you<00:01:37.090> can<00:01:37.509> print<00:01:37.750> this<00:01:37.869> and<00:01:38.229> we'll<00:01:38.920> take<00:01:39.039> it

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
you can print this and we'll take it

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:40.980 
you can print this and we'll take it
over<00:01:39.250> to<00:01:39.369> one<00:01:39.549> of<00:01:39.580> our<00:01:39.729> presses<00:01:40.299> and<00:01:40.570> we<00:01:40.840> use<00:01:40.960> a

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
over to one of our presses and we use a

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.410 
over to one of our presses and we use a
squeegee<00:01:41.380> to<00:01:41.619> pull<00:01:41.950> ain't<00:01:42.250> through<00:01:42.610> this<00:01:42.850> and

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
squeegee to pull ain't through this and

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.899 
squeegee to pull ain't through this and
it<00:01:43.899> acts<00:01:44.080> as<00:01:44.259> a<00:01:44.350> stencil<00:01:44.590> so<00:01:45.340> that<00:01:45.520> everywhere

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
it acts as a stencil so that everywhere

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.270 
it acts as a stencil so that everywhere
that's<00:01:46.179> yellow<00:01:46.479> is<00:01:46.990> your<00:01:47.020> image<00:01:47.380> that's<00:01:48.100> how

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
that's yellow is your image that's how

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.279 
that's yellow is your image that's how
you<00:01:48.340> break<00:01:48.640> will<00:01:49.060> go<00:01:49.210> to<00:01:49.360> a<00:01:49.450> press<00:01:49.780> and<00:01:50.020> see<00:01:50.170> how

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
you break will go to a press and see how

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:51.840 
you break will go to a press and see how
we<00:01:50.350> do<00:01:50.560> that

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
we do that

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.600 
we do that
so<00:01:52.420> this<00:01:52.600> is<00:01:52.750> a<00:01:52.780> 14<00:01:53.350> color<00:01:53.590> automatic<00:01:53.860> press

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
so this is a 14 color automatic press

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.600 
so this is a 14 color automatic press
the<00:01:55.540> screens<00:01:55.900> that<00:01:56.020> you<00:01:56.170> saw<00:01:56.409> earlier<00:01:56.710> each

the screens that you saw earlier each

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.850 
the screens that you saw earlier each
screen<00:01:58.119> calls<00:01:58.420> on<00:01:58.600> an<00:01:58.750> individual<00:01:59.409> head<00:01:59.650> on
