one hour same with a minnow built I give
them<00:05:55.330> the<00:05:55.479> amino<00:05:55.840> build<00:05:56.349> the<00:05:56.560> necessary<00:05:56.770> amino

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
them the amino build the necessary amino

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.719 
them the amino build the necessary amino
acid<00:05:57.490> as<00:05:57.699> long<00:05:58.000> as<00:05:58.210> it<00:05:58.330> is<00:05:58.830> that<00:05:59.830> set<00:06:00.099> that<00:06:00.460> that

acid as long as it is that set that that
second<00:06:01.690> or<00:06:01.870> third<00:06:02.380> step<00:06:02.590> a<00:06:03.240> lot<00:06:04.240> how<00:06:04.449> you<00:06:04.509> will

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
second or third step a lot how you will

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.180 
second or third step a lot how you will
call<00:06:04.990> it<00:06:05.139> then<00:06:06.070> after<00:06:06.970> that<00:06:07.120> we<00:06:07.630> go<00:06:07.840> on<00:06:08.050> the

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
call it then after that we go on the

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.060 
call it then after that we go on the
fats<00:06:09.190> which<00:06:09.789> we're<00:06:10.030> given<00:06:10.300> with<00:06:10.330> health<00:06:11.070> oil

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
fats which we're given with health oil

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.100 
fats which we're given with health oil
in<00:06:12.820> the<00:06:13.000> health<00:06:13.210> aisle<00:06:13.570> you<00:06:13.750> have<00:06:13.990> the

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
in the health aisle you have the

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.800 
in the health aisle you have the
necessary<00:06:14.229> oil<00:06:14.770> to<00:06:15.430> build<00:06:15.729> up<00:06:15.880> energy<00:06:16.180> and

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
necessary oil to build up energy and

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.310 
necessary oil to build up energy and
that<00:06:17.530> goes<00:06:17.770> together<00:06:18.010> with<00:06:18.340> the<00:06:18.400> carbo<00:06:18.909> plus

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 
that goes together with the carbo plus

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.740 
that goes together with the carbo plus
the<00:06:20.320> carbo<00:06:20.770> plus<00:06:21.039> the<00:06:21.340> plus<00:06:21.580> also<00:06:22.150> stands<00:06:22.720> for

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.750 
the carbo plus the plus also stands for

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.490 
the carbo plus the plus also stands for
the<00:06:23.409> plus<00:06:23.680> energy<00:06:24.159> more<00:06:24.760> energy<00:06:25.030> so<00:06:25.990> these<00:06:26.229> are

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500 
the plus energy more energy so these are

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.250 
the plus energy more energy so these are
basically<00:06:27.099> the<00:06:27.849> steps<00:06:28.090> which<00:06:28.389> are<00:06:28.630> which<00:06:29.020> we

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:29.260 
basically the steps which are which we

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.600 
basically the steps which are which we
are<00:06:29.440> following<00:06:30.070> to<00:06:30.940> make<00:06:31.690> a<00:06:31.720> bird<00:06:32.310> recover<00:06:33.310> and

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:33.610 
are following to make a bird recover and

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.870 
are following to make a bird recover and
train<00:06:34.210> as<00:06:34.419> fast<00:06:35.199> as<00:06:35.440> possible<00:06:35.919> after

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 
train as fast as possible after

00:06:36.880 --> 00:07:05.390 
train as fast as possible after
returning<00:06:37.300> from<00:06:37.570> a<00:06:38.110> race

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.460
