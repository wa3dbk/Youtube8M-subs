00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:24.850 
really fast hand to foot combinations

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.060 
really fast hand to foot combinations
and<00:00:25.180> generally<00:00:25.870> they<00:00:26.140> use<00:00:26.350> patterns<00:00:26.860> like

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
and generally they use patterns like

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.240 
and generally they use patterns like
right<00:00:27.610> left<00:00:27.940> foot<00:00:28.240> foot<00:00:28.540> or<00:00:28.780> right<00:00:29.770> left<00:00:30.040> right

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:35.489 
left foot foot for note and six note
groupings<00:00:33.460> and<00:00:33.940> played<00:00:34.719> it<00:00:34.899> blistering

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:35.499 
groupings and played it blistering

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:38.790 
groupings and played it blistering
speeds<00:00:35.890> and<00:00:36.570> one<00:00:37.570> of<00:00:37.690> the<00:00:37.809> things<00:00:38.050> that<00:00:38.320> that

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
speeds and one of the things that that

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.660 
speeds and one of the things that that
I've<00:00:39.010> done<00:00:39.280> is<00:00:39.550> I've<00:00:40.210> changed<00:00:40.570> that<00:00:41.519> hand<00:00:42.519> a

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
I've done is I've changed that hand a

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.509 
I've done is I've changed that hand a
foot<00:00:42.820> combination<00:00:43.539> by<00:00:43.920> substituting<00:00:44.920> a<00:00:45.190> left

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
foot combination by substituting a left

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.349 
foot combination by substituting a left
hand<00:00:45.879> for<00:00:46.269> the<00:00:46.359> first<00:00:46.539> foot<00:00:47.019> and<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:48.579> right

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:49.359 
hand for the first foot and so right

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:52.169 
hand for the first foot and so right
left<00:00:49.690> foot<00:00:50.019> foot<00:00:50.350> pattern<00:00:51.309> would<00:00:51.609> turn<00:00:52.030> into

00:00:52.169 --> 00:00:52.179 
left foot foot pattern would turn into

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:54.779 
left foot foot pattern would turn into
right<00:00:52.719> left<00:00:53.109> left<00:00:53.409> foot<00:00:53.800> for<00:00:54.370> a<00:00:54.399> four<00:00:54.609> note

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:54.789 
right left left foot for a four note

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.869 
right left left foot for a four note
pattern<00:00:54.819> and<00:00:55.420> a<00:00:56.379> six<00:00:56.620> note<00:00:56.829> pattern<00:00:57.609> were<00:00:57.760> to

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
pattern and a six note pattern were to

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.079 
pattern and a six note pattern were to
turn<00:00:58.120> into<00:00:58.469> right<00:00:59.469> left<00:00:59.920> right<00:01:00.219> left<00:01:00.639> left

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
turn into right left right left left

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:03.840 
turn into right left right left left
foot<00:01:01.690> as<00:01:01.899> opposed<00:01:02.679> to<00:01:02.829> just<00:01:03.159> right<00:01:03.429> left<00:01:03.760> right

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
foot as opposed to just right left right

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.450 
foot as opposed to just right left right
left<00:01:04.030> foot<00:01:04.420> foot<00:01:04.689> so<00:01:05.619> I'm<00:01:05.860> just<00:01:06.040> taking<00:01:06.369> the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
left foot foot so I'm just taking the

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.620 
left foot foot so I'm just taking the
first<00:01:06.729> of<00:01:06.850> the<00:01:06.939> two<00:01:07.090> bass<00:01:07.329> drum<00:01:07.600> notes<00:01:07.780> and

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
first of the two bass drum notes and

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.160 
first of the two bass drum notes and
exchanging<00:01:10.630> it<00:01:10.750> with<00:01:10.899> a<00:01:10.930> left<00:01:11.170> hand<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:13.170> this

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
exchanging it with a left hand and this

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.580 
exchanging it with a left hand and this
allows<00:01:14.439> me<00:01:14.829> to<00:01:15.789> increase<00:01:16.000> the<00:01:16.420> speed<00:01:16.840> because

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
allows me to increase the speed because

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.139 
allows me to increase the speed because
my<00:01:17.890> hands<00:01:18.369> are<00:01:18.490> faster<00:01:18.909> than<00:01:19.060> my<00:01:19.149> feet<00:01:19.360> if<00:01:19.990> I

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
my hands are faster than my feet if I

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:23.219 
my hands are faster than my feet if I
I'm<00:01:22.149> going<00:01:22.329> to<00:01:22.390> play<00:01:22.509> a<00:01:22.539> sixteenth<00:01:23.140> note

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
I'm going to play a sixteenth note

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.170 
I'm going to play a sixteenth note
pattern<00:01:23.829> and<00:01:24.100> I'm<00:01:24.490> going<00:01:24.729> to<00:01:24.820> do<00:01:24.939> something

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
pattern and I'm going to do something

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.539 
pattern and I'm going to do something
that's<00:01:25.390> really<00:01:25.899> simple<00:01:26.530> to<00:01:26.770> understand<00:01:27.189> it's

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
that's really simple to understand it's

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.810 
that's really simple to understand it's
it<00:01:27.909> divides<00:01:28.509> evenly<00:01:28.869> into<00:01:29.140> two<00:01:29.829> bars<00:01:30.219> or<00:01:30.579> to

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
it divides evenly into two bars or to

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.599 
it divides evenly into two bars or to
one<00:01:31.119> bar<00:01:31.359> and<00:01:31.630> I'm<00:01:32.350> going<00:01:32.500> to<00:01:32.530> use<00:01:32.710> four<00:01:33.310> groups

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:33.609 
one bar and I'm going to use four groups

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:37.279 
one bar and I'm going to use four groups
of<00:01:33.759> six<00:01:34.030> notes<00:01:34.270> and<00:01:34.570> two<00:01:34.960> groups<00:01:35.170> of<00:01:35.380> four<00:01:35.590> and

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
of six notes and two groups of four and

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:39.300 
of six notes and two groups of four and
I'll<00:01:38.289> show<00:01:38.469> you<00:01:38.560> what<00:01:38.680> sixteenth<00:01:39.130> though

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
I'll show you what sixteenth though

00:01:39.310 --> 00:02:08.000 
I'll show you what sixteenth though
sounds<00:01:39.549> like

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.560 

so<00:02:09.010> when<00:02:09.250> I<00:02:09.280> got<00:02:09.520> that<00:02:09.700> going<00:02:09.910> my<00:02:10.210> basic

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
so when I got that going my basic

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.620 
so when I got that going my basic
subdivision<00:02:11.200> was<00:02:11.790> for<00:02:12.790> groups<00:02:13.000> of<00:02:13.120> six<00:02:13.390> and

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
subdivision was for groups of six and

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.010 
subdivision was for groups of six and
two<00:02:14.380> groups<00:02:14.560> of<00:02:14.770> four<00:02:15.480> which<00:02:16.480> comes<00:02:16.750> out<00:02:16.870> even

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
two groups of four which comes out even

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.650 
two groups of four which comes out even
over<00:02:17.260> two<00:02:17.500> bars<00:02:19.080> now<00:02:20.190> if<00:02:21.190> I<00:02:21.400> play<00:02:21.670> that<00:02:21.880> same

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
over two bars now if I play that same

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.160 
over two bars now if I play that same
pattern<00:02:23.020> two<00:02:23.530> times<00:02:23.920> as<00:02:24.750> 32nd<00:02:25.750> notes<00:02:25.900> it's

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
pattern two times as 32nd notes it's

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.840 
pattern two times as 32nd notes it's
going<00:02:26.320> to<00:02:26.380> take<00:02:26.530> two<00:02:26.680> measures<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:27.220> resolve<00:02:27.370> or

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
going to take two measures to resolve or

going to take two measures to resolve or
I'm<00:02:28.060> going<00:02:28.240> to<00:02:28.300> play<00:02:28.420> it<00:02:28.540> two<00:02:28.690> measures<00:02:29.050> and

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
I'm going to play it two measures and

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.820 
I'm going to play it two measures and
it's<00:02:30.700> quite<00:02:31.060> quite<00:02:31.870> intense<00:02:32.320> and<00:02:32.560> exciting

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
it's quite quite intense and exciting
