look like two regular oval shapes and

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.010 
look like two regular oval shapes and
then<00:01:08.939> you're<00:01:09.119> going<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.270> draw<00:01:09.510> in<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.780> ears

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
then you're going to draw in the ears

then you're going to draw in the ears
which<00:01:10.140> are<00:01:10.439> like<00:01:10.680> two<00:01:11.220> semi<00:01:11.640> circles<00:01:13.220> and<00:01:15.470> go

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
which are like two semi circles and go

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.679 
which are like two semi circles and go
ahead<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.799> indent<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.820> little<00:01:18.090> nose<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.600> it

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
ahead and indent that little nose so it

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.350 
ahead and indent that little nose so it
looks<00:01:18.869> more<00:01:18.960> like<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> real<00:01:19.680> Panda<00:01:20.100> there<00:01:20.909> now

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
looks more like a real Panda there now

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:31.210 
looks more like a real Panda there now
it's<00:01:21.540> time<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.780> outline

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.570 

and<00:01:31.910> if<00:01:32.060> you<00:01:32.180> see<00:01:32.510> that<00:01:32.980> there's<00:01:33.980> something<00:01:34.250> in

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
and if you see that there's something in

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.160 
and if you see that there's something in
your<00:01:34.700> original<00:01:34.880> drawing<00:01:35.270> you<00:01:35.450> don't<00:01:35.630> like<00:01:35.810> and

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
your original drawing you don't like and

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.950 
your original drawing you don't like and
you<00:01:36.620> just<00:01:36.770> get<00:01:37.010> this<00:01:37.160> whim<00:01:37.460> to<00:01:37.850> do<00:01:38.750> it<00:01:38.840> a<00:01:38.870> little

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
you just get this whim to do it a little

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.230 
you just get this whim to do it a little
bit<00:01:39.200> differently<00:01:39.590> that's<00:01:39.890> fine<00:01:40.190> you<00:01:41.060> can<00:01:41.210> use

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
bit differently that's fine you can use

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.460 
bit differently that's fine you can use
a<00:01:41.360> sharpie<00:01:41.780> marker<00:01:41.810> or<00:01:43.690> regular<00:01:44.690> crayola

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
a sharpie marker or regular crayola

00:01:45.470 --> 00:02:03.130 
a sharpie marker or regular crayola
marker<00:01:45.910> and<00:01:47.380> whatever<00:01:48.380> floats<00:01:48.710> your<00:01:48.860> boat

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.959 

when<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.259> draw<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.590> rest<00:02:05.249> of<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.549> pandas

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
when you draw the rest of the pandas

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:06.590 
when you draw the rest of the pandas
face

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
face

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.690 
face
make<00:02:06.749> sure<00:02:06.960> your<00:02:07.109> wrist<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.590> nice<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.039> relaxed

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
make sure your wrist is nice and relaxed

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:16.850 
make sure your wrist is nice and relaxed
so<00:02:09.599> you'll<00:02:10.140> have<00:02:10.259> smooth<00:02:10.709> lines<00:02:14.540> okay<00:02:15.860> now

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
so you'll have smooth lines okay now

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.070 
so you'll have smooth lines okay now
it's<00:02:17.069> time<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.280> erase<00:02:17.730> all<00:02:17.940> of<00:02:18.030> your<00:02:18.269> gestural

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
it's time to erase all of your gestural

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.470 
it's time to erase all of your gestural
pencil<00:02:19.560> lines<00:02:19.799> I<00:02:20.160> like<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:20.910> use<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.180> kneaded

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
pencil lines I like to use the kneaded

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.539 
pencil lines I like to use the kneaded
eraser<00:02:21.540> because<00:02:22.170> it<00:02:22.379> makes<00:02:22.560> much<00:02:23.069> less<00:02:23.099> of<00:02:23.489> a

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
eraser because it makes much less of a

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:39.190 
eraser because it makes much less of a
mess<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:23.849> it<00:02:23.940> doesn't<00:02:24.209> smudge

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.410 

and<00:02:40.069> during<00:02:40.370> this<00:02:40.490> time<00:02:40.550> you<00:02:41.030> want<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.209> think

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
and during this time you want to think

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.540 
and during this time you want to think
about<00:02:41.660> what<00:02:41.959> you<00:02:42.230> want<00:02:42.440> to<00:02:42.500> use<00:02:42.980> to<00:02:43.160> color<00:02:43.370> your

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
about what you want to use to color your

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.160 
about what you want to use to color your
panda<00:02:44.000> with<00:02:44.380> you<00:02:45.380> can<00:02:45.709> color<00:02:46.340> in<00:02:46.580> black<00:02:46.930> or<00:02:47.930> you

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
panda with you can color in black or you

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.479 
panda with you can color in black or you
could<00:02:48.380> even<00:02:48.530> use<00:02:48.880> pink<00:02:49.880> or<00:02:51.040> rainbow<00:02:52.040> colors

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
could even use pink or rainbow colors

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.790 
could even use pink or rainbow colors
I'm<00:02:53.330> going<00:02:53.390> to<00:02:53.630> use<00:02:53.690> my<00:02:53.989> pencil<00:02:54.260> because<00:02:54.709> I

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
I'm going to use my pencil because I

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.350 
I'm going to use my pencil because I
want<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:54.980> be<00:02:55.099> able<00:02:55.190> to<00:02:55.370> see<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:55.730> pandas<00:02:56.120> eyes

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
want to be able to see the pandas eyes

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.750 
want to be able to see the pandas eyes
so<00:02:57.260> I'm<00:02:57.380> going<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.590> shade<00:02:57.890> it<00:02:58.100> in<00:02:58.250> a<00:02:58.280> medium

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
so I'm going to shade it in a medium

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:25.990 
so I'm going to shade it in a medium
tongue

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000
