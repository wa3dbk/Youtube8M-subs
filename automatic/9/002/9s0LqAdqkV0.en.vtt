00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
me the effect was negative so let's turn

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.649 
me the effect was negative so let's turn
to<00:01:19.890> other<00:01:20.340> kinds<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.700> genres<00:01:21.030> say<00:01:21.180> someone<00:01:21.540> is

giving a speech and you think about all

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.550 
giving a speech and you think about all
the<00:01:24.060> choices<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.659> go<00:01:24.780> into<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.110> speech

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
the choices that go into that speech

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.920 
the choices that go into that speech
about<00:01:25.860> how<00:01:26.040> she<00:01:26.580> can<00:01:26.759> choose<00:01:27.000> how<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.479> say

restaurant it was so inappropriate to
wear<00:03:52.660> that<00:03:52.780> t-shirt<00:03:52.959> but<00:03:53.620> if<00:03:53.829> that<00:03:54.069> t-shirt

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
wear that t-shirt but if that t-shirt

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.949

were in a rock concert it might see him

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.229 
were in a rock concert it might see him
in<00:03:56.109> that<00:03:56.350> context<00:03:56.739> a<00:03:56.829> little<00:03:57.130> bit<00:03:57.280> less<00:03:57.880> out<00:03:58.090> of

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
in that context a little bit less out of

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.090 
in that context a little bit less out of
place<00:03:58.420> I'm<00:03:58.600> still<00:03:59.170> not<00:03:59.290> great<00:03:59.470> right<00:03:59.739> but<00:03:59.769> a

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
place I'm still not great right but a

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.069 
place I'm still not great right but a
little<00:04:00.430> bit<00:04:00.670> more<00:04:00.700> in<00:04:01.120> place<00:04:01.299> so<00:04:01.720> what<00:04:01.959> we're

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
little bit more in place so what we're

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:03.629 
little bit more in place so what we're
seeing<00:04:02.230> is<00:04:02.380> that<00:04:02.440> the<00:04:02.859> effectiveness<00:04:03.400> of

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:03.639 
seeing is that the effectiveness of

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:06.599 
seeing is that the effectiveness of
communication<00:04:03.819> depends<00:04:04.810> in<00:04:05.079> part<00:04:05.109> on<00:04:05.680> the

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
communication depends in part on the

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:08.729 
communication depends in part on the
situation<00:04:07.239> in<00:04:07.389> which<00:04:07.420> it's<00:04:07.750> delivered<00:04:07.900> so<00:04:08.380> if

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
situation in which it's delivered so if

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.259 
situation in which it's delivered so if
I<00:04:08.859> were<00:04:08.950> writing<00:04:09.160> an<00:04:09.280> analysis<00:04:09.730> I<00:04:09.850> want<00:04:10.000> to<00:04:10.090> say

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
I were writing an analysis I want to say

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.330 
I were writing an analysis I want to say
something<00:04:10.569> about<00:04:10.660> that<00:04:10.959> hey<00:04:11.139> this<00:04:11.859> is<00:04:12.069> where

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
something about that hey this is where

something about that hey this is where
this<00:04:12.670> was<00:04:13.000> this<00:04:13.209> is<00:04:13.269> where<00:04:13.600> I<00:04:13.660> found<00:04:14.079> it<00:04:14.319> this

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
this was this is where I found it this

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.860 
this was this is where I found it this
is<00:04:14.590> where<00:04:14.799> it<00:04:14.829> was<00:04:15.130> designed<00:04:15.609> to<00:04:15.819> be<00:04:16.209> read<00:04:16.630> or

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
might have on an audience so when she

what<00:05:07.150> that<00:05:07.870> decision<00:05:08.560> on<00:05:09.070> an<00:05:09.310> audience<00:05:09.670> might

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
what that decision on an audience might

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.090

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
you know she also made a decision about

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.140

how<00:05:13.570> to<00:05:13.600> organize<00:05:13.720> things<00:05:14.350> and<00:05:14.880> that<00:05:15.880> might

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
how to organize things and that might

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.150 
how to organize things and that might
have<00:05:16.210> had<00:05:16.390> more<00:05:16.810> of<00:05:16.930> a<00:05:17.020> negative<00:05:17.530> effect<00:05:18.070> on

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
have had more of a negative effect on

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
certain people in the audience and then

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.200 
certain people in the audience and then
when<00:05:20.620> she<00:05:21.160> made<00:05:21.280> another<00:05:21.490> choice<00:05:21.760> about<00:05:22.060> how

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
when she made another choice about how

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.460 
when she made another choice about how
how<00:05:22.480> much<00:05:22.600> to<00:05:22.660> use<00:05:22.780> logic<00:05:22.930> how<00:05:23.200> must<00:05:23.380> use

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
how much to use logic how must use

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.530 
how much to use logic how must use
motions<00:05:23.950> um<00:05:24.160> that<00:05:24.880> that<00:05:25.120> might<00:05:25.270> have<00:05:25.360> worked

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.540 
motions um that that might have worked

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.120 
motions um that that might have worked
really<00:05:25.750> well<00:05:25.870> for<00:05:25.990> some<00:05:26.260> people<00:05:26.290> but<00:05:26.830> remember

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
really well for some people but remember

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.590 
really well for some people but remember
people<00:05:27.400> aren't<00:05:27.610> completely<00:05:28.180> predictable

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.600 
people aren't completely predictable

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.630 
people aren't completely predictable
right<00:05:28.870> so<00:05:29.080> some<00:05:29.260> people<00:05:29.350> might<00:05:29.620> have<00:05:30.040> had<00:05:30.340> a

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
right so some people might have had a

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.060 
right so some people might have had a
more<00:05:30.910> of<00:05:31.090> a<00:05:31.180> negative<00:05:31.390> emotion<00:05:31.990> or<00:05:32.200> might<00:05:32.710> have

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
more of a negative emotion or might have

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.200 
more of a negative emotion or might have
been<00:05:33.220> so<00:05:33.430> bored<00:05:33.670> they<00:05:33.790> didn't<00:05:33.970> pay<00:05:34.120> attention

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
been so bored they didn't pay attention

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.870 
been so bored they didn't pay attention
about<00:05:34.630> this<00:05:35.620> is<00:05:35.770> the<00:05:35.890> nature<00:05:36.130> of<00:05:36.460> rhetoric

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880

this is the nature of rhetorical

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.020 
this is the nature of rhetorical
communication<00:05:38.980> people<00:05:39.220> make<00:05:39.520> choices<00:05:39.790> all

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
obviously number two and three won't

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.420 
obviously number two and three won't
necessarily<00:05:46.240> happen<00:05:46.990> in<00:05:47.380> the<00:05:47.860> same<00:05:48.040> order<00:05:48.400> you
