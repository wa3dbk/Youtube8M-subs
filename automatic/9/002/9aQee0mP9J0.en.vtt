00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.450
 go 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.880
 It is very tight screw that at 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:02:03.360
 sometimes you find the thickest all 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:07.800
 I made the same turn the starting engine 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:22.090

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:44.430

 There's one more screw down here. 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:39.550
 We are going to take a curt break and not 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:50.500
 far too long 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:56.310
 passed this vehicle here is a utility 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:59.380
 is a bug and like yesterday 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:04.210
 made in clay will probably 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:06.880
 being the name of the rock and had oil 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:09.340
 it is leaking oil 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:14.710
 so I try to take the engine off 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:20.740
 in order to change this piece is behind the 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:28.090
 steering wheel and inside quite a bit of noise 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:35.490
 and it 's too much can here now probably 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:35.490

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:11.650

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:15.069

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:22.360
 or not as you see it is full of 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:25.840
 oil is bright and can not be 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:28.650
 so bright and has to stay dry 

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.650
