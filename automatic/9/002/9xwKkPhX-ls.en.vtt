00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.620
 today we prepare treats of puff pastry with 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.799
 chocolate and hazelnut cream 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.240
 for this we will need puff pastry 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:15.930
 secret grams of chocolate to melt 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.270
 and hazelnut cream 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.370
 well we start by extending the masses 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.280
 in this case we are going to extend the two 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.600
 masses together what we want is to do 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.270
 a high puff pastry by which 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.360
 let's unite the two layers is we begin 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.560
 lighting our dough in a fountain 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.890
 we already take advantage of the same role that 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.489
 the dough with a brush and a little water 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.379
 we obey one of them and now we pass 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.629
 to extend the next layer just that 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.610
 let's try to mount the above to 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.460
 whereupon we open first half of it 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.150
 we turn around and now we try to put 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.590
 over 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:55.100
 from the previous 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:58.030
 and we started the deployment process 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.170
 we remove the paper we understand well 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.170
 and here we would have 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.080
 the next step would be to do the 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.510
 hearts in this case we are going to 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.310
 take advantage let's do a prior what 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.610
 that will take us 1 what will 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.470
 catch the other 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.880
 so 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.850
 we are not going to start 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.460
 before the keel we make with the help of the 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.670
 cup a half moon and here another half 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.670
 Moon 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.920
 here we take advantage of this form that we have 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.920
 Done before 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.689
 and here we take this form 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.940
 and now we do the same thing on the other side 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.650
 we put the cup 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.650
 and makes half moon 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.460
 and we put the cup in another side 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:12.820
 and we also take advantage and do the other 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.820
 and here we make the heart shape 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.879
 this case 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.720
 and we remove the last left after 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.720
 we will take advantage 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.720
 here we have both and now what 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.220
 we do is separate one of the two 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.410
 we take the smallest that is more 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.200
 practical easier to mold 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.480
 and we separated them to a group we just 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.840
 do good the way we are left 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.840
 brands 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.450
 once we have cut we put a 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.150
 egg 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.560
 and we wet our puff pastry with him as 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.840
 we want it not to go up we're not going to click 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.190
 the look 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.190
 we do the same with the other heart 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.690
 and now we bake about 13 to 15 minutes 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.990
 depending on the oven at 200 degrees up 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.990
 that is golden 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.980
 Well, the 15 minutes have passed 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.230
 we removed as you see they have already taken their 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.680
 we let you cool on a 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.819
 grill 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.859
 to then fill them 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.319
 we are going to prepare coverage for 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:28.560
 chocolate for this we put water at 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:30.840
 fire and when it starts to boil we put 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.659
 our chopped chocolate in this case 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.430
 about 130 grams and we let it melt 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:37.260
 little by little the water once it is 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.079
 hot simply have to maintain 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.750
 the temperature you put it over medium heat and 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:44.370
 leave it 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.159
 and here we would have seen it 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.420
 as you see little by little it is melting and 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:49.830
 now it is found let's put on fire 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.040
 and let it do what account 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.040
 I presented 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.069
 but as you can see our jade has already been 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.870
 cooled and now while doing 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.370
 our chocolate coverage we are going to 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.670
 cut it and national or with cream 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.290
 hazelnuts 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.069
 for that we take a knife 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.069
 and carefully 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.740
 we separate our part 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.100
 and now we recreate with the cream of 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:29.160
 hazelnuts the quantity depends on the 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:32.630
 you want chocolate 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.630
 but a generous capital 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:41.850
 if we cover again and now we're going to 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.849
 do for it we're going to put it on 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.319
 a grid 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:48.189
 and now like these devices that I eat 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:48.189
 You see it's melted 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:55.039
 We are going to distribute 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.039
 notice that something falls around the edges 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.560
 well we have already covered kevin dÃ­az 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.220
 has this 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.220
 same 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.680
 well let's cool down a little 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:14.380
 chocolate and we serve them 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.720
 if you are wondering what it is that 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.910
 we did with the rest of the mass here 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.169
 you have the answer that we cut with 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.139
 various forms 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:24.060
 we bake it 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.569
 let's win them as a little bit of 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.580
 leftover too 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:31.159
 these mini scouts we can also 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.189
 open them and fill them with cream cream 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:35.539
 pastry or with hazelnut cream and 

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:37.520
 up to here our chocolate quarry 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:40.069
 with hazelnut cream to enjoy it 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.820
 and remember that although the 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:45.570
 chocolate lips 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.570
 this person
