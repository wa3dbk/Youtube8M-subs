00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.720
 the formula 1 of codemasters performs 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.580
 this year the qualitative leap 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.980
 definitive for the current generation 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.600
 of consoles taken in hand the license in the 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.820
 2010 with the launch of the first episode 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.900
 of the series over the years yes 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.730
 there is a constant improvement 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.670
 qualitative that brought up 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:26.460
 to the excellent f1 2012 and that today gives birth 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.530
 f1 2013 title able to conquer 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.390
 without too many problems the palm tree as 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.700
 best formula 1 game of the last 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.510
 years and meritly fit among the 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.510
 great like that 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.710
 what is surprising is the enormous flexibility of the 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.840
 play structure capable of 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.850
 turn from arcade simply 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.920
 activating all simulator aids 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.020
 naked and raw maybe not at the levels of 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.640
 strength but transport and tourism but 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.910
 certainly able to satisfy the 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.170
 enthusiasts in search of realism 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.970
 obviously we focused on 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.770
 latter aspect and exploiting the 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.240
 long awaited feature that allows 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.520
 now to save at any time 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.780
 during the session we evaluated 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.850
 the efficiency of the game structure 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.890
 performing a series of races hundred 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.239
 per cent of duration 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.370
 beyond the driving feeling that 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.380
 better than done with f1 2012 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.420
 returning in the hands of the player away 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.980
 for heavier cars subjected to stress 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.390
 realistically from every slightest movement 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.500
 of the steering wheel 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.200
 codemasters understandably has 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.580
 worked a lot on the tire factor 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.920
 one of the most delicate aspects e 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.130
 criticized by the 2013 formula season 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.690
 1 the name of realism the player must 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.280
 obviously deal with this 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.900
 problem and accept the fact that the 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.010
 Pirelli tire consumption is 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.570
 excessive 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.250
 sometimes seriously exactly 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.250
 as in the real formula 1 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.770
 real production defect is from 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.390
 instead to look into the damage system is 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.400
 a pity to see it as a game like that 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.840
 cared for in so many ways is lost in a 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.790
 detail that counts a lot in a 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.530
 racing title especially if yes 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.060
 deals with the formula 1 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.580
 the rear wings of each car 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.380
 they are practically indestructible and alone 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.780
 with truly violent impacts is a 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.940
 important damage on the whole machine i 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.100
 contacts then still propose too much of 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.140
 arcade and the natural thrill that is born 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.820
 from a possible wheel-to-wheel touch 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.890
 it vanishes as soon as you notice how the two 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.680
 single-seaters involved remain anchored on the 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.410
 big ground new in this 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.030
 production was f1 classics mode that 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.650
 allows enthusiasts to get on 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.050
 driving a single-seater who did 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.740
 the history of the sector with pilots entered 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.690
 in legend 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:37.700
 unfortunately, before you ask it 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.700
 missing senna for a matter of vicenza 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.940
 the rest of the game modes 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.550
 includes career return 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.650
 anticipated by tests for young drivers e 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.810
 the scenario mode to complete 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.790
 specific goals per race depending on 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.230
 of the proposed situations and the various ones 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.480
 time trials along with the possibility 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.190
 to play a mini-championship of ten 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.810
 races to conquer the car more 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.690
 coveted starting from one of the teams 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.100
 lower to close the fund 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.630
 technician remains in line with i 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.770
 predecessors with some improvement 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.140
 as for lighting 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:22.700
 with solar rays that finally yes 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.370
 reflect realistically on 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.350
 single-seat framerate on console is for 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.970
 fluid luck in the tender phase and yes 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.740
 let go of some uncertainty only 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.810
 in replays while not missing a bit 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.140
 aliasing that dirty the image even though 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.450
 not seriously annoying f1 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.010
 2013 does not revolutionize the series but 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.600
 presents those targeted improvements and 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.340
 much requested by fans who 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.020
 they actually decreed it as the best 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.520
 the codemasters era is among the best 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.890
 always in the history of games 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.520
