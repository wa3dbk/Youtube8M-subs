00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.950

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.750

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.830

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.240
 and good and the whole hysterical world I 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.800
 agreement that I started to open my eyes 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.740
 I felt very bad and could not breathe 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.210
 then I asked them for air 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.970
 ernesto air I can not breathe I can not 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.640
 breathe and there was the doctor next 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.920
 mine and I said karla look at me I'm I do not know 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.900

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.790

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.200
 you are on an airplane that I am 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.180
 started talking about how I'm going to start 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.640
 come back and not 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.790
 nothing like not understanding much what 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:07.629
 happened if I had some kind of had 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:10.290
 something to give you your serum, nothing, nothing 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:15.519
 nothing only oxygen oxygen only 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:18.329
 and there I was lying on the plane and that 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:21.280
 it was tragicomic 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.020
 Of course I come back from fainting I see everything 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.940
 the hysterical world worried the stewardess 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.250
 I had told him I was cold 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.070
 I was like with a lot of things on 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.410
 blankets the jacket also from the 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.419
 stewardess the cam jacket and everything very 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:39.690

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.870
 I swear that the greatest shame of 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.140
 my life and I look at cam and I tell him my 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.140
 love 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.520
 and we would be calm because I had a 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.550
 faint long but it will be all right not 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.200
