pressure plates release bearings but
this<00:00:35.730> applies<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.149> all<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.780> them<00:00:37.190> we<00:00:38.190> have<00:00:38.399> here

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
this applies to all of them we have here

this applies to all of them we have here
two<00:00:39.000> two<00:00:39.390> pressure<00:00:39.660> plates<00:00:40.050> they<00:00:40.350> are<00:00:40.500> the

two two pressure plates they are the
same<00:00:40.950> pressure<00:00:41.820> plates<00:00:42.530> when<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.649> there's

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
same pressure plates when you there's

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.310

three<00:00:44.550> levers<00:00:45.149> on<00:00:45.480> each<00:00:45.629> one<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.079> these<00:00:46.140> you

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
three levers on each one of these you

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.810 
three levers on each one of these you
press<00:00:46.590> down<00:00:46.950> on<00:00:47.010> this<00:00:47.789> thrust<00:00:48.629> face<00:00:49.190> here<00:00:50.190> it

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
press down on this thrust face here it

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.389 
press down on this thrust face here it
levers<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.780> takes<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.440> thrust<00:00:52.800> face<00:00:53.129> and

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
levers and takes this thrust face and

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.260 
levers and takes this thrust face and
pulls<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.449> down<00:00:54.710> so<00:00:55.710> as<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.100> goes<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.699> this

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
pulls it down so as this goes in this

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.930 
pulls it down so as this goes in this
comes<00:00:57.600> back<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.320> that's<00:00:58.890> what<00:00:59.129> disengages

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
comes back and that's what disengages

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.590 
comes back and that's what disengages
the<00:00:59.969> clutch<00:01:00.329> now<00:01:01.260> writing<00:01:01.649> on<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.670> we

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
the clutch now writing on this we

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.960 
the clutch now writing on this we
already<00:01:03.899> did<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.979> other<00:01:05.129> day<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.640> this

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
already did this the other day is this

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.109 
already did this the other day is this
carbon<00:01:06.390> release<00:01:06.869> bearing<00:01:07.260> that's<00:01:08.040> like<00:01:08.430> 6h

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
carbon release bearing that's like 6h

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.800 
carbon release bearing that's like 6h
you<00:01:12.119> can<00:01:12.330> write<00:01:12.570> with<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.500> well<00:01:14.509> if<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.659> had<00:01:15.750> a

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
you can write with it well if I had a

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.510 
you can write with it well if I had a
piece<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.049> paper<00:01:16.229> here<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.740> something<00:01:17.159> harder

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
piece of paper here and something harder

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.730 
piece of paper here and something harder
but<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.240> can<00:01:18.420> actually<00:01:18.630> admit<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.560> a

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
but it you can actually admit it's a

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.910 
but it you can actually admit it's a
this<00:01:20.610> carbon<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.479> graphite<00:01:21.689> it's<00:01:22.320> like<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.500> real

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
this carbon is graphite it's like a real

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.990 
this carbon is graphite it's like a real
hard<00:01:23.540> drafting<00:01:24.540> pen<00:01:24.780> pencil<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:26.549> this<00:01:26.700> comes

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
hard drafting pen pencil so this comes

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.630 
hard drafting pen pencil so this comes
down<00:01:27.210> on<00:01:27.420> here<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:27.840> presses<00:01:28.380> on<00:01:28.560> here<00:01:28.920> with<00:01:29.610> a

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
down on here this presses on here with a

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.249 
down on here this presses on here with a
release<00:01:30.030> bearing<00:01:30.299> fork<00:01:30.920> here<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:33.170> that's<00:01:34.170> how

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
release bearing fork here and that's how

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.190 
release bearing fork here and that's how
this<00:01:35.130> guy<00:01:35.340> works<00:01:35.579> we<00:01:36.479> already<00:01:36.780> talked<00:01:37.079> about

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
this guy works we already talked about

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.469 
this guy works we already talked about
how<00:01:38.570> roller<00:01:39.570> bearings<00:01:39.990> don't<00:01:40.290> work<00:01:40.500> on<00:01:40.710> MGS

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
how roller bearings don't work on MGS

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.289 
how roller bearings don't work on MGS
anyway<00:01:42.770> that's<00:01:43.770> what<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.280> relatively<00:01:44.909> new

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
anyway that's what a relatively new

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.139 
anyway that's what a relatively new
release<00:01:45.780> bearing<00:01:46.079> looks<00:01:46.500> like<00:01:46.759> this<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:47.939> what

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
release bearing looks like this is what

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.690 
release bearing looks like this is what
a<00:01:48.180> pretty<00:01:48.600> good<00:01:48.840> looking<00:01:49.200> pressure<00:01:49.950> pressure

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
a pretty good looking pressure pressure

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.030 
a pretty good looking pressure pressure
plate<00:01:51.030> looks<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:51.390> but<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.720> thrust<00:01:52.040> surface

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
plate looks like but the thrust surface

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.639 
plate looks like but the thrust surface
is<00:01:53.250> usually<00:01:53.490> nice<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.210> polished<00:01:54.450> nice<00:01:55.409> and

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
is usually nice and polished nice and

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.080 
is usually nice and polished nice and
clean<00:01:56.090> this<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.210> what<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.450> bad<00:01:57.719> one<00:01:58.020> looks<00:01:58.290> like

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
clean this is what a bad one looks like

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.330 
clean this is what a bad one looks like
and<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.299> what<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.630> bad<00:02:01.009> release<00:02:02.009> bearing

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
and this is what a bad release bearing

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.420 
and this is what a bad release bearing
looks<00:02:02.939> like<00:02:03.210> look<00:02:04.049> at<00:02:04.170> how<00:02:04.320> that's<00:02:04.560> worn<00:02:04.890> look

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
looks like look at how that's worn look

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.960 
looks like look at how that's worn look
at<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.790> we're<00:02:06.659> not<00:02:06.840> sure<00:02:07.530> why<00:02:08.220> this<00:02:08.280> happened

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
at that we're not sure why this happened

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.210 
at that we're not sure why this happened
we're<00:02:09.629> not<00:02:09.660> sure<00:02:10.080> if<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.349> carbon<00:02:10.649> was<00:02:11.009> too

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
we're not sure if the carbon was too

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.580 
we're not sure if the carbon was too
thin

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590

look<00:02:12.280> what<00:02:12.489> happened<00:02:12.910> in<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.060> end<00:02:13.300> was<00:02:13.930> our

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
look what happened in the end was our

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.040 
look what happened in the end was our
our<00:02:14.739> owner<00:02:15.270> was<00:02:16.270> I<00:02:18.060> can't<00:02:19.060> get<00:02:19.180> that<00:02:19.300> snip<00:02:19.630> back

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
our owner was I can't get that snip back

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:27.360 
our owner was I can't get that snip back
in<00:02:20.260> there<00:02:20.459> very<00:02:21.459> easily<00:02:24.000> but<00:02:25.319> eventually<00:02:26.370> the

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
in there very easily but eventually the

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.880 
in there very easily but eventually the
carbon<00:02:27.819> was<00:02:28.000> gone<00:02:28.239> all<00:02:28.569> together<00:02:28.959> and<00:02:29.620> it<00:02:29.739> was

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
carbon was gone all together and it was

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.670 
carbon was gone all together and it was
just<00:02:30.190> this<00:02:30.459> riding<00:02:31.060> up<00:02:31.269> on<00:02:31.420> on<00:02:31.989> the<00:02:32.380> thrust

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
just this riding up on on the thrust

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.680 
just this riding up on on the thrust
plate<00:02:33.010> in<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.849> thrust<00:02:34.120> plate<00:02:34.420> which<00:02:34.660> is

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
plate in the thrust plate which is

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.559 
plate in the thrust plate which is
supposed<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.290> be<00:02:35.440> a<00:02:35.470> nice<00:02:35.760> flat<00:02:36.760> surface<00:02:36.790> has

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
supposed to be a nice flat surface has

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.000 
supposed to be a nice flat surface has
adopted<00:02:37.930> this<00:02:38.790> convex<00:02:40.440> appearance<00:02:41.440> and<00:02:41.739> this

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
adopted this convex appearance and this

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.180 
adopted this convex appearance and this
of<00:02:42.160> course<00:02:42.190> has<00:02:42.550> become<00:02:42.730> concave<00:02:43.630> so<00:02:44.130> so<00:02:45.130> to

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
of course has become concave so so to

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.110 
of course has become concave so so to
use<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:45.850> modern<00:02:46.709> breakfast<00:02:47.709> expression<00:02:48.459> this

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
use the modern breakfast expression this

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.240 
use the modern breakfast expression this
is<00:02:49.330> toast

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
is toast

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.440 
is toast
again<00:02:51.250> we're<00:02:51.430> not<00:02:51.459> sure<00:02:51.790> why<00:02:51.970> it<00:02:52.030> happened

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
again we're not sure why it happened

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.580 
again we're not sure why it happened
that<00:02:52.540> is<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:53.019> engines<00:02:53.709> only<00:02:53.980> 1,500<00:02:54.670> miles<00:02:54.850> old

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
that is the engines only 1,500 miles old

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.809 
that is the engines only 1,500 miles old
you'd<00:02:56.590> have<00:02:56.830> to<00:02:57.010> have<00:02:57.160> your<00:02:57.370> foot<00:02:57.670> on<00:02:57.700> that

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
you'd have to have your foot on that

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.500 
you'd have to have your foot on that
clutch<00:02:58.390> all<00:02:58.690> locked<00:02:59.500> to<00:03:00.190> eat<00:03:00.430> it<00:03:00.610> up<00:03:00.730> like<00:03:01.030> that

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
clutch all locked to eat it up like that

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.240 
clutch all locked to eat it up like that
so<00:03:01.870> we<00:03:02.049> think<00:03:02.260> there<00:03:02.500> must<00:03:02.620> have<00:03:02.799> been<00:03:02.890> some

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
so we think there must have been some

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.000 
so we think there must have been some
residual<00:03:03.910> pressure<00:03:04.299> in<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:04.780> clutch<00:03:05.080> that<00:03:05.799> was

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
residual pressure in the clutch that was

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.300 
residual pressure in the clutch that was
holding<00:03:06.580> this<00:03:07.360> bearing<00:03:07.930> against<00:03:08.709> here<00:03:09.069> and

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
holding this bearing against here and

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.130 
holding this bearing against here and
eventually<00:03:10.299> after<00:03:11.280> 1,500<00:03:12.280> miles<00:03:12.519> of<00:03:13.140> spinning

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
eventually after 1,500 miles of spinning

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.699 
eventually after 1,500 miles of spinning
at<00:03:14.319> several<00:03:14.830> thousand<00:03:15.280> rpm<00:03:16.170> eight<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:17.470> thing

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
at several thousand rpm eight the thing

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.830 
at several thousand rpm eight the thing
up<00:03:17.890> I<00:03:18.160> don't<00:03:18.640> know<00:03:18.730> if<00:03:18.820> anyone<00:03:19.120> anyone<00:03:19.359> watched
