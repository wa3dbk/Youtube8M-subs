 free 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:12.389
 Now 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.459
 Targeted the mobile phone industry etc. 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:17.560
 I'm a university student with supporters 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.590
 Various programs that are active in the creator industry in the program 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.220
 I do not do the type of women 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.220
 I heard about the previous work 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.600
 Vegetables are 123 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.580
 I'm right away 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.340
 I would like to deposit money once again and see what the situation is. 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.700
 became 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.940
 Kaji came out 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.180
 Naturally in such materials 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.710
 If the other side thinks that it is good with the same customer 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.100
 Would you please 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.000
 Imagine that I want to show this place 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 I will connect that feeling while 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.430
 In particular 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.800
 As part of that 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.060
 I like it so much I talk 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.410
 Such intelligence and video 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.210
 Recruitment of engine video with 13522 in the hips 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.510
 doing 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.510
 You are in the picture industry 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.570
 From the city as a candidate one year 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:29.650
 Mono line up 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.770
 I'm running right now, but it is virtualization software that became Tohshin University 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.500
 The price is 4935 yen 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.880
 There 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.880
 Even if there are these people 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.580
 The target for next year may also take, but the selling price is good 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.040
 I think that I want to go on foot in this as it is made 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.220
 I have started to fade from the test 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.580
 Did the specialized director choose red garden editing in front of the booth? 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.799
 From birds 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.480
 While assembling work 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.490
 It's cheap and always great people's water saving 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.719
 In particular, tension rises and demand rises 

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:11.370
 Old control 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.659
 It is to do 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:14.469
 Why is it so great 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:17.779
 I'm doing 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:21.679
 Have you done this editing job right after graduation? 

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:23.649
 The system for 

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:28.549
 But this pv production company and policy assistant 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:36.359
 I think that your reaction is close to the work of play is also good 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:38.949
 Current task 

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:40.329
 Did it 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.080
 Especially I can not see the surroundings 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.090
 Much trouble 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.190
 One thing I need to do 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:49.409
 Saying that 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:52.089
 It was a disadvantage but it is said to turn 

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:55.089
 I think if it is transient 

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:58.559
 Figure 2 for the semi 

00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:01.309
 Not settled 

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:03.389
 Do you have any particular concerns 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.439
 I am sticking with myself 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:07.689
 In the direction of ipa 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:09.949
 I'm sure you'll be happy 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:12.949
 Commitment if you think that 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:18.290
 If it is a song, which photo is taken at the point of solitude 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.289
 Came 

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:23.489
 I wonder if I can tell 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.049
 A child who is a wisdom 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.249
 Imagine 

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:29.249
 The dollar has risen 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:33.049
 The most pleasant for this work and the past moist 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.049
 As you do 

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:39.369
 It is natural 

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:41.349
 At first glance, hit 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:43.189
 Most decided before 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:44.289
 Hatton's 

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:47.069
 Just a little longer 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.809
 The table is integrated 

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:52.719
 Earned based on other people 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:54.769
 Far in the future 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.179
 Newly developed 

00:03:57.179 --> 00:03:58.549
 Gotenba 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.379
 Pattern that I am concerned about 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.079
 If you come to the last minute 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.969
 You can also shoot from the standpoint of an editor near you 

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:10.679
 On the other hand 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.039
 It spread to such atmosphere 

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:16.939
 I think one is a wonderfully wonderful thing to unify the way of unity 

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:18.430
 but 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.809
 a lot of things 

00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:21.709
 I was studying while 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.030
 I think that it is the best after all editing of Moshi finally 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.150
 It is also good to go three 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.379
 Cameraman too 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:32.669
 In general, if you think about it, you can go there 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.669
 Become 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.669
 It is one of the video industry like players 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.520
 I can give you advice 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.520
 Early and late 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.199
 People who work in church 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:52.199
 To find out 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.389
 It says that he heard from people indirectly 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.990
 I read in a book 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.990
 I think it's a perverse thing 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:05.449
 The person who can talk so close to me or someone who can not hear the story 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:07.419
 Own 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:10.419
 I think I'm getting closer to motivation too 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.330
 It gives the result whether you can consult 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.979
 It became a topic 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:20.360
 I want to continue my work in this film industry 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.289
 Women active in the world industry 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.550
 I would like to suspect infection 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:26.220
 looking forward to
