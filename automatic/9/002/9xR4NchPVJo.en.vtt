have<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.970> depth<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.299> EVE<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.860> seems<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.040> have

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
have the depth of EVE it seems to have

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.649 
have the depth of EVE it seems to have
all<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.640> things<00:01:35.759> you'd<00:01:35.970> want<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.390> mean<00:01:36.540> it's

move from EVE this is the game I would
recommend<00:01:45.060> right<00:01:45.680> uh<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:47.189> has<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.360> system<00:01:48.960> for

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
recommend right uh it has a system for

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.560 
recommend right uh it has a system for
mining<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.040> resource<00:01:50.640> gathering<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:51.509> I

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
mining and resource gathering that I

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.840

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
time getting to play it mining wasn't

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.440 
time getting to play it mining wasn't
always<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.189> most<00:02:02.369> exciting<00:02:02.640> activities

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
always the most exciting activities

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.789 
always the most exciting activities
right<00:02:03.630> as<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.869> miner<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.409> just<00:02:04.590> sat<00:02:04.770> there

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
right as a miner you just sat there

after<00:02:13.709> sitting<00:02:14.160> there<00:02:14.310> mining<00:02:14.730> for<00:02:15.120> a

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
after sitting there mining for a

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.470

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
extended period of time or you guys got

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.640 
extended period of time or you guys got
attacked<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:19.430> you<00:02:20.430> fled<00:02:20.790> or<00:02:20.970> died<00:02:21.150> right<00:02:21.650> the

attacked and you fled or died right the

attacked and you fled or died right the
nice<00:02:22.830> thing<00:02:22.980> about<00:02:23.040> this<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:23.459> makes<00:02:23.490> mining

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
nice thing about this is it makes mining

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.229 
nice thing about this is it makes mining
a<00:02:24.000> little<00:02:24.270> bit<00:02:24.360> more<00:02:24.540> interactive<00:02:25.220> because

a little bit more interactive because

Potter colder it's really interesting

Potter colder it's really interesting
because<00:02:52.880> you<00:02:53.880> do<00:02:54.090> your<00:02:54.269> scan<00:02:54.569> and<00:02:54.989> sort<00:02:55.500> of

because you do your scan and sort of

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.040 
because you do your scan and sort of
send<00:02:55.769> you<00:02:55.890> out<00:02:55.980> in<00:02:56.220> direction<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.840> keep

send you out in direction and you keep

send you out in direction and you keep

you<00:02:59.640> get<00:02:59.790> to<00:02:59.850> a<00:03:00.239> good<00:03:00.569> mining<00:03:00.930> point<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.440> your

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
you get to a good mining point that your

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.040 
you get to a good mining point that your
scan<00:03:01.950> is<00:03:02.069> located<00:03:02.580> you<00:03:03.000> do<00:03:03.090> another<00:03:03.300> scan<00:03:03.660> and

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
scan is located you do another scan and

scan is located you do another scan and
it<00:03:04.410> will<00:03:04.530> sort<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:04.709> give<00:03:04.950> you<00:03:05.040> the

it will sort of give you the

it will sort of give you the

distribution of material of mineral
within<00:03:08.670> that<00:03:08.819> area<00:03:09.300> and<00:03:09.540> you'll<00:03:10.470> pick<00:03:10.650> a<00:03:10.680> place

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
within that area and you'll pick a place

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.500 
within that area and you'll pick a place
within<00:03:11.489> that<00:03:11.640> distribution<00:03:12.239> to<00:03:12.330> mine

within that distribution to mine

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.500 
within that distribution to mine
hopefully<00:03:12.840> gain<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.080> most<00:03:13.230> resources<00:03:14.510> but

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
hopefully gain the most resources but

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.729 
hopefully gain the most resources but
where<00:03:15.660> it<00:03:15.720> gets<00:03:15.750> really<00:03:16.049> interesting<00:03:16.410> is

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
where it gets really interesting is

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:17.949 
where it gets really interesting is
finding<00:03:17.100> artifacts

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
finding artifacts

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.930 
finding artifacts
so<00:03:18.959> besides<00:03:19.170> mining<00:03:19.890> your<00:03:20.310> sort<00:03:20.579> of<00:03:20.610> mining

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
so besides mining your sort of mining

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.410 
so besides mining your sort of mining
roads<00:03:21.209> also<00:03:21.420> equipped<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.829> acquire<00:03:23.820> artifacts

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
roads also equipped to acquire artifacts

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.170 
roads also equipped to acquire artifacts
for<00:03:24.630> your<00:03:24.780> team<00:03:25.019> which<00:03:25.739> are<00:03:26.180> basically

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
for your team which are basically

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.330 
for your team which are basically
treasure<00:03:27.480> chests<00:03:27.900> with<00:03:28.220> interesting<00:03:29.220> or

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
unique leaked right but all the treasure

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.800 
unique leaked right but all the treasure
chests<00:03:32.519> with<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.790> unique<00:03:33.060> loot<00:03:33.269> will<00:03:33.480> tell

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
chests with the unique loot will tell

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.449 
chests with the unique loot will tell
you<00:03:34.019> when<00:03:34.230> you<00:03:34.320> do<00:03:34.440> your<00:03:34.560> artifact<00:03:34.920> Stan<00:03:35.190> is

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
you when you do your artifact Stan is

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.550 
you when you do your artifact Stan is
how<00:03:36.180> far<00:03:36.450> away<00:03:36.660> it's<00:03:36.930> right<00:03:37.110> it<00:03:37.260> will<00:03:37.350> give<00:03:37.500> you

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
how far away it's right it will give you

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.240 
how far away it's right it will give you
a<00:03:37.650> number<00:03:37.980> for<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.880> total<00:03:39.209> distance<00:03:39.510> and<00:03:40.250> each

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
a number for the total distance and each

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.370 
a number for the total distance and each
time<00:03:41.579> you<00:03:41.760> scan<00:03:42.060> again<00:03:42.450> it<00:03:42.810> will<00:03:43.079> give<00:03:43.260> you

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
time you scan again it will give you

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.340 
time you scan again it will give you
that<00:03:43.560> number<00:03:43.709> again<00:03:44.579> right<00:03:45.000> telling<00:03:45.780> you<00:03:45.900> how

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
that number again right telling you how

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.979 
that number again right telling you how
much<00:03:46.620> further<00:03:47.160> or<00:03:47.489> closer<00:03:47.760> you've<00:03:48.060> gotten<00:03:48.480> but

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
much further or closer you've gotten but

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.110 
much further or closer you've gotten but
not<00:03:49.200> directional<00:03:49.890> right<00:03:50.130> just<00:03:50.430> overall<00:03:50.940> how

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
not directional right just overall how

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.970 
not directional right just overall how
much<00:03:51.269> closer<00:03:51.480> you've<00:03:51.630> got<00:03:51.810> so<00:03:52.410> you<00:03:52.440> play

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
much closer you've got so you play

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.460 
much closer you've got so you play
hotter<00:03:53.220> colder<00:03:53.609> until<00:03:53.760> you<00:03:53.910> can<00:03:54.060> find<00:03:54.299> it<00:03:54.470> well

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470
