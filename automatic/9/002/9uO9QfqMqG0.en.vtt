00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:09.670
 a winston club was happening as night is 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:13.790
 I love you very much because telecos is 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:17.630
 we are here on street fighter 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:20.480
 and that is what happens with the people who 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.340
 the street fighter iv in the kings and 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.560
 we have to choose two people who is 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.050
 to fight and I wanted to play 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.520
 because that's how he betrayed me 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.130
 quite a good fight game channel 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.770
 quite some other that out there knows 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.030
 the means to bring it the truth is 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.530
 pretty entertaining 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.570
 I think it 's a little bit because the 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.410
 volume to bera bera bera bera bera 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.670
 or let's go down and that's it if 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.860
 basically we are going to make a game 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.190
 ago enough that we will not play 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:56.969
 do a versus 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:59.670
 and against a disaster 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.890
 everything is fine let's see what comes out of 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.890
 here because we are going to leave 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.140
 as always in every fight game goes to 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.890
 have a little ball so to speak 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.570
 the lolitas 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.250
 with his voice is a bit perverted 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.670
 so I did not realize 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.729
 but I fell human benach 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.580
 and now we have to choose another 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:32.210
 so 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.210
 that is, it could be like peri varying 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.950
 this is not so bitchy is Japanese theme 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.899
 most normal week 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.539
 It's not like there are not those Japanese whores 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.789
 but hey it's more normal this and we're going to 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.469
 fight against random can be the us 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.760
 army can not win 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:54.570
 we do it this way 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.080
 as to choose them to look 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.080
 do not 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:04.259
 we fight against listening a corridor nor 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.840
 bravo and that has gift ramón and county in 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.560
 ramón or he called it against sodium and 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.560
 don ramón 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.300
 to see what comes out of all this 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.300
 and randomly 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.140
 I remember a while ago it is practiced 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.659
 with river and I get all the combos with 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:29.090
 Rio knew me to the fullest as with 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:29.090
 noise but after gdf zynga 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.630
 Juan removes 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.630
 babe 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.330
 okay 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.130
 and basically that's the way it is to see if it is not 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.960
 I remember 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.400
 obviously the fighting games the best 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:56.590
 is to play it with 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.270
 I will go further or I will pass 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.230
 Bravo 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.230
 is giving me more to johnny bravo 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.860
 do not 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.150
 now 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.450
 what's wrong fear now and for the 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.450
 half 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:20.260
 a combo 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.260
 country pa country 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.220
 look at one who seems happy 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:36.100

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.170
 or not 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.230
 what happens to be quickly change 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.960
 of people what 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.960

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.740

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.420

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:31.360
 to see that not now 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.650
 let's go upstairs to see if I 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:39.560
 I remembered the coordinate 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.560
 where are you well 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:42.539
 and then 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.969
 because they are in balls or not 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:52.119
 and very good 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:55.430
 and we are going to choose this green monster 

00:04:52.119 --> 00:04:57.090
 giant latina big king 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:02.280
 low 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:06.110
 and to choose this chubby we are going to 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:09.320
 choose this showing 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:12.479
 you're fine 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:16.919
 and in teaching I'm going to do 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:16.919
 now we are 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.729
 the topics 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.910
 good 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:40.849
 I invented the design of the person 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.849
 eye that you pass mérimée 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:48.970
 and it's a very coy style 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.720
 I do not remember the combo we are going to more 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.720
 fight with this then 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.510
 but I have not asked 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.320

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.650

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.000

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:04.850
