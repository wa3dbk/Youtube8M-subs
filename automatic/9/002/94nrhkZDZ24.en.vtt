00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello everyone we are still at home 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:07.830
 microsoft where we could witness a small 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.130
 very interesting presentation of kinect 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.840
 2.0 there even who had had mini blob to 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.269
 seattle when he visited 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.740
 microsoft labs we finally could 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.180
 see what he was talking about because he 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.800
 was very excited and very excited 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.240
 yeah that's it so it was a demo 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.060
 live makes it a pure technical demo 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.529
 so not at all geared to the game but 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.080
 really about the capabilities of the sensor 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.859
 which, frankly, 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.170
 spectacular 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.030
 that is, it is extremely 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.380
 sensitive so we were treated to a 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.790
 explanation that is a bit technical about 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.329
 the way he perceives his 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.950
 environment 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.410
 we are fighting not only on the 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.390
 light but also on the infrared 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.410
 because it's often 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.940
 finally used kinect will often 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.100
 employees in lighting conditions 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.270
 a little limited the player and he likes 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.620
 to be in the dark when we look at a 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.600
 movie too we are often in the dark 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.550
 so that's not just based on the 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.280
 color and light but most of all we have 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.140
 could have an idea the sensitivity of 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.059
 the craft that is still capable of 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.620
 detect not only the fingers like 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.129
 we were taking longer and also 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.570
 the facial expressions of the 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.890
 lips mouth if you pull your tongue out 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.409
 does kinect see that we pull the tongue 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.900
 he is able to perceive equally if 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.030
 we are interacting with the xbox one 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.080
 or interaction with someone else 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.189
 in the room ie if we 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.420
 does not deal with the system at all 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.220
 so we do not need they see it from 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.259
 blow he also wants we are rather shot 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.790
 to him open someone yeah so 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.220
 in the same vein he is 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.829
 able so good here that we already know from 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.329
 perceive multiple users but 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.920
 also to recognize who is in the process of 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.049
 really play this one we go on the 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.430
 pad as if I pass you the microphone 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.079
 for example in front of kinect I will become 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.180
 players he knows that you become the 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.649
 player in action we had several 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.580
 things like that and middle east of 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.900
 things that impressed me 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.770
 I had not necessarily seen before because 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.390
 I was on leave during the 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.950
 presentation of Botswana were 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.470
 parts yes here it is especially the 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.840
 management of the reason for the perception of 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.200
 the bow effort if I put myself on a 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.780
 leg 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.200
 kinect understands that I'm forcing on my 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.030
 leg if I pretend to put a 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.740
 punch according to my 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.410
 movement and its amplitude before the 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.899
 birth he sees the actor will lend the 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.240
 force of my neck already that it's a blow 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.310
 it's pretty impressive to see in 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.080
 more microsoft is completely confident 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.060
 there because they have nothing to 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.160
 hide he invited people to participate 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.190
 the little demo has arrived on stage it's 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.390
 not that complicated works many 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.060
 Kinect demos sent guys 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.220
 to stir like eggs to make 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.230
 bus stops you've already seen while 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.940
 once that happens in his life no 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.290
 wriggle the hand here for the shot 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.270
 this is not the pipe at all what was 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.370
 then not the question is technical 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.840
 malaria is exactly what ccc 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.170
 I was going to say are they going to happen 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.970
 to really used it in games where 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.790
 is it just going to be basically a 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.930
 way to do your home sport with 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.330
 games away but there are plenty of 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.340
 things that are 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.200
 the perception of the heart rhythm 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.090
 for example we immediately have the use 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.260
 in a survival horror but it's true 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.910
 that if not there it is especially the promise 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.970
 for now some fitness games from 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.740
 future technology really solid air 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.680
 after what we will really be able to 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.210
 use it on xbox one without saying good 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.430
 finesse with a friend it would be better or 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.540
 more precise I do not know yet but in 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.610
 anyway the technology works very 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.890
 very well and other big advantage it's 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.310
 a wide angle we can play next to 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.260
 his console 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.450
 no need to have a shed and to 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.340
 hold at 6 meters and that's good and I 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.050
 just finish with two small three 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.930
 images of another technical demo 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.600
 finally more technological about 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.459
 trigger vibrations beyond the 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.459
 five- year throttle triggers evokes 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.740
 swan I like a lot when it vibrates and 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.390
 we had five so small demo of 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.370
 five seconds about who you 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.380
 allowed to see all the vibrations 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.030
 you could have in a trigger 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.620
 for example when you start and a 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.330
 motor you felt almost finally 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.459
 all the engine in the hands is enough 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.260
 Funny helicopter by the same with the 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.120
 propeller rhythm 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.200
 There was also a machine gun 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.750
 really felt the bursts of bullets 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.629
 in your fingers what there was 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.610
 also one of the heartbeats and 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:06.000
 felt like it was your heart 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.799
 who was beating in the triggers and his 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.489
 port limits actually but it's very 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:14.250
 very accurate and pretty good after that 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.739
 and that's where it will have a real 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.370
 utility in games for now 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.079
 I doubt 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.690
 I read it did not use it I know 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.889
 not why but for once we'll see 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.330
 the future will tell us for now 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.840
 am glad to know that you did 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.080
 the helicopter I did that it does not have any 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.180
 price 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.590
 in any case technologically speaking 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.020
 everything works very well we'll see later 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.550
 it works as well in games to 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.240
 soon for other topics chao 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.240
 to go
