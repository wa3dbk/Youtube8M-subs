power seems to be in the devices in the
small<00:01:37.380> mobile<00:01:37.799> devices<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.579> think<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.600> with<00:01:39.750> a

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
small mobile devices I think that with a

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.960 
small mobile devices I think that with a
major<00:01:40.170> update<00:01:40.530> like<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.130> special<00:01:41.549> event

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970

just<00:05:03.860> the<00:05:04.070> difference<00:05:04.430> so<00:05:04.910> let's<00:05:05.090> make<00:05:05.210> much

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
just the difference so let's make much

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:08.260 
just the difference so let's make much
sense<00:05:05.449> this<00:05:05.840> is<00:05:05.900> just<00:05:06.199> clear<00:05:06.500> marketing<00:05:07.270> the

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270

bandwidth<00:05:38.360> here<00:05:39.020> you<00:05:39.110> have<00:05:39.199> for<00:05:39.590> video

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889 
bandwidth here you have for video

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.219 
bandwidth here you have for video
streams<00:05:40.310> coming<00:05:40.720> from<00:05:41.720> the<00:05:42.470> disk<00:05:43.220> array<00:05:43.610> here

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
in that video to telling me they're

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.540

so<00:05:49.940> that's<00:05:50.150> really<00:05:50.389> great<00:05:50.690> that<00:05:50.990> is<00:05:51.169> thunder

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
so that's really great that is thunder

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.860 
so that's really great that is thunder
bolt<00:05:51.590> for<00:05:52.070> you<00:05:52.220> um<00:05:52.400> that's<00:05:52.940> Intel<00:05:53.419> for<00:05:53.690> you<00:05:53.840> I

bolt for you um that's Intel for you I

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.089 
bolt for you um that's Intel for you I
think<00:05:54.199> it<00:05:54.349> is<00:05:54.380> a<00:05:54.500> great<00:05:54.680> job<00:05:55.039> um<00:05:56.650> while<00:05:57.650> hard

00:05:58.089 --> 00:05:58.099 
think it is a great job um while hard

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:00.550 
think it is a great job um while hard
drives<00:05:58.400> won't<00:05:58.789> be<00:05:59.000> on<00:05:59.270> the<00:05:59.389> bolt<00:05:59.599> regular<00:06:00.380> hard

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
drives won't be on the bolt regular hard

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.040 
drives won't be on the bolt regular hard
drives<00:06:00.800> but<00:06:01.310> certainly<00:06:01.849> the<00:06:02.060> enclosures<00:06:02.750> must

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:09.470 
higher resolution that's great makes you

the 15-inch department I think that

the 15-inch department I think that
forced<00:07:31.870> 1799<00:07:32.870> it's<00:07:33.319> a<00:07:33.409> four<00:07:34.099> hundred<00:07:34.219> dollars

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:34.340

forced 1799 it's a four hundred dollars
less<00:07:34.849> than<00:07:35.090> a<00:07:35.210> 15-inch<00:07:35.949> 2.2<00:07:36.949> so<00:07:37.669> you're<00:07:37.879> having

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:38.060 
less than a 15-inch 2.2 so you're having

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.149 
less than a 15-inch 2.2 so you're having
a<00:07:38.479> little<00:07:39.199> bit<00:07:39.319> of<00:07:39.379> a<00:07:39.529> difference<00:07:39.919> in
