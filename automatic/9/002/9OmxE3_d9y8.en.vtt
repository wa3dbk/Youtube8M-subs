 hello how good is that we bring you another 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:14.309
 video we bring you another video for the 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.830
 blackberry platform this in the video 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.770
 past he found it from an application this 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.080
 which is called performance pack it seems that 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.380
 is no longer available in the store 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.829
 blackberry applications then there are 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.529
 another method to be part of what 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:34.620
 does that application with the applications 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.260
 or with the same blackberry system 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.880
 let's see how is this we can 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.210
 put what is this the main menu 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:47.670
 and we are going to look for the option of 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.380
 applications that is within this 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.840
 menu and here we have it is called 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:56.230
 applications we go in there and we're going to 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:59.500
 look good in fact is not is not 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:02.980
 the icon is not activated ie 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:06.369
 we need to activate it so we can 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.550
 have the function is enabled of what 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:11.830
 which makes the performance pack in good 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.780
 certain way is not to say or is part of 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.340
 what is that application is what we're going 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.790
 to activate right now we are going to look for the 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.850
 security option we go to the 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.979
 tools we look for security we look for 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.479
 this advanced security options and 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.979
 let's activate this application that is 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:32.170
 here we are going to enter the menu of the 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.940
 water cleaning and you should have it 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.840
 deactivated in fact I also do not 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.850
 you have activated I did not have to enable 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.929
 and enabled will show us this 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.219
 menu in this menu we are going to be able to 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.710
 tell the application what it is that 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:48.840
 we want you to do and schedule it for 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.880
 practically and within this 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.000
 programming we will find that 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.770
 we have several options and in the part of 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.549
 down will tell us what is going to 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.350
 clean what is part of what it does 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.990
 the performance app for lin 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.689
 that all this does not certify 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.519
 everything that appears there then once 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.390
 that we have selected what is what 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.390
 we want it to clean 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.550
 and we're going to give you save that it's something very 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.800
 important 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.480
 we say ok we left the application and 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.760
 we are going to go where our 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.220
 our application folder and there 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.340
 we will find that now we will have 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.069
 see if it looks and with knowing there is like 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.870
 can see there is the new icon 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.989
 this icon is to clean the memory 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.340
 it burned as I said is part 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.560
 what the application was doing 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.140
 commented on the video last then yes 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.989
 we activate it you are going to see what it does 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.870
 exactly the same but this is a 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:50.930
 native application of the system 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.579
 operative blackberry as you can see 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.090

 typical failures that it gets stuck and that 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:11.200
