00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.700 

okay<00:00:06.700> so<00:00:06.759> here's<00:00:07.149> the<00:00:07.210> main<00:00:07.599> gauge<00:00:08.049> cluster

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:08.710 
okay so here's the main gauge cluster

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.350 
okay so here's the main gauge cluster
and<00:00:09.309> one<00:00:09.490> of<00:00:09.610> the<00:00:09.670> things<00:00:09.940> that<00:00:10.150> you'll<00:00:10.299> notice

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:10.360 
and one of the things that you'll notice

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.810 
and one of the things that you'll notice
is<00:00:10.809> different<00:00:11.260> right<00:00:11.410> away<00:00:11.709> is<00:00:11.950> instead<00:00:12.760> of

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:12.820 
is different right away is instead of

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.820 
is different right away is instead of
having<00:00:12.940> the<00:00:13.330> speedometer<00:00:13.990> be<00:00:14.139> the<00:00:14.290> main<00:00:14.530> gauge

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:14.830 
having the speedometer be the main gauge

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.510 
having the speedometer be the main gauge
in<00:00:15.099> the<00:00:15.219> center<00:00:15.549> it's<00:00:16.000> actually<00:00:16.509> the<00:00:16.660> tach<00:00:16.930> and

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
in the center it's actually the tach and

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.240 
in the center it's actually the tach and
you<00:00:18.520> can<00:00:18.669> see<00:00:18.910> there's<00:00:19.509> a<00:00:19.570> lit<00:00:20.529> up<00:00:20.710> indicator

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
you can see there's a lit up indicator

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.220 
you can see there's a lit up indicator
there<00:00:21.519> that<00:00:21.699> says<00:00:21.910> VDC<00:00:22.630> off

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
there that says VDC off

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.650 
there that says VDC off
I<00:00:23.260> believe<00:00:23.830> VDC<00:00:24.490> stands<00:00:24.910> for<00:00:25.119> something<00:00:25.480> like

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
I believe VDC stands for something like

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.230 
I believe VDC stands for something like
vehicle<00:00:26.289> dynamic<00:00:27.039> control<00:00:27.429> basically<00:00:28.029> that's

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
vehicle dynamic control basically that's

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.870 
vehicle dynamic control basically that's
your<00:00:28.420> traction<00:00:28.720> control<00:00:28.929> I<00:00:29.529> always<00:00:30.400> turn<00:00:30.640> that

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
your traction control I always turn that

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.329 
your traction control I always turn that
off<00:00:31.150> when<00:00:31.570> I<00:00:31.599> get<00:00:31.839> in<00:00:31.990> the<00:00:32.110> car<00:00:32.320> and<00:00:32.589> that's

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:33.339 
off when I get in the car and that's

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:37.649 
off when I get in the car and that's
this<00:00:33.610> button<00:00:34.030> down<00:00:34.210> here<00:00:35.129> VDC<00:00:36.129> off<00:00:36.580> so<00:00:37.180> every

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:37.659 
this button down here VDC off so every

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:39.750 
this button down here VDC off so every
time<00:00:37.809> you<00:00:37.989> start<00:00:38.290> the<00:00:38.320> car<00:00:38.680> you<00:00:39.339> want<00:00:39.489> to<00:00:39.580> push

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
time you start the car you want to push

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.460 
time you start the car you want to push
that<00:00:39.940> once<00:00:40.210> to<00:00:40.449> disable<00:00:40.930> the<00:00:41.019> traction

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
that once to disable the traction

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.950 
that once to disable the traction
control<00:00:41.500> now<00:00:42.400> there<00:00:42.580> is<00:00:42.699> a<00:00:42.729> way<00:00:42.970> to<00:00:43.030> disable<00:00:43.659> it

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
control now there is a way to disable it

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.380 
control now there is a way to disable it
every<00:00:44.320> single<00:00:44.530> time<00:00:44.680> automatically<00:00:45.610> by

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
every single time automatically by

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.320 
every single time automatically by
pulling<00:00:47.049> one<00:00:47.080> of<00:00:47.440> your<00:00:47.650> ABS<00:00:48.220> sensors<00:00:48.760> from<00:00:49.150> one

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.330 
pulling one of your ABS sensors from one

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.359 
pulling one of your ABS sensors from one
of<00:00:49.449> the<00:00:49.510> wheels<00:00:49.690> the<00:00:50.440> easiest<00:00:50.680> ones<00:00:50.979> to<00:00:51.100> get<00:00:51.309> to

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:51.369 
of the wheels the easiest ones to get to

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:53.729 
of the wheels the easiest ones to get to
are<00:00:51.699> the<00:00:51.820> ones<00:00:52.059> under<00:00:52.570> the<00:00:52.690> hood<00:00:52.930> to<00:00:53.379> the<00:00:53.470> front

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
are the ones under the hood to the front

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:54.149 
are the ones under the hood to the front
wheels

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:54.159 
wheels

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:56.130 
wheels
if<00:00:54.640> you<00:00:54.790> pull<00:00:55.030> just<00:00:55.239> one<00:00:55.360> of<00:00:55.659> those<00:00:55.780> it<00:00:55.839> will

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
if you pull just one of those it will

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.460 
if you pull just one of those it will
disable<00:00:56.559> the<00:00:56.879> ABS<00:00:57.879> system<00:00:58.420> which<00:00:58.659> also<00:00:58.960> turns

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
disable the ABS system which also turns

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.979 
disable the ABS system which also turns
off<00:00:59.710> the<00:00:59.920> traction<00:01:00.369> control<00:01:00.400> so<00:01:01.119> that's<00:01:01.750> what

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
off the traction control so that's what

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.109 
off the traction control so that's what
I<00:01:02.019> do<00:01:02.140> when<00:01:02.530> I'm<00:01:02.710> doing<00:01:02.949> a<00:01:03.369> lot<00:01:03.489> drifting<00:01:04.000> in

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
I do when I'm doing a lot drifting in

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:05.250 
I do when I'm doing a lot drifting in
this<00:01:04.239> car<00:01:04.449> and<00:01:04.570> I<00:01:04.629> don't<00:01:04.689> want<00:01:04.960> to<00:01:05.049> mess<00:01:05.229> with

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
this car and I don't want to mess with

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.200 
this car and I don't want to mess with
that<00:01:05.560> button<00:01:05.830> or<00:01:06.189> forget<00:01:06.580> to<00:01:06.700> turn<00:01:06.850> it<00:01:07.030> off

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
that button or forget to turn it off

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.539 
that button or forget to turn it off
I'll<00:01:07.720> just<00:01:07.960> pull<00:01:08.200> one<00:01:08.229> of<00:01:08.530> the<00:01:08.590> ABS<00:01:09.070> sensors

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
I'll just pull one of the ABS sensors

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:11.609 
I'll just pull one of the ABS sensors
but<00:01:10.149> remember<00:01:10.570> that<00:01:10.719> if<00:01:10.840> you<00:01:10.960> do<00:01:11.140> that<00:01:11.350> and

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
but remember that if you do that and

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.620 
but remember that if you do that and
you're<00:01:11.979> on<00:01:12.009> the<00:01:12.219> street<00:01:12.579> and<00:01:13.119> you<00:01:13.210> have<00:01:13.359> to<00:01:13.509> get

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
you're on the street and you have to get

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.450 
you're on the street and you have to get
on<00:01:13.719> your<00:01:13.869> brakes<00:01:14.109> you<00:01:14.409> will<00:01:14.859> lock<00:01:15.100> them<00:01:15.310> up

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
on your brakes you will lock them up

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.419 
on your brakes you will lock them up
they're<00:01:15.789> not<00:01:15.820> going<00:01:16.479> to<00:01:16.649> you<00:01:17.649> know<00:01:17.679> kick<00:01:18.250> in

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:18.429 
they're not going to you know kick in

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:20.760 
they're not going to you know kick in
the<00:01:18.549> ABS<00:01:19.060> and<00:01:19.090> come<00:01:19.960> to<00:01:20.109> a<00:01:20.140> stop<00:01:20.259> without

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
the ABS and come to a stop without

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.340 
the ABS and come to a stop without
sliding<00:01:20.829> you<00:01:21.429> will<00:01:21.670> lock<00:01:21.909> the<00:01:22.090> tires<00:01:22.329> up<00:01:22.630> okay

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
sliding you will lock the tires up okay

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.899 
sliding you will lock the tires up okay
so<00:01:23.409> you<00:01:23.649> got<00:01:23.799> your<00:01:23.829> tach<00:01:24.159> there<00:01:24.399> you<00:01:24.579> can<00:01:24.729> see

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
so you got your tach there you can see

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.510 
so you got your tach there you can see
the<00:01:25.030> red<00:01:25.179> line<00:01:25.390> is<00:01:25.570> just<00:01:25.810> past<00:01:26.049> 6500<00:01:27.039> six<00:01:27.399> or

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
the red line is just past 6500 six or

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.300 
the red line is just past 6500 six or
six<00:01:27.700> hundred<00:01:27.850> rpms<00:01:28.509> on<00:01:28.719> this<00:01:28.869> 2003<00:01:29.740> model<00:01:29.950> and

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
six hundred rpms on this 2003 model and

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.489 
six hundred rpms on this 2003 model and
you<00:01:30.969> can<00:01:31.119> see<00:01:31.329> that<00:01:31.479> it<00:01:31.630> has<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:31.960> word<00:01:31.990> Rev

00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:32.499 
you can see that it has the word Rev

right below the right below the needle
there<00:01:36.039> in<00:01:36.159> the<00:01:36.249> center<00:01:36.600> there<00:01:37.600> is<00:01:37.630> a<00:01:37.780> shift

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
there in the center there is a shift

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:39.959 
there in the center there is a shift
light<00:01:38.499> right<00:01:39.039> by<00:01:39.249> that<00:01:39.460> and<00:01:39.670> I'm<00:01:39.759> going<00:01:39.880> to

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:39.969 
light right by that and I'm going to

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:42.959 
light right by that and I'm going to
show<00:01:40.119> you<00:01:40.149> how<00:01:40.329> that<00:01:40.390> works<00:01:40.719> so<00:01:41.880> moving<00:01:42.880> over

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:42.969 
show you how that works so moving over

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:44.669 
show you how that works so moving over
here<00:01:43.210> to<00:01:43.390> the<00:01:43.479> left<00:01:43.689> you<00:01:43.869> can<00:01:43.990> see<00:01:44.049> I<00:01:44.229> need<00:01:44.469> some

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 
here to the left you can see I need some

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:47.550 
here to the left you can see I need some
gas<00:01:44.920> you<00:01:45.189> got<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.490> low<00:01:45.640> gas<00:01:45.880> light<00:01:46.179> on<00:01:46.390> and<00:01:46.689> you

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
gas you got the low gas light on and you

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.260 
gas you got the low gas light on and you
got<00:01:47.710> your<00:01:47.859> temperature<00:01:48.039> there<00:01:48.520> that's<00:01:48.789> normal

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
got your temperature there that's normal

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.789 
got your temperature there that's normal
and<00:01:49.389> then<00:01:49.479> we<00:01:49.569> have<00:01:49.749> an<00:01:49.869> indicator<00:01:50.319> showing

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
and then we have an indicator showing

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.649 
and then we have an indicator showing
that<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.159> emergency<00:01:51.759> brake<00:01:52.030> or<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.299> parking

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
that the emergency brake or the parking

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.050 
that the emergency brake or the parking
brake<00:01:52.869> is<00:01:52.899> engaged<00:01:53.409> right<00:01:53.679> now<00:01:53.740> and<00:01:54.429> then<00:01:54.819> over

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
brake is engaged right now and then over

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.849 
brake is engaged right now and then over
here<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:55.450> the<00:01:55.539> right<00:01:55.749> is<00:01:56.020> your<00:01:56.049> speedometer

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:56.859 
here to the right is your speedometer

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:57.970 
here to the right is your speedometer
and

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 
and

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.220 
and
that<00:01:58.100> it<00:01:58.550> shows<00:01:58.820> your<00:01:59.000> mileage<00:01:59.420> things<00:01:59.990> like

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
that it shows your mileage things like

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.770 
that it shows your mileage things like
that<00:02:00.440> and<00:02:00.710> of<00:02:00.860> course<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:01.340> trip<00:02:02.330> mileage<00:02:02.750> that

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
that and of course the trip mileage that

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.560 
that and of course the trip mileage that
you<00:02:03.110> can<00:02:03.290> reset<00:02:03.770> and<00:02:04.010> the<00:02:04.700> way<00:02:04.790> you<00:02:04.850> reset<00:02:05.360> that

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
you can reset and the way you reset that

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.010 
you can reset and the way you reset that
is<00:02:05.990> by<00:02:06.770> holding<00:02:06.980> this<00:02:07.340> down<00:02:07.610> right<00:02:07.880> here<00:02:08.180> until

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
is by holding this down right here until

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.370 
is by holding this down right here until
it<00:02:09.140> zeros<00:02:09.470> out<00:02:09.650> and<00:02:10.450> these<00:02:11.450> two<00:02:11.780> black<00:02:11.990> dots

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
it zeros out and these two black dots

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.060 
it zeros out and these two black dots
right<00:02:12.620> here

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
right here

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.210 
right here
those<00:02:13.370> are<00:02:13.610> your<00:02:13.820> turn<00:02:14.120> signal<00:02:14.540> indicators

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.740 

okay<00:02:19.220> so<00:02:19.280> that<00:02:19.580> pretty<00:02:19.760> much<00:02:19.940> covers<00:02:20.210> the<00:02:20.420> main

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
okay so that pretty much covers the main

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.560 
okay so that pretty much covers the main
cluster<00:02:21.260> there<00:02:21.470> now<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.790> awesome<00:02:23.420> thing

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
cluster there now the awesome thing

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.170 
cluster there now the awesome thing
about<00:02:23.600> 350<00:02:24.320> C's<00:02:24.530> is<00:02:24.800> you<00:02:25.070> also<00:02:25.250> have<00:02:25.640> this<00:02:25.850> you

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
about 350 C's is you also have this you

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.780 
about 350 C's is you also have this you
know<00:02:26.630> additional<00:02:27.140> gauge<00:02:27.830> cluster<00:02:28.370> over<00:02:28.610> here

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
know additional gauge cluster over here

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.090 
know additional gauge cluster over here
in<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.000> center<00:02:29.360> and<00:02:29.720> what<00:02:30.440> you<00:02:30.560> have<00:02:30.740> here<00:02:30.950> is

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
in the center and what you have here is

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.550 
in the center and what you have here is
your<00:02:31.310> faux<00:02:32.150> gauge<00:02:32.480> I'm<00:02:32.840> not<00:02:33.020> sure<00:02:33.200> how<00:02:33.350> well

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
your faux gauge I'm not sure how well

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.960 
your faux gauge I'm not sure how well
you<00:02:33.590> can<00:02:33.740> see<00:02:33.890> that<00:02:34.070> hopefully<00:02:34.610> it's<00:02:34.760> not

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
you can see that hopefully it's not

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:35.950 
you can see that hopefully it's not
glaring<00:02:35.270> real<00:02:35.540> bad

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
glaring real bad

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.470 
glaring real bad
you've<00:02:36.320> got<00:02:36.530> your<00:02:36.650> volt<00:02:36.920> gauge<00:02:37.190> and<00:02:37.820> you've

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
you've got your volt gauge and you've

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.050 
you've got your volt gauge and you've
got<00:02:38.690> your<00:02:38.870> oil<00:02:39.080> pressure<00:02:39.470> gauge<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:40.250> you'll

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
got your oil pressure gauge and you'll

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.430 
got your oil pressure gauge and you'll
notice<00:02:41.300> this<00:02:41.570> will<00:02:41.720> change<00:02:41.960> as<00:02:42.290> you're

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
notice this will change as you're

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.710 
notice this will change as you're
driving<00:02:42.650> because<00:02:42.980> obviously<00:02:43.250> higher<00:02:44.060> rpm

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
driving because obviously higher rpm

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.810 
driving because obviously higher rpm
you're<00:02:45.290> going<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.500> have<00:02:45.650> more<00:02:45.860> oil<00:02:46.400> pressure

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
you're going to have more oil pressure

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.640 
you're going to have more oil pressure
more<00:02:47.240> oil<00:02:47.480> moving<00:02:47.930> through<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.170> motor<00:02:48.410> and

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
more oil moving through the motor and

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.410 
more oil moving through the motor and
then<00:02:49.160> this<00:02:49.340> is<00:02:49.520> the<00:02:49.610> multi<00:02:49.940> gauge<00:02:50.120> I<00:02:50.330> was

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
then this is the multi gauge I was

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.390 
then this is the multi gauge I was
talking<00:02:50.780> about<00:02:50.840> and<00:02:51.590> you<00:02:51.680> can<00:02:51.860> see<00:02:52.070> it<00:02:52.190> says

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
talking about and you can see it says

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.720 
talking about and you can see it says
zero<00:02:52.730> miles<00:02:53.000> per<00:02:53.360> hour<00:02:53.510> and<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:54.460> DTE

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
zero miles per hour and the DTE

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.010 
zero miles per hour and the DTE
is<00:02:56.060> flashing<00:02:56.480> and<00:02:58.120> DTE<00:02:59.120> I<00:02:59.540> believe<00:02:59.870> that

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
is flashing and DTE I believe that

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.350 
is flashing and DTE I believe that
stands<00:03:00.260> for<00:03:00.410> distance<00:03:01.010> till<00:03:01.250> empty<00:03:01.360> basically

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
stands for distance till empty basically

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.330 
stands for distance till empty basically
so<00:03:03.320> you<00:03:03.410> can<00:03:03.560> see<00:03:03.770> I<00:03:03.800> have<00:03:04.010> a<00:03:04.040> digital

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
so you can see I have a digital

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.430 
so you can see I have a digital
speedometer<00:03:04.790> here<00:03:05.330> and<00:03:05.510> that's<00:03:05.990> one<00:03:06.230> of<00:03:06.260> the

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
speedometer here and that's one of the

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.199 
speedometer here and that's one of the
reasons<00:03:06.860> they<00:03:07.010> put<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.340> tack<00:03:07.580> in<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:07.880> center

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
reasons they put the tack in the center

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.300 
reasons they put the tack in the center
of<00:03:08.300> the<00:03:08.360> main<00:03:08.570> cluster<00:03:09.050> is<00:03:09.560> because<00:03:10.010> you<00:03:10.160> have

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
of the main cluster is because you have

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.310 
of the main cluster is because you have
the<00:03:10.459> digital<00:03:10.640> speedometer<00:03:11.450> here<00:03:11.660> and<00:03:11.900> this<00:03:12.140> is

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
the digital speedometer here and this is

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.350 
the digital speedometer here and this is
pretty<00:03:12.500> much<00:03:12.620> what<00:03:13.040> I<00:03:13.070> always<00:03:13.370> have<00:03:13.730> my<00:03:14.000> multi

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
pretty much what I always have my multi

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.170 
pretty much what I always have my multi
gauge<00:03:14.570> set<00:03:14.840> to<00:03:15.080> the<00:03:15.680> digital<00:03:16.220> speedometer

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
gauge set to the digital speedometer

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.510 
gauge set to the digital speedometer
okay<00:03:17.780> but<00:03:17.989> now<00:03:18.170> if<00:03:18.440> I<00:03:18.650> want<00:03:18.890> to<00:03:18.950> cycle<00:03:19.489> through

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
okay but now if I want to cycle through

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.140 
okay but now if I want to cycle through
these<00:03:19.910> I<00:03:20.239> go<00:03:20.600> back<00:03:20.780> to<00:03:20.959> the<00:03:21.050> main<00:03:21.260> cluster<00:03:21.739> here

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
these I go back to the main cluster here

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.850 
these I go back to the main cluster here
this<00:03:23.150> is<00:03:23.360> what<00:03:23.540> I<00:03:23.570> push<00:03:23.930> to<00:03:24.170> cycle<00:03:24.590> through<00:03:24.770> the

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
this is what I push to cycle through the

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.680 
this is what I push to cycle through the
different<00:03:24.890> options<00:03:25.640> and<00:03:26.030> this<00:03:26.270> is<00:03:26.480> what<00:03:26.660> I

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
different options and this is what I

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.590 
different options and this is what I
push<00:03:27.020> or<00:03:27.230> hold<00:03:27.500> to<00:03:28.190> do<00:03:28.640> different<00:03:29.030> actions<00:03:29.450> on

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
push or hold to do different actions on

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.479 
push or hold to do different actions on
those<00:03:29.780> options<00:03:30.230> so<00:03:30.739> right<00:03:31.070> now<00:03:31.250> I'm<00:03:31.400> just

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
those options so right now I'm just

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.310 
those options so right now I'm just
going<00:03:31.700> to<00:03:31.790> cycle<00:03:32.060> through<00:03:32.270> with<00:03:32.630> this<00:03:32.840> to<00:03:33.110> show

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
going to cycle through with this to show

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.260 
going to cycle through with this to show
you<00:03:33.350> what<00:03:33.680> there<00:03:33.860> is

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
you what there is

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.270 
you what there is
okay<00:03:36.020> so<00:03:36.080> we're<00:03:36.500> moving<00:03:36.620> away<00:03:36.860> from<00:03:37.010> the

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
okay so we're moving away from the

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.130 
okay so we're moving away from the
digital<00:03:37.790> speedometer<00:03:38.360> now<00:03:38.600> we've<00:03:38.780> got<00:03:38.990> the

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
digital speedometer now we've got the

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.470 
digital speedometer now we've got the
digital<00:03:39.650> temperature<00:03:40.460> indicator<00:03:41.180> for<00:03:41.450> the

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
digital temperature indicator for the

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.950 
digital temperature indicator for the
outside<00:03:41.930> temperature<00:03:42.500> 86<00:03:42.980> degrees<00:03:43.720> okay

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 
outside temperature 86 degrees okay

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.900 
outside temperature 86 degrees okay
that's<00:03:45.200> telling<00:03:45.620> me<00:03:45.650> how<00:03:45.860> many<00:03:45.920> miles<00:03:46.400> until

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
that's telling me how many miles until

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.050 
that's telling me how many miles until
I'm<00:03:47.030> going<00:03:47.180> to<00:03:47.270> run<00:03:47.420> out<00:03:47.600> of<00:03:47.630> gas

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
I'm going to run out of gas

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.270 
I'm going to run out of gas
that's<00:03:50.060> my<00:03:50.270> average<00:03:50.690> fuel<00:03:51.140> mileage<00:03:51.380> and<00:03:51.920> my

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
that's my average fuel mileage and my

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.340 
that's my average fuel mileage and my
average<00:03:52.460> speed<00:03:52.730> you<00:03:53.390> can<00:03:53.570> tell<00:03:53.780> I<00:03:53.810> just<00:03:54.170> do

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
average speed you can tell I just do

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.210 
average speed you can tell I just do
city<00:03:54.650> driving<00:03:55.180> I<00:03:56.180> live<00:03:56.660> about<00:03:57.050> not<00:03:57.860> even<00:03:58.160> a

city driving I live about not even a

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.640 
city driving I live about not even a
mile<00:03:58.490> from<00:03:58.790> my<00:03:58.880> office<00:03:59.450> and<00:03:59.720> so<00:04:00.320> I<00:04:00.350> probably

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
mile from my office and so I probably

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.740 
mile from my office and so I probably
never<00:04:01.010> brake<00:04:01.400> 40<00:04:01.850> miles<00:04:02.030> an<00:04:02.300> hour<00:04:02.390> just

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
never brake 40 miles an hour just

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.670 
never brake 40 miles an hour just
driving<00:04:03.200> to<00:04:03.350> and<00:04:03.530> from<00:04:03.560> work<00:04:04.240> and<00:04:05.320> very<00:04:06.320> rarely

driving to and from work and very rarely

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.710 
driving to and from work and very rarely
you<00:04:07.310> know<00:04:07.460> do<00:04:07.640> I<00:04:07.700> take<00:04:07.940> this<00:04:08.090> car<00:04:08.300> on<00:04:08.450> long

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
you know do I take this car on long

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.500 
you know do I take this car on long
trips<00:04:08.960> anymore<00:04:09.380> so<00:04:09.890> it<00:04:10.400> just<00:04:10.610> kind<00:04:10.790> of<00:04:10.940> sits<00:04:11.390> in

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
trips anymore so it just kind of sits in

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.210 
trips anymore so it just kind of sits in
the<00:04:11.630> garage<00:04:11.660> and<00:04:12.170> takes<00:04:12.350> me<00:04:12.500> toon<00:04:12.710> from<00:04:13.010> work

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
the garage and takes me toon from work

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.430 
the garage and takes me toon from work
and<00:04:13.400> a<00:04:13.490> couple<00:04:13.670> joy<00:04:13.970> rides<00:04:14.240> here<00:04:14.510> there<00:04:14.780> now<00:04:15.290> if

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
and a couple joy rides here there now if

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.140 
and a couple joy rides here there now if
you<00:04:15.530> want<00:04:15.710> to<00:04:15.800> reset<00:04:16.220> something<00:04:16.520> like<00:04:16.910> this

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
you want to reset something like this

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.750 
you want to reset something like this
you<00:04:18.050> can<00:04:18.200> go<00:04:18.320> back<00:04:18.560> over<00:04:18.890> here<00:04:18.920> and<00:04:19.310> you<00:04:19.580> can

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
you can go back over here and you can

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.060 
you can go back over here and you can
hold<00:04:19.940> this<00:04:20.239> lower<00:04:20.570> button<00:04:21.050> and<00:04:21.739> I'll<00:04:21.860> show<00:04:22.040> you

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
hold this lower button and I'll show you

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.310 
hold this lower button and I'll show you
what<00:04:22.310> that's<00:04:22.520> going<00:04:22.700> to<00:04:22.760> do<00:04:23.050> if<00:04:24.050> I<00:04:24.260> hold<00:04:24.530> back

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.800 

now<00:04:27.860> it's<00:04:28.070> resetting<00:04:28.670> and<00:04:28.880> so<00:04:29.390> once<00:04:29.600> you<00:04:29.720> start

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
now it's resetting and so once you start

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.270 
now it's resetting and so once you start
driving<00:04:30.260> you<00:04:30.620> can<00:04:30.770> see<00:04:30.950> it's<00:04:31.100> like

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
driving you can see it's like

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.400 
driving you can see it's like
recalculating<00:04:32.090> once<00:04:32.690> you<00:04:32.840> drive<00:04:33.110> for<00:04:33.350> a

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
recalculating once you drive for a

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.440 
recalculating once you drive for a
little<00:04:33.680> while<00:04:33.860> it<00:04:34.160> will<00:04:34.190> recalculate<00:04:34.850> your

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
little while it will recalculate your

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.480 
little while it will recalculate your
miles<00:04:35.930> per<00:04:36.080> gallon<00:04:36.530> and<00:04:36.650> your<00:04:36.770> average<00:04:37.190> mile

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
miles per gallon and your average mile

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.130 
miles per gallon and your average mile
per<00:04:37.760> hour<00:04:37.790> okay<00:04:39.700> now<00:04:40.700> moving<00:04:41.390> to<00:04:41.540> the<00:04:41.570> next<00:04:41.930> one

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
per hour okay now moving to the next one

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.540 
per hour okay now moving to the next one
you've<00:04:42.530> got<00:04:42.850> timer<00:04:43.850> here<00:04:44.300> and<00:04:44.540> a<00:04:44.870> trip<00:04:45.830> mileage

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
you've got timer here and a trip mileage

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.820 
you've got timer here and a trip mileage
you<00:04:47.420> can<00:04:47.450> reset<00:04:47.990> that<00:04:48.020> as<00:04:48.350> well

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
you can reset that as well

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.910 
you can reset that as well
same<00:04:49.100> thing<00:04:49.340> you<00:04:49.460> got<00:04:49.610> another<00:04:49.820> one<00:04:50.060> here<00:04:50.920> and

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
same thing you got another one here and

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.330 
same thing you got another one here and
then<00:04:52.430> this<00:04:52.580> is<00:04:52.820> showing<00:04:53.060> you<00:04:53.390> PSI<00:04:54.110> so<00:04:55.040> pound

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
then this is showing you PSI so pound

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.920 
then this is showing you PSI so pound
square<00:04:55.670> inch<00:04:55.880> and<00:04:56.090> your<00:04:56.180> tires<00:04:56.420> and<00:04:56.750> you<00:04:56.810> can

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
square inch and your tires and you can

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.740 
square inch and your tires and you can
see<00:04:57.140> DTE<00:04:57.680> continues<00:04:58.550> to<00:04:58.730> flash<00:04:59.000> letting<00:04:59.630> me

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
see DTE continues to flash letting me

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.140 
see DTE continues to flash letting me
know<00:04:59.780> that<00:05:00.110> I'm<00:05:00.200> low<00:05:00.350> on<00:05:00.500> fuel<00:05:00.800> okay<00:05:01.760> so<00:05:01.820> it's

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
know that I'm low on fuel okay so it's

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.720 
know that I'm low on fuel okay so it's
saying<00:05:02.330> my<00:05:02.660> front<00:05:03.050> left<00:05:03.350> is<00:05:03.830> on<00:05:04.130> the<00:05:04.160> top<00:05:04.490> my

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
saying my front left is on the top my

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.510 
saying my front left is on the top my
front<00:05:05.060> right<00:05:05.270> is<00:05:05.840> on<00:05:06.170> the<00:05:06.200> bottom<00:05:07.100> there<00:05:07.310> and

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
front right is on the bottom there and

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.600 
front right is on the bottom there and
it's<00:05:08.390> telling<00:05:08.750> me<00:05:08.870> that<00:05:09.050> there<00:05:09.200> at<00:05:09.350> 33<00:05:09.980> and<00:05:10.010> 34

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
it's telling me that there at 33 and 34

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.970 
it's telling me that there at 33 and 34
psi<00:05:11.210> and<00:05:11.510> this<00:05:11.840> will<00:05:12.020> change<00:05:12.260> it<00:05:12.560> checksum

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
psi and this will change it checksum

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.370 
psi and this will change it checksum
regularly<00:05:13.610> so<00:05:13.880> as<00:05:14.150> your<00:05:14.660> tires<00:05:14.870> heat<00:05:15.200> up

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
regularly so as your tires heat up

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.810 
regularly so as your tires heat up
you'll<00:05:15.590> notice<00:05:15.800> that<00:05:16.100> your<00:05:16.250> pressure<00:05:16.490> goes<00:05:16.790> up

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
you'll notice that your pressure goes up

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.620 
you'll notice that your pressure goes up
and<00:05:17.270> then<00:05:17.780> all<00:05:18.320> I<00:05:18.410> have<00:05:18.590> to<00:05:18.620> do<00:05:18.920> is<00:05:19.390> hit<00:05:20.390> this

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
and then all I have to do is hit this

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.140 
and then all I have to do is hit this
bottom<00:05:21.050> one<00:05:21.080> and<00:05:21.530> now<00:05:22.400> you<00:05:22.460> see<00:05:22.760> it<00:05:22.790> switches

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
bottom one and now you see it switches

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.020 
bottom one and now you see it switches
from<00:05:23.330> f2r<00:05:23.930> and<00:05:24.410> showing<00:05:25.190> that<00:05:25.280> my<00:05:25.460> readers<00:05:25.730> at

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
from f2r and showing that my readers at

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.140 
from f2r and showing that my readers at
35<00:05:26.630> psi<00:05:27.200> each<00:05:27.470> okay<00:05:28.130> so<00:05:28.190> that's<00:05:28.580> the<00:05:28.850> multi

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
35 psi each okay so that's the multi

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.010 
35 psi each okay so that's the multi
gauge<00:05:29.330> on<00:05:29.570> that<00:05:29.860> now<00:05:30.860> if<00:05:31.040> I<00:05:31.160> cycle<00:05:31.610> through

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
gauge on that now if I cycle through

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.550 
gauge on that now if I cycle through
this<00:05:33.020> is<00:05:33.350> their<00:05:33.740> the<00:05:34.010> shift<00:05:34.400> light<00:05:34.580> point<00:05:35.560> so

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
this is their the shift light point so

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.310 
works I'm going to go back to the tach
and<00:06:01.080> remember<00:06:01.500> mine<00:06:01.740> set<00:06:02.040> at<00:06:02.070> 6000<00:06:02.850> rpms<00:06:03.330> so<00:06:03.630> if

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
and remember mine set at 6000 rpms so if

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.959 
and remember mine set at 6000 rpms so if
I<00:06:04.470> bring<00:06:04.680> the<00:06:04.860> throttle<00:06:05.100> up<00:06:05.460> now

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:07.969 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:11.649 

up<00:06:08.509> just<00:06:08.899> under<00:06:09.110> 6000<00:06:10.099> it'll<00:06:11.029> start<00:06:11.329> flashing

00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:11.659 
up just under 6000 it'll start flashing

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:15.039 
up just under 6000 it'll start flashing
and<00:06:12.199> then<00:06:12.949> when<00:06:13.129> I<00:06:13.159> go<00:06:13.399> to<00:06:13.459> 6000<00:06:14.329> it'll

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:15.049 
and then when I go to 6000 it'll

00:06:15.049 --> 00:06:17.049 
and then when I go to 6000 it'll
actually<00:06:15.199> get<00:06:15.559> solid<00:06:15.979> red<00:06:16.189> see<00:06:16.789> how<00:06:16.879> that

00:06:17.049 --> 00:06:17.059 
actually get solid red see how that

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:21.650 
actually get solid red see how that
works<00:06:17.269> and<00:06:17.539> same<00:06:18.469> thing<00:06:18.649> we<00:06:18.769> can<00:06:19.009> run

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.330 

so<00:06:22.660> again<00:06:22.960> it<00:06:23.200> will<00:06:23.320> just<00:06:23.560> go<00:06:23.740> to<00:06:23.770> the<00:06:24.160> red

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 
so again it will just go to the red

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.080 
so again it will just go to the red
right<00:06:24.670> there

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.909 

right<00:06:27.300> right<00:06:27.660> before<00:06:28.080> 6:00<00:06:28.380> I'll<00:06:28.680> start

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:35.700 
to 6000 then it goes solid and that's

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.370 
to 6000 then it goes solid and that's
telling<00:06:36.150> you<00:06:36.330> time<00:06:36.630> to<00:06:36.750> shift<00:06:36.960> you're<00:06:37.200> right
