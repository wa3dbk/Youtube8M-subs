00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
won't get any sometimes all the zombies

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.960 
won't get any sometimes all the zombies
will<00:01:30.720> just<00:01:31.050> spawn<00:01:31.259> inside<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.680> theater<00:01:32.009> then

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
will just spawn inside the theater then

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.690 
will just spawn inside the theater then
you<00:01:33.479> know<00:01:33.630> what<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.740> want<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.920> do<00:01:35.100> right<00:01:35.430> here

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
you know what you want to do right here

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.880 
you know what you want to do right here
it's<00:01:35.910> a<00:01:36.000> low<00:01:36.180> round<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:36.990> obviously<00:01:37.410> the<00:01:37.590> trap

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
it's a low round so obviously the trap

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.859 
it's a low round so obviously the trap
took<00:01:38.520> care<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.850> whole<00:01:39.030> round<00:01:39.240> for<00:01:39.570> me<00:01:39.690> I

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
took care of the whole round for me I

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.080 
took care of the whole round for me I
got<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> couple<00:01:40.440> stragglers<00:01:40.860> here<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:41.910> what<00:01:42.060> I

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
got a couple stragglers here so what I

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.700 
got a couple stragglers here so what I

there okay because they never realized
what<00:03:53.770> it<00:03:53.800> actually<00:03:54.100> does<00:03:54.370> people<00:03:55.360> just<00:03:55.600> run

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
what it actually does people just run

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.750 
what it actually does people just run
right<00:03:56.260> into<00:03:56.320> the<00:03:56.620> lobby<00:03:56.800> and<00:03:57.190> then<00:03:57.550> all<00:03:57.730> the

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
right into the lobby and then all the

zombies will spawn inside the lobby but

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.850 
zombies will spawn inside the lobby but
with<00:04:00.790> this<00:04:01.000> strategy<00:04:01.330> you<00:04:01.990> stand<00:04:02.350> there<00:04:02.650> and

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
with this strategy you stand there and

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.220 
with this strategy you stand there and
you<00:04:02.950> make<00:04:03.640> all<00:04:03.940> the<00:04:04.150> zombies<00:04:04.330> instead<00:04:04.990> of<00:04:05.080> them

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
you make all the zombies instead of them

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.200 
you make all the zombies instead of them
spawning<00:04:05.530> in<00:04:05.710> the<00:04:05.740> lobby<00:04:06.010> you're<00:04:06.730> making<00:04:07.060> all

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.210 
spawning in the lobby you're making all

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.090

the zombie spawned back in the theater

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.510 
the zombie spawned back in the theater
and<00:04:09.340> then<00:04:10.270> you<00:04:10.390> kill<00:04:10.690> a<00:04:10.870> second<00:04:11.560> wave<00:04:11.770> with<00:04:12.370> the

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
and then you kill a second wave with the

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.390 
and then you kill a second wave with the
trap<00:04:12.840> but<00:04:13.840> not<00:04:13.990> only<00:04:14.200> that<00:04:14.350> when<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.130> trap

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
trap but not only that when the trap

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.310 
trap but not only that when the trap
goes<00:04:15.640> away<00:04:15.850> and<00:04:16.180> it<00:04:16.270> goes<00:04:16.420> out<00:04:16.690> and<00:04:16.900> it's<00:04:17.140> time

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
goes away and it goes out and it's time

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.039 
goes away and it goes out and it's time
