00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.730
 greetings guys today javi I bring you a 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.780
 little review of this weapon that 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:17.540
 we can call it the hard nail neumarkt 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.130
 the in staple everything and basically we can 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:23.060
 keep it up by putting ridiculous names 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:26.119
 but it's actually the seat jota script 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.009
 ms and even though its appearance that gives 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.099
 Laughter and distrust at first sight 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:33.590
 we can verify that this weapon gave us 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.660
 some good surprises the truth is not the 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.989
 we wanted to use because their statistics 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:42.140
 They are pretty bad the appearance makes you laugh 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.269
 and it just does not look like a weapon 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.280
 invincible worth worth the time 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.410
 to get your accessories but 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.899
 after being using a few 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.660
 rounds we saw that it's really not so 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.469
 bad as it seems it is a defensive weapon 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.109
 personal 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.690
 wv that will only be available for the 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.820
 engineer class obviously and by the 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.129
 same classification of the weapon we know of 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.590
 beforehand that only serves for short 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.620
 distances because their damage is basically 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.730
 terrible has a maximum damage of 22 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:17.030
 up to 12.5 meters 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:18.860
 12.1 up to 55 meters so just what 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.020
 we will use in short distances or 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.870
 face- to- face fighting because a 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.270
 Although it has a very low damage 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.700
 high rate of shooting cadence will help 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.250
 very much to face multiple enemies 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.590
 at the same time also because it has 50 bullets 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.020
 in the charger that could well be a 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.900
 quite intimidating force for you 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.880
 good enemy as long as there is 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.300
 finished laughing after seeing you with 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.570
 this thing your recharge is not so bad are 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:51.320
 3.3 seconds and is completely empty 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.960
 and 2.4 if you do a tactical recharge or with 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.700
 a bullet in the charger apparently the 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.950
 problem that you also face is 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.900
 a horizontal recoil the vertical or the 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.790
 problem there is practically no kick 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.890
 up but the horizontal is 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.200
 pretty bad 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.750
 talking about this we know that weapons 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.150
 of personal defense are very suitable for 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.090
 shoot from the hip naturally 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.610
 they're made for that, so something happens 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.920
 curious we have to think about what to do 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.650
 let's shoot aiming with the aim 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.110
 acm or we will just get carried away 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.320
 by its nature to be excellent to the 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.910
 hip the only answer that we find and 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.709
 the only accessory that we saw that in 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.230
 reality serves you as something is the 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:36.080
 compensator because the compensator you 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.060
 will help when you're acm to decrease your 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.310
 horizontal dispersion and it will make you more 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.650
 controllable well and then we will take advantage 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.840
 the book that exists with this accessory 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.540
 which indirectly improves enlisting the 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.640
 hip so to all this we put the 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.739
 laser and you'll have a weapon that you can use 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.170
 in multiple situations always and 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.790
 when he is not demanding to medium 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.100
 distances because even if you have the 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.050
 compensator this does not guarantee you that 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.300
 will continue to maintain the precision in 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.150
 those ranges of fact if the enemy what 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.790
 you see far better forget about it and look 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.200
 alternative routes the truth is that well 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.550
 how we were surprised the beginning with his 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.440
 performance not only 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.200
 because of the limited number of accessories that 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.510
 the heavy cannon can be useful just 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.700
 it adds more control and brake 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.100
 mouth leaves this weapon like a brave man 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.650
 low budget movie you do not give to 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.080
 nothing and the silencer gives more laughter than the 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.690
 aspect of headquarters j so avoid it in 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.400
 the possible a little contradictory and very 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.200
 comic this weapon 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.510
 I do not know if I recommend that he invest 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.790
 time because it feels like a simple 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.500
 Filler to wash the film simply 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.750
 I could play for many hours and 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.970
 find better options than this one but 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.000
 good if you want to have fun for a while 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.800
 get in stapling enemies and good guys 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.340
 this was our review of the cmj 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.900
 more script I hope you liked it 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.700

 weapon
