 the installation is currently in progress 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.040
 of a trigeneration plant for 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.470
 save the atmosphere from the atmosphere 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.000
 co2 every day we do ours

 better to find the right balance 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.400
 between the weight of the packaging and the 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.040
 need to stretch and preserve the 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.790
