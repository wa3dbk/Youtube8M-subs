00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.540
 I want so much for all the kids 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.180
 red today if I'm here with this video 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.559
 to inform you of the return of a series 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.180
 su call of duty here on juan 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.860
 it is for those who haven't already 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.900
 understood the challenge of weapons already 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.270
 started on black holes two is continued 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.740
 also on goss but maybe for new ones 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.779
 It is better that you explain a little better 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.970
 how does it work 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.920
 have you ever wondered playing with which 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.390
 it was better assault rifle or which one 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.619
 machine guns better to use in one 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.319
 given situation 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.239
 well this series serves just this 

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:40.690
 in fact the only thing you will have to do is 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:43.149
 comment in the comments with the two weapons 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.539
 which you want to see analyzed for example 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:48.609
 the cable ra3 and the bal 27 the comment that 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:49.120
 will receive more votes will be what to 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:51.069
 end 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.049
 we say will be exploited for the 

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:54.819
 realization of the video I will go to 

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:57.370
 look for all the data concerning you 

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:59.440
 these weapons ranging from damage to 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.209
 increased to the accuracy of the charger e 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.549
 in general the features that 

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:05.860
 maybe they might interest you and sails 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:07.960
 I will wear black on white in a video with 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.300
 gameplay will eventually give you the 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.950
 possibility in the comments to choose the 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.590
 winner and I will also give you my own 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.350
 personal opinion 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.900
 I think this is a good idea either 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.760
 for those who may not know exactly which one 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.440
 both the best weapon to choose from both 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.170
 general for any player since 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.880
 in Italy in general the tactical part o 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.540
 let's say more call of duty technique 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.340
 missing so we don't waste any more time e 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.200
 immediately start commenting with the two 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.330
 weapons you would like to see in the first one 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.950
 challenge on advanced warfare 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.080
 of course you will not only have to 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.290
 comment because otherwise I would end up 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.570
 find me with 72,000 comments all 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.760
 equal and none that is more voted than the 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.070
 others therefore I recommend commented but 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.500
 also vote for the comment you think 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.810
 is more useful or that you would like to 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.580
 more already and if you want to see 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.470
 exactly how this thing works ah 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.610
 well on the juan channel and you can find 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.190
 previous challenges 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.830
 having said that we will see each other at the first 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.580
 challenge a great desire for everyone and stay pawa 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.580
