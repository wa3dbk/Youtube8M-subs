00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.790
 was convinced but then sitting in the cinema 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.580
 in advance I saw a little bit 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.359

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.359

 Never on the back of a car or 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.010
 We should know each other better 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.900

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.950

 they are not really what they are for you 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.210
 relax yourself 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.540
 I am relaxed 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.540
 once again 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.590
 I do not understand sometimes 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.480
 on the one hand kissed me and then again 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.109
 Not 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.289
 specify institute 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:09.289
 I think 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:25.940
 we need help 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.940
 okay but i only do that hollow 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.860
 because they make gay they must 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.450
 it not so I was treated to make 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.350
 I'm not scared okay my son has me 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:46.030
 everything tells that he feels for her 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.030
 He may have won 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.090
 I'm just not 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.480
 The city is 98 minutes away 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.420
 released six years ago and runs on 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.520
 the 15 august 2013 in the german 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.950
 Cinemas tells the story of ole der 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.870
 in the middle of somewhere then somewhere 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.370
 sometime Mecklenburg Pomerania is alive 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.200
 and in the countryside, it is pretty 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.700
 boring so had with his 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.470
 best two buddies across the 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.480
 prairie on their mopeds and have them 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.580
 a whole lot of fun but somehow 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.800
 everything so provincial and he longs 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.720
 even after a little bit more action 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.280
 and that's where it's good now 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.200
 that his grandfather loves so much 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.180
 I wish he had his cow once a summer 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.070
 Visited in the city Berlin lives 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.380
 he but for many many exactly 15 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.060
 years and has not seen on this 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.590
 away was also due to 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.420
 the resistance of the parents with 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.610
 mixed feelings in the stomach but must 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.990
 then realize that his cousin only 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.880
 It's a different story than he is 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.590
 that he almost meets a city 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.540
 with information overload just overwhelmed but 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.610
 especially that a family story 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.200
 The days are somewhere in the world 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.420
 past a big dispute 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.860
 has caused and going somewhere 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.120
 this movie then actually in 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.530
 these feelings of love the 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.060
 friendship within the family 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.710
 you can not choose families 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.780
 but that you can hurdle each other together 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.490
 overcome can be broached and 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.590
 this is actually a film which then 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.600
 also gets really deep and always 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.190
 is really funny again and above all 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.510
 The cast is pretty much done with 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.830
 jacob matschenz among others one 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.239
 main role or kostja ullmann in 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.860
 other roles are quite 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.260
 well-known faces was above all 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.120
 klaas heufer-circulation the one else from 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.830
 joko and klaas 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.120
 of course, playing here is terrific 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.980
 looks a bit like a young one 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.290
 james deal but above all he has one 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.670
 incredible camera presence and as me 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.080
 The trailer heard the first time thought 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.030
 i kinda somehow fit a roll 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.680
 pure and yes he does not fit that one 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.150
 is pretty cool he can do it 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.040
 everyone is ready to play against the wall here 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.640
 and that absolutely surprised me 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.050
 still in any case that tobias moretti 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.790
 the one with his aura also on the 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.530
 canvas the one or the other seconds 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.910
 really good the audience in the spell 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.680
 I can draw the film on the 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.630
 whole line is surprised and is the must 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.040
 one says among other things with produced 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.050
 from til silent and silent til 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.100
 warner bros are somehow right 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.720
 crass together in the German 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.310
 film landscape and you can tell that 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.960
 This movie looks a little like 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.090
 no-ear bunny or two-eared chick and all 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.100
 these films only without til silent but 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.050
 with these typical gentle hollywood 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.850
 Stick with rhythm with beauty 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.620
 Low the typical composition of this 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.090
 films with a basic problem then 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.380
 overcomes almost over then it comes 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.060
 sometime to the showdown at the end is 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.770
 Maybe everything is good 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.510
 the feeling of this typical silence 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.280
 to look staged movie which is quite 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.660
 can mean that he is good and before 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.979
 all because he is maybe anyway 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.780
 people have a completely different view 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.460
 throw this machart of german film 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.470
 in the end that means for me that 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.910
 small city a movie is me 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.140
 totally surprised because the trailer 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.910
 bad but I do not say that he 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.770
 Great you have to see necessarily 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.510
 but he is much better than I thought 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.669
 and then unfortunately too little pr who 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.930
 So you like German movie like times 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:47.640
 it's okay, what's behind it? 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.590
 somebody should actually be watching this movie 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.720
 The money for the kinoticket pay off 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.040
 is really a bit far right 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.169
 fun and looks with his 98 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.580
 Minutes also quite entertaining so 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:57.780
 Really great a manufacturer 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.000
 and that's why the movie comes from me 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.130
 six and a half out of ten possible points 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.470
 how about the cultivation say why are you talking about the 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.760
 all the time because so positive and then only 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.190
 six and a half out of ten possible points 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.870
 remaining genre of romantic comedy 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.090
 maybe or romantic 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.840
 tragikkomÃ¶die yes that's just because 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.760
 that if you have that kind of 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.130
 expectation has the extremely far 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.479
 down one is then consistently positive 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.070
 but then can also talk through the 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:22.110
 do not have to give such a high rating because 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.130
 that is again this circumstance if you 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.630
 understand what I mean when you are 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.490
 but they would actually tackle that 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:28.260
 film must be top then I would have too 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.880
 in the film relatively bad talked around 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.560
 a question of expectation and 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.950
 actually a cinema experience i would like 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.320
 on 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.100
 here are not much this cinema experience 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.180
 Sweeten if you thought so 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.010
 the film can not do anything and 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.660
 that has a lot to do 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.400
 but by no means one of the top 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.530
 movies is this month but start 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.210
 quite straight for German post 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.979
 possible handsome families overall 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.930
 six out of ten possible forecast than 

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:50.250
 his genre okay a little bit 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.690
 cuddles and spoils but me 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.860
 Hope you got it that 's it 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.919
 otherwise now mine with mine

 Review of big city small truck liked 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:59.950
