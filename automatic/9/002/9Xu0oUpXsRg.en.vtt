rebel base is a virtue moved on to halt

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.800 
rebel base is a virtue moved on to halt
I<00:00:31.099> think<00:00:31.910> that's<00:00:32.119> what<00:00:32.300> they<00:00:32.390> kind<00:00:32.689> of

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:32.810 
I think that's what they kind of

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.940 
I think that's what they kind of
explained<00:00:33.440> here<00:00:34.120> anyway<00:00:35.120> oh<00:00:35.300> sorry<00:00:35.809> yeah<00:00:36.800> this

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
explained here anyway oh sorry yeah this

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.889 
explained here anyway oh sorry yeah this
is<00:00:37.040> actually<00:00:37.100> my<00:00:37.309> second<00:00:37.610> attempt<00:00:37.969> because<00:00:38.600> I

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899 
is actually my second attempt because I

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.380 
is actually my second attempt because I
kept<00:00:41.899> on<00:00:42.020> running<00:00:42.379> into<00:00:42.680> things<00:00:42.969> and<00:00:43.969> I<00:00:44.210> could

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
kept on running into things and I could

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.049 
kept on running into things and I could
on<00:00:44.480> dying<00:00:44.719> in<00:00:44.989> the<00:00:45.230> only<00:00:45.379> have<00:00:45.469> three<00:00:45.649> lives

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
on dying in the only have three lives

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.029 
on dying in the only have three lives
there's<00:00:47.059> a<00:00:47.149> passcode<00:00:47.660> to<00:00:47.690> get<00:00:48.170> five<00:00:48.440> lives<00:00:48.710> by

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
there's a passcode to get five lives by

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:53.799 
there's a passcode to get five lives by
figured<00:00:49.340> I<00:00:49.489> don't<00:00:50.120> need<00:00:50.270> it<00:00:52.270> but<00:00:53.270> turns<00:00:53.629> out<00:00:53.750> I

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
figured I don't need it but turns out I

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.400 
figured I don't need it but turns out I
do<00:00:55.359> all<00:00:56.359> right<00:00:56.510> now<00:00:56.660> it's<00:00:56.899> actually<00:00:57.079> kind<00:00:57.350> of

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
do all right now it's actually kind of

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.889 
do all right now it's actually kind of
hard<00:00:57.649> to<00:00:58.359> decide<00:00:59.359> where<00:00:59.539> you<00:00:59.600> need<00:00:59.750> to<00:00:59.840> go

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
hard to decide where you need to go

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.750 
hard to decide where you need to go
because<00:01:00.649> there's<00:01:00.980> no<00:01:01.280> green<00:01:01.640> or<00:01:01.910> orange<00:01:02.300> arrow

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
because there's no green or orange arrow

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.330 
because there's no green or orange arrow
where<00:01:04.390> to<00:01:04.509> go

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.450 

and<00:01:07.460> it's<00:01:07.909> better<00:01:08.119> if<00:01:08.240> you<00:01:08.299> take<00:01:08.479> out<00:01:08.630> those

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
and it's better if you take out those

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.340 
and it's better if you take out those
ships<00:01:10.460> better<00:01:11.359> sell<00:01:11.659> the<00:01:11.780> ground<00:01:12.020> while

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
ships better sell the ground while

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.540 
ships better sell the ground while
they're<00:01:12.500> not<00:01:12.829> a<00:01:12.859> nuisance

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:24.050 

suit<00:01:17.180> suit<00:01:17.630> suit<00:01:17.660> suit<00:01:18.050> suit<00:01:18.470> suit<00:01:18.890> suit

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.530 

um

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.330 

I<00:01:27.660> can't<00:01:28.260> remember

remember what I was talking about in the

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:35.639 
remember what I was talking about in the
last<00:01:31.960> commentary<00:01:32.740> because<00:01:33.929> it<00:01:34.929> is<00:01:35.469> pretty

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
last commentary because it is pretty

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.209
