be very entertaining to watch a meet
there's<00:01:35.450> nothing<00:01:35.689> wrong<00:01:36.049> with<00:01:36.350> that<00:01:36.560> but<00:01:36.850> the

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
there's nothing wrong with that but the

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.940 
there's nothing wrong with that but the
problem<00:01:38.390> begins<00:01:38.780> when<00:01:39.200> people<00:01:39.560> start<00:01:39.890> with

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
problem begins when people start with

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.130 
problem begins when people start with
one<00:01:40.399> tree<00:01:40.729> and<00:01:40.909> then<00:01:41.420> another<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:42.079> then

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
one tree and then another and then

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.580 
one tree and then another and then
another<00:01:43.390> probably<00:01:44.390> the<00:01:44.659> best<00:01:44.869> analogy<00:01:45.380> I<00:01:45.560> can

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
another probably the best analogy I can

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.830 
another probably the best analogy I can
think<00:01:45.829> of<00:01:46.280> for<00:01:46.549> this<00:01:46.820> is<00:01:47.030> that<00:01:47.600> feeding

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
think of for this is that feeding

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.139 
think of for this is that feeding
gliders<00:01:48.530> treats<00:01:48.920> is<00:01:49.159> a<00:01:49.219> lot<00:01:49.579> like<00:01:49.820> eating

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
gliders treats is a lot like eating

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.899 
gliders treats is a lot like eating
potato<00:01:50.539> chips<00:01:50.659> it's<00:01:51.409> very<00:01:51.890> hard<00:01:52.250> to<00:01:52.340> stop<00:01:52.700> at

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
potato chips it's very hard to stop at

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.289 
potato chips it's very hard to stop at
just<00:01:53.210> one<00:01:53.619> now<00:01:54.619> like<00:01:55.280> we<00:01:55.460> talked<00:01:55.700> about<00:01:55.729> in<00:01:56.179> the

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
just one now like we talked about in the

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.480 
just one now like we talked about in the
video<00:01:56.420> on<00:01:56.689> proper<00:01:57.109> nutrition<00:01:57.140> it's<00:01:58.100> very

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
video on proper nutrition it's very

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.609 
video on proper nutrition it's very
important<00:01:59.119> to<00:01:59.179> remember<00:01:59.509> that<00:01:59.719> sugar<00:02:00.109> gliders

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
important to remember that sugar gliders

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.399 
important to remember that sugar gliders
are<00:02:00.799> a<00:02:00.890> lot<00:02:01.189> like<00:02:01.429> human<00:02:01.850> children<00:02:02.090> in<00:02:02.479> that<00:02:03.109> if

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
are a lot like human children in that if

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.440 
are a lot like human children in that if
you<00:02:03.530> give<00:02:03.770> them<00:02:03.799> the<00:02:04.009> choice<00:02:04.429> between<00:02:04.969> eating

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
you give them the choice between eating

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.359 
you give them the choice between eating
sweet<00:02:05.780> things<00:02:06.140> and<00:02:06.409> foods<00:02:07.039> that<00:02:07.250> are

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
sweet things and foods that are

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.249

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
nutritionally good for them they will

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.620 
nutritionally good for them they will
always<00:02:09.890> fill<00:02:10.130> up<00:02:10.310> on<00:02:10.460> the<00:02:10.610> sweet<00:02:10.880> stuff<00:02:11.060> first

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
little nutritional value so feeding them

limit on your gliders treats also it's

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.930 
limit on your gliders treats also it's
generally<00:03:58.230> not<00:03:58.410> a<00:03:58.470> good<00:03:58.620> idea<00:03:58.799> to<00:03:59.370> feed<00:03:59.579> treats

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
generally not a good idea to feed treats
