00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hey people welcome to the first episode 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.799
 the fifa 16 predictions I have mine 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.390
 I do not think so much like that 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.589
 the others most of all 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.820
 any race players then take 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.620
 simply the products but I want 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.940
 because it's a bit systematic 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.490
 and that's what I'm going to do 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.710
 most interesting player in fifa so 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.529
 from 415 to jaw 16 in the Bundesliga 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.060
 looking for position interesting 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.980
 defines itself that means someone 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.630
 It's a very interesting upgrade 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.670
 hopefully and probably will 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.010
 or a downgrade no matter in position 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.330
 change that's always relatively there 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.800
 interesting and not what i like 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.930
 try to get the players in there 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.090
 which in any case in 4 16 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.920
 are different than in 415 mostly 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.329
 of course better, but not always, however, 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.070
 We have seyfang right on today 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.770
 namely the culprits and the first 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.510
 is her roman buchki the card design by 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.190
 the way of fifa 16 is of course not 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.170
 the official but a very nice something 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.370
 I found and what I bought 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:57.059
 have and the design bought the pst 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.070
 file for photoshop for 90 cents believe 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.239
 me and because she gave a job and 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.410
 this cool as if I took the 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.539
 because I think that's a very nice one 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.909
 card and that would definitely me 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.080
 fallen for fifa 16 if that looks like that 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.240
 but we come to the player of 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.549
 ex-freiburger now dortmunder to the new 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.020
 season is really good 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.310
 played in the last season 79 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.479
 maybe almost too low but me 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.189
 I did not want to overdo it 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.130
 he certainly with the strong upgrade in 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.840
 deining reflex is in everything because he has 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.869
 proved in last season at freiburg 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.799
 what he has on him that despite the 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.290
 actually constantly difficult 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.770
 situation freiburgs always a safe 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.880
 backing had support was so rum though 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.340
 here and there once made a mistake 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.229
 he absolutely did not avoid that either 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.759
 Of course, but not on a large scale 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.259
 and all in all, freiburg 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.759
 has saved much more points than 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.619
 it costs and accordingly 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.390
 deserves an upgrade to 79 in mine 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.380
 eyes and on these values ​​handling 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.869
 I left it a bit low 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.159
 and kicking positioning a bit higher 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.149
 as the two and then, of course, therefore 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.159
 it's like a reflex because that's in mine 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.899
 eyes the very clear strength of him 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.610
 He is terribly good on the line and 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.380
 thinks some really good really good 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.619
 today and will definitely in my eyes 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.969
 can prevail in dortmund 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.409
 against Weidenfeller and with lengerich is 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.390
 now away from it, he becomes the new one 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.039
 Season number one will be there then 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.750
 is today ralf ferryman of schalke 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.420
 He again with a strong 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.290
 seasonal seasonally before the last was yes 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.750
 already very good 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.099
 his 77 card and now in mine 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.349
 eyes an 80s one could here 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.579
 maybe even an 81 talk too 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.510
 I did not want to exaggerate directly here 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.430
 he has a really good season 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.170
 played but still he is very 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.480
 injury prone in the 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.920
 past and could partially his 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.359
 not always keep shape 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.459
 but I think if he goes on like this 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:33.959
 as in the last season then it suits him 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.349
 definitely a very bright future 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:40.109
 before because today so most do not listen 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.819
 on before they are at least 34 35 are there 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:43.500
 not quite the athletic abilities 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.599
 so incredibly important are we on the 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.430
 In any case, in my eyes he fielded the 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.959
 eighties rating 83-year-old 84 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.909
 reflexes helbling quite well 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.709
 also does not position kicking quite like that 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:55.230
 high he can even quite good 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.730
 Actually, but I think that 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.379
 still a little bit up 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.970
 Generally a very good card here too 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.250
 especially by his size of me 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.319
 think a meta 96 or something like that very much 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.359
 interesting for the tor because just now 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.280
 with its size and good reflexes 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.870
 and in the good, definitely something good 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.879
 can hold 80s overall rating for 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.290
 ferryman in my eyes the third 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:16.019
 player then today is yann summer and 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.769
 he too he has become a giant or a 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:21.299
 he deserves a relatively good upgrade 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.519
 moved to gladbach and has there 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.139
 really in the last season 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:28.109
 incredibly well played what the part 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:29.579
 holding was incredible and yes that 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.049
 he did not get a team of the season 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.849
 I also found to be very 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.299
 weird because it was absolutely deserved 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.340
 would have 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.389
 Generally both Switzerland has today 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.859
 a huge season but above all 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:39.599
 summer with gladbach year very far 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.799
 At the top ended up a great season 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.139
 but also played with his team 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.479
 he himself upgraded to 82 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:49.319
 86 is 86 reflex 

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:50.790
 81 handling 75 kicking and 77 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.989
 positioning so all values ​​actually 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.909
 pretty good and I think he's there 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.199
 definitely a very good bundesliga 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:57.150
 Goalkeeper will be the one too 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:58.859
 definitely can use and 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.780
 probably even use 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:02.280
 because he is good in all statistics 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.689
 the only problem with him is the 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.060
 size i think he is a real plus 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:07.590
 183 tall which is very small today 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.060
 so that could be a problem in fifa 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.159
 be of the values ​​forth anyway 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.970
 not he a clear one in my eyes 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:16.590
 update earned 82 that would be worth it 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.209
 then we can too, he also horn 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.880
 having a good season was a long time 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.010
 the first few games part of the best 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.360
 defensive because cologne I had to one 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.790
 First I do not know how many we do 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.620
 barely on the first few days 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.180
 Tore has stood very defensively well 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.500
 an important point for that he was the 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.360
 not only kept good but also 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.010
 Generally very much quiet radiates 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.780
 in spite of his young age a lot 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.460
 routinely over and of course 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.760
 He is very, very tall, anyway 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.490
 a clear upgrade to 77 80 83 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.720
 reflex handling also kick well 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.100
 I slightly raised because that is now in 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.440
 my eyes no sense so huge 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.970
 Change is needed and positioning too 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.860
 high general also here a good upgrade 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.950
 also due to its size probably 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.690
 an interesting candidate because well 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.800
 a big part in fifa is mostly good 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.930
 though they may sometimes have 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.860
 problems with the flat balls in the corner 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.570
 for example if you are fast on the 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.670
 But ground must also be at fifa 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.870
 actually rare and that's why he 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.270
 certainly next year too 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.560
 good option 77 that's what I mean 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.610
 they could and will be too 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.590
 already the last player's turn 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.170
 loris karius was not with me 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.720
 sure if I should give it 777 or 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:20.640
 maybe only a 76er too 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.260
 like everyone else in this episode today 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.180
 with a good one with good performances 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.970
 Last year, however, from time to time 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.770
 prone to error so I like him and 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.060
 as good as I can find him he just has 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.070
 partly still to bucks in it 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.200
 example just against the vfb as navi 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.540
 from 35 meters on it pulls and he was 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.950
 then somehow yes through his hands 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.570
 jumps through quite funny scene 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.730
 that's why there is something else here 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.170
 lower than investment values ​​for diving 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.370
 reflex I've set directly up 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.440
 because that's his in my eyes 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.030
 Strengthen kicking something up and 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.920
 Positioning also clearly because that with 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.690
 67 was rated very low 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.040
 In general, he proved that he the 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.300
 number one at mainz can be too 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.580
 plays a good role and certainly 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.860
 also for larger clubs already 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.940
 endeared I just hope that does 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.710
 he will not switch that would be 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.480
 Stupid this summer it would be smart 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.800
 if he still brings a season at 1 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.210
 Matures there and then maybe 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.640
 we hope the next step 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.360
 that it would happen in fifa 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.160
 probably not the one now 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.090
 Most played sitter will be in the next 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.920
 year but still 77er gold card that 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.270
 would be pretty good and the water 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.590
 again before today's episode in 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.000
 the next episodes will be the 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.670
 not all positions come 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.390
 get your own episode I believe 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.470
 defender and zdm must be 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.970
 I'm not together yet 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.350
 certainly depending but I think so 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.520
 I make them together if you 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.110
 you have suggestions for players 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.330
 Of course I like to post 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.040
 already lists created with players the 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.150
 I take it in and then I do it 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.260
 probably will use but if 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.640
 you still some other player 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.690
 of course I can do that too 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.260
 still consider and maybe 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.850
 I still remember 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.980
 on what I have overlooked so far 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.610
 then attention you give me makes therefore 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.680
 likes to write in the comments 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.000
 water games he still wants to see on the 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.860
 future positions 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.630
 that 's it from today's predictions 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:55.430
 Although we are not so up to date 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:55.430
 until then and bye
