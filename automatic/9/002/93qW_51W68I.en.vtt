00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.680
 all the world is talking all the time 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.690
 oculus meets exactly as he did 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.550
 but you forget relatively easily 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.769
 that there are a lot of others 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.360
 inventions in the field there and one 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.190
 which comes right out of here 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.100
 Germany from the computer scientist Stefan 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.140
 Witherer has a wonderful 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.680
 Construction tinkered with the phone 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.779
 will become the 3d boom console and want that 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.849
 we will show you more exactly if you 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.230
 Modern smartphone is buying nowadays 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.790
 you have more computing power than we do 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.829
 a few years ago in the desktop calculator 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.200
 had and in addition there is any 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.790
 amount of son acceleration will become 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.190
 an example is the classic 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.200
 Everyone knows and that is one of the 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.930
 sensors the stefan exploits if he 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.960
 then the mobile phone in his small apparatus 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.690
 pushes one here and then in front of the eyes 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.030
 is what is happening in it 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.820
 Relatively simple on the phone is a 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.129
 side by side 3d image showing that one 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.870
 viewed through these lenses and 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.910
 This then becomes a picture 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.739
 composed the eye and if you 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.930
 the phone then has in front of his eyes and 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.950
 moves to the right or left after 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.900
 top or bottom 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.140
 then exactly this movement into the 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.760
 Gameplay implemented when you look at yourself 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.799
 the mobile virtual reality glasses 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.990
 has then set up as I said 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.240
 So the head movements can transmit 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.700
 you look wonderful in this 3d room 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.869
 because in front of the eye takes look around 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.610
 Of course you need to move 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.930
 a little more and then the 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.579
 Then come the classic ones 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.970
 bluetooth controller for use 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.130
 be it in the usual ps3 wii shop 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.170
 design or even one for my sake 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.270
 second mobile phone and where the touchscreen 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.409
 then the control area represents for 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.079
 the character in the game 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.340
 Quake 2 with a second cell phone too 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.720
 Control the other thing before 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.000
 own eyes sounds a bit 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.470
 but funny is relatively practical 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.630
 On the one hand, there is the possibility 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.250
 the controller mobile phone's buttons 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.140
 individually to prove there the whole 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.820
 mobile phone as a controller is available 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.290
 and on the other and that makes the matter 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.640
 you can really get excited in the long run 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.049
 view yes, for example, go and 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.270
 the acceleration sensors from 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.829
 then use the controller mobile phone 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.270
 forward backward movements or 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.770
 to implement similar 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.899
 So there is still a lot of air after 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.989
 above and the whole in 3d 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.650
 sounds pretty cool in the prototype of 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.420
 3D glasses 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.860
 we have here now 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.959
 galaxy nexus in it 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.920
 in principle , you could but any android 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.909
 use mobile phone 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.260
 that at least a 720p resolution has 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:27.239
 currently would be here in the housing now 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.049
 also that it fits in three or that 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.730
 nexus 4 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.799
 and if the thing at some point in 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.420
 production goes well then it should be so 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.129
 be individually adjustable that one 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.030
 Actually, every cell size is reasonable 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.799
 can accommodate 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.170
 and that will be a really cool one 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.970
 Gadget for all gamers the android cellphone 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.250
 you do not even need a root 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.269
 access the thing runs smoothly, it makes 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.129
 really much fun 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.220
 We are really looking forward to the finale 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.220
 product
