00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
trick on FL Studio how to make your

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:08.810 
trick on FL Studio how to make your
drums<00:00:07.770> more<00:00:08.010> interesting<00:00:08.580> and<00:00:08.730> less

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
drums more interesting and less

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.879 
drums more interesting and less
repetitive<00:00:09.210> how<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:09.900> add<00:00:10.080> variations<00:00:10.710> into

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
repetitive how to add variations into

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.770 
repetitive how to add variations into
your<00:00:11.040> drum<00:00:11.250> pattern<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:12.150> this<00:00:12.269> can<00:00:12.420> be<00:00:12.509> really

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
your drum pattern and this can be really

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.209 
your drum pattern and this can be really
important<00:00:13.170> especially<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.679> software<00:00:14.070> like

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
important especially the software like

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.970 
important especially the software like
FL<00:00:14.490> Studio<00:00:14.910> where<00:00:15.599> it<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:15.990> so<00:00:16.320> easy<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.830> get

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
FL Studio where it is so easy to get

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.620 
FL Studio where it is so easy to get
overly<00:00:17.460> repetitive<00:00:18.000> because<00:00:18.180> you're<00:00:18.420> just

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
overly repetitive because you're just

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.359 
overly repetitive because you're just
dragging<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.199> dropping<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.740> same<00:00:19.949> pattern

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
dragging and dropping the same pattern

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.550 
dragging and dropping the same pattern
so<00:00:21.029> how<00:00:21.180> do<00:00:21.240> you<00:00:21.330> make<00:00:21.480> your<00:00:21.630> drums<00:00:21.869> more

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
so how do you make your drums more

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.920 
so how do you make your drums more
interesting<00:00:23.010> by<00:00:23.130> adding<00:00:23.369> variations<00:00:24.000> well

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
interesting by adding variations well

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.800 
interesting by adding variations well
let's<00:00:25.289> say<00:00:25.500> here<00:00:25.800> we've<00:00:26.010> got<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.490> 4<00:00:27.119> bar<00:00:27.359> phrase

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
let's say here we've got a 4 bar phrase

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.529 
let's say here we've got a 4 bar phrase
of<00:00:28.140> fours<00:00:28.769> here<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.369> just<00:00:29.609> your<00:00:29.730> standard<00:00:30.060> 4<00:00:30.300> 4

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
go down to make unique and what that's

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.759 
go down to make unique and what that's
gonna<00:01:02.430> do<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.730> create<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> copy<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.409> same

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.560 
gonna do is create a copy of that same
drum<00:01:05.339> pattern<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:05.939> just<00:01:06.119> clicked<00:01:06.390> on

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
drum pattern that we just clicked on

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.359 
drum pattern that we just clicked on
into<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.170> different<00:01:07.560> pattern<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.010> can<00:01:08.159> edit

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
into a different pattern so you can edit

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.039 
into a different pattern so you can edit
it<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.299> won't<00:01:09.420> erase<00:01:09.750> what<00:01:09.930> you've

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
it and it won't erase what you've

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.600 
it and it won't erase what you've
already<00:01:10.170> had<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:10.560> there<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:10.920> we'll<00:01:11.310> just<00:01:11.460> add

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
already had on there so we'll just add

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.050 
already had on there so we'll just add
an<00:01:11.820> eighth<00:01:11.939> note<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.390> there<00:01:13.369> so<00:01:14.369> now<00:01:14.520> listen<00:01:14.909> to

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
an eighth note in there so now listen to

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.230 
an eighth note in there so now listen to
it

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.480 

all<00:01:19.170> right<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.440> a<00:01:19.470> little<00:01:19.500> basic<00:01:19.860> fill<00:01:20.250> there

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
all right so a little basic fill there

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.510 
all right so a little basic fill there
let<00:01:21.119> me<00:01:21.150> go<00:01:21.330> on<00:01:21.510> to<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.900> fourth<00:01:22.250> pattern<00:01:23.250> of

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
let me go on to the fourth pattern of

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.430 
let me go on to the fourth pattern of
that<00:01:23.670> sequence<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:26.810> don't<00:01:27.810> take<00:01:28.050> a<00:01:28.080> listen<00:01:28.290> to

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
that sequence I don't take a listen to

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.430 
that sequence I don't take a listen to
that<00:01:32.299> so<00:01:33.299> that's<00:01:33.420> how<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.630> do<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:33.960> okay<00:01:34.259> real

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
that so that's how you do that okay real

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.749 
that so that's how you do that okay real
basic<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.159> we'll<00:01:36.000> just<00:01:36.210> add<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:37.250> three<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.580> that

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
basic so we'll just add a three and that

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.630 
basic so we'll just add a three and that
floor<00:01:39.030> pattern<00:01:39.450> right<00:01:40.020> okay<00:01:40.590> another<00:01:41.520> thing

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
floor pattern right okay another thing

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.540 
floor pattern right okay another thing
you<00:01:41.970> can<00:01:42.119> do<00:01:42.300> is<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:42.720> say<00:01:42.960> I've<00:01:43.229> got<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.590> melody

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
you can do is so say I've got the melody

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.910 
you can do is so say I've got the melody
line<00:01:44.670> kicking<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.149> right<00:01:45.180> here<00:01:45.740> let's<00:01:46.740> make

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
line kicking in right here let's make

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.440 
line kicking in right here let's make
this<00:01:47.100> one<00:01:47.310> unique<00:01:47.580> again<00:01:49.310> me<00:01:50.310> find<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.789> crash

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
this one unique again me find the crash

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.050 
this one unique again me find the crash
cymbal<00:01:51.990> here<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.440> place<00:01:55.640> all<00:01:56.640> right

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
cymbal here and place all right

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.529 
cymbal here and place all right
actually<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.259> would<00:01:58.380> want<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.649> go<00:01:58.740> here<00:01:59.039> on

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
actually you would want to go here on

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:02.419 
actually you would want to go here on
the<00:02:00.539> first<00:02:00.869> pattern<00:02:01.289> of<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.920> sequence<00:02:02.280> or<00:02:02.369> the

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
the first pattern of the sequence or the

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:14.449 
the first pattern of the sequence or the
melody<00:02:02.640> kicks<00:02:02.970> in<00:02:12.890> so<00:02:13.890> here's<00:02:14.100> what<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.340> have

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
melody kicks in so here's what you have

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:23.309 
melody kicks in so here's what you have
now<00:02:14.640> altogether
