00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
demonstrator that I've been using this

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.010 
demonstrator that I've been using this
is<00:00:13.380> from<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.650> same<00:00:13.799> company<00:00:14.389> this<00:00:15.389> is<00:00:15.630> called

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
is from the same company this is called

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.269 
is from the same company this is called
their<00:00:16.710> sapphire<00:00:17.340> 1<00:00:17.670> &amp;<00:00:17.970> 2<00:00:18.000> 8<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.510> 11<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:19.380> this<00:00:20.130> is

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
their sapphire 1 &amp; 2 8 and 11 so this is

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.220 
their sapphire 1 &amp; 2 8 and 11 so this is
what<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.490> looks<00:00:20.670> like<00:00:20.850> here<00:00:21.270> these<00:00:21.869> are<00:00:22.199> all

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
what it looks like here these are all

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.230 
what it looks like here these are all
the<00:00:22.650> different<00:00:22.769> attachments<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:23.670> comes<00:00:23.910> with

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
so you have really small ones some

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.130 
so you have really small ones some
medium<00:00:26.670> sized<00:00:27.060> ones<00:00:27.300> too<00:00:27.480> thick<00:00:27.660> ones<00:00:27.900> and

medium sized ones too thick ones and

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.990 
medium sized ones too thick ones and

this<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.330> most<00:00:30.689> different<00:00:31.140> thing<00:00:31.260> i've

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
this is the most different thing i've

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.170 
this is the most different thing i've
ever<00:00:31.439> used<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:32.189> i<00:00:32.250> usually<00:00:32.460> curl<00:00:32.969> my<00:00:33.149> hair

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
ever used and i usually curl my hair

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.479 
ever used and i usually curl my hair
with<00:00:33.420> my<00:00:33.690> straightener<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.380> this<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.340> like

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
with my straightener and this is like

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.940 
with my straightener and this is like
above<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.000> beyond<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.360> definitely<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.649> it

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
above and beyond that definitely so it

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.700 
above and beyond that definitely so it
does<00:00:38.129> have<00:00:38.360> the<00:00:39.360> eight<00:00:39.510> barrel<00:00:39.840> attachments

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
and the different ones right here and it

and the different ones right here and it
just<00:00:43.500> says<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.860> thicknesses<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:45.000> each<00:00:45.539> of

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
just says the thicknesses in each of

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.080 
just says the thicknesses in each of
them<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.230> also<00:00:46.440> has<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:47.100> specs<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.820> takes

like<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.600> few<00:00:49.050> seconds<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.559> get<00:00:49.770> hot<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.700> goes<00:00:50.910> up

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
like a few seconds to get hot it goes up

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.869 
like a few seconds to get hot it goes up
very<00:00:51.329> high<00:00:51.690> although<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.440> only<00:00:53.129> take<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.730> to

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
very high although I only take it to

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.779 
very high although I only take it to
about<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.300> goes<00:00:54.420> up<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.690> 450<00:00:55.530> degrees

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
about it goes up to 450 degrees

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.630 
about it goes up to 450 degrees
fahrenheit<00:00:56.789> in<00:00:57.120> 230<00:00:57.629> degrees<00:00:58.410> Celsius<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.609> I

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
fahrenheit in 230 degrees Celsius so I

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.429 
fahrenheit in 230 degrees Celsius so I
usually<00:01:00.180> put<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.480> on<00:01:00.629> about<00:01:01.559> um<00:01:02.930> 375<00:01:03.930> or<00:01:04.260> maybe

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
usually put it on about um 375 or maybe

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.600 
usually put it on about um 375 or maybe
a<00:01:04.559> little<00:01:04.739> bit<00:01:04.920> more<00:01:05.070> nothing<00:01:05.430> higher<00:01:05.580> than
