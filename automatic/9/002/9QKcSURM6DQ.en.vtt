yet<00:04:26.890> two<00:04:27.010> points<00:04:27.400> and<00:04:27.870> firstly<00:04:28.870> is<00:04:29.140> the<00:04:29.410> areas

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
yet two points and firstly is the areas

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.320 
yet two points and firstly is the areas
of<00:04:30.250> youth<00:04:30.430> for<00:04:30.640> a<00:04:30.700> long<00:04:30.820> time<00:04:31.060> it'll

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
of youth for a long time it'll

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.090 
of youth for a long time it'll
eventually<00:04:31.510> the<00:04:32.320> ground<00:04:32.560> starts<00:04:32.890> to<00:04:32.950> wear

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
eventually the ground starts to wear

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.250 
eventually the ground starts to wear
down<00:04:33.160> specially<00:04:33.700> its<00:04:33.790> grass<00:04:34.030> so<00:04:34.360> I<00:04:34.630> recommend

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
down specially its grass so I recommend

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.770 
down specially its grass so I recommend
moving<00:04:35.770> regularly<00:04:36.460> to<00:04:36.850> find<00:04:37.060> better<00:04:37.270> patches

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
moving regularly to find better patches

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.480 
moving regularly to find better patches
and<00:04:38.700> another<00:04:39.700> point<00:04:39.940> is<00:04:40.120> a<00:04:40.150> football<00:04:41.490> always

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
and another point is a football always

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.380 
and another point is a football always
make<00:04:42.640> sure<00:04:42.670> that<00:04:42.850> the<00:04:43.030> balls<00:04:43.330> are<00:04:43.510> too<00:04:43.690> hard<00:04:45.390> so

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
make sure that the balls are too hard so

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.960 
make sure that the balls are too hard so
there's<00:04:46.540> enough<00:04:46.690> air<00:04:46.930> inside<00:04:47.260> it<00:04:47.790> it's<00:04:48.790> not

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
there's enough air inside it it's not

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.240
