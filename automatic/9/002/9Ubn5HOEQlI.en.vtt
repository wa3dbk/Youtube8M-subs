00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
the same URL is the first page so it's

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.250 
the same URL is the first page so it's
from<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.870> same<00:02:34.200> guy<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.970> it's<00:02:35.970> asking<00:02:36.840> for

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
one of these animals is a fake animal

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.030 
one of these animals is a fake animal
website<00:03:18.540> that's<00:03:18.870> owned<00:03:19.200> by<00:03:19.500> some<00:03:19.800> other

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.940 
website that's owned by some other
person<00:03:20.490> so<00:03:20.700> these<00:03:20.880> aren't<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.750> same<00:03:22.020> as<00:03:22.410> the

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
person so these aren't the same as the

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.160 
person so these aren't the same as the
guy<00:03:23.160> who<00:03:23.220> does<00:03:23.730> this<00:03:23.940> website<00:03:24.450> but<00:03:24.990> they're

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
guy who does this website but they're

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.130 
guy who does this website but they're
all<00:03:25.410> fake<00:03:26.310> animals<00:03:26.640> such<00:03:27.150> as<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.510> saber-tooth

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
all fake animals such as the saber-tooth

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.610 
all fake animals such as the saber-tooth
salmon<00:03:28.800> and<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:30.000> mountain<00:03:30.810> walrus<00:03:31.320> and

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
salmon and the mountain walrus and

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.510 
salmon and the mountain walrus and
things<00:03:31.830> like<00:03:32.040> that

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
things like that

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.640 
things like that
so<00:03:32.910> these<00:03:33.030> are<00:03:33.210> obviously<00:03:33.870> fake<00:03:34.110> websites
