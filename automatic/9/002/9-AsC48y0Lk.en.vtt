00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.359
 now however the week goes with a budget granted in two 

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:16.390
 in the week that could be called this week's combine of the week 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.390
 because I will not teach you how to produce a plan 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:25.029
 if to draw your attention to the importance of placement 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.029
 notes of this melody when you have 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.300
 here is for example the font the about 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.600
 Saint Jacques 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.600
 but in the most classic way 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.370
 I can add an important notion to this way of playing I will 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.400
 simply 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.440
 we had a little more 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.440
 here is an example 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.450
 we can imagine a closer result 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.150
 so the examples are passed 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.250
 I am, but for the rhythmic placement of the year 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.390
 everything while his interpretation 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.550
 imagine badly 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.000
 no profession in practice this placement 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.410
 on a string of chords played by a guitarist to indignation you subway 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:11.829
 eight days a suite 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:14.649
 of agreement that does not have a priori 

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:17.819
 gold with the source melody but on the quality we listened to everything from 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.819
 after 

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:30.059
 other measure that a priori by the tone have nothing to do with 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:35.199
 I'm going to try to put on these chords that will turn in loop 

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:38.979
 the melody we had to eat together in asia 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:58.919
 when 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:09.419
 brown be 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:12.369
 here 

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:15.369
 here 

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:27.509
 when to 

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:41.649
 c 

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:46.679
 the power 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.329
 the 

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:58.139
 no 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:01.139
 at 

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:05.229
 sometimes the snow 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:08.959
 you imagine yourself 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.959
 to apply this kind of approach 

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:16.599
 40 'known melodies train on steps recognized well 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:19.139
 r nursery rhymes for children 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.729
 we all remember it's stock market we learned that we were 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:22.430
 children 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.270
 for example we will not go to the wood on the same suite of agreement could 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.270
 give 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:11.460
 flying 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.320
 We'll see 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.320
 so I hope these examples 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:20.449
 think how to interpret differently appreciated music 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:26.059
 a little bit differently think she has in this trial also a thought 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:29.800
 because hopping your melodies 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.360
 it is yesterday with the years I do not hide you 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.360
 and if you have it right now 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.360
 but if it is easier to interpret 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.919
 have fun that this 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:42.740
 the plan of the week this combines from the week to its next
