show you five ways I like to Solow my
fringe<00:00:14.940> so<00:00:15.630> let's<00:00:15.809> start<00:00:16.080> off<00:00:16.170> with<00:00:16.289> wearing

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
fringe so let's start off with wearing

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.500 
fringe so let's start off with wearing
it<00:00:16.800> straight<00:00:17.160> since<00:00:17.760> my<00:00:17.910> bangs<00:00:18.119> are<00:00:18.300> pretty

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
it straight since my bangs are pretty

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.400 
it straight since my bangs are pretty
thick<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.869> like<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.289> section<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:19.800> in<00:00:19.920> half<00:00:20.220> and

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
thick I like to section it in half and

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.320 
thick I like to section it in half and
then<00:00:22.410> using<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.830> flat<00:00:23.100> iron<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.550> just<00:00:23.760> curl<00:00:24.090> it

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
then using a flat iron I just curl it

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.150 
then using a flat iron I just curl it
towards<00:00:24.539> my<00:00:24.779> face<00:00:25.050> making<00:00:25.590> sure<00:00:25.859> that<00:00:26.010> the

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
towards my face making sure that the

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.220 
towards my face making sure that the
lengths<00:00:26.400> are<00:00:26.609> even<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:29.539> let<00:00:30.539> down<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.810> second

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
lengths are even I let down the second

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.930 
lengths are even I let down the second
layer<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.710> also<00:00:32.040> curl<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.460> towards<00:00:32.790> my

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
layer and I also curl that towards my

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.330 
layer and I also curl that towards my
face<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.899> right<00:00:34.079> side<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.410> my<00:00:34.530> bangs<00:00:34.800> tend<00:00:35.219> to

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
face the right side of my bangs tend to

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.670 
face the right side of my bangs tend to
lay<00:00:35.579> flatter<00:00:36.000> making<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.630> look<00:00:36.780> longer<00:00:37.350> so

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
lay flatter making it look longer so

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.229 
lay flatter making it look longer so
it's<00:00:37.860> kind<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.430> struggle<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.879> make<00:00:39.090> them

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
it's kind of a struggle to make them

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.000 
it's kind of a struggle to make them
look<00:00:39.390> even<00:00:39.629> but<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.110> think<00:00:40.320> it's<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.530> quirk<00:00:40.770> that

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
look even but I think it's a quirk that

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.119 
look even but I think it's a quirk that
I<00:00:41.070> haven't<00:00:41.340> let<00:00:41.579> go<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.969> yet<00:00:42.800> then<00:00:43.800> I<00:00:43.829> use<00:00:44.100> a

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
I haven't let go of yet then I use a

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.430 
I haven't let go of yet then I use a
round<00:00:44.430> comb<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.180> brush<00:00:45.210> over<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.960> under<00:00:46.289> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
round comb to brush over and under the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.410 
round comb to brush over and under the
bangs<00:00:46.649> shaping<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.550> hair<00:00:47.760> while<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.210> still

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
bangs shaping the hair while it's still

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.979 
bangs shaping the hair while it's still
