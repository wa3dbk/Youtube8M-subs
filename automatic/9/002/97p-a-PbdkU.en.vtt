00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
maintaining oom never would have

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.460 
maintaining oom never would have
thought<00:03:48.850> of<00:03:49.000> putting<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.360> stress<00:03:49.570> away<00:03:49.810> and<00:03:50.230> I

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
thought of putting the stress away and I

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.250 
thought of putting the stress away and I
think<00:03:51.070> chef<00:03:51.370> feels<00:03:52.060> very<00:03:52.420> relaxing<00:03:53.020> very

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
think chef feels very relaxing very

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.170 
think chef feels very relaxing very
different<00:03:53.710> than<00:03:53.830> the<00:03:53.920> last<00:03:54.100> one<00:03:54.430> so<00:03:55.000> I<00:03:55.030> guess

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
different than the last one so I guess

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.030 
different than the last one so I guess
depending<00:03:55.360> on<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:55.990> mood<00:03:56.200> you're<00:03:56.500> going<00:03:56.770> for
