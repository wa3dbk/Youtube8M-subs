of<00:00:42.120> all<00:00:42.210> LCD<00:00:43.020> versus<00:00:43.290> plasma<00:00:43.590> two<00:00:43.710> different

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
of all LCD versus plasma two different

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.770 
of all LCD versus plasma two different
technologies<00:00:44.460> yeah<00:00:44.760> now<00:00:45.239> what<00:00:45.510> about<00:00:45.600> this

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
technologies yeah now what about this

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.590 
technologies yeah now what about this
LED<00:00:46.260> tail<00:00:46.440> technics<00:00:46.980> TV<00:00:47.640> thing<00:00:47.940> well<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.540> will

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
LED tail technics TV thing well it will

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.380 
LED tail technics TV thing well it will
LED<00:00:49.110> it's<00:00:49.350> actually<00:00:49.800> as<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.280> subcategory<00:00:50.880> of<00:00:51.270> an

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
LED it's actually as a subcategory of an

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.770 
LED it's actually as a subcategory of an
LCD<00:00:51.810> because<00:00:52.680> an<00:00:53.250> LCD<00:00:53.700> generates<00:00:54.660> its

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
LCD because an LCD generates its

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.990 
LCD because an LCD generates its
pictures<00:00:55.200> through<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.470> back<00:00:55.740> light<00:00:56.070> behind<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
pictures through a back light behind the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.210 
pictures through a back light behind the
screen<00:00:57.330> right<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:57.990> always<00:00:58.410> done<00:00:58.620> with<00:00:58.740> LEDs

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
screen right and always done with LEDs

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.480 
screen right and always done with LEDs
instead<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.790> using<00:00:59.970> a<00:01:00.890> ccfl<00:01:01.890> which<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.310> like<00:01:02.460> a

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:02.490 
instead of using a ccfl which is like a

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.189 
instead of using a ccfl which is like a
fluorescent<00:01:03.150> tube<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.600> your<00:01:03.720> senior<00:01:04.079> an

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
fluorescent tube and your senior an

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.410 
fluorescent tube and your senior an
office<00:01:04.500> or<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.739> basement<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.070> your<00:01:05.220> home

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
office or in the basement of your home

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.480 
office or in the basement of your home
replace<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.600> with<00:01:06.720> LED<00:01:07.170> bulbs<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.950> that's<00:01:08.340> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
replace it with LED bulbs and that's the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.789 
replace it with LED bulbs and that's the
only<00:01:08.670> difference<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.689> technology<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.470> TV

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
only difference so the technology the TV

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.649 
only difference so the technology the TV
hasn't<00:01:11.340> changed<00:01:11.880> much<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.180> just<00:01:12.329> how<00:01:12.600> you

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
hasn't changed much it's just how you

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.719 
hasn't changed much it's just how you
light<00:01:13.079> up<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.439> back<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.130> LEDs<00:01:14.579> of

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
light up the back of it so LEDs of

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.010 
light up the back of it so LEDs of
different<00:01:14.970> kind<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.119> televisions<00:01:15.540> just<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.780> new

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
different kind of televisions just a new

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.560 
different kind of televisions just a new
type<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.290> LCD<00:01:17.000> exactly<00:01:18.000> that's<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.270> limit

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
type of LCD exactly that's the limit

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.120 
type of LCD exactly that's the limit
okay<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:19.170> why<00:01:19.380> are<00:01:19.439> we<00:01:19.530> getting<00:01:19.620> computers

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
okay so why are we getting computers

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.469 
okay so why are we getting computers
there's<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.580> lot<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.760> noise<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
there's a lot of noise in the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.060 
there's a lot of noise in the
marketplace<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.050> think<00:01:22.229> right<00:01:22.590> all<00:01:22.800> right<00:01:22.920> good

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
marketplace I think right all right good

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.100 
marketplace I think right all right good
so<00:01:23.490> other<00:01:24.060> buzzwords<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.630> people<00:01:24.870> may<00:01:24.960> run

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
so other buzzwords that people may run

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.170 
so other buzzwords that people may run
into<00:01:25.140> we're<00:01:25.770> gonna<00:01:25.950> come<00:01:26.130> across<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.729> local

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
into we're gonna come across a local

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.149 
into we're gonna come across a local
dimming<00:01:27.360> local<00:01:28.050> government<00:01:28.320> yeah<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:28.680> an<00:01:28.860> edge

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
dimming local government yeah so an edge

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.630 
dimming local government yeah so an edge
lighting<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:30.060> there's<00:01:30.659> two<00:01:30.810> ways<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.020> approach

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
lighting so there's two ways to approach

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.360 
lighting so there's two ways to approach
LCD<00:01:32.640> or<00:01:32.670> LED<00:01:33.080> televisions<00:01:34.080> and<00:01:34.200> edge<00:01:34.890> lighting

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370 
LCD or LED televisions and edge lighting

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.399 
LCD or LED televisions and edge lighting
is<00:01:35.700> where<00:01:35.940> you<00:01:36.090> have<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.479> light<00:01:36.720> source<00:01:37.049> with

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
is where you have the light source with

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.520 
is where you have the light source with
a<00:01:37.440> backlighting<00:01:38.100> on<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.150> top<00:01:39.570> or<00:01:39.900> bottom<00:01:40.229> or

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
a backlighting on the top or bottom or

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.580 
a backlighting on the top or bottom or
the<00:01:40.590> sides<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.670> create<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.720> image<00:01:43.020> behind<00:01:43.260> the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
the sides to create the image behind the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.090 
the sides to create the image behind the
screen<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.760> other<00:01:44.880> way<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.090> approach<00:01:45.510> it

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
screen the other way to approach it

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.590 
screen the other way to approach it
unfortunately<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.220> approach<00:01:47.970> has<00:01:48.270> some

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
unfortunately that approach has some

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.750 
unfortunately that approach has some
challenges<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:50.159> may<00:01:50.340> not<00:01:50.549> give<00:01:50.729> you

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
challenges in that it may not give you

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.370 
challenges in that it may not give you
the<00:01:50.850> intense

sales<00:01:55.039> going<00:01:55.189> to<00:01:55.280> be<00:01:55.340> uneven<00:01:55.820> perhaps<00:01:56.119> right

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
sales going to be uneven perhaps right

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:57.580 
sales going to be uneven perhaps right
there's<00:01:56.659> been<00:01:56.780> largest<00:01:57.140> it<00:01:57.229> now<00:01:57.320> there's<00:01:57.560> a

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
there's been largest it now there's a

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.100 
there's been largest it now there's a
lot<00:01:57.740> of<00:01:57.770> a<00:01:57.890> lot<00:01:58.729> of<00:01:58.820> innovation<00:01:59.390> to<00:01:59.630> really

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
lot of a lot of innovation to really

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.569 
lot of a lot of innovation to really
make<00:02:00.289> sure<00:02:00.470> that<00:02:00.500> that<00:02:00.680> intensity<00:02:01.250> is<00:02:01.430> as

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
make sure that that intensity is as

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.520 
make sure that that intensity is as
equal<00:02:01.970> to<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.180> center<00:02:02.479> of<00:02:02.509> the<00:02:02.630> screen<00:02:02.810> as<00:02:03.110> it

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
equal to the center of the screen as it

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.499 
equal to the center of the screen as it
is<00:02:03.619> on<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:03.799> edges<00:02:04.130> right<00:02:04.429> but<00:02:05.030> to<00:02:05.179> take<00:02:05.299> it<00:02:05.450> to

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
is on the edges right but to take it to

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.600 
is on the edges right but to take it to
one<00:02:05.659> step<00:02:05.899> further<00:02:06.460> manufacturers<00:02:07.460> have

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
one step further manufacturers have

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.520 
one step further manufacturers have
introduced<00:02:08.060> local<00:02:08.420> dimming<00:02:08.599> and<00:02:08.929> what<00:02:09.410> you've

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
introduced local dimming and what you've

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.170 
introduced local dimming and what you've
done<00:02:09.709> now<00:02:09.950> is<00:02:09.979> you<00:02:10.250> taking<00:02:10.489> the<00:02:10.640> screen<00:02:10.970> and

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
done now is you taking the screen and

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.170 
done now is you taking the screen and
you<00:02:11.599> divide<00:02:11.930> it<00:02:11.989> up<00:02:12.319> the<00:02:12.500> screen<00:02:12.800> into<00:02:13.430> sectors

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
you divide it up the screen into sectors

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.320 
you divide it up the screen into sectors
or<00:02:14.720> blocks<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.620> then<00:02:16.130> you<00:02:16.310> infuse<00:02:17.030> them<00:02:17.300> with

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
or blocks and then you infuse them with

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.309 
or blocks and then you infuse them with
LED<00:02:18.190> sources<00:02:19.190> so<00:02:19.760> now<00:02:19.910> it's<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.630> can<00:02:20.720> do<00:02:20.870> local

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
LED sources so now it's you can do local

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.580 
LED sources so now it's you can do local
dimming<00:02:21.560> so<00:02:21.890> for<00:02:22.040> example<00:02:22.099> like<00:02:22.459> a<00:02:22.610> film<00:02:23.090> like

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
dimming so for example like a film like

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.990 
dimming so for example like a film like
nightmare<00:02:24.590> before<00:02:24.860> christmas<00:02:25.310> or<00:02:25.459> sin<00:02:25.700> city

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
nightmare before christmas or sin city

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.240 
nightmare before christmas or sin city
or<00:02:26.269> the<00:02:26.299> director's<00:02:26.780> cut<00:02:27.019> of<00:02:27.049> Blade<00:02:27.530> Runner<00:02:27.890> a

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
or the director's cut of Blade Runner a

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.120 
or the director's cut of Blade Runner a
lot<00:02:28.670> of<00:02:28.849> dark<00:02:29.060> scenes<00:02:29.450> where<00:02:30.410> it's<00:02:30.739> going<00:02:31.069> to

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
lot of dark scenes where it's going to

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.680 
lot of dark scenes where it's going to
be<00:02:31.250> challenged<00:02:31.880> to<00:02:32.000> be<00:02:32.090> able<00:02:32.239> to<00:02:32.299> produce<00:02:32.420> a

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
be challenged to be able to produce a

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.380 
be challenged to be able to produce a
true<00:02:33.080> black<00:02:33.349> but<00:02:34.250> now<00:02:34.400> with<00:02:34.610> local<00:02:34.910> dimming<00:02:35.060> is

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
true black but now with local dimming is

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.270 
true black but now with local dimming is
that<00:02:35.540> regions<00:02:36.140> of<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.440> screen<00:02:36.980> could

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
that regions of the screen could

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.580 
that regions of the screen could
actually<00:02:37.459> dim<00:02:37.910> or<00:02:38.120> shut<00:02:38.390> off<00:02:38.420> to<00:02:39.140> give<00:02:39.380> you

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
actually dim or shut off to give you

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.990 
actually dim or shut off to give you
that<00:02:39.890> black<00:02:40.130> color<00:02:40.430> that<00:02:40.610> you're<00:02:40.730> looking<00:02:40.819> for

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
that black color that you're looking for

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.740 
that black color that you're looking for
good<00:02:41.660> okay<00:02:41.900> go<00:02:42.080> like<00:02:42.260> I<00:02:42.349> get<00:02:42.620> that<00:02:42.769> now<00:02:42.829> now

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
good okay go like I get that now now

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.400 
good okay go like I get that now now
anything<00:02:44.750> else<00:02:44.900> that<00:02:45.049> we<00:02:45.110> should<00:02:45.260> know<00:02:45.380> about

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
anything else that we should know about

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.620 
anything else that we should know about
well<00:02:45.980> right<00:02:46.370> now<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.670> next<00:02:47.239> thing<00:02:47.360> going<00:02:47.510> to

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
well right now the next thing going to

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.089 
well right now the next thing going to
hear<00:02:47.810> about<00:02:47.900> they<00:02:48.170> locate<00:02:48.500> is<00:02:48.620> local<00:02:48.920> dimming

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
hear about they locate is local dimming

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.069 
hear about they locate is local dimming
so<00:02:49.549> this<00:02:49.700> edge<00:02:49.910> lighting<00:02:50.209> is<00:02:50.540> local<00:02:50.900> dimming

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
so this edge lighting is local dimming

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.920 
so this edge lighting is local dimming
and<00:02:51.349> then<00:02:51.709> there's<00:02:51.950> full<00:02:52.280> array<00:02:52.610> and<00:02:52.970> full

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
and then there's full array and full

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.259 
and then there's full array and full
array<00:02:54.290> what<00:02:55.099> happens<00:02:55.430> there<00:02:55.579> is<00:02:55.700> you<00:02:55.850> have<00:02:56.030> the

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
array what happens there is you have the

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.319 
array what happens there is you have the
entire<00:02:56.660> back<00:02:57.230> panel<00:02:57.530> yeah<00:02:58.069> it's<00:02:58.329> completely

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
entire back panel yeah it's completely

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.099 
entire back panel yeah it's completely
covered<00:02:59.920> empowered<00:03:00.920> by<00:03:01.220> LED<00:03:01.790> bulbs<00:03:02.299> not<00:03:02.840> just

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
covered empowered by LED bulbs not just

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:06.640 
covered empowered by LED bulbs not just
in<00:03:03.260> regions<00:03:03.799> ok<00:03:04.280> so<00:03:04.609> for<00:03:05.510> LG<00:03:05.900> you<00:03:06.079> have<00:03:06.319> edge

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
in regions ok so for LG you have edge

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.250 
in regions ok so for LG you have edge
lighting<00:03:06.980> you<00:03:07.609> have<00:03:07.880> a<00:03:08.180> local<00:03:08.540> dimming<00:03:08.870> where

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
lighting you have a local dimming where

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.990 
lighting you have a local dimming where
you<00:03:09.410> have<00:03:10.389> 16<00:03:11.389> regions<00:03:12.079> but<00:03:12.620> on<00:03:12.829> ours<00:03:13.190> are<00:03:13.549> top

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
you have 16 regions but on ours are top

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.879 
you have 16 regions but on ours are top
of<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.180> line<00:03:14.389> series<00:03:15.049> you<00:03:15.620> have<00:03:16.269> 240<00:03:17.889> packages

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
of the line series you have 240 packages

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:21.490 
of the line series you have 240 packages
of<00:03:19.069> LED<00:03:19.549> bulbs<00:03:20.060> which<00:03:20.480> gives<00:03:20.720> you<00:03:20.840> precision

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
of LED bulbs which gives you precision

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.410 
of LED bulbs which gives you precision
control<00:03:21.950> and<00:03:22.160> that<00:03:22.220> greater<00:03:22.519> accuracy<00:03:22.970> of

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
control and that greater accuracy of

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.990 
control and that greater accuracy of
color<00:03:23.900> reproduction<00:03:24.560> right<00:03:24.889> and<00:03:25.250> then<00:03:25.609> let's

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
color reproduction right and then let's

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.640 
color reproduction right and then let's
just<00:03:26.120> talk<00:03:26.269> very<00:03:26.480> briefly<00:03:26.569> about<00:03:26.870> 3d<00:03:27.380> has<00:03:27.470> been

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
just talk very briefly about 3d has been

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.020 
just talk very briefly about 3d has been
a<00:03:27.680> lot<00:03:27.799> of<00:03:27.859> talk<00:03:28.040> about<00:03:28.069> 3d<00:03:28.430> television<00:03:28.850> right

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
a lot of talk about 3d television right

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.699 
a lot of talk about 3d television right
now<00:03:29.060> so<00:03:29.540> that's<00:03:29.690> yet<00:03:29.840> another<00:03:29.870> category

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
now so that's yet another category

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.920 
now so that's yet another category
because<00:03:30.920> i'm<00:03:31.100> guessing<00:03:31.459> the<00:03:31.639> 3d<00:03:32.329> technology

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
because i'm guessing the 3d technology

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.559 
because i'm guessing the 3d technology
isn't<00:03:33.109> is<00:03:33.380> a<00:03:33.440> plasma<00:03:33.889> or<00:03:34.250> LCD<00:03:34.400> or<00:03:34.639> is<00:03:34.910> it<00:03:35.060> well

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
isn't is a plasma or LCD or is it well

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.400 
isn't is a plasma or LCD or is it well
3d<00:03:36.109> can<00:03:36.290> be<00:03:36.380> applied<00:03:36.650> to<00:03:36.980> both<00:03:37.160> plasma<00:03:37.880> and<00:03:38.030> LCD

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
3d can be applied to both plasma and LCD

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
excitement with avatar as a lot of

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.349 
excitement with avatar as a lot of
questions<00:03:43.430> that<00:03:43.519> that<00:03:43.790> film<00:03:44.090> was<00:03:44.269> released

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
questions that that film was released

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:47.080 
questions that that film was released
later<00:03:44.870> maybe<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:45.889> buzz<00:03:46.100> may<00:03:46.549> not<00:03:46.760> be<00:03:46.970> as

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
later maybe the buzz may not be as

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.879 
later maybe the buzz may not be as
intense<00:03:47.450> right<00:03:47.720> now<00:03:47.750> as<00:03:48.019> it<00:03:48.109> is<00:03:48.170> right<00:03:48.410> now<00:03:48.470> and

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889 
intense right now as it is right now and

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:50.949 
intense right now as it is right now and
you<00:03:49.430> know<00:03:49.519> what<00:03:49.700> we're<00:03:49.819> seeing<00:03:50.030> is<00:03:50.299> with<00:03:50.510> 3d

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
you know what we're seeing is with 3d

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.000 
you know what we're seeing is with 3d
it's<00:03:51.260> about<00:03:51.620> that<00:03:51.950> experience

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
it's about that experience

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.280 
it's about that experience
about<00:03:53.400> experience<00:03:54.090> and<00:03:54.330> there's<00:03:54.900> two<00:03:55.080> ways<00:03:55.230> to

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
about experience and there's two ways to

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.949 
about experience and there's two ways to
approach<00:03:55.650> it<00:03:55.950> active<00:03:56.519> or<00:03:56.790> passive<00:03:56.819> okay<00:03:57.720> and

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
approach it active or passive okay and

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.809 
approach it active or passive okay and
with<00:03:58.379> passive<00:03:59.069> what<00:03:59.310> you're<00:03:59.430> going<00:03:59.549> to<00:03:59.610> see<00:03:59.790> on

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
with passive what you're going to see on

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.119 
with passive what you're going to see on
the<00:04:00.000> screen<00:04:00.150> is<00:04:00.480> that<00:04:00.629> double<00:04:01.019> image<00:04:01.379> so<00:04:01.920> back

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
the screen is that double image so back

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.580 
the screen is that double image so back
in<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.400> day<00:04:02.549> with<00:04:02.760> those<00:04:02.970> red<00:04:03.209> and<00:04:03.659> red<00:04:03.780> blue

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
in the day with those red and red blue

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.380 
in the day with those red and red blue
yeah<00:04:05.040> back<00:04:05.280> in<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.519> theaters<00:04:05.909> that's

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
yeah back in the theaters that's

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.309 
yeah back in the theaters that's
assuming<00:04:06.720> you're<00:04:06.810> going<00:04:06.930> to<00:04:06.989> see<00:04:07.049> two<00:04:07.290> images

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
assuming you're going to see two images

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.490 
assuming you're going to see two images
being<00:04:08.159> presented<00:04:08.790> and<00:04:09.120> and<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:09.840> lenses<00:04:10.290> are

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
being presented and and the lenses are

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.740 
being presented and and the lenses are
just<00:04:10.709> polarized<00:04:11.280> so<00:04:12.060> that<00:04:12.209> now<00:04:12.390> you're<00:04:12.599> going

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
just polarized so that now you're going

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.780 
just polarized so that now you're going
to<00:04:12.810> see<00:04:12.930> to<00:04:13.110> a<00:04:13.230> left<00:04:13.560> and<00:04:13.769> right<00:04:14.010> and<00:04:14.220> in<00:04:14.670> the

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
to see to a left and right and in the

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.090 
to see to a left and right and in the
brain<00:04:15.030> it<00:04:15.450> comes<00:04:15.780> together<00:04:15.900> and<00:04:16.440> now<00:04:16.799> you<00:04:16.859> had

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
brain it comes together and now you had

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.189 
brain it comes together and now you had
that<00:04:17.250> sense<00:04:17.430> of<00:04:17.579> depth<00:04:17.880> in<00:04:18.120> motion<00:04:18.570> so<00:04:18.930> the

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
that sense of depth in motion so the

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:21.170 
that sense of depth in motion so the
glasses<00:04:19.560> these<00:04:19.650> days<00:04:19.889> are<00:04:20.160> polarized<00:04:20.850> meeting

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
glasses these days are polarized meeting

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.909 
glasses these days are polarized meeting
like<00:04:21.630> sunglasses<00:04:21.840> I<00:04:22.229> guess<00:04:22.410> right<00:04:22.620> right

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
like sunglasses I guess right right

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.610 
like sunglasses I guess right right
exactly<00:04:23.160> so<00:04:23.880> in<00:04:24.270> this<00:04:24.510> sense<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:25.199> advantage

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
exactly so in this sense the advantage

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.310 
exactly so in this sense the advantage
here<00:04:25.919> is<00:04:26.060> the<00:04:27.060> cost<00:04:27.389> of<00:04:27.660> those<00:04:27.810> paths<00:04:28.110> of

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
here is the cost of those paths of

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.260 
here is the cost of those paths of
glasses<00:04:28.919> are<00:04:29.070> very<00:04:29.370> affordable<00:04:29.760> we're

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
glasses are very affordable we're

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.810 
glasses are very affordable we're
looking<00:04:30.600> at<00:04:30.780> probably<00:04:31.410> to<00:04:31.740> a<00:04:32.100> dollar<00:04:32.340> to<00:04:32.669> two

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
looking at probably to a dollar to two

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.879 
looking at probably to a dollar to two
dollars<00:04:33.210> and<00:04:33.389> costs<00:04:33.930> right<00:04:34.139> to<00:04:34.350> produce<00:04:34.530> these

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
dollars and costs right to produce these

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.760 
dollars and costs right to produce these
on<00:04:35.789> the<00:04:35.970> other<00:04:36.120> side<00:04:36.419> you<00:04:36.720> have<00:04:36.870> active<00:04:37.440> active

produced on the screen but the lenses

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:46.279 
produced on the screen but the lenses
are<00:04:44.250> called<00:04:44.490> shutter<00:04:44.880> lenses<00:04:45.419> and<00:04:45.660> they
