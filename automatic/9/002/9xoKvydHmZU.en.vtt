00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
but he should absolutely batter him but

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.190 
but he should absolutely batter him but
then<00:01:43.829> again<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.310> think<00:01:44.610> well<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.299> WWE<00:01:45.810> so

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
then again you think well this is WWE so

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.600 
then again you think well this is WWE so
I<00:01:46.470> don't<00:01:47.159> think<00:01:47.220> it's<00:01:47.340> going<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.549> be

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
I don't think it's going to be

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.730 
I don't think it's going to be
straightforward<00:01:48.360> as<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.899> think<00:01:49.619> there's

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
straightforward as that I think there's

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.899 
straightforward as that I think there's
going<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.920> be<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.040> little<00:01:50.189> twist<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.700> turn<00:01:50.880> and

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
going to be a little twist and turn and

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.719 
going to be a little twist and turn and
if<00:01:51.240> he<00:01:51.329> lays<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> finger<00:01:51.869> on<00:01:52.130> jaan<00:01:53.130> liya<00:01:53.250> John

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
if he lays a finger on jaan liya John

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.370 
if he lays a finger on jaan liya John

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
if they're gonna put John Laurinaitis

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.460 
if they're gonna put John Laurinaitis
one<00:02:25.040> of<00:02:25.099> those<00:02:25.190> things<00:02:25.340> again<00:02:25.670> but<00:02:25.970> I<00:02:26.470> don't

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
one of those things again but I don't

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.660 
one of those things again but I don't
know<00:02:27.640> but<00:02:28.640> one<00:02:28.849> thing<00:02:29.150> i<00:02:30.010> strongly<00:02:31.010> think<00:02:31.220> will

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
know but one thing i strongly think will

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.710 
know but one thing i strongly think will
happen<00:02:31.849> is<00:02:32.239> because<00:02:33.069> Brock<00:02:34.069> Lesnar<00:02:34.760> has<00:02:34.970> quit

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
happen is because Brock Lesnar has quit

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.009 
happen is because Brock Lesnar has quit
WWE<00:02:36.470> after<00:02:37.310> he<00:02:37.489> lost<00:02:37.730> to<00:02:38.420> seeing<00:02:38.659> it<00:02:38.780> in<00:02:38.870> the

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
WWE after he lost to seeing it in the

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.110 
WWE after he lost to seeing it in the
previous<00:02:39.500> pay-per-view<00:02:40.069> I<00:02:40.599> reckon<00:02:41.599> John<00:02:42.560> Cena

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
previous pay-per-view I reckon John Cena

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.240 
previous pay-per-view I reckon John Cena
not<00:02:44.120> John<00:02:44.329> Cena<00:02:44.540> Brock<00:02:44.780> Lesnar<00:02:45.230> will<00:02:45.560> jump

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
not John Cena Brock Lesnar will jump

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.770 
not John Cena Brock Lesnar will jump
over<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.489> barriers<00:02:46.849> and<00:02:47.000> get<00:02:47.239> involved<00:02:47.690> in

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
over the barriers and get involved in

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.740 
over the barriers and get involved in
this<00:02:47.900> match<00:02:48.140> for<00:02:48.410> sure<00:02:48.530> because<00:02:49.510> they<00:02:50.510> said

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
this match for sure because they said

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.020 
this match for sure because they said
that<00:02:50.780> anyone<00:02:51.319> any<00:02:51.859> WWE<00:02:52.549> superstar<00:02:52.910> who

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
that anyone any WWE superstar who

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.430 
that anyone any WWE superstar who
interferes<00:02:53.599> the<00:02:53.750> ring<00:02:53.900> will<00:02:54.079> be<00:02:54.109> immediately

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
interferes the ring will be immediately

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.789 
interferes the ring will be immediately
terminated<00:02:54.920> where's<00:02:55.760> Brock<00:02:56.060> Lesnar<00:02:56.799> he's

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
terminated where's Brock Lesnar he's

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.160 
terminated where's Brock Lesnar he's
quite<00:02:58.489> a<00:02:58.519> bit<00:02:58.700> early<00:02:58.879> so<00:02:58.909> he<00:02:59.239> can<00:02:59.510> I<00:02:59.720> guess

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
quite a bit early so he can I guess

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.360 
quite a bit early so he can I guess
because<00:03:00.379> he<00:03:00.530> could<00:03:00.650> do<00:03:00.769> whatever<00:03:00.950> he<00:03:01.040> wants

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
because he could do whatever he wants

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.030 
because he could do whatever he wants
now<00:03:01.549> so<00:03:02.239> he<00:03:02.480> won't<00:03:02.659> get<00:03:02.900> fired<00:03:03.170> and<00:03:03.500> that's

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
now so he won't get fired and that's

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.149 
now so he won't get fired and that's
where<00:03:04.220> he<00:03:04.400> will<00:03:04.519> come<00:03:04.700> in<00:03:04.849> I<00:03:05.709> think<00:03:06.709> John<00:03:06.920> Cena

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:07.159 
where he will come in I think John Cena

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:08.979 
where he will come in I think John Cena
will<00:03:07.250> win<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.519> match<00:03:07.670> Brock<00:03:08.390> laser<00:03:08.629> will<00:03:08.840> come
