00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:11.360
 In this video 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:12.530
 Explanation and demonstration of how to launch the application with mac 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.340
 Do 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:22.780
 There are three ways to get started 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:28.930
 The most standard way is by clicking on the finder in the lower left corner of the screen 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:35.380
 Select an application and double-click the program you want to start 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:40.060
 Basic to you is the best be displayed by 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.290
 For example, it is slightly lower left than the middle of the screen 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.360
 safari 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:47.030
 I will try to launch this 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:50.770
 Since it is a double-click and with pom-poms 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.240
 Doing so will start safari 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:59.110
 It's important is 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:01:03.340
 The dog at the bottom of the screen is a part of the safari at the lock 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:09.490
 The point where a little electricity is on is the point 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:12.480
 It is a dog at the bottom of the screen but all applications are displayed here 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.480
 It does not have 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:22.229
 There are many programs in the application folder 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:24.710
 In ne This program is each everyone's Mac 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:29.930
 A Depending on the 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:35.360
 The installed program is different 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:38.900
 Please Oite and is holding that does not mean that exactly the same as the screen because 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.840
 Here is the point but it is the first time now 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:46.290
 Start the safari 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.700
 It is also possible to start other programs at once 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.750
 For example 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.750
 Well, let's start the application per map 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.430
 Also map at the bottom of it in the dog is starting 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.430
 It comes with electricity 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.860
 The program which is not in the dog 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:14.110
 Launch chess 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.110
 It is in this way when you start a chess 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:23.780
 Right side of the dock 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:27.680
 To the right of the lock is the chess program icon 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:32.310
 Though it is how to switch 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:37.980
 I think the easiest to switch in the box 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:39.650
 In the future I will try to switch to using mission control 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:45.620
 I think 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:47.269
 The basic fact that Na or Well easiest is that switched in this dog is to 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:54.769
 I will add 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:55.909
 As an applied version , put the program that you use often in this dog and send it for swimming 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.580
 Erika was 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:00.120
 This is the most Well 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.629
 I feel good 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:11.190
 From the application of the finder 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:13.049
 Who left button to drag the program that he wants actually use between Gu' and Dog 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:17.120
 It's to that Rutteyuu placed in 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.120
 It will not move such Fu anti-now 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.360
 To overlap internal use 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:28.430
 to place 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:35.530
 I have put the software of movie editing called imob 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:38.790
 Well then, I wonder if you use the left button king of the twitter 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:43.020
 I put it in the dog 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:47.250
 It is easy by doing this 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:52.140
 It will be possible to launch the program from the dock 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.010
 The point is, this is a program you use for yourself 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:58.670
 eh 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:02.840
 When the application as soon as it is children if to leave the drag from the place of 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:07.010
 Please hold down what you say next 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:12.410
 You have anywhere from the hole way when no longer needed 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:13.300
 If you think that you don't use imb, keep pressing the left button 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.760
 a 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:21.310
 Right below the arrow 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:24.980
 Bit When you release the hand where the flame and Kana dust like a mark out 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:28.160
 Let's erase the disappearing Twitter 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:33.040
 Boie from where or 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:39.910
 You can add or delete 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:43.390
 In the new that Macs here in recent Macs right after this finder right now 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:49.490
 There is now, but there is a launchpad 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:58.660
 To be selected this Accordingly, as of iphone and ipad 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:05:03.360
 By a he or she once this select the program you want to call want to launch 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.360
 It will be possible to start 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:19.400
 So the way to start the program is three big one is the application of the finder 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:27.500
 How to call select the black grab you want to launch from 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:33.760
 How to say Another is to start the program you want to start their own from the venom 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:38.030
 Lastly, one more thing is that I use the function launchpad. 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:42.590
 How to choose the program you want to start 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:43.990
 Add that you can switch pages by dragging where there is nothing 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:47.020
 I will 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:54.960
 And in today's video 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:54.960
 I will put this mission control in the special zone in one of the courses 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:02.430
 This mission control is a convenient program to switch programs 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:12.700
 For example, finally I will explain the application one more time 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:15.490
 It's a mission control, so the desktop is just out 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.300
 In the stomach is the left side of the screen 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:23.930
 Dashboard 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:25.780
 Although this is it's a screen of a collection of small program application 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:29.930
 It is Toka Calculator 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:31.770
 It is also possible to switch to such 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:37.440
 Also the keyboard 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:44.160
 f 3 Use this to go to the desktop 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:48.560
 You can also go to the dashboard, and it's 4 or 4 too , put it on the track card 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.560
 By the drag Te 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:53.630
 You can switch to the dashboard 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:07:07.300
 If I choose my child's order board + I will put the stock price 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:10.969
 On the contrary, I would like to close the stock by pressing the minus button 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:15.520
 It is also possible that said: 

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:21.169
 The application is in addition to the program in the dog 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:26.639
 The fact that there is a program in the dashboard is also a big feature of Mac 

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:29.780
 In this video we explained how to launch the application 

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:32.710
 This concludes this video 

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.710
 Thank you very much
