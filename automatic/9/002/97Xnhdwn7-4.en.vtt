 Let's stay here quickly. 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:55.350

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.870

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.250
 question 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:04.440
 we consider captains of sand at the 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.959
 The same question Frames Book was 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:11.069
 written by jorge amado captains of 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:13.950
 Good sand, remember if I forgot to speak. 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:18.209
 This has to remind you that you can not click 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:21.239
 in continuing on the question you mistake 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:25.200
 You have to keep asking who 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:32.190
 you hit with click Continue 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:34.380
 Okay, Agile, a roulette, she's not black. 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:39.210
 she continues the same way 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.990
 you can take the question that erred the 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.380
 attack 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.590
 You will click Continue and not 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.450
 missed the question why did you 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:59.280
 hit there and clicked continue on 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:05:02.010
 The right question, let's turn king again 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.200
 looks just plays I wanted to serve a stick 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:07.050
 until falling into the river 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:11.490
 but it will not be necessary if you come 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:13.130
 here again the same thing will happen in the 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:21.210
 Poland 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:23.960

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:33.950

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.950
 We already know. 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:46.020
 yes hitting the frog is the same process 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:48.150
 Do not change anything, you'll make a mistake. 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.000
 continue you do not click continue 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.430
 You go there in the other browser but 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.229
 remember that the browser has to 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:06:01.410
 being with the same game has to be half 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:06:04.530
 of a roulette understood I will say here d 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:06.510

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.800
 for example when it appears 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:18.599

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:20.879

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:44.190
