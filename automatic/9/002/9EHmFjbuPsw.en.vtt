 ok carnal you do not have to disconnect the 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.700
 your console's internet you have to pull 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.080
 the cable remove the cable so that 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.760
 time that you take out the cable is going to 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.560
 lead directly to what is the mode 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.050
 story when we're in the mode of 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.700
 history we are going to load the game that 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.020
 we keep as you can see here 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.090
 we appeared with maikel that is 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.369
 grabbing her buttocks to her old that all 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.700
 mother ok let's load the game 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:36.240
 we load the game that will take us 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.590
 where are we with the car we want 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.330
 bring what is being gta online 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.520
 this is going to take a little bit ahead of him 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.800
 the advance advances you ok channels 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.960
 It takes a little while to load the game already 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.429
 when you appear with the car what 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.750
 let's do is reconnect what 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:54.840
 what's been on the internet 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.509
 ok let's login 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.280
 when indexes indexes and when 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.530
 connect to the internet and you are initiating 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.780
 session what we are going to do is 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.670
 just for example let's give it to 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.289
 the little arrow down and we will choose 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.140
 the character that will take us to the 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.670
 what is gta online ok now here is very 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.709
 very important what we are going to do is 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.930
 again to squash what's coming 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.670
 being the button and quickly pull the 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.650
 cable and put it back in as quickly 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.709
 that you can ok when doing cable and then you 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.480
 to put then then this is going to be and you 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.650
 you turn the button on there, this goes 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.150
 to be that it takes us to gta online 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.680
 ok channels will take us to people 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.510
 online if it takes you to the story mode not 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.370
 you got the trick you have to see what 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.530
 you have to try again if it takes you 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.180
 directly to what is online gta 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.510
 you already got the trick when you appear with 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.390
 your character will you realize that the 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.190
 car is in the same location where 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.540
 the station before that's the way it is in the 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.549
 same place where the station before 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.459
 Now what are we going to do just 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.900
 since you have the car in what is jeta 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.989
 online because we are in a game 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.420
 public what we are going to do is invite 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.310
 to a friend you are going to invite a friend 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.110
 so that he stays watching the car 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.599
 because if you leave the car only 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.970
 it disappears that's how you're going to leave a 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.190
 friend taking care of your car and you are going to ask 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.959
 to another friend who is in another session 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.510
 you are going to send a message to another friend who 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.280
 have you out there playing you will say 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.709

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.200
 rockstar 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.570
 when your friend invites you through the 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.160
 phone you're going to get in the car that you 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.190
 you want to replace in this case by 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:37.750
 example I'm going to replace this car 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:39.530
 I'm going to take out my phone and I'm going to put the 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.300
 activity that is sending me 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.550
 friend ok 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.890
 here at the same time I'm going to crush what 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:49.990
 which is the button to and the button 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:52.070
 to accelerate ok the button accept the the 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.210
 activity and the accelerate button to 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.850
 same time we are going to leave them 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.900
 squashed at the same time and what will 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.670
 happen then it will take us to the 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.900
 activity there you will find your friend 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.820
 as you can see here is my friend you 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.410
 We send a hello to the bastard and what 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.090
 we're going to do when you're getting to what 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.010
 which is going to be for example when you go 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.580
 going down when you're going to start the 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.260
 activity you have to cancel it ok as 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.980
 you can see here we are going down here 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.910
 cancel we cancel the activity 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.739
 Y 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.269
 this is going to happen good we give it to 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.510
 if we cancel if it is going to stay like this 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.860
 I know how I judged and what will happen 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.390
 is that he will return us to what is coming 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.190
 being our garage when we are in 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.490

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.860
