like an Advil or Tylenol or ibuprofen

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:12.570 
like an Advil or Tylenol or ibuprofen
something<00:06:09.039> like<00:06:09.669> that<00:06:09.969> the<00:06:10.389> lid<00:06:11.009> was<00:06:12.009> perfect

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
something like that the lid was perfect

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.990 
something like that the lid was perfect
scale<00:06:13.000> size<00:06:13.419> for<00:06:14.259> the<00:06:14.620> dog<00:06:14.860> and<00:06:15.189> the<00:06:15.550> dog<00:06:15.580> house

so<00:06:16.810> I<00:06:16.839> know<00:06:17.169> that<00:06:17.439> Gatorade<00:06:17.979> their<00:06:18.759> larger<00:06:19.650> was

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
so I know that Gatorade their larger was

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.990 
so I know that Gatorade their larger was
at<00:06:20.800> half<00:06:21.009> gallon<00:06:21.669> or<00:06:21.789> gallon<00:06:23.430> Powerade<00:06:24.430> they

like sodas and waters it's going to be

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:35.459 
like sodas and waters it's going to be
too<00:06:32.650> small<00:06:32.949> anyway<00:06:33.550> so<00:06:33.849> this<00:06:34.270> is<00:06:34.330> the<00:06:34.509> finished

00:06:35.459 --> 00:06:35.469
