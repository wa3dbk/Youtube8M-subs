00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:11.410
 my third week in opposite worlds 2 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.010
 the good truth as you will see we went back to 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.010
 hell 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.530
 half hard I thought I was going to take 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.410
 otherwise to get back to the 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:25.619
 hell was mentalized to continue in 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.410
 the paradise and others but good we had 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.200
 one more test because it can not compete 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.940
 because good me 15 that I have the desire 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.480
 to be fine and everything I think the 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.180
 hell is it is like the dark light the 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.120
 eat little in hygiene and a whole 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.220
 new day in those frictions that there are in 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.400
 the team out there I'm very close to 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.710
 artur and sometimes it hurts a lot 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.890
 attitudes that he takes he thinks is very 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.809
 cold to say things and like not 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.480
 he cares about generating divisions the only thing 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.000
 you think about it in fact 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.220
 and do justice on their own without 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.379
 mind hurting others and 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.170
 I think that also divided a bit the 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.530
 group this week with courage and the 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.530
 true 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:18.119
 I regretted telling him what I told him 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:20.280
 I said at the party I think you 're not one hundred 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.549
 aware of what I was doing 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.220
 I told him I asked him if there was water in 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.380
 the pool as saying 8tv you say that I 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.649
 you like it if you tell me that you also like 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.450
 of me and him on the part I think he played 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.789
 with me because he told me that if there was one 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.979
 sink when in fact the only thing that 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:41.890
 did in the week is to demonstrate everything 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.170
 otherwise that's a hello chao up 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.210
 including flirting with compaÃ±eras 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.299
 flirt with tamara compile 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.810
 and the truth is that in that sense I'm like 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.659
 very 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.049
 I do not feel very sentimental that I 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.670
 plays against many times then the 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.430
 I 'm really down because I do not 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.229
 I expected a person to be like that but 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.659
 now I check that nothing that is your 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.000
 personality the fact of flirting and 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.540
 others and try not to fish what 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.910
 directly I think valentino is not 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:19.489
 good match for me is not the kind of 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.489
 man that I would like to have next
