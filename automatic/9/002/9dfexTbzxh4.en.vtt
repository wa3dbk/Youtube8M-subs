 measure boat speed le 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.530
 depth of the sea the intensity and the 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.849
 Wind speeds have always been a 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.039
 obsession for sailors 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.900
 it is no coincidence that speed is measured 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.689
 in knots that were the ones that ran 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.640
 in the nostromo's hand the electronics has 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.410
 changed the rules of the game by making 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.420
 everything is infinitely easier 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.609
 sure of angie is one of the brands 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.849
 dynamic protagonist of this great 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.849
 change 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.020
 here we are finally in front of triton which ones 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.360
 are the strengths of this new one 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.920
 set of tools maybe this points 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.870
 ease of use are serious 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.840
 very simple user interface 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.120
 reliable color display 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.790
 extremely bright bond technology 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.140
 that allows you to paste the LCD on the 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.879
 display avoiding the mirror effect 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.840
 very simple interpretation of the commands 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.400
 and the display menu during the phase 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.619
 navigation everything you need 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.450
 to the shipowner simply this rate 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.550
 then it allows us to pass from here gene e 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.740
 in page and see information that 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.630
 were initially submitted to the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.700
 first switching on and then saving the 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.149
 tool for all other phases of 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.740
 navigation turning on the pages there 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:21.320
 show the various formations like this 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.509
 on the navigation page 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:28.200
 the user interface with the autopilot the 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.210
 analogue display in graphic version o 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.440
 however it is also possible to integrate the 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.530
 hand version of the series to ca 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.600
 three thousand the various form the maxi 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.570
 wind navigation information 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.729
 until you can reach the page again 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.729
 of is cosca di della cosca dai 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.640
 this is a cyclic menu so we do 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.690
 we can again scroll in 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.680
 all the chronological ways 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.020
 information we have seen 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.580
 previously up to the 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.310
 information that we really need 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.360
 without having to enter the submenu e 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.360
 therefore complicate our lives
