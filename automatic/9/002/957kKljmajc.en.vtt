00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.430

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.489
 when you see pace in são paulo 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.129

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.049
 In this store, this store is new in Brazil. 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.570
 She has been doing something for about a year. 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.909
 here is a little over a year I think 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.119
 I went to her as soon as she inaugurated it. 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.820
 had a single price of 5 and 90 now 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.700
 single price increased and any other 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.869
 ask and it's more or less so it's a store 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.619
 from $ 1 away from 99 with more things 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.080
 chics 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.340
 so it's different things then 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.380
 when you enter a store for $ 99 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.810
 real report all in 99 in some stores 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.240
 It's not all like that and there you go. 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.189
 buy just ask for that normal type thing 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.310
 There's nothing cuddly at all. 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:50.579
 cute in the store my things 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:53.009

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.890

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.180
 so not only for you companies 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:10.259
 What I did I bought a lot. 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.260
 from home and there people will show 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.480
 friends 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.810
 they ask ah yes but why you 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.640

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.760
 marry you 're doing shawl on 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.579
 This is not because some videos 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.069
 I make some cooking videos and I 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:30.409
 use the kitchen and the kitchen utensils 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.900
 my mother just wanted to understand that she 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:35.750
 turns out the pretty basic guys know nothing of the 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.379
 It's our type and pink is to draw dinho there. 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.840
 do you want 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:41.599
 and then I started to have an interest in buying 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.700
 a few different things to 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.659
 appear in the videos to be cute 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.549
 in the videos 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:48.980
 That's why I went to Shop 10 because 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.120
 knows that there were different things there 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.609
 a legal price 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.000
 then so are but most 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:58.940
 things there are things from home is from 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.329
 decoration like this and it's all very much 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:10.730
 cuddly okay so let's start I 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:16.280
 I bought this one I forgot the 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:18.169
 Name is happy people who say that 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.040
 is the hand beater but he has another 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:22.519
 name 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.370
 It's stainless steel up here and here. 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:29.599
 under silicone and it is honorable but 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.220
 It's 1971, we do not know and he's well. 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:35.900
 Beautiful, I'm buying almost everything. 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:38.810
 pink to use in the kitchen and it is very very 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.709
 You're the logical one, that 's what you 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.120
 they think that any other store does 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.940
 I found beautiful ground legal price because 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.419
 it was all for 12 3 reais a sickle and 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.419
 90 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.640
 It's all still making packaging that is 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.360
 everything new came out with a final price of 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.920
 week 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:12.010
 Oh, I bought this glass that is a 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:15.100
 cup actually shaped like a cone 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.200
 of ice cream is seeing that rose and it is 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.109
 able dessert has written I found it well 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.000
 legal to make a ascended recipe 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.900
 milkshake put an ice cream one 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.510
 roof 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.460
 So I decided to bring some 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.500
 cuddly and even to decorate the can 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.580
 put something in here in your 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.900
 room is not 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.900
 finally I thought it was cool 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.030
 this I found very cute when the 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.790
 milk I said as soon as I take it is a 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:52.780
 pizza cutter in heart shape 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:55.960
 so that's how you spend so pizza 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:59.320
 I have not tested it yet it is very very 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:05.560
 cuddly and and he got it cute 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:08.290
 I loved everything pink 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.910
 I bought the team too and the team is well. 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.550
 cool because sometimes you have some 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:15.520
 recipe so leave without eating or all 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:18.040
 in the oven fire is less five minutes 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.110
 tokyo or onion 40 minutes 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.240
 and if you spend that time your recipe 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:26.260
 it does not work and then sometimes you forget 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.150
 to set a time on your mobile phone does not 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:33.640
 Look, this is it, it's more or less. 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:36.310
 how stopwatch looks like a stopwatch 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.810
 you put here five minutes was there 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.320
 That will count five minutes. 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:43.740
 then when he does five minutes 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.210
 noise of waking the third class 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.600
 mpb 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:52.060
 so it does so it's better that you 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.890
 do not miss the right point of your 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.440
 recipe 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:06:00.070
 my last company in the iso store 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:02.400
 was a pot is picking up or if you have 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.050
 that carry pot or if you are 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.139
 It takes snacks somewhere. 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:10.190
 You of a little sweet cousin so then 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:13.650
 I bought a kettle from December before 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:15.780
 I I like few we do not strange the 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.690
 size of the food but not as 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.669
 planet but not with much food then 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:23.430
 it does not have to be a big thing 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:29.750
 she's like this, she's got this part of 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:29.750
 down and you put it here you want right? 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:39.330
 There is a part of the upper part that 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:42.720
 and the last part that gives you put 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:45.150
 fork or knife spoon do not know what you 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:48.630
 I want I found pretty cool because it cares 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:51.389
 it did not mix so it was really cool and so 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:54.330
 it's a cool track you can take 

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:56.669
 all apart and then you can 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.289
 put on the plate only food warmed 

00:06:56.669 --> 00:07:00.360
 microwave knows then everything stays 

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:03.570
 normal does not stay then the food everything 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:07.520
 mixed in the pot that I did not 

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:11.130
 I really like that, you did not do it then. 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:13.380

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:15.990
