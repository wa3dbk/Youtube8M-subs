00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 alarm 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:12.089
 hello how welcome you will be more here in the sights of the treaty to carry 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:14.210
 that the termination of this creature 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.980
 as laos to end today to vote to look with a brush with that think not any 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.789
 ahead in this case 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.970
 a synthetic hair brush 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.230
 let's work it with ink 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.880
 the brush 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.500
 caution not to stain clothes the only thing that takes the ink from the 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.630
 clothes is a scissor so let's try not to stain them and let's give them 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:37.290
 definition to drawing 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.400
 let's start with the outline of the face 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.400
 in that form 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.170
 all the outline let's random the ears 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.250
 From both sides 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.270
 let's do the nose where we go to 'xarla' finite in the bottom 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.870
 wider at the top 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.610
 we are going to mark him 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.770
 the part of the 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.750
 nostrils 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.460
 and we're going to mark the glasses 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.430
 what are we going to do 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.930
 let's read to circle first 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.420
 and then we're not going to paint 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.340
 a whole sector 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.660
 leaving him 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.700
 a shine that is the one that gives the feeling that it is 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.250
 in this case 1 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.960
 the same thing on the other side 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.550
 we mark first 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.160
 contour 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.090
 the body 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.700
 we mark him 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.030
 the space where it will have the brightness 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.030
 on both sides 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.030
 we mark the eyebrow that we are going to make one higher than the other 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.930
 is closer to the entity 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.980
 we are going to insinuate the wrinkles 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.570
 we are going to mark the contour of the face of the chin 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.230
 the mouth where we are going to lift more than one side of the other 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.019
 and to insinuate from the corners 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.729
 the neck 

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:14.729
 let's get out a shirt collar 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:18.519
 and in this way 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:19.779
 we have 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:21.299
 almost defined 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:22.629
 the caricature 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.980
 the time that predisposes you to be very important is very important 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.769
 time you dedicate to each of the jobs 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.980
 blind man knows that sometimes in three minutes 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.430
 impossible to be able 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.929
 say that all the things that are needed 

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:39.010
 but this and predisposition studied to anas 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.460
 it's useless it went well 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.730
 starting again in practice what we do a good cartoonist 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.439
 in practice it is fundamental between 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:50.450
 we follow it next here in the mines of the many
