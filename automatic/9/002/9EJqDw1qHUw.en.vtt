00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 here's what I did 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.649
 on to how to resolve in a 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.059
 morning in no time at all 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.620
 few products 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.790
 you saw that I used a 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.379
 eye shadow in cream an eyeliner and mascara 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.470
 strong lipstick so few products 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.970
 however the logically careful impact is 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.920
 maybe don't overdo it because otherwise 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.359
 ok a few products but the impact but you can 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:31.380
 be too so the right impact 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.059
 so a nice ryan air lapped lips there 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.550
 I say a make up that you really do 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.710
 very little time and I hope this 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.160

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.160

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.710

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.579
 foundation quest sad burls the brahms 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:55.640
 beige which is an opaque fluid is enough 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.640
 very little uses a flat brush 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.890
 very quickly 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:08.710
 to give you more 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.600
 rice uniformity that other but in 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.049
 In this case, however, she is not big 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:18.810
 defects to be covered therefore some 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:18.810
 we form the color of the face 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.530
 then as an environment I now go to 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.570

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.560

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:46.190
 interactive with hawkins magic I go to 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:50.000
 lay down with dedication from the center of the 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:53.200

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.200
 of the part goes 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.470
 let's go and tap the same moment 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:15.140

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.890

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.790
 very dark and let's just go to 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:38.110
 draw a line at the hairline 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.110

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:02.920
 with the same you've combined let's go 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.920
 at the base of the lower lashes 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.209
 only in the final part 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.040
 before all this dries up 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:27.630
 take an angled brush e 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:35.060

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:35.010

 cheekbone withdrawal to the temple or years 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.669
 80 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.130

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.130
 essen saint jean 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:55.470
 abound with mascara because anyway 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.360
 since it is a lot to do 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:03.260
