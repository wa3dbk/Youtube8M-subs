robotic nasai in the disc launcher but

robotic nasai in the disc launcher but
we'll<00:01:40.320> get<00:01:40.410> into<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.890> sec<00:01:41.450> another<00:01:42.450> pro

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
we'll get into that in a sec another pro

we'll get into that in a sec another pro
I<00:01:42.780> would<00:01:43.080> have<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.350> say<00:01:43.530> would<00:01:43.710> be<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.330> knees

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
I would have to say would be the knees

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.090 
I would have to say would be the knees
but<00:01:45.659> that's<00:01:45.900> pretty<00:01:46.170> standard<00:01:46.409> with<00:01:46.710> Titans

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
but that's pretty standard with Titans

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.670 
but that's pretty standard with Titans
you<00:01:47.220> expect<00:01:47.700> knees<00:01:48.140> now<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.200> pro<00:01:49.470> would

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
you expect knees now the pro would

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.980 
you expect knees now the pro would
probably<00:01:50.070> be<00:01:50.220> his<00:01:50.400> unique<00:01:50.700> design<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.540> lot<00:01:51.900> of

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
probably be his unique design a lot of

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
is no exception the build is extremely

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.180 
is no exception the build is extremely
enjoyable<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:58.050> there<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.320> lot<00:01:58.590> going<00:01:58.890> on<00:01:58.979> as

you can probably see here so it's

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.530 
you can probably see here so it's
definitely<00:02:02.490> new<00:02:02.820> unique<00:02:03.150> in<00:02:03.330> a<00:02:03.390> fun

move<00:02:26.370> his<00:02:26.580> head<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:28.700> chest<00:02:29.700> armor<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.120> guess<00:02:30.530> so

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
move his head and chest armor I guess so

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.890 
move his head and chest armor I guess so
that<00:02:32.190> moves<00:02:32.370> back<00:02:32.549> and<00:02:32.760> forth<00:02:32.850> then<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.480> has<00:02:33.780> an

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
that moves back and forth then it has an

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.870 
that moves back and forth then it has an
interesting<00:02:34.170> mix<00:02:34.709> of<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.190> gears<00:02:35.519> and<00:02:35.760> the

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
interesting mix of the gears and the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.720 
interesting mix of the gears and the
rubber<00:02:36.060> bands<00:02:36.360> which<00:02:36.570> I've<00:02:37.489> kind<00:02:38.489> of<00:02:38.580> seen

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
rubber bands which I've kind of seen

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.699 
rubber bands which I've kind of seen
before<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.209> barak<00:02:39.480> it's<00:02:39.720> interesting<00:02:40.170> it's<00:02:40.560> a

before the barak it's interesting it's a

so<00:03:11.800> probably<00:03:12.800> the<00:03:13.010> other<00:03:13.220> easy<00:03:14.180> to<00:03:14.450> figure<00:03:14.630> out

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
so probably the other easy to figure out

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.380 
so probably the other easy to figure out
pros<00:03:15.260> would<00:03:15.500> be<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.940> mobility<00:03:16.970> he<00:03:17.270> has

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
pros would be the mobility he has

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.120 
pros would be the mobility he has
standard<00:03:17.870> points<00:03:18.170> of<00:03:18.230> articulation<00:03:18.380> in<00:03:18.980> his

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
standard points of articulation in his

standard points of articulation in his

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
arms legs and head neck which is

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.770 
arms legs and head neck which is
standard<00:03:24.080> now<00:03:24.230> and<00:03:24.970> I'd<00:03:25.970> also<00:03:26.150> go<00:03:26.300> ahead<00:03:26.540> and

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
standard now and I'd also go ahead and

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.050 
standard now and I'd also go ahead and
say<00:03:26.959> that<00:03:26.989> another<00:03:27.380> pro<00:03:27.890> would<00:03:28.550> be<00:03:28.700> the<00:03:28.820> fact

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
say that another pro would be the fact

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.190 
say that another pro would be the fact
that<00:03:29.180> he<00:03:29.360> has<00:03:29.450> very<00:03:29.630> stable<00:03:29.959> footing<00:03:30.610> because

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
that he has very stable footing because

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.009 
that he has very stable footing because
the<00:03:33.200> foot<00:03:33.410> design<00:03:33.680> is<00:03:33.860> very<00:03:34.150> stable<00:03:35.150> because

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
the foot design is very stable because

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.650 
the foot design is very stable because
he<00:03:36.110> has<00:03:36.200> his<00:03:36.380> own<00:03:36.580> things<00:03:37.580> here<00:03:37.790> and<00:03:38.000> look<00:03:38.510> like

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
he has his own things here and look like

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.059 
he has his own things here and look like
I<00:03:38.690> made<00:03:38.900> a<00:03:38.930> styrofoam<00:03:40.030> so<00:03:41.170> I'd<00:03:42.170> say<00:03:42.470> that<00:03:42.500> that

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
I made a styrofoam so I'd say that that

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.059 
I made a styrofoam so I'd say that that
goes<00:03:43.250> through<00:03:43.459> the<00:03:43.550> pros<00:03:43.819> probably<00:03:44.709> the<00:03:45.709> brute

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
goes through the pros probably the brute

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.160 
goes through the pros probably the brute
look<00:03:46.400> was<00:03:46.730> very<00:03:46.940> well<00:03:47.150> done<00:03:47.360> he<00:03:47.989> has<00:03:48.140> a

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
look was very well done he has a

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.140 
look was very well done he has a
mechanical<00:03:48.380> eye<00:03:48.980> which<00:03:49.280> is<00:03:49.310> very<00:03:49.670> pronounced

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
mechanical eye which is very pronounced

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.030 
mechanical eye which is very pronounced
so<00:03:50.269> those<00:03:50.900> are<00:03:51.110> some<00:03:51.260> pros<00:03:51.550> but<00:03:54.040> unfortunately

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
so those are some pros but unfortunately

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.930 
so those are some pros but unfortunately
I<00:03:55.069> will<00:03:55.400> have<00:03:55.580> to<00:03:55.760> say<00:03:57.430> that's<00:03:58.430> where<00:03:58.640> the<00:03:58.730> pros

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
I will have to say that's where the pros

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.729 
I will have to say that's where the pros
end<00:03:59.150> aside<00:03:59.840> from<00:03:59.959> the<00:04:00.079> disc<00:04:00.260> launcher<00:04:00.380> I<00:04:00.590> like

end aside from the disc launcher I like

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.759 
end aside from the disc launcher I like
the<00:04:00.860> disc<00:04:01.040> concha<00:04:01.310> it's<00:04:01.430> a<00:04:01.489> pro<00:04:02.140> now<00:04:03.140> it's<00:04:03.380> time

pros<00:04:09.880> let's<00:04:10.880> just<00:04:11.090> get<00:04:11.180> started

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
pros let's just get started

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.500 
pros let's just get started
first<00:04:12.320> of<00:04:12.500> all<00:04:12.590> pro<00:04:13.070> up<00:04:13.430> cons<00:04:14.799> no<00:04:15.799> elbows<00:04:16.549> in<00:04:17.390> a

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
first of all pro up cons no elbows in a

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.159 
first of all pro up cons no elbows in a
world<00:04:17.890> where<00:04:18.890> elbows<00:04:19.489> are<00:04:19.700> standard<00:04:20.239> cracka

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
world where elbows are standard cracka

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.590 
world where elbows are standard cracka
stands<00:04:21.560> out<00:04:21.769> as<00:04:21.919> having<00:04:22.070> none<00:04:22.460> going<00:04:23.210> back<00:04:23.390> to

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
stands out as having none going back to

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.650 
stands out as having none going back to
using<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:23.960> TOA<00:04:24.350> mata<00:04:24.620> limbs<00:04:25.520> which<00:04:26.419> do<00:04:26.630> not

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
using the TOA mata limbs which do not

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.219 
using the TOA mata limbs which do not
have<00:04:26.810> any<00:04:27.050> articulation<00:04:28.660> now<00:04:29.660> the<00:04:29.720> con<00:04:29.990> I'm

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
have any articulation now the con I'm

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:31.750 
have any articulation now the con I'm
sure<00:04:30.440> some<00:04:30.710> would<00:04:30.860> say<00:04:31.070> would<00:04:31.280> be<00:04:31.310> the<00:04:31.550> disc

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
sure some would say would be the disc

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.120 
sure some would say would be the disc
launcher<00:04:32.000> as<00:04:32.500> someone<00:04:33.500> say<00:04:33.650> that<00:04:33.830> the<00:04:33.950> disc

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
launcher as someone say that the disc

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.860 
launcher as someone say that the disc
launcher<00:04:34.280> is<00:04:34.550> a<00:04:34.640> gimmick<00:04:34.970> and<00:04:35.300> it<00:04:35.419> is<00:04:35.570> just

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
launcher is a gimmick and it is just

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.640 
launcher is a gimmick and it is just
there<00:04:36.110> and<00:04:36.140> it<00:04:36.380> takes<00:04:36.560> out<00:04:36.770> of<00:04:36.800> some<00:04:37.070> of<00:04:37.160> the

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
there and it takes out of some of the

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
mechanics and whatnot so someone say

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.640 
mechanics and whatnot so someone say
that<00:04:42.100> another<00:04:43.100> con<00:04:43.640> I<00:04:44.080> would<00:04:45.080> personally<00:04:45.289> say

also a con in that it occasionally

times<00:06:16.580> now<00:06:17.580> the<00:06:17.639> con<00:06:17.880> would<00:06:18.120> be<00:06:18.150> the<00:06:18.300> open<00:06:18.960> pins

unfortunately I'd have to say that's
about<00:06:31.620> it<00:06:32.070> I<00:06:32.660> think<00:06:33.660> I've<00:06:33.750> already<00:06:33.960> mentioned
