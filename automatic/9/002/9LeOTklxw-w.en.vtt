00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 people what everyone and with 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.470
 a full of eating maybe even in 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.929
 slide meeting before a date look times 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.110
 after a guy who already saw me 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.470
 what I eat so but since I invite tomorrow 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.820
 Hey , that's what hey maybe 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.410
 watch how hunger plays along today 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.670
 I will eat a little less than 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.779
 otherwise and then you have time in 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.529
 slide meeting a lot before a bath day 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.869
 fun doing the first meal of the day 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.880
 porridge 100 grams will turn 30 degrees 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.210
 angle flakes and 40 grams of protein 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:40.170
 brother fuso friends board was inhaled 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.770
 41 grams of protein 28 grams of caps and a 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.739
 grams of fat 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.899
 In addition there was a half liter of water 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.879
 actually drink every morning 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.320
 liquid because it just has that 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.030
 reason because you just over the night 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.739
 Relatively much liquid loses yes 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.469
 even if not a particularly warm one 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.480
 you practically only lose 2 liters 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.829
 sweating and that's why I am 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.359
 in the opinion of everyone in the morning 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.420
 case that liquid deficit 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.610
 should balance with liquid plan 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.460
 do not have to drink water now but yes 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.250
 capitoo for example but that one 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.570
 hold at least 400 milliliters or 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.830
 then drink half a liter of water 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.780
 is one with every case on the 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.310
 safe side 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.930
 and yes, because people have asked me how 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.630
 my daily routine looks like i will 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.240
 So now I have eaten this 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.189
 and now i will get some mails 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.619
 answer yes coaching mails 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.659
 answer messages from customers 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.390
 answer in general 11 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.790
 So answer a little bit of work 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.170
 in other words, and then I will 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.600
 depending on how long the in 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.060
 I accept 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.320
 maybe already eat something or if 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.630
 I'm done faster now then 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.340
 I will learn a bit 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.110
 I do not have such a phase so now 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.210
 learning phase for the klausurphase has yes 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.280
 already started practically because of that 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.500
 I need a bit of work cut times 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.479
 again in arrears but no problem 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.240
 I 'll bring that back to the last meters 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.670
 on whatever else has on everyone 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.409
 case daily breakfast work 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.990
 and then maybe eat again or 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.690
 after I'm honest right away 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.670
 People second meal two packs 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.830
 I will do this now for the fast food 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.480
 Radioshack test you have determined 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.030
 already seen the video if not one 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.800
 check this time I can give you a quick look 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:29.319
 show five complete 0,9 grams 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.700
 carbohydrates and 20 76 who my conclusion 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.830
 you probably have in that too 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.810
 seen video as I said if not 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.970
 then check out the video and oh yes me 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.760
 I will not become a vegan nor will I 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.580
 So do not worry about them and sponsor them 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.860
 There are still two crews and one 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:50.069
 Apple and a nectarine are what I think 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:52.180
 120 grams of apple and 108 grams of nectarine 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.989
 hinder with the 100 grams 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:59.319
 I already have 400 grams in the morning 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:01.780
 practically so happy in there will be 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:05.260
 time for flour number three am just on 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.420
 learn and now there's something right 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.510
 really really good looks best 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.180
 even my friends are 100 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.310
 gramm Persian finest Persian games 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.900
 So who does not know that must and 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.680
 definitely try it 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.140
 one tastes abnormally good as well 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.109
 said 100 grams 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:28.709
 because people ask me how do you carry 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:31.450
 because that's something you often do not find 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.950
 in the course common sides how to 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.350
 can scare and you will find that too 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.780
 not for fdp or fitness paul 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.150
 Meat but rather then I am then 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.670
 just some candy that 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.549
 is about, yes, something like that so 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.579
 some pastry in the honey pastries and the 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.180
 all have between 550 to 400 times 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.730
 calorie 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.890
 I'm looking for something with 84 490 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.079
 calories and then carries it easily 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.000
 and on 100 grams you can see that 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.620
 maybe 50 calories difference 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.019
 and maybe today I will 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.370
 bit in deficit, either way 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.680
 that's why he does not make a big one 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.739
 difference that means I am wearing now 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.230
 something something something where I think 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.239
 this is relatively similar to products 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.370
 as well as recommend themselves so if 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.850
 now goes to dine out and 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.530
 wanted to 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.810
 then you can check one 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.580
 So compare products consult when 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.160
 you have your burger with 200 grams 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.360
 maybe 220 grams of meat then you can 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.850
 her also in the double whopper then take 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.500
 also 222 grams of meat about then 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:34.960
 you will soon be the same 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:36.880
 I come to my meat and sauce and bread 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.250
 do not crap citizens and you have too 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.210
 not much more bread on one 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.280
 Stadtberger on a whopper to 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.290
 example , so I'm doing as dirty as 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.030
 said comparative value or try 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.440
 stop at the citizen in the year even easier 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.410
 just the things in items 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.630
 but it may disassemble into parts 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.870
 so I do not know that I could 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:59.740
 I do not believe meal number 4 200 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.210
 broccoli and 180 grams of salt 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.590
 makes no sense who is because 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.810
 zeilsheim with broccoli but that is 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.270
 actually the appetizer and that should 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:10.810
 tell you what it's about you 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:13.510
 can you ever guess only friends 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:18.790
 so does the main course of a bag 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:21.180
 chips 125 grams 150 grams tata correct 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:25.180
 really well seasoned by me then 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:27.160
 yes yes 50 grams barely 150 grams and 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.050
 a pack of kers 150 grams 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:33.730
 as I said that we then of course 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:37.660
 she was there for salzer and a cola 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:39.550
 zero mainka the bad but hey caffeine free 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.940
 different count on that again knows that 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.940
 everyone
