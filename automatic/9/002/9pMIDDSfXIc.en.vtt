 Hey, everyone here is alice and me. 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.800
 I'm bringing you another video 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.090
 cold stream of 4 and its mode 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.189
 multiplayer 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.560
 in today's video I'm going to respond to a 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.369
 question that I received in the previous video 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.950
 of tips that are here on the channel and a boy 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.840
 called Carlos and asked the following 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.300
 what is the best way for those who are 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.010
 starting now and I'm going to answer that 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.110
 You ask me, I'm really going to give 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.019
 my opinion and I will leave here a 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.570
 background video is a game that I 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:48.059
 I'm already in progress and it's well 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.739
 interesting because when I entered the 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.679
 My team was losing and we 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.210
 we managed to turn the game and win a 

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:56.219
 way cool 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.309
 so enjoy a video has worked 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.710
 and I'm going to talk in general can be 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.199
 any game but I'm going to use the old 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.270
 movie of four as an example for you 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.110
 to start the game, the ideal is that you 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.050
 look for a simpler way for example 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:17.280
 Garfield 4 The simplest mode is the 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:20.850
 team by themselves or tim in front of him and 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.160
 why the molds is simple you 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.950
 there is nothing else to do except 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.940
 kill enemies and support your 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.740
 team 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.360
 this makes it very simple not to 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.160
 I'm telling you it's easy, I 'm just saying. 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.250
 that it is simpler 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.740
 after you get to know the maps and 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.970
 have your favorite weapon you can be 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:45.300
 seeking a way eg the goal 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.610
 the domination mode is very good for you 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.400
 play after I've met a little 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.120
 more of the maps and has your favorite weapon 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:57.390
 right in the domination mode you both have 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:00.390
 that kill enemies like supporting the 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.790
 your team and have goals to do in 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.439
 Life has a goal to do that is 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.540
 catch the fireman 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.459
 so this makes it a bit more difficult 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.890
 you to install yourself by capturing a 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.140
 flag and see a lot of enemies to 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.560
 also capture the flag then you 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.940
 ends up dying so it's a way that has 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.580
 that you have to have a strategy 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.580
 better then this requires you to 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.130
 know a little more of the maps 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.470
 after domination mode you may be 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.510
 taking a look at the other modes 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.599
 I'll just say the following to let 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.000
 Last mode conquers conquest mode 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:40.180
 I think he's one of the most complex 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 give the son of four certain 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.630
 You have enemies to kill you have. 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.580
 that dealing with the vehicles is 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:55.390
 driving or destroying them and 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.680
 You also have to do what the 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.410
 goals 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.549
 so if you do not have a good team one 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.440
 squadron mounted the ideal is that you 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:08.440
 understand a little of every thing you 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.200
 know a little of each thing then 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.290
 starts with each team by itself then goes 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.720
 nomination afterwards fly each button 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.609
 for you and then take a look at the 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.440
 other modes and finally goes nu 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.000
 conquered conquest is a way 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.239
 Amazing 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.280
 I do not take too long to tell the truth. 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.319
 but I know how powerful he is. 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.829
 I know the amount of things you 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:35.950
 can be doing is simply in 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:38.650
 game inside another game is very much 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.380
 good for you to play as a squad to 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:44.049
 you play with the team formed then it is 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.670
 This is a personal reminder that this is only 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:49.030
 My opinion but I hope that 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.859
 somehow help from you and I wanted 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.500
