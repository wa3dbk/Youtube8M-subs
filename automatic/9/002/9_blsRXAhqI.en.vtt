 Super makeup super easy to do super 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.389
 Bunny I liked it, I think this week 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.730
 after this makeup instagram eu 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.410
 I said it was my uniform makeup 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.449
 that fall that I use for almost everything 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.519
 and a lot of people asked me for a video asked 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.830
 step by step, so much here to show 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.720
 How do you do this makeup? 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.670
 I used so much I very much hope that you 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.130
 like you want to see how i did 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.350
 This motivation of the video I already have with 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.000
 skin ready and how I applied concealer 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.290
 and base on the eyelid I will not use 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.180
 no kind of beach nor 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.129
 shadow potter and I go 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.739
 begin this makeup using this 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.840
 shadow mac court which is a 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.700
 comedy that he is great to take away 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.079
 that morning swelling of the eyes 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.690
 while you want to wear makeup 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.940
 during the day is perfect because this tone 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.680
 on the eyelid takes a little swelling and creates 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.870
 an illusion of depth 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.750
 I'm going to use the make-up brushes today. 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.510
 I'll start using this here's from 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.860
 make men's cuddly he is great 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.720
 because besides applying this is to give 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.490
 I'm not going to apply this 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.950
 shade from the entire eyelid to the 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.880
 of the concave and when it reaches the 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.299
 concave 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.759
 I'm going to give a little light band spy 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.920
 turn the brush like it's chubby I 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.600
 I learned with him that way, 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.350
 The time that arrives in the concave I give a 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.869
 peek and esfume the level is great 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.090
 because he already helps school as well 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.090
 He's got a way out. It 's really cute. 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:41.159
 which is also forming then I go 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.649
 Applying and I'm going to vanish shadow already 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.390
 applied across the mist eyelid 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.560
 chubby now I'll wear a shadow 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.360
 dark brown 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.790
 if you can not wear a black even 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.860
 I'll use with it I saw the law that daisy 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.380
 and I will apply with the brush as 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.159
 more rounded with this tip 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.409
 I like applying it slowly and 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.210
 feeling 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:06.009
 The entity then I put here 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:09.250
 a corner and pulling the concave and I go 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:11.110
 making this move back and forth to 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.230
 the well marked conca 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.810
 I like to leave the concave as if 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.780
 had a line here darker to 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.790
 divide the concave eyelid have people 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.799
 who does not like people who prefer this 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.560
 Makeup is very well formed then 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.720
 You can go smoke or do like I do. 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.340
 a bit more marked from a 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.040
 accentuated in the shadow that in the 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.040
 concave eye to be deeper 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.489
 I'll get a brush and I'll clean it 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.629
 It's also from make and I'm going to try a little 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.629
 plus the edge 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.120
 I'm going to enjoy this cute potential. 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.340
 and volume on the underside of the eyebrow I go 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.560
 to use this color is where the fox you have 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.840
 a more yellowish background if only to take 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.239
 the rosy background you can use a 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.829
 shade so with the rosier background 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:05.790
 but it is important that it has not 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:05.790
 shine is to be very soft discreet 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.250
 now got to the part of outlining the eye 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.380
 I'm going first in line to the 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.660
 lower lashes I'll get a brush 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.480
 so tiny little detail and 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.510
 I'll go back with that shadow to cork 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.609
 I will apply to it through the whole 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.690
 lower eyelashes have in the outer corner 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.690
 to the inner corner 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.730
 now I can win the top row 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.220
 the children I will use an eyeliner 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.180
 This liquid is the brand of animals. 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.250
 be black 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.349
 but I'll apply with the brush and 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.720
 if it's a brand-name bevelled brush 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.970
 of 6 which also it is very very very 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.129
 Fininho walks you to see he's super 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.019
 godfather so it's great to finish 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.329
 during the day that we want to fire 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.730
 It's fine, at first, it's getting tired. 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:04:00.090
 perfect, what I do is get the 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.260
 eyeliner with the brush and watch the 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.799
 applicator 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.569
 I pass a brush, the lady is already there. 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:09.120
 product here in the brush 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.859
 I apply directly to the eyes I go 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.129
 make a middle outline for the end 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:16.769
 and then I'll join the inner corner with 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:20.630
 the medium thin and in the end make a 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.630
 very discreet kitty 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.840
 without getting more product I will use this 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.590
 here to outline the line of 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.980
 eyelashes 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:40.540
 only at the end of the day 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.040
 now I'm going back because brush it 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.870
 baby and if what we had 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.520
 a lower line of eyelashes and I go 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.639
 apply a shadow 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.790
 so pulled by a half bronze 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:54.430
 this is a link from mac and you 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.980
 can replace ocepar and also for this 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.440
 hence from intense korea in five is one 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.389
 a little more rosy for you to see 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.760
 but who does not think here gives to 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:06.010
 to become very well with this one from here I go 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.770
 apply with this potential zinho by 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.190
 the full extent of my eyelashes 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.190
 inferior 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.530
 I'll apply the light pencil to the line 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.230
 this water is that illuminator of the 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:26.000
 sigma I'm going to use this rosy side 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.040
 You can apply the black pencil pencil 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.090
 brown also if you want to stay 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.710
 beautiful and to imagine what had internal 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.500
 of the eyes I'm going to wear a shadow 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.420

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.300

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.760
 Natural 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:51.920

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.440

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.810

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.940

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.590
