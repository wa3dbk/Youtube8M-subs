00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.020 

and<00:01:48.840> just<00:01:49.470> hold<00:01:49.710> on<00:01:49.920> for<00:01:50.910> a<00:01:50.940> second<00:01:52.850> this<00:01:53.850> could

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
and just hold on for a second this could

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.270 
and just hold on for a second this could
take<00:01:54.210> some<00:01:54.420> time<00:01:56.540> there<00:01:57.540> we<00:01:57.690> go<00:01:57.950> we<00:01:58.950> got<00:01:59.160> the

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
take some time there we go we got the

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.010 
take some time there we go we got the
performance<00:02:00.050> information<00:02:01.050> and<00:02:01.680> tools<00:02:01.880> so<00:02:03.020> how

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
performance information and tools so how

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.110 
performance information and tools so how
do<00:02:04.080> you<00:02:04.230> know<00:02:04.320> if<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.860> are<00:02:05.160> capable<00:02:05.670> of

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
do you know if you are capable of

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.320 
do you know if you are capable of
installing<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:07.020> 64-bit<00:02:07.770> here<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.910> system

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
installing a 64-bit here in the system

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.430 
installing a 64-bit here in the system
you<00:02:10.140> get<00:02:10.910> this<00:02:11.910> information<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.720> there<00:02:12.990> it<00:02:13.200> is

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
you get this information and there it is

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.720 
you get this information and there it is
64-bit<00:02:14.430> capable<00:02:15.000> yes<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:16.520> that's<00:02:17.520> how<00:02:17.670> you

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
64-bit capable yes and that's how you

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.640 
64-bit capable yes and that's how you
know<00:02:17.940> if<00:02:18.150> your<00:02:18.630> machine<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:18.990> capable<00:02:19.350> of

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
know if your machine is capable of

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.460 
know if your machine is capable of
installing<00:02:20.070> a<00:02:20.340> 64-bit<00:02:20.970> operating<00:02:21.300> system<00:02:21.660> now

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
installing a 64-bit operating system now

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.140 
installing a 64-bit operating system now
the<00:02:22.530> difference<00:02:23.190> between<00:02:23.250> 32-bit<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.090> 64-bit

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
the difference between 32-bit and 64-bit

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.250 
the difference between 32-bit and 64-bit
is<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:25.700> if<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:27.030> want<00:02:27.270> to<00:02:27.420> install<00:02:27.720> more<00:02:28.050> RAM

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
is that if you want to install more RAM

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.860 
is that if you want to install more RAM
than<00:02:28.290> four<00:02:28.890> gigabytes<00:02:29.310> then<00:02:29.730> it's<00:02:30.120> really

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
than four gigabytes then it's really

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.010 
than four gigabytes then it's really
important<00:02:31.410> for<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.250> install<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:33.030> 64-bit<00:02:33.720> I

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
important for you to install a 64-bit I

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.730 
important for you to install a 64-bit I
mean<00:02:34.709> for<00:02:35.670> Windows<00:02:35.940> 7<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:36.930> can<00:02:37.140> store<00:02:37.530> like

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
mean for Windows 7 you can store like

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.050 
mean for Windows 7 you can store like
128<00:02:38.730> gigabytes<00:02:39.240> of<00:02:39.360> RAM<00:02:39.630> if<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:40.620> using<00:02:41.220> 64-bit

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
128 gigabytes of RAM if you using 64-bit

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.320 
128 gigabytes of RAM if you using 64-bit
so<00:02:42.360> that's<00:02:42.690> really<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.290> advantage<00:02:43.530> of<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:44.070> and

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
so that's really the advantage of it and

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.390 
so that's really the advantage of it and
for<00:02:45.330> 32-bit<00:02:46.230> operating<00:02:46.410> system<00:02:46.920> you<00:02:47.070> can<00:02:47.250> only

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
for 32-bit operating system you can only

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.170 
for 32-bit operating system you can only
install<00:02:47.700> up<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.230> 4<00:02:49.230> GB<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:50.340> gets<00:02:50.640> like<00:02:51.080> 3.4<00:02:52.080> so

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
install up to 4 GB it gets like 3.4 so

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.509
