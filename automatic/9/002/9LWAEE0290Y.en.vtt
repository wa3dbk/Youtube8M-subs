hi this William welcome to fly spoke

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.090 
hi this William welcome to fly spoke
today<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.110> want<00:00:19.290> to<00:00:19.320> show<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.680> little<00:00:19.830> midge

today I want to show you a little midge

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.730 
today I want to show you a little midge
fly<00:00:20.369> that<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.779> call<00:00:22.110> the<00:00:22.260> copper<00:00:22.619> cap<00:00:22.830> as<00:00:23.790> a

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
fly that I call the copper cap as a

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.920 
fly that I call the copper cap as a
copper<00:00:25.740> mylar<00:00:26.220> on<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.640> very<00:00:26.849> top<00:00:27.180> there<00:00:27.540> for<00:00:27.900> a

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
copper mylar on the very top there for a

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.440 
copper mylar on the very top there for a
wing<00:00:28.170> casing<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:29.670> one<00:00:29.849> happens<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.270> be<00:00:30.330> a

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:30.450 
wing casing this one happens to be a

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:36.770 
wing casing this one happens to be a
size<00:00:30.720> 18<00:00:33.050> so<00:00:34.050> starting<00:00:34.770> with<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.949> TM<00:00:35.340> ko2<00:00:35.580> 06<00:00:36.300> BL

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
size 18 so starting with a TM ko2 06 BL

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.250 
size 18 so starting with a TM ko2 06 BL
and<00:00:37.080> you<00:00:37.920> can<00:00:38.100> use<00:00:38.250> any<00:00:38.489> curved<00:00:38.879> hook<00:00:39.270> it

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
and you can use any curved hook it

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.080 
and you can use any curved hook it
doesn't<00:00:40.620> have<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.920> be<00:00:40.949> this<00:00:41.280> particular<00:00:41.670> one

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
doesn't have to be this particular one

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.110 
doesn't have to be this particular one
but<00:00:42.269> this<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.570> barbless<00:00:43.080> up<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:44.100> this<00:00:44.730> one's<00:00:45.000> a

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
but this is a barbless up I this one's a

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.380 
but this is a barbless up I this one's a
size<00:00:45.330> 18<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:46.140> usually<00:00:46.680> tie<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.190> fly<00:00:47.640> in<00:00:47.879> an<00:00:47.970> 18

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
size 18 I usually tie this fly in an 18

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:57.320 
size 18 I usually tie this fly in an 18
or<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.690> 20<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:53.269> tiemco<00:00:54.769> 2457<00:00:55.769> is<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.699> great<00:00:57.089> hook

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
or a 20 and tiemco 2457 is a great hook

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.049 
or a 20 and tiemco 2457 is a great hook
for<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:57.920> like<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.040> said<00:00:59.100> anything<00:00:59.760> with<00:01:00.030> a

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
for this like I said anything with a

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.520 
for this like I said anything with a
curved<00:01:01.549> curved<00:01:02.549> hook<00:01:02.909> shape<00:01:03.269> just<00:01:03.989> gut<00:01:04.290> hook

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
curved curved hook shape just gut hook

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.840 
curved curved hook shape just gut hook
basically<00:01:06.799> so<00:01:07.799> I'm<00:01:07.979> just<00:01:08.190> going<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.430> start<00:01:08.700> at

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
basically so I'm just going to start at

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.010 
basically so I'm just going to start at
the<00:01:08.940> front<00:01:09.409> start<00:01:10.409> putting<00:01:10.740> some<00:01:10.920> thread<00:01:11.280> on

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
the front start putting some thread on

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.530 
the front start putting some thread on
i'm<00:01:13.020> using<00:01:14.090> 72<00:01:15.090> denny<00:01:15.450> or<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.930> dot<00:01:16.409> uni<00:01:17.100> red<00:01:17.540> for

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
i'm using 72 denny or a dot uni red for

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.749 
i'm using 72 denny or a dot uni red for
this<00:01:18.690> particular<00:01:18.900> fly<00:01:19.680> but<00:01:20.479> you<00:01:21.479> can<00:01:22.759> use

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
this particular fly but you can use

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.719 
this particular fly but you can use
brown<00:01:24.210> olive<00:01:25.109> tan<00:01:25.590> black<00:01:28.310> basically<00:01:29.310> make<00:01:29.549> the

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
brown olive tan black basically make the

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.940 
brown olive tan black basically make the
whole<00:01:29.909> fly<00:01:30.240> exactly<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.140> same<00:01:31.380> as<00:01:31.590> i'm<00:01:31.740> going

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
whole fly exactly the same as i'm going

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.789 
whole fly exactly the same as i'm going
to<00:01:32.070> show<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.310> but<00:01:33.149> alter<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.960> thread<00:01:34.409> color

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
to show you but alter the thread color

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.940 
to show you but alter the thread color
and<00:01:35.509> you<00:01:36.509> come<00:01:36.750> up<00:01:36.929> with<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.259> number<00:01:37.740> of

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
and you come up with a number of

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.130 
and you come up with a number of
different<00:01:38.429> colors<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:38.850> these<00:01:39.270> for<00:01:40.079> these

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
different colors for these for these

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.919 
different colors for these for these
midges<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:40.979> right<00:01:41.939> now<00:01:42.119> i'm<00:01:42.270> just<00:01:42.420> taking

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
midges and right now i'm just taking

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:48.469 
midges and right now i'm just taking
some<00:01:43.170> 7x<00:01:44.659> mono<00:01:46.579> and<00:01:47.579> i'm<00:01:47.729> going<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:47.999> use<00:01:48.210> that

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
some 7x mono and i'm going to use that

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.249 
some 7x mono and i'm going to use that
as<00:01:48.749> my<00:01:48.990> rib<00:01:49.939> run<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.210> in<00:01:51.450> as<00:01:51.719> best<00:01:51.960> i<00:01:52.200> can

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
as my rib run that in as best i can

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.239 
as my rib run that in as best i can
along<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.219> bottom<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.939> hook<00:01:54.149> just<00:01:55.249> keep

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:56.249 
along the bottom of the hook just keep

00:01:56.249 --> 00:02:02.239 
along the bottom of the hook just keep
it<00:01:56.429> out<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.609> the<00:01:56.789> way<00:01:58.850> and<00:01:59.850> right<00:02:00.270> around<00:02:01.249> to

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:02.249 
it out of the way and right around to

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:04.249 
it out of the way and right around to
the<00:02:02.369> middle<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.789> the<00:02:02.850> bend<00:02:03.210> or<00:02:03.539> even<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.960> little

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
the middle of the bend or even a little

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:10.400 
the middle of the bend or even a little
further<00:02:04.560> would<00:02:04.979> be<00:02:05.159> ok<00:02:06.859> mmm<00:02:08.869> make<00:02:09.869> yourself<00:02:10.289> a

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
further would be ok mmm make yourself a

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.190 
further would be ok mmm make yourself a
tapered<00:02:10.860> body

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.320 

getting<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.069> little<00:02:16.220> thicker<00:02:16.640> towards<00:02:17.180> the

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
getting a little thicker towards the

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.820 
getting a little thicker towards the
abdomen<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.790> for<00:02:20.060> now<00:02:20.470> we're<00:02:21.470> just<00:02:21.500> going<00:02:21.650> to

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
abdomen and for now we're just going to

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.380 
abdomen and for now we're just going to
leave<00:02:22.040> this<00:02:22.280> mono<00:02:22.640> hanging<00:02:23.239> out<00:02:23.390> back<00:02:23.660> here

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
leave this mono hanging out back here

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.070 
leave this mono hanging out back here
okay<00:02:26.390> next<00:02:26.780> thing<00:02:27.140> is<00:02:27.349> I'm<00:02:28.129> going<00:02:28.400> to<00:02:28.489> take

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
okay next thing is I'm going to take

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.240 
okay next thing is I'm going to take
some<00:02:30.080> holographic<00:02:30.640> copper<00:02:32.410> mylar<00:02:33.410> and<00:02:33.709> this

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
some holographic copper mylar and this

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.530 
some holographic copper mylar and this
is<00:02:34.459> very<00:02:34.970> thin<00:02:35.510> in<00:02:36.250> strands<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:37.430> I'm<00:02:38.030> going<00:02:38.390> to

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
is very thin in strands and I'm going to

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.979 
is very thin in strands and I'm going to
quadruple<00:02:39.290> it<00:02:39.970> to<00:02:40.970> give<00:02:41.180> me<00:02:41.360> some<00:02:41.660> thickness

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
quadruple it to give me some thickness

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.080 
quadruple it to give me some thickness
if<00:02:42.440> you<00:02:42.590> have<00:02:42.860> copper<00:02:44.200> holographic<00:02:45.700> in<00:02:46.700> what

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
if you have copper holographic in what

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.660 
if you have copper holographic in what
would<00:02:47.269> be<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.780> small<00:02:48.410> size<00:02:49.010> I<00:02:51.519> believe<00:02:52.519> you

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
would be the small size I believe you

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.589 
would be the small size I believe you
could<00:02:52.849> use<00:02:53.060> two<00:02:53.390> strands<00:02:55.090> medium<00:02:56.090> you<00:02:56.360> would

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
could use two strands medium you would

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.699 
could use two strands medium you would
get<00:02:56.959> away<00:02:57.230> with<00:02:57.440> one<00:02:57.709> strand<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:59.780> that<00:03:00.380> I'm

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
get away with one strand and that I'm

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.819 
get away with one strand and that I'm
just<00:03:01.099> going<00:03:01.310> to<00:03:01.400> go<00:03:02.110> to<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.349> front<00:03:03.680> of<00:03:03.769> the

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
just going to go to the front of the

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:11.710 
just going to go to the front of the
