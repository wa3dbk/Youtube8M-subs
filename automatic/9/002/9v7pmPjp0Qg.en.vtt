00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.410
 technology and in this video I'm going to 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.519
 teach how to jailbreak the 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.660
 ios version 5.1.1 for your iphone ipod 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.030
 touch or ipad 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.010
 this is useful if you have windows mac or 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.260
 linux does not matter you can continue this 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.420
 tutorial and how I just told you this 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.220
 works with any iphone ipad or 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.550
 ipod toch that is compatible with the 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.349
 version 5.1.1 if any and how 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.970
 said the creators is so easy that 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.619
 anyone can do it but good 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.619
 let's go to my computer to start 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.140
 well to be a little more specific 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.730
 This jobbik is useful if you have one of 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.699
 the devices that are appearing 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.229
 on screen if your device appears 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.180
 then you can continue with this 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:56.699
 process well we are already in my 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.619
 computer in this case I'm going to use 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.320
 a mac but as I told you if they have 

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:02.879
 windows or linux is the same has to be 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.810
 exactly the same steps are not 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.119
 worry good then it's important 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.840
 check first, first of all, that 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.170
 your device is in version 5.1.1 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.670
 okay 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.000
 check this is very important check 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.149
 that is 5.1.1 for this, just go to 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.619
 settings or settings and then they go to 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:28.190
 general general and about about and 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.509
 check what version they have but good 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.700
 as I told them the first thing they have to 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.380
 to do is download a program that 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.959
 call apps sync that is the one that is going to 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.549
 allow to do the jailbreak so is that 

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:40.619
 let's download I'll leave the 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.580
 links in the description download the 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.140
 your operating system 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.030
 and I'm going to leave the links in the 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.000
 description so do not worry 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.270
 why this is fine in windows linux or 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.390
 mac once you've downloaded app if 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.190
 you do not have to install it well for 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.190
 any operating system install it 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.200
 and you're going to open it in mac lover is normal 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.850
 same in linux but if you're in windows 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.470
 It is important that you click with the 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.270
 right button and you run it like 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.040
 administrator that is very important 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.590
 once they have opened the program 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:15.160
 Now what we need is to connect 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.200
 our iphone ipod touch or ipad in this 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.280
 case and use a third ipad 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.700
 generation that already has the ios 5.1.1 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.200
 but if you have an ipod touch or an iphone 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.540
 follow exactly the same steps already 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.060
 that for all is exactly the same and 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.780
 going to happen is going to be the same process in 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.490
 everyone 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.410
 so it follows the same steps in 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.480
 this case I use on a third ipad 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.620
 generation so at this time 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.230
 they are watching it on screen 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.629
 now this is very important be the 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.090
 device that they have if they have 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.950
 password is to say that when 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.690
 they unlock asks for a password 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.159
 ok this is very important and already 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.720
 then they put it back on because 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:56.659
 the joe louis process is over 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.180
 but for now remove the password by 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:02.329
 please if you do not want it to lock and 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.099
 that works correctly since 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.319
 the program is open if they want 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.030
 they can tell you to read the instructions 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.760
 is asking us to connect our 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.390
 device to the computer so 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.390
 let's do it 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.330
 and let's hope they recognize it if they 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.440
 open itunes or any other program 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:26.700
 in automatic close it and return to 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.770
 nothing so once you are connected 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.030
 your device the only thing they have to 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.820
 to do is to click on the button that says 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.100
 Break and wait, do not touch anything 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.720
 until the process finishes to know 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.010
 this in the same program is not going to 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.780
 say anyway I 'm going to 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.940
 notify when it is already so they are 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.540
 patients because this can last several 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.810
 minutes 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.950
 so click here 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.870
 and good we have faster sales 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.230
 remember not to touch anything or in the 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.989
 program or on your device so it's that 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.610
 wait, some things will happen in your 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:02.260
 device because it appears pledge 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.260
 but whatever happens, do not touch anything 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.010
 for example that which says restoration is 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.010
 normal do not touch anything 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.739
 why 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.639
 well when the program is finished 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.560
 is going to tell us done enjoy ok this 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.690
 means that they can now disconnect their 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.090
 ipad iphone or ipod touch of the 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.789
 computer and you're ready already have already 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.650
 see and so we 're going to our ipad in 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:37.870
 my case in your case go to what you 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.660
 have done the jailbreak and let's see now 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.310
 what do we have to do well if 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.289
 They had password and want to become a 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.349
 the put and and they can do so 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:50.440
 normal and well you will notice that they already have 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:52.180
 Syria on screen 7 on your device 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.860
 this means that they already have the 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.590
 jailbreak 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.620
 ok remember being connected to a network 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.750
 wifi and good this is the proof that 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:05.050
 It's working, it's 100%, I'm going to 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.550
 to teach is normal that this appears 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.050
 Syria is going to close when it closes 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.120
 reopen and I 'm going to show you 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.370
 how everything works perfectly well 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.979
 well it's already closed before we go back 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.020
 to open is already running perfectly 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:19.030
 well you choose that you want a user 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.150
 hacker or developer I always give 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.370
 click developer and there you are 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.009
 I would run perfectly on my ipad 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:30.699
 third generation and so should 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:32.650
 be with your iphone ipod touch or ipad 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:34.670
 it depends on what you have done 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.560
 the jailbreak 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.570
 well this was the video today I hope that 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.980
