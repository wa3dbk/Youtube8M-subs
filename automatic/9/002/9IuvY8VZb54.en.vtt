00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.100
 here is an Irish oyster more 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.480
 fleshy and sweeter than the tide does 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.610
 will break them one is still on a 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.630
 product label red marennes-oléron so 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.790
 it is still the high-end 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.740
 but here you see we still have 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.900
 an oyster with a coat much more 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.160
 thick and a completely different taste 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.170
 it's really two products 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.210

 Oyster farmer from Oleron castle 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.480
 responsible for sending them a new 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.670
 activity he launched two years ago in 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.940
 full crisis of mortality of oysters 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.180
 it allowed me to continue to develop 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.980
 my activity despite mortality while 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.329
 remaining in high-end products 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.360
 that's what really held us 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.559
 baptized heart austra regales the u13 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.260
 Dutch are very popular in 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.210
 export benoit massed ship them 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.100
 in china italy and hong kong 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.020
 like the luxury products the oyster and 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.670
 landaises does not know the crisis she 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.640
 sells twice as expensive as 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.420
 other stands at this oyster is going to be 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:05.220
 sold around 17 euros i think around 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.780
 17 18 euros the minimum dozen on 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.400
 the markets and I think it's a 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.830
 fight that can be sold up to 25 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.290
 even 30 euros in restaurants the 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.850
 dozen the Irish oyster does not 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.979
 that a flash passage to oléron 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.930

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.900
 it only takes a few months for the 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.329
 Oléronnaise come back much more 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.240
