okay this is after the list has been
installed<00:00:07.610> this<00:00:08.610> definitely<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.420> lot<00:00:09.570> higher

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.280 
installed this definitely a lot higher

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.129 
installed this definitely a lot higher
wasn't<00:00:11.280> as<00:00:11.370> high<00:00:11.490> as<00:00:11.550> expecting<00:00:12.420> it<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.660> be<00:00:12.690> but

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
wasn't as high as expecting it to be but

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.910 
wasn't as high as expecting it to be but
still<00:00:13.410> pretty<00:00:14.040> high<00:00:14.250> off<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.610> ground<00:00:15.920> let's

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
still pretty high off the ground let's

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.830 
still pretty high off the ground let's
see<00:00:17.190> put<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.029> steering<00:00:18.420> stabilizer<00:00:18.720> in<00:00:20.840> right

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
see put a steering stabilizer in right

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.560 
see put a steering stabilizer in right
here

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.800 

a<00:00:27.630> new<00:00:27.900> tough<00:00:28.230> country<00:00:28.500> sharks

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:32.810 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.520 

those<00:00:34.480> little<00:00:35.480> pens<00:00:35.810> over<00:00:36.110> there<00:00:36.260> you<00:00:36.380> can

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
those little pens over there you can

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.290 
those little pens over there you can
pull<00:00:36.740> out<00:00:36.770> from<00:00:37.070> the<00:00:37.130> sway<00:00:37.490> bar<00:00:37.760> I<00:00:37.790> guess<00:00:38.090> if

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
pull out from the sway bar I guess if

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.849 
pull out from the sway bar I guess if
you're<00:00:38.450> off-roading

00:00:39.849 --> 00:00:39.859 
you're off-roading

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:42.810 
you're off-roading
the<00:00:39.949> tires<00:00:40.190> can<00:00:40.339> you<00:00:40.850> know

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
the tires can you know

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.150 
the tires can you know
I<00:00:42.850> guess

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:01:04.730 

the<00:00:48.610> other<00:00:48.760> side<00:00:49.090> the<00:00:49.810> extended

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:04.740 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.000 

there's<00:01:05.740> a<00:01:05.950> side<00:01:06.250> shot<00:01:06.580> of<00:01:06.640> the<00:01:06.850> truck<00:01:08.010> and

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
there's a side shot of the truck and

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.540 
there's a side shot of the truck and
I'll<00:01:09.190> get<00:01:09.430> more<00:01:09.640> height<00:01:10.330> out<00:01:10.510> of<00:01:10.630> it<00:01:10.720> -<00:01:10.900> once<00:01:11.229> I

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
I'll get more height out of it - once I

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.580 
I'll get more height out of it - once I
get<00:01:12.550> some<00:01:12.760> bigger<00:01:12.970> tires<00:01:13.270> on<00:01:13.600> it<00:01:13.780> probably<00:01:14.350> get

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
get some bigger tires on it probably get

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.800 
get some bigger tires on it probably get
another<00:01:14.710> inch<00:01:15.300> it's<00:01:16.300> gonna<00:01:16.450> get<00:01:16.600> a<00:01:16.659> little

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
another inch it's gonna get a little

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:17.460 
another inch it's gonna get a little
taller

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
taller

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.560 
taller
these<00:01:17.860> are<00:01:18.009> thirty<00:01:18.220> twos<00:01:18.460> right<00:01:18.759> now<00:01:18.940> so<00:01:19.240> and

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
these are thirty twos right now so and

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.460 
these are thirty twos right now so and
they're<00:01:19.930> pretty<00:01:20.050> bald<00:01:20.380> they're<00:01:20.950> not<00:01:21.100> a<00:01:22.470> too

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
they're pretty bald they're not a too

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.490 
they're pretty bald they're not a too
much<00:01:23.649> tread<00:01:23.890> left<00:01:24.040> so<00:01:24.810> that's<00:01:25.810> the<00:01:25.930> side<00:01:26.170> shot

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
much tread left so that's the side shot

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.030 
much tread left so that's the side shot
how<00:01:26.800> it<00:01:27.009> looks

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
how it looks

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.440 
how it looks
there's<00:01:30.040> are<00:01:30.220> the<00:01:30.310> shocks<00:01:30.640> that<00:01:30.880> I<00:01:31.000> got<00:01:31.210> right

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
there's are the shocks that I got right

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.630 
there's are the shocks that I got right
here<00:01:32.070> yeah

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.080 

as<00:01:35.820> sex

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:58.859 

their<00:01:42.450> nitrogen

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.450 

so<00:01:59.439> in<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.710> rear<00:01:59.920> they<00:02:00.490> said<00:02:00.759> my<00:02:00.969> exhaust

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
so in the rear they said my exhaust

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.419 
so in the rear they said my exhaust
wasn't<00:02:03.460> going<00:02:03.579> to<00:02:03.640> work<00:02:03.759> out<00:02:04.000> anymore<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:05.740> they

wasn't going to work out anymore so they
end<00:02:06.969> up<00:02:07.060> cutting<00:02:07.359> my<00:02:07.600> exhaust<00:02:07.960> Andrey<00:02:08.440> bending

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
end up cutting my exhaust Andrey bending

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.540 
end up cutting my exhaust Andrey bending
it<00:02:08.979> and<00:02:09.009> this<00:02:09.280> is<00:02:09.429> what<00:02:09.580> they<00:02:09.700> did<00:02:10.709> they<00:02:11.709> put<00:02:12.280> a

little weld there as you can see in

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.559 
little weld there as you can see in
fresh<00:02:14.950> piece<00:02:15.160> of<00:02:15.310> pipe

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569

back to the lift shocks again the new
shackle<00:02:24.680> flip<00:02:24.799> in<00:02:25.159> the<00:02:25.280> rear

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
shackle flip in the rear

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.300 
shackle flip in the rear
that's<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:27.020> setup<00:02:27.950> right<00:02:28.280> there

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
vibration I was feeling I don't know

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.820 
vibration I was feeling I don't know
that<00:02:36.470> looks<00:02:36.800> out<00:02:37.840> of<00:02:38.840> whack<00:02:39.170> to<00:02:39.410> you<00:02:39.470> with<00:02:39.709> us

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
that looks out of whack to you with us

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.540 
that looks out of whack to you with us
the<00:02:40.130> drive<00:02:40.880> shaft<00:02:41.209> to<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.510> rear<00:02:41.660> differential

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
the drive shaft to the rear differential

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:59.490 
the drive shaft to the rear differential
that's<00:02:43.550> how<00:02:43.760> it<00:02:43.970> sits

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.220 

and<00:03:00.070> now<00:03:00.460> my<00:03:00.640> exhaust<00:03:01.030> is<00:03:01.330> a<00:03:01.360> little<00:03:01.660> crooked<00:03:01.870> -

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
and now my exhaust is a little crooked -

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.430 
and now my exhaust is a little crooked -
doesn't<00:03:05.230> exactly<00:03:05.800> look<00:03:06.370> even<00:03:07.060> anymore<00:03:07.480> or

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
doesn't exactly look even anymore or

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:34.360 
doesn't exactly look even anymore or
symmetrical

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.280 

same<00:03:34.850> thing<00:03:35.090> on<00:03:35.210> this<00:03:35.360> side<00:03:35.630> they<00:03:35.840> cut<00:03:36.110> my

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
same thing on this side they cut my

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.050 
same thing on this side they cut my
exhaust

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.640 

just<00:03:40.599> got<00:03:40.810> a<00:03:41.110> ridiculous

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:47.659 
let's see flip on this side of the

00:03:47.659 --> 00:04:03.870 
let's see flip on this side of the
shackle
