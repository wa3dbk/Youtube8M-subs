to see all of your modular hardpoint

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.130 
to see all of your modular hardpoint
components<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.880> can<00:00:27.510> be<00:00:27.630> swapped<00:00:27.869> out<00:00:28.080> of

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
components that can be swapped out of

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.410 
components that can be swapped out of
customizing<00:00:28.980> go<00:00:29.460> around<00:00:29.730> customizing<00:00:30.390> your

customizing go around customizing your

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.260 
customizing go around customizing your
ship<00:00:30.830> this<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.579> basic<00:00:32.790> hangar

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
ship this is this is the basic hangar

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.840 
ship this is this is the basic hangar
it's<00:00:33.510> kind<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.809> fancy<00:00:34.290> know<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:35.309> yeah<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.670> is

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
it's kind of fancy know so yeah this is

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.450 
it's kind of fancy know so yeah this is
an<00:00:35.969> early<00:00:36.120> early<00:00:36.989> look<00:00:37.260> at<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.649> hangar

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
an early early look at the the hangar

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.490 
an early early look at the the hangar
it's<00:00:38.610> about<00:00:38.879> fifty<00:00:39.600> percent<00:00:39.629> fleshed<00:00:40.320> out

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
it's about fifty percent fleshed out

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.780 
it's about fifty percent fleshed out
right<00:00:40.770> now<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> lot<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.340> things<00:00:41.430> are<00:00:41.610> still

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
right now a lot of things are still

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.250 
right now a lot of things are still
temporary<00:00:42.239> but<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.570> gives<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.870> kind<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.140> a

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
temporary but it gives you a kind of a

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.540 
temporary but it gives you a kind of a
good<00:00:43.410> base<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:43.980> what<00:00:44.190> it's<00:00:44.309> going<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.489> look

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
good base on what it's going to look

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.670 
good base on what it's going to look
like<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.539> people<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:45.930> have<00:00:46.079> pledged<00:00:46.379> more

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
like the people that have pledged more

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.920 
like the people that have pledged more
or<00:00:46.980> upon<00:00:47.309> bigger<00:00:47.610> better<00:00:47.940> ships<00:00:48.329> they<00:00:48.750> will

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
or upon bigger better ships they will

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.290 
or upon bigger better ships they will
actually<00:00:49.079> get<00:00:49.379> an<00:00:49.770> upgraded<00:00:50.399> hangar<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:51.120> is

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
actually get an upgraded hangar this is

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.060 
actually get an upgraded hangar this is
from<00:00:51.449> my<00:00:51.570> Aurora<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.320> what<00:00:52.500> if<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.680> have<00:00:52.890> like

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
from my Aurora and what if I have like

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.040 
from my Aurora and what if I have like
more<00:00:53.309> than<00:00:53.520> one<00:00:53.730> ship<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.510> like<00:00:54.629> if<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.809> have<00:00:54.930> my

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
more than one ship so like if I have my

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.860 
more than one ship so like if I have my
Cutlass<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.820> complete<00:00:57.270> modular

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
Cutlass so this is a complete modular

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.229 
Cutlass so this is a complete modular
system<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.710> through<00:00:59.219> engineering<00:00:59.699> can

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
system that through engineering can

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.510 
system that through engineering can
automatically<00:01:00.899> duplicate<00:01:01.530> himself<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.250> we

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
automatically duplicate himself and we

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.179 
automatically duplicate himself and we
will<00:01:02.789> take<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.180> west<00:01:04.140> wall<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:05.010> will

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
will take the west wall and it will

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.160 
will take the west wall and it will
slide<00:01:05.850> all<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.150> way<00:01:06.270> down<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.750> end<00:01:06.840> and

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
slide all the way down to the end and

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.020 
slide all the way down to the end and
take<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.560> center<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.369> will<00:01:08.520> literally

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
take the center and it will literally

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.789 
take the center and it will literally
duplicate<00:01:09.659> based<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:10.110> how<00:01:10.260> many<00:01:10.320> ships<00:01:10.619> you

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
duplicate based on how many ships you

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.890 
duplicate based on how many ships you
have<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.280> will<00:01:11.460> automatically<00:01:11.939> expand<00:01:12.630> and

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
have so it will automatically expand and

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.050 
have so it will automatically expand and
contract<00:01:13.020> my<00:01:13.799> little<00:01:14.010> avatar<00:01:14.369> there<00:01:14.729> I'll<00:01:14.909> be

ship<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.659> start<00:01:22.049> with<00:01:22.380> getting<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.070> concept

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
ship you start with getting the concept

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.020 
ship you start with getting the concept
art<00:01:24.229> Elijah<00:01:25.229> has<00:01:25.619> created<00:01:26.430> all<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.850> original

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
art Elijah has created all the original

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.200 
art Elijah has created all the original
concept<00:01:27.689> art<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.170> we've<00:01:28.320> been<00:01:28.860> using<00:01:29.180> then<00:01:30.180> I

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
concept art that we've been using then I

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.780 
concept art that we've been using then I
take<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.320> then<00:01:31.890> dish<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.310> out<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.670> make

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
take it and then dish it out to make

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.340 
take it and then dish it out to make
sure<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:33.119> gets<00:01:33.180> made<00:01:33.420> properly<00:01:33.840> or<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.200> just

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
sure it gets made properly or I just

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.580 
sure it gets made properly or I just
make<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.920> myself<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.610> then<00:01:36.240> take<00:01:37.110> everything

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
make it myself and then take everything

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.910 
make it myself and then take everything
and<00:01:37.770> just<00:01:38.060> start<00:01:39.060> building<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.600> out<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.770> what's

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
and just start building it out so what's

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.410 
and just start building it out so what's
the<00:01:40.979> point<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.430> hang<00:01:41.579> around<00:01:41.700> then<00:01:42.060> what

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
the point of the hang around then what

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.219 
the point of the hang around then what
can<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.659> do<00:01:43.430> well<00:01:44.430> on<00:01:44.640> top<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:45.180> be<00:01:45.329> able<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.570> see

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
can I do well on top of be able to see
