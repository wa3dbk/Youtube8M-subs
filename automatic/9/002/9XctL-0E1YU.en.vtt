00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.710
 after repair you have pieces left 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.929
 unused wallpaper don't rush them 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.849
 get rid of. Volkova will tell you how 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:18.160
 originally they can be used in 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:21.160
 hello to your apartment my dear you 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.460
 All things are called upon the world I am sure that 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.800
 and there is an unnecessary roll in your home or 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.840
 the rest is an abortion but you know sometimes when 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.849
 such a piece remains to us it seems 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.980
 God forbid handy under the wall 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:36.220
 scratch or child draw something a 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.160
 I washed it down again, but yes, and more often 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.350
 it will be like that joke does not burn or 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.060
 I once had it when I searched and 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.160
 I was looking for and where did I put it and yes 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.200
 found it happens but today we 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.670
 let's see what amazing things you can 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.250
 make a roll of wallpaper 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.380
 and this and update our interior and 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.230
 there will be an irreplaceable thing you can do here 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.540
 Such an original watch is the simplest 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.250
 watches that you can buy enough 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.390
 cheap or which we already have at home 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.520
 but we want to update them 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.710
 breathe new life into them we take 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.500
 cut a piece of wallpaper neatly 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.509
 round this part we disassemble the watch itself 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.000
 that is, we remove the glass we remove 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.710
 neatly arrows paste glue 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.390
 pva can be any glue that is at home 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.670
 and neatly return to the place and 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.200
 arrows and glass here we will turn 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.960
 such original cute clean and 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.899
 you can not say that this wallpaper that remained 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.810
 losses that we still have we 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:30.460
 Here is a picture of the organizer something 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.560
 like we did when the rack for 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.310
 decorations yes that is, the base frame is taken 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:39.280
 from the picture to the base of the cardboard we 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:44.319
 paste the rest of the wallpaper then take 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:46.090
 gum cross them fasten and fix 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:48.069
 buttons in the middle where they are 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.659
 intersect it now real 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:51.609
 organizer and here we can put 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.380
 photos of close friends with some 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:55.509
 parties or unusual on your 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.520
 adventure just some emotions all 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.990
 what do you have in the house that require 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.049
 of a certain place 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.270
 somewhere you can store stored right on 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.889
 this board organizer even little notes 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.440
 we can attach each other 

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:10.360
 We write from time to time definitely very 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.610
 comfortable and beautiful 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.310
 i like the flesh of the frame which 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.950
 decorated too clearly with the help of pieces 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.840
 both yes and their whole thing is 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.640
 that these frames will be part of 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.230
 your interior, that is, these are already paintings 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.460
 from wallpaper 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.170
 yet again you can put here 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.880
 of course, and the photo is loved and 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.380
 some picture but here is the most 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.780
 an important point which we absolutely do not 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.430
 spent money to make it 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.030
 do because some old framework 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.040
 already been 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.720
 and pieces of wallpaper were left after 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.520
 repair is unknown where to put them and here 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.970
 Today such an application is about. you found 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.560
 Is the lamp beautiful from 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.020
 leftover wallpaper up 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.690
 it's all the same from the remnants of wallpaper and 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.820
 how to make this lamp and surely you 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.090
 you will find and I will certainly teach you all 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.820
 right now can not even believe that I have 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.560
 will turn out very gentle very beautiful and 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.989
 I can not believe it's your own hands 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.330
 did yes that's really 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.209
 old old lamp his top 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.709
 part of me has already turned yellow 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.300
 spoiled and it would be necessary to update it and 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.270
 of course by the way wallpaper 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.580
 same nuance is the intersection of some 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.530
 elements I had a piece of wall made 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.420
 other wallpaper and of course a piece 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.519
 little stayed i did the same here 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.560
 option as I propose to do to you 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.690
 but there must be some 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.000
 requirements for both which can 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.250
 use for the lamp after all 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.750
 in the same place it will heat the lamp if 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.370
 put in our lamp 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.320
 energy saving light then it is not 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.870
 heats up and it's perfectly safe 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.250
 if we have some old version 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.620
 can use just enough 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.320
 tight fire and so we remove the top 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.970
 part of our lamp shade with him nothing we 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.410
 we will not do we will glue the wallpaper 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.900
 over this lampshade 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.030
 and this is another defense 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.720
 from a light bulb once before, he stood it 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.340
 and now to be sure we take our 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.700
 lamp shade and scroll it 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.380
 and at the same time introduce us yes because 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.989
 if we make a regular striped 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.829
 Of course, it will not fall on ours 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:12.400
 lamp shade as i exactly do the main thing here 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:15.160
 so that the hand does not flinch is desirable 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.820
 do it without taking the lampshade off the roll 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.400
 wallpaper 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.930
 we are following the line we 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.940
 creates the lampshade itself 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:27.710
 and now we do the same 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:29.449
 interior and if the child close 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.860
 it turned out that it could be more 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.080
 small geometry lesson 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:36.350
 of course because who would have thought 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.870
 that using a lampshade can create 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.560
 such beautiful circles by the way about 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.259
 children 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.910
 Vanechka your something drew on both in 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:46.130
 childhood he is such an active guy you then 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:50.360
 I will tell you that I did not even 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:52.880
 scolded and we had a special compartment in 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.759
 apartment special stenochka where we 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.949
 dispersed the plot basement and we are there 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:59.930
 allowed him to draw and pencils and 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:02.240
 markers and paints 7 than only 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.520
 can we give him our will we basically 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.960
 generally stick to these read what 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.520
 we have forbidden us in childhood us on 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.680
 in fact they are by this moment they 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.419
 remember why the cake could not be 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.250
 never take the top chocolate bar or 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.289
 jelly because it will be for some reason 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.120
 for everyone ugly it was us 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:18.889
 incomprehensible and we always allowed vanka 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.960
 the fact that childhood forbade us including 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:23.300
 and draw a set I'm afraid to even assume 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.280
 I still think that some 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.130
 bans your parents and husband were 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:32.210
 reasonable not well of course some kind of framework 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:33.620
 there in our resolutions here but we 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.840
 was just the price already initially 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.919
 old enough for him 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.110
 presented well, of course, that it is so 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:43.580
 only today we allow not because 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.470
 Anyway, they wanted half a year later. 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.270
 do repairs and now these six months he could 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:50.630
 there already come off in full and 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:54.229
 so we will show ready 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:57.229
 cut element is the most basic now 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:59.360
 it neatly evenly attach 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:00.770
 again come back because 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.830
 this can be done with hot 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:06.139
 glue it fast enough but here we are 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.789
 remember that the glue hardens quickly 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:09.440
 if somewhere something moves either 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:10.909
 a fold is formed then of course it is necessary 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.460
 will redo the glue 

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:15.759
 and with pva you can do it 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:20.449
 much easier we put right on our 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:22.960
 shade glue and do it 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:25.759
 also put it on the wand 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.710
 taped wallpaper leveled 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:30.760
 and just as went 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.710
 around the circle we glue tight 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.440
 she grabbed right away pretty well 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:37.180
 that is, there is no need 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.010
 fix something well 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.940
 again want the same clothespins 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.130
 can be fixed 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.410
 one to two hours and completely dried our 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.540
 god that you can add more of course 

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:48.160
 we never stop at that 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.750
 who would doubt of course we want 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.930
 decorating more and more because 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.580
 here we still used satin ribbon 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.250
 thin strip that we let 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:07:00.130
 on top of this we have hidden the edges of the wallpaper 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:02.680
 and beautifully decorated with glue too 

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:04.810
 glue can be the same reason also glue 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.570
 and on top and here from the bottom side also 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.100
 to add colors then novel 

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:11.560
 we used the same ribbons below 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:14.500
 just let here such beautiful 

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:16.240
 Tape a lampshade is not ashamed to give 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:19.270
 of course thank you to someone 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.310
 I’m pretty sure that you are looking for 

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:23.290
 remnants of wallpaper at home and correctly 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:25.510
 do because of the ideas 

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:28.380
 darling wolf you our house will be even 

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.380
 more beautiful
