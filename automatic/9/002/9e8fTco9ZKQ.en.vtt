00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.670
 in a mythical club 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.550

 inter continental champions but what 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.370
 we retain mainly unceasingly 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.260
 a shot of brazil and especially his eleven 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.129

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.189
 his career there will only be two years 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.880
 and will still be champion of the states 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.740

 against Argentina a match was 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.079
 enough for peeled to become 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.240
 holder within the selection 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.619
 Brazilian a titular place that 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.479
 will allow him to participate in his 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.360
 first world cup that brazil 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.399

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.340
 four hundred and fifty matches he will be 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.590
 sacred afterwards athletes of the century 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.759
 best players of the 20th century and done 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.709
 so left the april team fifa in 2013 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.179
 he receives the golden ball of honor because at 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:11.000
 his time this one was reserved 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.010
 only to European players 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.630
 for the little story according skinned 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.400
 best goal he's scored was facing 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.849
 the juventude during a match of 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.680
 championship 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.019
 this goal was not filming but a 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.269
 3d reproduction has been done is indeed 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.160
 that was awesome pellet 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.290
 chained four sombrero shots of which 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.220
 one to the guardian to finally register 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.220
 a goal of the head 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.840
 this world cup of 1950 was a 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.939
 conch that marked my life I had 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.970
 about 9-10 years old and my dad playing a 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:46.560
 dam for atlético club in the north 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:56.159
 and there was a great rivalry between 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:57.810
 the bar atletico and loire and my father 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:00.890
 play ball atletico which was a 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.890
 great figure of the club at the time 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.099
 I was at baron doing the job 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.959
 party because Brazil had just won 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.790
 the matches until the final and I saw 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.139
 my dad with barrow players in 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.430
 set the table on the party 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:27.069
 we consumed with the children of 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:29.409
 corner of voices always so beautiful 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.700
 and suddenly there was a silence I 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.090
 saw my father and all the players very 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.709
 sad 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.120
 so I turned to my father and 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.840
 I tell him but what is happening 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.739
 Emma father told me we lost the ball 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.319
 started crying 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.939
 and there I say to myself do not make dad we have 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:52.269
 lost but by the way he cuts the world 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:53.709
 for you I killed let's say that this 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.599
 story is important is that the pit 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.519
 years later with 17 years brazil 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.409
 was in sweden months in the selection and 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.090
 we won the World Cup and this 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:03.209
 moment I will remember all my 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.209
 life 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:10.180
 today we are attacking the map 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.859
 peeled legend which at the base is the 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.169
 best player of the game general level 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:18.280
 without counting of course the notes and the 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:20.859
 totti physical side only glass 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.720
 almost extraordinary estap alone 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.910
 small flat may be 160 hours in 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.419
 force but good all that green offsets 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.770
 largely this little flaw 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.900
 mental side it's still something 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.620
 not very aggressive and not very good 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.870
 interceptions 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:39.039
 peeled however has a vision of the game and 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:41.320
 a positioning always impeccable and 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:44.020
 there, of course, ladies and gentlemen 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:47.199
 it's simply amazing glass 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.000
 glass and green again the only ones 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:50.919
 notes below 80 are the notes 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.900
 defensive as marking and 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:55.509
 tackles for the rest his stats are 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.229
 all above 81 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:58.229
 what more do you say 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.180
 the price as for him we know it is 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.639
 extremely expensive you can you 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.509
 provide 9.6 million credits 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:13.039
 and 14.4 me their keyboards 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:14.960
 before you introduce the gameplay I 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:16.550
 wanted to thank Mr. Steamer 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.740
 have passed me his gameplay to get 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.819
 blairer view do not hesitate to check his 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.440
 string the link will be in the description 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:26.599
 for this review peppers decided to 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.729
 place in a Brazilian team with 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:30.880
 on the other hand as salvatore guardian 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:30.880
 Sirigu 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:39.800
 peel the best player in the world but 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:42.620
 also the best player on fifa a 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.479
 formidable finishing in front of the cages of the 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.080
 left or right in all 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:47.120
 positions 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.560
 these strikes are dangerous a little 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:54.020
 normal you will say with 191 in finish 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.280
 a phenomenal just impossible speed 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.289
 to catch up so fast he is 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.150
 combined with its 5 stars gesture 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:01.130
 technical and his 93 years dribbling is 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.169
 simple on the ground it's breaking of 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:06.719
 kidney on row breaking 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:09.240
 his ball control and 94 and just 

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:11.610
 out of the ordinary his vision of the game 96 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:15.020
 combined with its quality of pass and valence 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:17.580
 caviars in all directions 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.379
 kick stopped bar nothing to say 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.449
 above just know how to shoot them 

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:23.509
 to put them in the bottom of the nets what 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:26.669
 it happens 

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:28.710
 these contributions high perfect perfect 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:30.800
 for had always been well positioned 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.029
 always there at the right time 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.189
 you are taught nothing at this 

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:36.860
 review i think peeled is just 

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:38.849
 phenomenal 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.469
 regarding its strengths and 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:43.169
 weak points to low first the 

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:45.240
 strengths and finish the speed 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:47.669
 the dribbles the passes control of 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.639
 4-star ball in bad shape 4 

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:52.289
 stars in vista technical gesture 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:55.020
 positioning set kicks sow 

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:56.310
 and the game head for its weak points 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.529
 baiona 2 1 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.819
 the price is not us at all 

00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:02.849
 world even though for a player this 

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:04.469
 exception its low price is deserved and its 

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:05.909
 force the mines between brackets because 

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:07.740
 we're done it's way too much 

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:09.389
 physically moved but hey it's often 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.039
 in the surface of which cuba he gets 

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:14.819
 always back penaltys and an advantage 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:16.800
 and a disadvantage at the same time you 

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:19.349
 you will doubt it for a player of this 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.300
 exception it's of course 20 out of 20 

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:25.219
 which is attributed to him for the king peeled 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:25.219
 it could not be otherwise 

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.060
