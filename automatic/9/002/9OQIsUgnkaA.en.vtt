00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.080
 hello my name is simon of one 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.700
 quali building de in this second part 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.740
 my little series on the topic 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.630
 Training plans are about the topic 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.430
 basic exercises complex exercises 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.050
 I will explain why it is so 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.869
 important is complex exercises 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.150
 perform and thereby effectively muscles 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.550
 to grow under complex 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.500
 Exercises are exercises when in 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.929
 claimed different muscle groups 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.360
 will do this exercise for you 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.130
 examples to this, the bench press at 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.410
 Bench press is primarily so first 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.149
 line the chest muscles addressed 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.899
 but it will also be the triceps 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.640
 addressed 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.770
 it also addresses the shoulder 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.110
 piece far the biceps and depending on the 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.719
 video the whole says also the prince 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.550
 establish muscle with claims that 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.160
 contrary to a complex exercise 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.199
 The isolation exercise at the isolation 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.420
 Exercise you train a muscle as possible 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.160
 isolated the name already says of all 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.690
 other muscles that means you want 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.120
 really just that one muscle 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.909
 urally want to claim too 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.040
 claimed example of this is the biceps 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.070
 cologne is best still with nicole board 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.869
 then his forearm is supported by the 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.820
 The upper arm is approximately supported 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.650
 move so that you actually only 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.290
 the biceps only the biceps if possible 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.240
 claimed and just other muscles that 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.360
 could be claimed as well 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.460
 as possible left out 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.759
 why are complex exercises now better 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.560
 as an isolated exercise for muscle building 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.540
 be very clear with complex exercises 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.360
 different muscle groups different 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.950
 muscles interact with each other 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.200
 that means many different things 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.530
 Muscles have to do work and work 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.180
 many different muscles become his 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.860
 growth factors released the 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.659
 of course that means his entire 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.770
 Body of this complex exercise 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.240
 can benefit 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.020
 because in many different ways 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.759
 Muscle Small Muscles Just These 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.159
 factor distribution is produced 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.899
 another reason why complex exercise 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.210
 that's a bit better 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.810
 make the body more even 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.090
 trained 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.910
 For example, if you cologne only biceps 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.099
 Would you then have in relatively expensive 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.630
 complete biceps but maybe 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.280
 another muscle groups for example 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.050
 money for apps then lean against it 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.310
 that means you can be your body 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.709
 so a bit out of the optical 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.910
 training balance then looks 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.220
 Of course not so good for that reason 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.450
 keep complex exercises always in the body 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.800
 train entire package 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.630
 and of course you always have one 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.160
 even training so the whole 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.010
 of course also harmonious from the 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.450
 aesthetics looks good another reason 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.890
 I'm just here who else 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.780
 want to mention is that of course 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.670
 in everyday life on strains 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.230
 For example, in the box itself 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.489
 of course, then drag 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.030
 any exercises you can do in the 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.560
 Gym observes cross very good 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.330
 Exercises are about living on these 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.340
 to prepare daily load 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.040
 that means you train easily 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.750
 Realistic actually better that way 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.650
 you still stress in everyday life better 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.390
 can master 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.640
 simply hold on under the stroke 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.849
 Complex exercises are for the 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.860
 Muscle building enormously important my tip for 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.630
 theme complex exercises always try 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.400
 possible at the beginning of yours 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.239
 Workout complex exercises 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.549
 perform 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.859
 So there was still full power there 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.630
 You should run complex around later 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:17.670
 in the further course of the training 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.989
 30 maybe 40 minutes you have 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.940
 certainly no longer the power as yet 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.980
 at the beginning there you can also 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.290
 thanks to fatigue then to the 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.359
 Reach and seek isolation 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.280
 Exercise from around just a muscle again 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:30.239
 make really, really want us times 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.459
 to say very clearly 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.440
 can claim again and then 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.450
 he may still have his biceps isolated 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.340
 but already train in advance 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.250
 you have done the complex exercise too 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.290
 biceps have already claimed as I said 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.250
 complex in order to always isolations 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.139
 to prefer exercise 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.370
 I named the reasons for that and it 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:49.260
 It is very important that you do this 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.989
 Complex exercises against the training plan 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.760
 Install and at every training session 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.230
 complex then that's it 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.760
 first of all so far from me to this part 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.380
 this little series on the topic 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.579
 training plans already go to mine 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.060
 other videos 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.959
 to this little series 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.459
 I would be happy if you could meet me 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.500
 subscribe to me here and one 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:09.030
 positive rating is that it was then 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.030
 much bigger simon
