00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:07.750
 so that you will become this 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.320
 year we got this show 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.320
 columbo 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.730
 the columbo the com 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.430
 that was 16 years that was loaded in that way 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:23.790
 Of course they are so from Africa 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.630
 Brasil and you evening crow your own 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.260
 word hidden at secret place and that 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.260
 was a cinema 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.960
 the concept of the nouveau cirque 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.450
 german new circus is in france 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:54.399
 has been known in Germany for some time 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:56.259
 the idea is still relatively new, the 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.469
 difference is in france 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:02.350
 the circus in contact so that it like 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:04.479
 dance or opera or theater in 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:10.929
 Germany it is entertainment 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:12.670
 still because of running with circus flic flac 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.410
 is okay what we do 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.880
 We are not commercial projects 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.860
 or 24 marashi couture 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.780
 that this mixture only doses this 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.630
 mix of theater shows in 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.989
 panels play without language that 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.819
 one only with pictures and live music and and 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:31.510
 that 's right with a drama 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.819
 animal love then history and this 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:39.030
 mix of theater dance easily 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:39.030
 music circus art comedy this is music 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.100
 the show program is very poetic 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.220
 live music with elements from africa 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.989
 Argentina and the Balkans that no 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.100
 Animals in the show are falling here 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.100
 not at all 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.920
 if I think that's not all that much 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.080
 better without animal 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.420
 clearly the audience loves them 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.220
 hereby children to see the lion or 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.220
 elephant i dont know here is better 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.470
 in freedom for me and i think that 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.500
 People like we said have found our lobby 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.410

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.640
 they are from marl and they are clear 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.100
 that no elephant probably like that 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.350
 is small and then slowly the 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.210
 coming show or slow the war thing 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.790
 offered and will not be anymore 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:41.170
 falls because we bring a lot of strong 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.170
 the emotion to the people 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.770

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:04.440
 single show inserts composed in front of it 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:08.890
 you have to write for all musicians go 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:13.000
 create music and then have to show in the show 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:16.350
 I myself play my partner and 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.350
