00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.150 
to fix our teamwork like it's still good
but<00:02:46.599> we<00:02:46.690> still<00:02:46.870> lose<00:02:47.019> a<00:02:47.079> few<00:02:47.349> dragons<00:02:47.829> early

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
but we still lose a few dragons early

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.410 
but we still lose a few dragons early
and<00:02:48.280> stuff<00:02:48.430> like<00:02:48.549> that<00:02:48.610> so<00:02:48.790> you<00:02:49.000> just<00:02:49.120> need<00:02:49.299> to

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
and stuff like that so you just need to

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.059 
and stuff like that so you just need to
work<00:02:49.569> on<00:02:49.660> objectives<00:02:50.200> because<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.859> finger

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
work on objectives because the finger

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.440 
work on objectives because the finger
laning<00:02:51.400> phase<00:02:51.549> and<00:02:51.760> individual<00:02:52.150> skill<00:02:52.359> is

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
laning phase and individual skill is

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.479 
laning phase and individual skill is
pretty<00:02:52.629> good<00:02:52.780> right<00:02:52.989> now<00:02:53.170> but<00:02:53.769> our<00:02:54.099> teamwork

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
pretty good right now but our teamwork

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.750 
pretty good right now but our teamwork
still<00:02:54.790> lacks<00:02:55.000> a<00:02:55.120> bit<00:02:55.829> before<00:02:56.829> we<00:02:57.040> go<00:02:57.549> over<00:02:57.670> to
