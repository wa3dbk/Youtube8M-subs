00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
for a pc haven't entirely decided what

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
it is yet but i think it's going to be

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.299 
it is yet but i think it's going to be
more<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.660> budget<00:00:36.870> orientated<00:00:37.680> one<00:00:37.860> as<00:00:38.070> those

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
more of a budget orientated one as those

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.010 
more of a budget orientated one as those
are<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.520> ones<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.969> most<00:00:39.420> people<00:00:39.780> are

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
are the ones that most people are

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.650 
are the ones that most people are
actually<00:00:40.350> looking<00:00:40.890> for<00:00:41.250> as<00:00:42.120> well<00:00:42.180> what<00:00:42.510> else

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
actually looking for as well what else

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.299 
actually looking for as well what else

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
really happy that was the very first

really happy that was the very first
press<00:00:48.600> copy<00:00:48.870> I've<00:00:49.200> ever<00:00:49.739> received<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.520> any

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.330 
press copy I've ever received of any
game<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.079> meant<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.440> actually<00:00:52.649> got<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.219> a

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
game so that meant I actually got it a

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.830 
game so that meant I actually got it a
little<00:00:53.610> bit<00:00:53.760> earlier<00:00:53.910> than<00:00:54.210> everyone<00:00:54.570> else

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
little bit earlier than everyone else

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.229 
little bit earlier than everyone else
and<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.320> meant<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.649> actually<00:00:55.829> got<00:00:56.820> some<00:00:56.969> time

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
with the game before release so i can

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.139

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
and people's faces so yeah overall I

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.950 
and people's faces so yeah overall I
think<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.670> sims<00:01:47.880> 4<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.299> actually<00:01:48.570> great<00:01:48.720> good

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
think the sims 4 is actually great good

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.719 
think the sims 4 is actually great good
and<00:01:48.990> if<00:01:49.259> you're<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.470> fan<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.159> sims<00:01:50.369> i<00:01:50.549> think

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
and if you're a fan of the sims i think

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.580 
and if you're a fan of the sims i think
it's<00:01:50.850> definitely<00:01:51.030> worth<00:01:51.390> checking<00:01:51.420> out<00:01:51.930> but

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
it's definitely worth checking out but

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.950 
it's definitely worth checking out but
pretty<00:01:52.890> much<00:01:52.950> as<00:01:53.280> predicted<00:01:53.909> if<00:01:54.090> you're<00:01:54.630> not<00:01:54.899> a

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
pretty much as predicted if you're not a

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.660 
pretty much as predicted if you're not a
fan<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.470> sims<00:01:55.680> then<00:01:55.950> this<00:01:56.159> isn't<00:01:56.310> going<00:01:56.579> to

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
fan of the sims then this isn't going to

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.370 
fan of the sims then this isn't going to
really<00:01:56.880> change<00:01:57.090> your<00:01:57.240> opinion<00:01:57.780> but<00:01:58.170> what's

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
really change your opinion but what's

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.810 
really change your opinion but what's

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
actually going to happen once this

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.999 
actually going to happen once this

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
didn't have so much time I didn't have

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.210 
didn't have so much time I didn't have
the<00:02:15.360> equipment<00:02:15.570> but<00:02:15.990> I<00:02:16.020> did<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.620> best<00:02:16.860> with

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
the equipment but I did the best with

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.800 
the equipment but I did the best with
what<00:02:17.280> I<00:02:17.400> had<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.880> I<00:02:17.970> was<00:02:18.120> pretty<00:02:18.330> pleased<00:02:18.690> with

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
what I had and I was pretty pleased with

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.470 
what I had and I was pretty pleased with
the<00:02:18.990> results<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.950> viewer<00:02:20.520> response<00:02:21.060> to

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
the results and the viewer response to

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.270 
the results and the viewer response to
what<00:02:21.840> i<00:02:21.870> had<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.500> lighting<00:02:22.860> i<00:02:22.950> think<00:02:23.160> was

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
what i had the lighting i think was

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.850 
what i had the lighting i think was
better<00:02:23.520> in<00:02:23.730> there<00:02:24.360> anyway<00:02:24.780> so<00:02:25.020> what's<00:02:25.710> going

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
better in there anyway so what's going

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.260 
better in there anyway so what's going
to<00:02:25.920> be<00:02:26.130> different<00:02:26.280> this<00:02:26.550> time<00:02:26.610> well<00:02:27.030> it's

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
to be different this time well it's

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.640 
to be different this time well it's
going<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.480> be<00:02:27.570> a<00:02:27.600> similar<00:02:28.050> structure<00:02:28.350> in<00:02:28.590> the

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
going to be a similar structure in the

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.770 
going to be a similar structure in the
sense<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:28.950> there<00:02:29.190> be<00:02:29.370> some<00:02:29.610> detailed<00:02:30.420> videos

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
sense that there be some detailed videos

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.450 
sense that there be some detailed videos

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
difference is I won't have quite as much

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.860 
difference is I won't have quite as much
time<00:02:53.490> as<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:53.760> do<00:02:53.820> now<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.150> actually<00:02:54.510> go<00:02:54.840> through

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
time as I do now to actually go through

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.620 
time as I do now to actually go through
and<00:02:55.140> write<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.710> load<00:02:55.950> of<00:02:56.100> simple<00:02:57.060> guides<00:02:57.300> and

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
and write a load of simple guides and

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.260 
and write a load of simple guides and
stuff<00:02:58.080> like<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.290> so<00:02:59.040> those<00:02:59.490> will<00:02:59.670> be<00:02:59.730> kind<00:03:00.180> of

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
stuff like that so those will be kind of

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.720 
stuff like that so those will be kind of
kept<00:03:00.480> minimal<00:03:00.990> to<00:03:01.320> just<00:03:01.590> one<00:03:01.770> a<00:03:01.800> week<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.250> then

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
kept minimal to just one a week and then

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.190 
kept minimal to just one a week and then
the<00:03:02.850> other<00:03:02.880> two<00:03:03.180> if<00:03:03.510> I<00:03:03.690> don't<00:03:03.750> have<00:03:04.080> any

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
the other two if I don't have any
