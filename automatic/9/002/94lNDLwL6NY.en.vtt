of a really high dollar production
machine<00:00:38.399> but<00:00:39.090> it's<00:00:39.210> going<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.360> be<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.629> probably

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
machine but it's going to be it probably

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.709 
machine but it's going to be it probably
a<00:00:40.260> half<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.190> quarter<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.700> cost<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.570> you

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
a half to a quarter of the cost that you

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.540 
a half to a quarter of the cost that you
would<00:00:42.840> spend<00:00:43.170> in<00:00:43.680> order<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:43.980> buy<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.370> machine

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
would spend in order to buy that machine

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.959 
would spend in order to buy that machine
now<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.660> will<00:00:45.840> do<00:00:46.020> three<00:00:47.010> inch<00:00:47.219> up<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.610> three

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
now this will do three inch up to three

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.940 
now this will do three inch up to three
inch<00:00:48.149> stainless<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.200> oh<00:00:49.230> six<00:00:49.680> five

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
inch stainless this is oh six five

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.189 
inch stainless this is oh six five
stainless<00:00:50.760> steel<00:00:50.940> which<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.210> not<00:00:51.480> easy<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.960> do

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
stainless steel which is not easy to do

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.889 
stainless steel which is not easy to do
obviously<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.460> thing<00:00:53.520> will<00:00:53.879> do<00:00:54.030> steel

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
obviously this thing will do steel

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.650 
obviously this thing will do steel
aluminum<00:00:55.860> usually<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.030> machine<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.480> good

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
aluminum usually this machine is good

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.170

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
for about one inch to three inch but two

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.639 
for about one inch to three inch but two
to<00:01:00.329> three<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.719> what<00:01:00.870> your<00:01:00.989> normal<00:01:01.079> standard

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
to three is what your normal standard

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.170 
to three is what your normal standard

demonstration<00:01:11.549> I'm<00:01:12.479> gonna<00:01:12.600> show<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.780> how

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
demonstration I'm gonna show you how

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.410 
demonstration I'm gonna show you how
simple<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.799> make<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> 180<00:01:14.369> degree<00:01:15.000> Bend

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
simple it is to make a 180 degree Bend

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.260 
simple it is to make a 180 degree Bend
so<00:01:15.990> I'm<00:01:16.080> push<00:01:16.259> desired<00:01:16.740> bend<00:01:17.250> angle<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:18.180> know

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
so I'm push desired bend angle you know

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.830 
so I'm push desired bend angle you know
we're<00:01:18.689> going<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.840> put<00:01:18.950> 181<00:01:19.950> eight<00:01:20.130> zero<00:01:20.490> zero

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
we're going to put 181 eight zero zero

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.469 
we're going to put 181 eight zero zero
press<00:01:21.840> ENTER<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.820> if<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.909> look<00:01:24.060> down<00:01:24.090> all

press ENTER and if you look down all
we're<00:01:24.600> going<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.780> do<00:01:24.930> we're<00:01:25.470> gonna<00:01:25.530> push<00:01:25.950> the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
we're going to do we're gonna push the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.399 
we're going to do we're gonna push the
pedal<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.750> there's<00:01:27.750> going<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.930> be<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.110> whirring

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
pedal and there's going to be a whirring

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.140 
pedal and there's going to be a whirring
that<00:01:28.560> comes<00:01:28.770> up<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.579> this<00:01:29.700> has<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.909> lot<00:01:30.119> of

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
that comes up and this has a lot of

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.210 
that comes up and this has a lot of
safety<00:01:30.479> functions<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.829> there's<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.040> lot<00:01:32.189> of

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
safety functions so there's a lot of

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.429 
safety functions so there's a lot of
sensors<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:33.030> will<00:01:33.479> tell<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.869> make<00:01:34.200> sure

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
sensors that will tell you make sure

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.620 
sensors that will tell you make sure
that<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:35.280> don't<00:01:35.400> crash<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.820> machine<00:01:36.329> and

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
that you don't crash the machine and

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.859 
that you don't crash the machine and
kill<00:01:37.170> your<00:01:37.380> investment<00:01:38.119> so<00:01:39.119> it's<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.360> very<00:01:39.600> safe

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
kill your investment so it's a very safe

machine too so you just push accept now
the<00:01:43.649> machine<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.070> going<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.549> go<00:01:44.909> ahead<00:01:45.149> and

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
the machine is going to go ahead and

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.749 
the machine is going to go ahead and
clamp<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.720> it's<00:01:46.649> running<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.130> mandrel<00:01:47.579> in

from the back now most of us know the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.490 
from the back now most of us know the
mandrel<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.549> what<00:01:51.240> smoothes<00:01:51.600> out<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.930> tube<00:01:52.290> as

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
mandrel is what smoothes out the tube as

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.710 
mandrel is what smoothes out the tube as
it<00:01:52.649> comes<00:01:52.860> around<00:01:53.090> and<00:01:54.090> as<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.329> see<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.509> haven't

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
it comes around and as you see I haven't

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.690 
it comes around and as you see I haven't
done<00:01:54.899> anything<00:01:55.200> other<00:01:55.770> than<00:01:56.070> hold<00:01:56.340> my<00:01:56.520> foot

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
we go it magically knows that it's

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.260 
we go it magically knows that it's
pulled<00:02:23.430> itself<00:02:23.700> off

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
pulled itself off

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.750

cost that you would normally have all
right<00:02:49.170> now<00:02:49.350> I'll<00:02:49.530> bring<00:02:49.709> it<00:02:49.830> to<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.040> indexer

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
right now I'll bring it to the indexer

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.360 
right now I'll bring it to the indexer
this<00:02:50.970> is<00:02:51.180> a<00:02:51.209> normal<00:02:51.600> lathe<00:02:51.780> chuck<00:02:52.310> tighten<00:02:53.310> it

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
this is a normal lathe chuck tighten it

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.870 
this is a normal lathe chuck tighten it
up<00:02:53.489> very<00:02:54.150> simple<00:02:54.630> there's<00:02:55.380> a<00:02:55.470> stop<00:02:55.880> adjustable

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
up very simple there's a stop adjustable

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.479 
up very simple there's a stop adjustable
so<00:02:57.360> that<00:02:57.660> way<00:02:58.200> now<00:02:58.620> you<00:02:58.680> know<00:02:58.920> your<00:02:59.100> bend<00:02:59.310> is

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
so that way now you know your bend is

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:00.890 
so that way now you know your bend is
going<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.670> be<00:02:59.790> good<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.030> accurate<00:03:00.239> lengthwise

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
going to be good and accurate lengthwise

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.710 
going to be good and accurate lengthwise
and<00:03:01.290> in<00:03:02.100> order<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.400> spin<00:03:02.760> your<00:03:02.970> indexer

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
and in order to spin your indexer

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.449 
and in order to spin your indexer
there's<00:03:03.900> a<00:03:03.959> little<00:03:04.230> nice<00:03:04.560> little<00:03:04.590> red<00:03:05.010> pointer

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
there's a little nice little red pointer

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.750 
there's a little nice little red pointer
we're<00:03:05.910> gonna<00:03:06.000> spin<00:03:06.420> it<00:03:06.540> around<00:03:06.630> a<00:03:07.049> 90<00:03:07.549> just<00:03:08.549> for

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760
