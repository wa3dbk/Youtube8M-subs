try something let's put design for a

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.020

think this might come in a mattifying

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.700 
think this might come in a mattifying
one<00:01:40.970> as<00:01:41.970> well<00:01:42.240> but<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.659> will<00:01:42.810> put<00:01:43.020> all<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.350> up
