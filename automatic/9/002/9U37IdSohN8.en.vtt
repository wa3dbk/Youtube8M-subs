00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.260
 a cup of washed and drained rice 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:18.720
 margarine 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:22.260
 two cups of chicken broth this broth 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.240
 we're going to take it out when we cut chicken and 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.390
 we do not need the broth, we're going to 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.590
 we can freeze it 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.370
 perfectly and when we go to 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.130
 need the frozen ones 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.860
 in one case I'm going to put a little bit of 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:40.200
 oil 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.200
 and I'm going to put a spoonful of margarine 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.089
 the oil I put it on so that the 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.039
 Margarine does not burn if we 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:51.109
 we put to heat margarine without having 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:54.000
 added a little oil the 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:55.740
 Margarine is going to burn casually 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.160
 and since margarine is hot 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.160
 we go 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.450
 we will be moving constantly 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.870
 so that the rice absorbs all the 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.870
 margarine 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:22.230
 ah 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.230
 ah 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.480
 we have to be moving the rice to 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.480
 keep it from sticking in the background 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.490
 We are going to be moving approximately 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.490
 three minutes over medium heat 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.600
 I'm going to add 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.020
 I'm going to move a little bit more to 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:08.189
 make sure there is no rice left 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.189
 stuck in the background 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.900
 so I'm going to leave and I'll wait for 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.900
 start boiling 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.420
 when the rice starts to boil we go to 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:28.000
 put minimum fire and let's leave 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.000
 boiling for 20 minutes exactly 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.520
 there is no need to be stirring the 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.990
 rice is left boiling nothing else and in 20 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.020
 minutes and you are ready 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:47.610
 we are not going to put salt either because the 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.610
 Chicken broth already had salt 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.540
 we'll just wait for the 20 to pass 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.540
 minutes to put out the fire 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:03.690
 exactly 20 minutes passed and this 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.880
 rice is already cooked as you can see then 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:10.020
 this was very nice it takes off from 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.480
 rice looks very beautiful its appearance and 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:16.070
 It is perfectly cooked in 20 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.070
 exactly minutes 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:26.350
 the rice is ready to go 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.270
 any food that you want 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:33.040
 this time I will use it 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:35.290
 to accompany the chicken in pipián 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.590
 if you want to know how the chicken is made 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.750
 in easy and fast pipián enters my 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.329
 channel there you will find a video where you 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.579
 I explain how to do it I hope that I have 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:49.170
 liked this recipe and I'll wait for you in my 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.170
