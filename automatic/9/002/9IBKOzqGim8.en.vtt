be doing today is this right here it is
called<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.140> unified<00:00:19.949> atomic<00:00:21.140> theory<00:00:22.140> and

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
called the unified atomic theory and

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.820 
called the unified atomic theory and
basically<00:00:23.730> what<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.150> does<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.840> is<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:25.439> allows

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
basically what it does it is it allows

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
aspects as you can see whoops I grabbed

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:54.910 
aspects as you can see whoops I grabbed
the<00:01:15.390> wrong<00:01:15.570> one<00:01:24.439> yeah<00:01:26.960> my<00:01:27.960> bad<00:01:50.960> or<00:01:51.960> not<00:01:53.329> alright

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.120 

eight<00:02:01.979> different<00:02:02.640> aspects<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.420> need

I'm the magical elemental in natural
worlds<00:02:27.750> all<00:02:27.870> fit<00:02:28.260> together<00:02:28.849> knowledge<00:02:29.849> like

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
worlds all fit together knowledge like

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.580 
worlds all fit together knowledge like
this<00:02:30.569> could<00:02:30.930> prove<00:02:31.290> invaluable

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
this could prove invaluable

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.690 
this could prove invaluable

okay so let's right-click and we now

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.530 
okay so let's right-click and we now
have<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.780> unified<00:02:40.560> thunk<00:02:40.859> feel<00:02:41.159> free<00:02:41.370> now<00:02:42.299> as

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
have the unified thunk feel free now as

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.069 
have the unified thunk feel free now as
you<00:02:42.780> can<00:02:42.989> see<00:02:43.760> those<00:02:44.760> wands<00:02:45.480> were<00:02:45.629> too<00:02:45.689> lit<00:02:45.930> up

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
you can see those wands were too lit up

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:50.690 
you can see those wands were too lit up
and<00:02:46.379> we<00:02:46.920> have<00:02:47.159> a<00:02:47.540> column<00:02:48.540> there<00:02:49.370> that<00:02:50.370> thingy

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
and we have a column there that thingy

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.409 
and we have a column there that thingy
there<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:51.359> jar<00:02:51.659> there<00:02:53.090> but<00:02:54.090> where<00:02:54.389> I

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:54.419 
there and the jar there but where I

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:57.759 
there and the jar there but where I
gotta<00:02:54.989> focus<00:02:55.200> on<00:02:55.560> this<00:02:55.739> right<00:02:55.980> now<00:02:56.120> hmm

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
gotta focus on this right now hmm

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.440 
gotta focus on this right now hmm
yeah<00:02:58.769> formulated<00:02:59.489> a<00:02:59.609> theory<00:02:59.939> on<00:03:00.090> how<00:03:00.389> the

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
yeah formulated a theory on how the

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.179 
yeah formulated a theory on how the
natural<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:00.989> elemental<00:03:01.530> world<00:03:01.709> interacts

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:02.189 
natural and elemental world interacts

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:03.770 
natural and elemental world interacts
with<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.370> mystical<00:03:02.849> you<00:03:02.970> finally<00:03:03.359> have<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.540> crisp

with a mystical you finally have a crisp

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.720 
with a mystical you finally have a crisp
on<00:03:03.989> how<00:03:04.139> that<00:03:04.319> bar<00:03:04.470> saturates<00:03:05.129> everything<00:03:05.579> and

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
on how that bar saturates everything and

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.690 
on how that bar saturates everything and
everyone<00:03:06.500> not<00:03:07.500> only<00:03:07.530> is<00:03:08.010> this<00:03:08.370> knowledge

a<00:03:17.519> wand<00:03:17.819> of<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.269> adept<00:03:18.629> it<00:03:19.290> is<00:03:19.409> similar<00:03:19.709> to<00:03:19.859> the

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:19.949 
a wand of the adept it is similar to the

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.300 
a wand of the adept it is similar to the
wand<00:03:20.159> of<00:03:20.340> The<00:03:20.459> Apprentice<00:03:20.549> except<00:03:21.299> it<00:03:21.419> is<00:03:21.569> able
