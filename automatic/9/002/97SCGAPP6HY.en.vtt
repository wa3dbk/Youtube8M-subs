00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:02.500
 Hello everyone. 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.020
 I am Serizawa, an afterbeat music school guitar instructor. 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:10.090
 This time, I would like to explain to everyone about what is called pick scratch. 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.640
 This is how you rub the pick on the strings, but 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.189
 "I know the name but I do not know what to do with it" 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:21.470
 Because I hear that voice, I will try to explain a little bit of salt. 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.519
 First of all, although there is no alternative way, basically it is free. 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.550
 I do not want to worry about so much detail, though. 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.690
 First of all, the way to put it in a nutshell is to put the pick on its side, etc. 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.809
 In the case of myself, I have many things like this, but this five-string, six-string winding string is like that. 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.920
 "Sud" with the rough strings 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.969
 I just keep rubbing. 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.329
 So speed is important when rubbing. 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.550
 If this is too slow 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.410
 I must be cool at all. 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.010
 Or if it's too fast 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.470
 What a stupid thing. 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.960
 So, how do you say this should be cool? 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.909
 In the case of myself, I feel like that, but at first I do a pick scratch a little faster, 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.229
 There are a lot of patterns to be slow from a certain point. 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.029
 It depends on how long the pick scratch is put, but 

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:29.430
 One bar usually called "one, knee, sun, sea" 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.720
 In the case of picking scratch with a feeling of "Queen". 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.070
 I will do it quite slowly. 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.130
 "Shoot". 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.710
 It looks like this. 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.890
 At first, give a little momentum 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.380
 Without this momentum of "Queen" 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.550
 Because it makes a noise, in the feeling that it beats 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.250
 With this kind of "cuckoo". 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.100
・ ・ ・, There are many things to do. 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.570
 Again, even if the rubbing power is too weak 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:31.090
 It will be a pick scratch that feels unreliable, so hold the pick firmly and rub it against the strings firmly 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.290
 It feels like it should be done. 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.060
 On the other hand, while one bar is doing "one, knee, sun, sea" 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.650
 If you are doing "Quee-e-n", you can use the current procedure. 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.740
 Is it 1 beat or 2 beats shorter? 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.540
 Count in 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.300
 When going "one, two, sun", "cueen", "dawn". 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.520
 Because I can not do it so slowly, "Queen" is normal. 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.159
 "One, Knee, Sun", "Queen". 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:05.609
 I often do pick scratch around here. 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:10.409
 So, I pick up the sound of the first shot myself 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.540
 I often play it. 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.360
 Um, this is .... 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.140
 It feels like, back to here ... · time lag 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.220
 I am doing pick scratching because it is very cool. 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.379
 In the feeling that you can pick while doing a pick scratch 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.970
 It feels like it should be possible. 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.860
 If you do this pick scratch too much, the pick will be rumbling 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.250
 I do not want to do so much, but often there are times when I have to do it 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.379
 Pick scratch with original song or when you are copying too 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:47.340
 If you have to, please do it while working on the pick. 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.989
 The side of Rilakkuma Pick has become jagged 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.970
 I feel a little sorry. 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.790
 "Oh, sorry Rilakkuma. All the bad is I". 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.420
 It feels like. 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:07.340
 Please do your best to practice cool pick scratch sounds. 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.549
 I think that once you get the hang of it is not that difficult. 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.269
 Let's sound cool pick scratch. 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:14.819
 Well then.
