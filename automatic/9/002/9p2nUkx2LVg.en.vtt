00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.170
 19-year-old button and three-year igor 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.269
 quarreled once again in anticipation 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.580
 entering the arena they tied in a small 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.710
 adult bears are no longer 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.809
 I like that very young brother 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.150
 constantly praise and strive me 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.310
 queues to treat a treat without a year 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.289
 week and already favorites like this 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.670
 guesses trainers ponders 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.859
 big age button 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.050
 jokes jokes but when in one program 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.699
 several types of animals work at once 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.260
 then safety 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.210
 the distance that they can 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.500
 approach each other and people do not 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.059
 must be critical 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.129
 all bears are different places for example 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.350
 bears that I have one quietly 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.120
 given can you calmly people that is, we 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.489
 led who can catch man and 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.039
 bring a very serious injury to someone else 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.170
 people in our circus brown bears 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.539
 keeps here in such cells ideally they 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.219
 should rest enclosures for example in 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.120
 more spacious cheeses of Moscow and 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.000
 St. Petersburg 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.949
 velvet kept in spacious pens there 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.690
 and better water supply system 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.940
 and power supply and on and 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.320
 but not everything is so tragic if in Riga 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.630
 turn off the electricity then during 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.060
 views of the light on the arena behind the scenes 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.400
 in no case will not work 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.710
 backup generator there are old 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.759
 wire that comes old shield 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.159
 because the boxes only need to connect them but 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.049
 connect as much as you can 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.670
 time this old one must be removed and just 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.770
 too resume what you all were 1 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.409
 equally at the same level and at 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.329
 same security level 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.939
 good in circus a great system 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.950
 fire safety without it in 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.079
 a building that is 120 years old 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.250
 get along soon put and system 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.259
 video surveillance 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.360
 already thinking about how to expand 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.549
 narrow corridors along which viewers walk 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.820
 during intermission it can be done for 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.890
 score 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.869
 administrative premises of the circus and those 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.640
 move to another place go to 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.979
 circus court you can see that self 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.720
 the building can still be customized 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.909
 need funds two years in a row 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.310
 the state allocates circus fasting thousands 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.860
 lats but with this money you can only holes 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.140
 to patch and you need a major reconstruction 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.909
 here for example the dome for all the trick 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.550
 which could show the middle 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.660
 last century, it is perfect but now to 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.430
 demonstrate complex 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.510
 acrobatic elements aerial 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.280
 sometimes gymnasts 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.620
 they themselves are mounted on the overhead overhead 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.750
 wooden beams and additional pipes 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.599
 In other churches I have the opportunity 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.470
 your first props number first number 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:27.720
 take as far as possible to the second 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.220
 the air number worked more freely 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.819
 Now let's say this moment I can not 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.340
 swing props 2 numbers 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:41.549
 because but he is right under 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:43.349
 give the most credits 1 to the Riga circus 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.269
 residual subsidized 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.129
 due to the fact that it is still not clear 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.470
 will there be land and circus buildings 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.540
 belong to the state either these rights 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.909
 will give away the owner this Thursday 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.129
 next trial but 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:58.530
 while the circus trial continues to ignite 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:01.099
 lights or on tender and they are hot first 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.099
