00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 Hello from France, my most 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:08.580
 best wishes today we will be with 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:11.280
 you prepare dishes from the remnants of which 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.920
 I found it in the fridge rather than me 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.960
 really wanted cabbage but because 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.010
 I had only cabbage 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.109
 here's a piece of small remnants so let's say 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.869
 I have the rice too since yesterday 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.880
 day half onion from sandwiches 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.510
 which we prepared well in general 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.750
 see and I decided to make cabbage rolls 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.489
 but it will be lazy cabbage rolls rather my 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.760
 option lazy cabbage 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.239
 and so we need i take 200 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.969
 a gram of minced meat I have five minced beef 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.120
 the percentage of fat content the fact is that also 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.340
 this dish will be dietary 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.219
 then we naturally need two 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.070
 carrots can take so many carrots 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.260
 how much you love cabbage too, as 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.989
 as much as you like half 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.210
 onion bunch here is so small 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:06.570
 parsley bay leaf and somewhere well 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.460
 probably a glass of boiled rice well 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.920
 and of course somewhere a cup floor 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.369
 tomato puree or tomatoes or 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:18.390
 tomato paste and so proceed to 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:21.630
 cooking lazy cabbage cabbage 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.880
 finely chopped and laid the first layer 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.939
 in our saucepan 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.520
 because cabbage will give juice and in this 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.799
 dish i won't use no butter no 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.549
 water will all stew in its own 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:38.930
 juice and so finely chopped cabbage it 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.750
 our first layer is moving on to 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:47.340
 chopped onion add to mince 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:50.430
 a little prize and all this will be 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:55.159
 stir carrots rub on here 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:58.649
 here I grate parsley 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:02.880
 I made exactly of tomato puree 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:05.010
 a cup of tomato juice on 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:11.970
 we add to the gun 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:14.310
 and lay meat on it so I 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.700
 laid out the meat here such should be 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.800
 uniform small layer of meat like me 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.240
 already said we connected with finely 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:28.500
 chopped onions and the next layer will be 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:32.070
 Riz Riz I also posted, we also add 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.910
 this layer and at the very top we will 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:38.970
 spread carrot 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.040
 laid layer too when soles I laid 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.340
 also bay leaves what will I do 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.460
 further since i have lazy cabbage rolls 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.100
 not classic that to the bottom are mostly their 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.710
 like hedgehogs make meatballs like I have the same 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.490
 everything will be layered as i like 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:03:00.360
 when cabbage is soft and and when vegetables 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:02.610
 meat is all about tushino to softness and what we 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.990
 do we need to go in there 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:11.310
 tomato juice and we make such here 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:16.730
 Stuff to tomato juice passed we 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:21.030
 until the bottom so put off the spatula and 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:24.510
 we pour in like this 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:28.230
 add neither water nor anything but empty 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:31.980
 carrots enough to juice in our 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:34.380
 lazy cabbage rolls had enough tomato 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.320
 I add juice but purely because of respect 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:40.170
 to the recipe since sour after all 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:44.160
 cabbage rolls should be present and so 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:47.700
 Now I close this lid and put 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.040
 stew on low heat somewhere minutes 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.040
 45 Well, in general, we will try when 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.190
 cook cabbage and carrots here 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.610
 passed somewhere 10 minutes look here 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:02.880
 cabbage gave juice see it enough 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.580
 carrot still did not give the juice so 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.010
 don't worry broth will 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.200
 enough 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.629
 now and now over the girl for a long time juice 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.049
 see on becoming such more 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:17.900
 orange soft generally fragrant good 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.829
 half an hour so here it looks my lazy 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.090
 cabbage rolls 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:25.550
 I look spikelet still there so I am up 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:29.169
 carcass to fully timeline fell on 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.350
 Now I will add to my cabbage rolls 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.550
 parshechka 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:36.350
 and again close the lid he's all in the fog 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.949
 passed in 45 minutes, see what I have 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.919

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:45.289

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.990

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:12.770

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:16.010
