SSD world if you look through some of
the<00:01:33.410> benchmarks<00:01:34.010> they'll<00:01:34.400> show<00:01:35.210> that<00:01:35.570> they

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
the benchmarks they'll show that they

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.870 
the benchmarks they'll show that they
generally<00:01:36.470> kind<00:01:36.680> of<00:01:36.770> flip-flop<00:01:37.280> depending

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
generally kind of flip-flop depending

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.250 
generally kind of flip-flop depending
upon<00:01:37.970> what<00:01:38.360> you're<00:01:38.510> testing<00:01:38.780> you<00:01:39.140> know

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
upon what you're testing you know

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.990 
upon what you're testing you know
whether<00:01:39.470> it<00:01:39.620> be<00:01:39.710> sequential<00:01:40.130> read<00:01:40.460> sequential

just<00:01:43.070> kind<00:01:43.310> of<00:01:43.369> jittery<00:01:44.119> flip-flop<00:01:44.869> on<00:01:45.050> that

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
just kind of jittery flip-flop on that

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.400 
just kind of jittery flip-flop on that
on<00:01:45.440> the<00:01:45.680> chart<00:01:46.100> so<00:01:46.600> any<00:01:47.600> of<00:01:47.750> those<00:01:47.900> drives<00:01:48.259> that

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
on the chart so any of those drives that

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.930 
on the chart so any of those drives that
you<00:01:48.530> get<00:01:48.710> you're<00:01:48.890> bound<00:01:49.250> to<00:01:49.400> get<00:01:49.520> a<00:01:49.580> really

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
you get you're bound to get a really

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.670 
you get you're bound to get a really
fast<00:01:50.180> hard<00:01:50.450> I<00:01:50.570> want<00:01:50.960> with<00:01:51.080> the<00:01:51.170> Patriot

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
fast hard I want with the Patriot

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.140 
fast hard I want with the Patriot
personally<00:01:52.250> just<00:01:52.310> because<00:01:52.430> I<00:01:52.640> like<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:52.880> fact

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
personally just because I like the fact

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.480 
personally just because I like the fact
that<00:01:53.300> it<00:01:53.450> kind<00:01:53.660> of<00:01:53.750> stuck<00:01:54.350> above<00:01:54.650> one<00:01:54.979> and<00:01:55.160> the

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
that it kind of stuck above one and the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.240 
that it kind of stuck above one and the
one<00:01:55.670> and<00:01:55.790> to<00:01:55.910> mark<00:01:56.180> more<00:01:56.840> consistently<00:01:57.440> looked

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
one and to mark more consistently looked

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.550 
one and to mark more consistently looked
like<00:01:58.369> it<00:01:58.520> was<00:01:58.640> a<00:01:58.670> really<00:01:58.990> reliable<00:01:59.990> type<00:02:00.440> of

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
like it was a really reliable type of
