00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 hello everyone with you ivan doses and already passed 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.670
 three weeks since the new one came out 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.490
 infinite bioshock which is called as 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.900
 You see, but it's a damn very strange because 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.119
 that this word does not have a igka but 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.150
 yet what pleased us 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.099
 developers this time of course 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.789
 good textures and vanomas for suck 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:31.890
 of course the graphics are great 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:35.040
 the atmosphere of the new air city 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.210
 Colombia's excellent gentle female 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.710
 character named Elizabeth in 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.829
 anyone have her cell phone 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.219
 add another fucking story with 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.250
 many references and of course birch with 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.039
 one ending I can't 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.680
 better say yourself to play 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.840
 bioshock infinite than telling him 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:03.840
 but we turn to its origins or rather in 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.320
 2007 year when the first game came out in 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.170
 shine 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.280
 the main character jack crashes on 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.479
 by plane but miraculously survives and finds 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.850
 immediately the lighthouse in which is 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.460
 bathysphere and takes our main 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.290
 hero to the city is a delight that way 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.780
 called underwater city 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.880
 but the fate of this city is too 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.869
 deplorable because it inhabits 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.630
 mutants 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.020
 little sisters and big daddies 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.119
 Of course, we are still a handful of people 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.970
 the main character immediately finds himself 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.509
 new radio friend named atlas 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.120
 which explains to him that andrew ryan 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.930
 mayor of this city 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:50.330
 full gavnyuk and it must be destroyed 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.880
 but before killing andrew ryan 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.820
 find out that he is a father 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.190
 Main character 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.950
 unexpected is it really a turn when jack 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.860
 restart the system it turns out that 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.840
 no satin for him sat for 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.330
 radio frank fountain 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.120
 It also turns out that Jack was 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.810
 a function such as obeying the phrase 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.330
 be so kind and Ponte 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.160
 needed jack he decides to kill him but 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.140
 to help jack comes small 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.020
 sisters who saves ours 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.310
 protagonist doctor tannenbaum who 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:30.470
 suspiciously similar to gwyneth paltrow 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:34.120
 turns off the obedience function be so 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.590
 kindly and now jack goes quietly 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.520
 kill frank fountain who 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:43.100
 turned into a hefty gray tilde 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:49.190
 Yes, right in our review, it seems to be pussy 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:53.390
 and it would not be possible to manage 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:56.300
 right now pantene will kill jack but who would 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.480
 you thought you came to help yes of course 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.520
 our lovely sisters 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.940
 and start to lose weight 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.709
 times we continue but the game is present 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.680
 also two endings 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:13.340
 if you have sisters will take that adam 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:17.000
 mutants will attack the submarine but if you 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.790
 you will save these sisters you will die 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.450
 happy old foster 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.970
 daughters 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:28.610
 or tal happy ending graphics quite 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.650
 normal and textures the same to me 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.760
 of course now it does not look 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.140
 Primakova 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.700
 but in 2007 it looked right by god 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.459
 the gameplay here is like call of duty 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.760
 however, instead of aiming you can 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:46.300
 use superpowers such as 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.130
 electricity fire 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:52.190
 telekinesis ice but and so on and so on 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.930
 like that yes something you can do your 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.540
 allies big daddy 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.540
 these abilities are mined for adam a 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.909
 Adam is mined now either by salvation 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.900
 or just get its modem from the little ones 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:06.239
 sisters 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.359
 everything else can be bought for real 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:11.730
 money in all kinds of machines there but if 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:15.229
 you still lack some 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:17.639
 dollar then please hack you to help 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:20.970
 The soundtrack is of course made here. 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:25.070
 style of the fifties but of course this is not 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.070
 so that there mafia 2 type 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.780
 but in this game, too, listening to the soundtrack 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.530
 billing 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.840
 well and lastly about the localization of nothing 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.670
 about her right to add because 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.200
 she is already quite well done 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.140
 1c companies 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.980
 Is that my favorite voice in this game 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:57.900
 This is Andrew Ryan, who was voiced by Andrei 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:01.300
 Yaroslavl and him for that many thanks 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.770
 Andrew Ryan is not a naive girl who 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.810
 government can be circled around 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.260
 finger on it all 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:10.470
 goodbye or goodbye 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.810
 any language you wish to be honest 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.470
 most expect from this voice 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:21.210
 here is such a phrase 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:24.720
 yes, you and they will summarize 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:27.810
 the game turned out great 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:31.200
 I really want to get into it 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:34.560
 play them on the span but of course in 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:37.860
 this game lacks drama and therefore 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.470
 infinite bioshock complements this drama 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.930
 but for now you think what kind of game 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.450
 play first sign up 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.840
 to the channel and leave your comments 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:53.270
 but with you was Ivan then thanks for the pizza and 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.270
 to new meetings pakedova 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.590
 but
