00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
thought it'd just be an interesting

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
couple of months ago so it might be

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.500 
couple of months ago so it might be

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
the video now and then have a guess

which<00:01:32.340> drink<00:01:32.759> has<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.299> most<00:01:33.479> sugar<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:34.079> which

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
which drink has the most sugar and which

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.060 
which drink has the most sugar and which
drink<00:01:34.590> has<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.280> least<00:01:35.430> amount<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.850> sugar<00:01:37.070> okay

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
drink has the least amount of sugar okay

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.219 
drink has the least amount of sugar okay
so<00:01:38.400> I'll<00:01:38.670> start<00:01:38.820> off<00:01:39.090> with<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.750> drink<00:01:40.049> that

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
so I'll start off with the drink that

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.859 
so I'll start off with the drink that
has<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.680> least<00:01:40.829> amount<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.280> sugar<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:42.420> is

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
has the least amount of sugar and it is

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.510 
has the least amount of sugar and it is
this<00:01:43.740> one<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.369> vitamin<00:01:45.360> water<00:01:46.159> then<00:01:47.159> if<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.399> get

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
this one a vitamin water then if you get

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.690 
this one a vitamin water then if you get
it<00:01:47.640> right<00:01:47.990> so<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.140> vitamin<00:01:49.290> water<00:01:49.799> has<00:01:50.070> 22

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
it right so the vitamin water has 22

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.080 
it right so the vitamin water has 22
grams<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.210> sugar<00:01:51.619> which<00:01:52.619> looks<00:01:53.430> like<00:01:53.759> this

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
grams of sugar which looks like this

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.870 
grams of sugar which looks like this
that's<00:01:54.720> how<00:01:54.990> much<00:01:55.409> sugar<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:56.040> in<00:01:56.100> this<00:01:56.579> string

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
that's how much sugar is in this string

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.850 
that's how much sugar is in this string
I<00:01:57.030> mean<00:01:57.270> from<00:01:57.479> looking<00:01:57.780> at<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.020> label<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.530> you

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
I mean from looking at the label you you

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.430 
I mean from looking at the label you you
would<00:01:58.979> think<00:01:59.159> this<00:01:59.340> was<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.610> healthy<00:02:00.000> drink

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
would think this was a healthy drink

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.350 
would think this was a healthy drink
because<00:02:00.620> you<00:02:01.310> kind<00:02:01.580> of<00:02:01.670> just<00:02:01.880> see<00:02:02.030> a<00:02:02.060> word

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
because you kind of just see a word

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.620 
because you kind of just see a word
vitamin<00:02:02.990> and<00:02:03.230> minerals<00:02:03.800> and<00:02:04.130> low-calorie

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
vitamin and minerals and low-calorie

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.050 
vitamin and minerals and low-calorie
then<00:02:05.630> even<00:02:05.900> though<00:02:06.080> it<00:02:06.590> does<00:02:07.460> have<00:02:07.610> all<00:02:07.730> those

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
then even though it does have all those

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.780 
then even though it does have all those
nutrients<00:02:08.750> in<00:02:08.930> it<00:02:09.080> it<00:02:09.560> still<00:02:09.920> has<00:02:09.950> quite<00:02:10.550> a<00:02:10.610> lot

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
nutrients in it it still has quite a lot

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.600 
nutrients in it it still has quite a lot
of<00:02:10.910> sugar<00:02:11.240> so<00:02:11.510> this<00:02:12.410> is<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:13.100> drink<00:02:13.310> with<00:02:13.520> the

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
of sugar so this is the drink with the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.430 
of sugar so this is the drink with the
least<00:02:13.790> amount<00:02:13.970> of<00:02:14.210> sugar<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:14.660> now<00:02:14.960> the<00:02:15.020> drink

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
least amount of sugar and now the drink

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.240 
least amount of sugar and now the drink
with<00:02:15.770> the<00:02:15.920> most<00:02:16.130> amount<00:02:16.400> of<00:02:16.550> sugar<00:02:16.850> is<00:02:17.120> the

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
with the most amount of sugar is the

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.200 
with the most amount of sugar is the
orange<00:02:19.250> see<00:02:19.640> an<00:02:20.390> orange<00:02:21.290> see<00:02:21.590> has<00:02:21.980> 64<00:02:22.880> point

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
orange see an orange see has 64 point

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.900 
orange see an orange see has 64 point
eight<00:02:23.570> grams<00:02:23.600> of<00:02:24.110> sugar<00:02:24.440> which<00:02:25.400> looks<00:02:25.700> like

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
eight grams of sugar which looks like

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.190 
eight grams of sugar which looks like
this<00:02:26.530> so<00:02:27.530> when<00:02:27.980> you<00:02:28.130> drink<00:02:28.430> a<00:02:28.670> 600<00:02:29.510> milk<00:02:29.720> carton

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
this so when you drink a 600 milk carton

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.970 
this so when you drink a 600 milk carton
of<00:02:30.500> orange<00:02:30.770> see<00:02:31.750> you're<00:02:32.750> drinking<00:02:32.930> that<00:02:33.800> much

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
of orange see you're drinking that much

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.890 
of orange see you're drinking that much
sugar<00:02:34.250> which<00:02:35.180> is<00:02:35.210> crazy

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
sugar which is crazy

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.740 
sugar which is crazy
I<00:02:36.080> know<00:02:36.590> now<00:02:37.520> out<00:02:37.730> of<00:02:37.760> all<00:02:38.000> these<00:02:38.150> drinks<00:02:38.570> I

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
I know now out of all these drinks I

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.720 
I know now out of all these drinks I
actually<00:02:38.960> thought<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.680> Coca<00:02:40.040> Cola<00:02:40.070> would

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
actually thought the Coca Cola would

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.820 
actually thought the Coca Cola would
over<00:02:41.120> my<00:02:41.240> stamina<00:02:41.510> sugar<00:02:41.960> it<00:02:42.200> does<00:02:42.320> have<00:02:42.590> a<00:02:42.620> lot

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
over my stamina sugar it does have a lot

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.580 
over my stamina sugar it does have a lot
of<00:02:42.860> sugar<00:02:43.100> in<00:02:43.460> fact<00:02:43.700> it's<00:02:43.880> only<00:02:44.090> it<00:02:44.930> has<00:02:45.290> any

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
of sugar in fact it's only it has any

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.890 
of sugar in fact it's only it has any
point<00:02:46.010> eight<00:02:46.220> grams<00:02:46.280> less<00:02:46.940> than<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.630> orange

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
point eight grams less than the orange

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.370 
point eight grams less than the orange
see<00:02:48.170> so<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.620> Coca<00:02:49.010> Cola<00:02:49.040> drink<00:02:49.430> has<00:02:49.990> 64<00:02:50.990> grams

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
see so the Coca Cola drink has 64 grams

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.690 
see so the Coca Cola drink has 64 grams
of<00:02:51.590> sugar<00:02:51.800> in<00:02:51.950> it<00:02:52.040> which<00:02:52.340> looks<00:02:52.580> like<00:02:52.730> that

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
of sugar in it which looks like that

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.000 
of sugar in it which looks like that
then<00:02:55.700> not<00:02:55.940> far<00:02:56.240> behind<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.870> Coca<00:02:57.110> Cola<00:02:57.410> is<00:02:57.770> the

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
then not far behind the Coca Cola is the

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.330 
then not far behind the Coca Cola is the
sprite<00:02:58.340> with<00:02:58.790> 61<00:02:59.510> grams<00:02:59.750> of<00:03:00.080> sugar<00:03:00.260> and<00:03:00.560> then

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
just behind this bright is the chocolate

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.880 
just behind this bright is the chocolate
milk<00:03:03.770> and<00:03:04.070> this<00:03:04.760> has<00:03:05.050> 57<00:03:06.050> grams<00:03:06.320> of<00:03:06.500> sugar<00:03:06.800> in

and that's how much sugar is in a bottle

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.910 
and that's how much sugar is in a bottle
of<00:03:34.430> coke<00:03:34.700> so<00:03:35.480> now<00:03:35.690> whenever<00:03:35.989> I<00:03:36.200> go<00:03:36.380> get<00:03:36.590> a<00:03:36.620> drink

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.650 
of coke so now whenever I go get a drink
I<00:03:37.130> always<00:03:37.370> think<00:03:37.670> twice<00:03:37.790> about<00:03:37.970> how<00:03:38.450> much

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
I always think twice about how much

I always think twice about how much
sugar<00:03:38.989> is<00:03:39.019> actually<00:03:39.820> in<00:03:40.820> the<00:03:41.570> drink<00:03:41.840> I'm<00:03:41.989> about

to<00:03:42.440> have<00:03:42.700> one<00:03:43.700> of<00:03:43.850> the<00:03:44.000> main<00:03:44.360> reasons<00:03:44.870> why

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
to have one of the main reasons why

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.500 
to have one of the main reasons why
sugars<00:03:45.440> so<00:03:45.920> bad<00:03:46.160> for<00:03:46.310> you<00:03:46.430> is<00:03:46.550> because<00:03:46.970> they're

sugars so bad for you is because they're

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.050 
sugars so bad for you is because they're
basically<00:03:47.720> empty<00:03:48.500> calories<00:03:48.950> sugar<00:03:49.370> pretty

another<00:04:02.190> reason<00:04:02.430> sugar<00:04:03.000> is<00:04:03.209> pretty<00:04:03.630> bad<00:04:03.840> for

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
another reason sugar is pretty bad for

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.690 
another reason sugar is pretty bad for
you<00:04:04.170> is<00:04:04.319> it<00:04:04.620> actually<00:04:05.010> suppresses<00:04:05.489> your

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
you is it actually suppresses your

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.180 
you is it actually suppresses your
immune<00:04:06.180> system<00:04:06.870> which<00:04:07.140> means<00:04:07.410> if<00:04:07.560> you<00:04:07.680> have<00:04:07.709> a

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
immune system which means if you have a

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.250 
immune system which means if you have a
bottle<00:04:08.489> of<00:04:08.550> coke<00:04:08.819> or<00:04:09.150> something<00:04:09.569> that's<00:04:09.750> got<00:04:10.230> a

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
bottle of coke or something that's got a

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.050 
bottle of coke or something that's got a
lot<00:04:10.440> of<00:04:10.470> sugar<00:04:10.770> in<00:04:10.890> it<00:04:11.069> it'll<00:04:11.220> basically<00:04:11.459> tamp

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
lot of sugar in it it'll basically tamp

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.470 
lot of sugar in it it'll basically tamp
down<00:04:12.180> your<00:04:12.709> immune<00:04:13.709> system's<00:04:14.220> ability<00:04:14.480> to

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
down your immune system's ability to

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.509 
down your immune system's ability to
respond<00:04:15.930> to<00:04:15.989> challenges<00:04:16.230> so<00:04:16.919> that's<00:04:17.250> another

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
respond to challenges so that's another

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.280 
respond to challenges so that's another
reason<00:04:17.730> why<00:04:18.000> sugar<00:04:18.209> is<00:04:18.419> pretty<00:04:18.750> bad<00:04:18.930> for<00:04:19.169> you

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
reason why sugar is pretty bad for you

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.949 
reason why sugar is pretty bad for you
also<00:04:19.739> raises<00:04:20.340> your<00:04:20.609> insulin<00:04:21.120> levels<00:04:21.510> soon<00:04:21.840> as

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
also raises your insulin levels soon as

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.350 
also raises your insulin levels soon as
you<00:04:22.109> drink<00:04:22.350> hope<00:04:23.040> I<00:04:23.220> look<00:04:23.370> like<00:04:23.610> your<00:04:24.090> blood

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
you drink hope I look like your blood

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.690 
you drink hope I look like your blood
sugar<00:04:24.720> levels<00:04:25.080> will<00:04:25.380> zoom<00:04:26.010> through<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:26.520> roof

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
sugar levels will zoom through the roof

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.879 
sugar levels will zoom through the roof
and<00:04:26.910> then<00:04:27.060> what<00:04:27.240> happens<00:04:27.600> after<00:04:27.780> a<00:04:27.990> while<00:04:28.290> your

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
and then what happens after a while your

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.159 
and then what happens after a while your
pancreas<00:04:29.340> will<00:04:29.669> release<00:04:30.090> a<00:04:30.120> bunch<00:04:30.479> of<00:04:30.690> insulin

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
pancreas will release a bunch of insulin

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.020 
pancreas will release a bunch of insulin
to<00:04:31.350> help<00:04:31.530> clear<00:04:31.800> the<00:04:32.010> sugar<00:04:32.370> from<00:04:32.669> your<00:04:32.850> blood

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
to help clear the sugar from your blood

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.180 
to help clear the sugar from your blood
into<00:04:33.419> yourselves<00:04:34.050> and<00:04:34.410> as<00:04:34.560> your<00:04:34.740> blood<00:04:34.919> sugar

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
into yourselves and as your blood sugar

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.940 
into yourselves and as your blood sugar
levels<00:04:35.610> go<00:04:35.820> down<00:04:36.060> and<00:04:36.419> your<00:04:37.110> insulin<00:04:37.560> levels

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
levels go down and your insulin levels

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.710 
levels go down and your insulin levels
will<00:04:38.190> kind<00:04:38.669> of<00:04:38.729> go<00:04:38.880> back<00:04:39.090> to<00:04:39.270> normal<00:04:39.450> and<00:04:39.600> if

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
will kind of go back to normal and if

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.290 
will kind of go back to normal and if
you're<00:04:39.870> constantly<00:04:40.139> drinking<00:04:41.120> sugar<00:04:42.120> or

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
you're constantly drinking sugar or

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.820 
you're constantly drinking sugar or
eating<00:04:42.690> lots<00:04:42.840> of<00:04:42.990> sugar<00:04:43.050> you're<00:04:43.590> kind<00:04:43.770> of

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
eating lots of sugar you're kind of

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.120 
eating lots of sugar you're kind of
making<00:04:44.040> it<00:04:44.340> insulin<00:04:44.880> go<00:04:45.419> into<00:04:45.690> overdrive

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
making it insulin go into overdrive

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.620 
making it insulin go into overdrive
which<00:04:47.130> can<00:04:47.460> kind<00:04:47.820> of<00:04:48.000> cause<00:04:48.300> a<00:04:48.330> lot<00:04:48.600> of

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
which can kind of cause a lot of

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.810 
which can kind of cause a lot of
problems<00:04:49.110> eventually<00:04:50.010> your<00:04:50.220> pancreas<00:04:50.639> can

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
problems eventually your pancreas can

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.750 
problems eventually your pancreas can
actually<00:04:51.240> stop<00:04:51.630> producing<00:04:52.350> and<00:04:52.620> the<00:04:53.310> insulin

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
actually stop producing and the insulin

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.270 
actually stop producing and the insulin
and<00:04:54.150> that's<00:04:54.750> how<00:04:55.020> you<00:04:55.080> end<00:04:55.350> up<00:04:55.470> with<00:04:55.530> diabetes

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
and that's how you end up with diabetes

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.909 
and that's how you end up with diabetes
so<00:04:56.729> that's<00:04:56.940> basically<00:04:57.510> why<00:04:57.780> sugar<00:04:58.080> isn't<00:04:58.740> good

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
so that's basically why sugar isn't good

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:00.409 
so that's basically why sugar isn't good
for<00:04:59.160> you<00:04:59.310> and<00:04:59.610> you<00:04:59.729> should<00:04:59.880> really<00:05:00.030> kind<00:05:00.330> of

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
for you and you should really kind of

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:01.909 
for you and you should really kind of
watch<00:05:00.600> the<00:05:00.810> amount<00:05:01.020> of<00:05:01.140> sugars<00:05:01.500> that<00:05:01.530> you're

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
watch the amount of sugars that you're

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:03.740 
watch the amount of sugars that you're
eating<00:05:02.250> and<00:05:02.400> drinking<00:05:02.550> that's<00:05:03.300> my<00:05:03.600> little

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
eating and drinking that's my little

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.360 
eating and drinking that's my little
video<00:05:03.960> for<00:05:04.289> today<00:05:04.470> I<00:05:04.590> just<00:05:04.950> thought<00:05:05.220> it'd<00:05:05.340> be

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
video for today I just thought it'd be

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.950 
video for today I just thought it'd be
interesting<00:05:05.520> to<00:05:06.030> show<00:05:06.240> you<00:05:06.270> guys<00:05:06.510> how<00:05:06.780> much

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
interesting to show you guys how much

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.659 
interesting to show you guys how much
sugars<00:05:07.350> actually<00:05:07.710> in<00:05:07.860> your<00:05:08.010> drinks<00:05:08.400> please

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
sugars actually in your drinks please

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:10.670 
sugars actually in your drinks please
kind<00:05:09.030> of<00:05:09.150> think<00:05:09.360> twice<00:05:09.600> about<00:05:09.810> drinking<00:05:10.260> them

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
kind of think twice about drinking them

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.010 
kind of think twice about drinking them
I<00:05:10.860> mean<00:05:11.100> they're<00:05:11.250> okay<00:05:11.640> to<00:05:11.700> have<00:05:12.060> once<00:05:12.720> in<00:05:12.930> a

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
I mean they're okay to have once in a

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.409 
I mean they're okay to have once in a
while<00:05:13.229> but<00:05:13.560> I<00:05:13.770> remember<00:05:14.400> my<00:05:14.580> husband<00:05:15.030> he<00:05:15.240> used

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
while but I remember my husband he used

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.490 
while but I remember my husband he used
to<00:05:15.600> have<00:05:15.810> three<00:05:16.650> or<00:05:16.680> four<00:05:17.010> of<00:05:17.100> these<00:05:17.220> a<00:05:17.280> day<00:05:17.460> and

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
to have three or four of these a day and

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.719 
to have three or four of these a day and
that's<00:05:19.500> where<00:05:19.830> your<00:05:19.950> weight<00:05:20.070> room<00:05:20.370> I<00:05:20.460> kind<00:05:20.700> of

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
that's where your weight room I kind of

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:22.159 
that's where your weight room I kind of
recommend<00:05:21.060> maybe<00:05:21.390> just<00:05:21.660> treating<00:05:22.080> yourself

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
recommend maybe just treating yourself

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:24.680 
recommend maybe just treating yourself
once<00:05:22.710> a<00:05:22.860> month<00:05:23.039> or<00:05:23.250> something<00:05:23.700> the<00:05:23.940> best<00:05:24.210> thing
