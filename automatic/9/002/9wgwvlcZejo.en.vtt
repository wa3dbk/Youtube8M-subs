00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
we knew if we had breakdowns on the

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.380 
we knew if we had breakdowns on the
defensive<00:04:24.710> end<00:04:24.860> we<00:04:25.430> would<00:04:25.670> build<00:04:25.790> a<00:04:26.000> margin

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
defensive end we would build a margin

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.540 
defensive end we would build a margin
that<00:04:26.540> we<00:04:26.660> wouldn't<00:04:26.870> be<00:04:27.020> able<00:04:27.140> to<00:04:27.380> overcome

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
that we wouldn't be able to overcome

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.350 
that we wouldn't be able to overcome
unfortunately<00:04:29.550> we<00:04:29.640> weren't<00:04:29.790> able<00:04:29.880> to<00:04:30.060> get<00:04:30.210> as

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
unfortunately we weren't able to get as

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.570 
unfortunately we weren't able to get as
many<00:04:30.600> transition<00:04:31.350> opportunities<00:04:32.130> i<00:04:32.250> think<00:04:32.460> we

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
many transition opportunities i think we

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.190 
many transition opportunities i think we
had<00:04:32.700> three<00:04:33.000> transition<00:04:33.570> turnovers<00:04:34.020> in<00:04:34.140> the

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
had three transition turnovers in the

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.440 
had three transition turnovers in the
first<00:04:34.230> half<00:04:34.500> we<00:04:35.400> did<00:04:35.550> a<00:04:35.580> heck<00:04:35.730> of<00:04:35.760> a<00:04:35.940> job<00:04:36.090> taking

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
first half we did a heck of a job taking

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:37.640 
first half we did a heck of a job taking
care<00:04:36.480> of<00:04:36.660> the<00:04:36.780> ball<00:04:36.900> in<00:04:37.020> the<00:04:37.050> second<00:04:37.440> half<00:04:37.560> I

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
care of the ball in the second half I

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.230 
care of the ball in the second half I
think<00:04:37.860> we<00:04:37.920> might<00:04:38.070> have<00:04:38.160> only<00:04:38.340> had<00:04:38.520> one<00:04:38.730> second

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
think we might have only had one second

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.300 
think we might have only had one second
