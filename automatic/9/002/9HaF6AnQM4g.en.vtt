00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 hey people here a little video for 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.509
 a bit of tuning and a bit 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.250
 appearance 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:20.100
 a small tip I'm not at the 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:25.519
 Baumarkt lattice bought just about normal 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:28.830
 alu guitar ten euro is really long so 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:38.969
 really good ten euro 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:41.460
 I would terrier changed my 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.899
 That's quite clever because I'm yes 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.120
 mostly with my roll cage was 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:51.809
 Here's just a simple one here 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.989
 window out cut out that crop 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.129
 the engine simply gets more air 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.460
 he is cooled 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:05.519
 yes because that is otherwise with the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:07.080
 caro really hot that's why I have 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.330
 namely thought to cut it out 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.369
 but that looks too stupid yes it 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.010
 was practically free to attack 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.720
 Refuel everything looks like it comes too 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.470
 dirt in and so not really good 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.729
 that's why I'm coming up with the idea 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.500
 I just try a grid 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.650
 time from now I have here before 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.590
 cut out 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:34.740
 that is it therefore comes in it 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:40.619
 it comes from the inside and inside and then 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:43.790
 is it yes and then the inside is in it 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:47.180
 glued with hot glue 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:52.070
 that would just try now 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.070
 yes and now is actually quite easy 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:59.040
 you just take a pair of pliers 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:03.540
 then we would be there to cut something out 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.700
 you just go in there and clips off 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.289
 I did so myself 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.289
 I took a lamp here 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:23.400
 a lamp very short here 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.440
 lifted underneath 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.670
 this is how a sheet of paper illuminates 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.019
 I've got that here 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:38.239
 recorded that one sees so rude 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:40.920
 Paper take him up Lift him up 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:50.120
 then you can sign off with this 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:50.120
 sign off the pen fineliner 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.560
 yes I actually have it very simple then 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:07.940
 I glued the it endorsed the 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:15.109
 often put on it is the grid zack zack 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:15.109
 and I'm just looking for hello 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:25.190
 So do not worry about it here 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:28.220
 then here so marked and sharp and 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:32.840
 then just drawn in, too 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:37.360
 that's not the case, yes 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.360
 as well as in the video it looks like this now 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:46.400
 finished and wales in the front still in the 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:50.630
 Grille at the front still a grid out 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:55.450
 do they simply nicer 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.450
 So see you then and see
