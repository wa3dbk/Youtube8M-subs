with something kind of similar a little
bit<00:02:40.120> different

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
bit different

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.270 
bit different
we<00:02:41.020> start<00:02:41.320> with<00:02:41.530> still<00:02:41.770> the<00:02:41.890> bar<00:02:42.100> with<00:02:42.190> the

sixth and the eighth on the fourth

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.470 
sixth and the eighth on the fourth
string<00:02:44.080> here<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:45.640> pick<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:45.970> two<00:02:46.090> outside

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
string here you pick the two outside

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.070 
string here you pick the two outside
strings<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:47.280> then<00:02:48.280> six<00:02:49.240> on<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.600> third<00:02:49.780> string

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
strings and then six on the third string

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.350 
strings and then six on the third string
then<00:02:50.650> reach<00:02:50.890> up<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.280> grab<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.520> tenth<00:02:51.970> fret

with your pinky and slide it down to
nine<00:02:55.990> so<00:02:56.260> instead<00:02:56.470> of<00:02:56.530> just<00:02:56.710> playing<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:56.950> nine

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
nine so instead of just playing the nine

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.440 
nine so instead of just playing the nine
you're<00:02:57.190> going<00:02:57.310> to<00:02:57.370> slide<00:02:57.640> down<00:02:57.670> to<00:02:58.060> it<00:03:00.000> on<00:03:01.000> the

you're going to slide down to it on the

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.120 
you're going to slide down to it on the
second<00:03:01.780> string<00:03:01.990> there<00:03:02.200> and<00:03:02.410> then<00:03:02.890> do<00:03:03.010> that

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
second string there and then do that

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.660 
second string there and then do that
seven<00:03:03.610> eight<00:03:03.760> again<00:03:03.960> and<00:03:05.310> that's<00:03:06.310> still<00:03:06.520> that

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670

eighth on the fourth string plate seven

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.330 
eighth on the fourth string plate seven
and<00:03:27.730> eight<00:03:27.820> together

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
and eight together

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.660 
and eight together
and<00:03:29.430> then<00:03:30.150> move<00:03:30.390> that<00:03:30.420> up<00:03:30.810> to<00:03:31.140> where<00:03:31.319> it's

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
and then move that up to where it's

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.150 
and then move that up to where it's
seven<00:03:32.670> and<00:03:32.760> nine<00:03:33.140> on<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.440> fourth<00:03:34.709> string<00:03:34.830> here

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
seven and nine on the fourth string here

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.479 
seven and nine on the fourth string here
second<00:03:36.000> string<00:03:36.150> here<00:03:36.360> and<00:03:36.890> then<00:03:37.890> hit<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.280> top

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
second string here and then hit the top

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.970 
second string here and then hit the top
while<00:03:38.790> that's<00:03:39.000> ringing<00:03:39.440> for<00:03:40.440> your<00:03:40.530> pinky<00:03:40.860> on

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
while that's ringing for your pinky on

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.479 
while that's ringing for your pinky on
the<00:03:41.099> ninth<00:03:41.370> fret<00:03:41.580> first<00:03:42.090> string<00:03:42.150> and<00:03:43.310> add<00:03:44.310> that

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
the ninth fret first string and add that

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.640 
the ninth fret first string and add that
to<00:03:44.700> it

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:55.530 

so<00:03:48.580> that's<00:03:48.730> second<00:03:49.000> phrase<00:03:54.150> all<00:03:55.150> right<00:03:55.330> and

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
so that's second phrase all right and

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.390 
so that's second phrase all right and
then<00:03:55.810> we<00:03:55.930> do<00:03:56.379> the<00:03:56.680> same<00:03:56.860> thing

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
then we do the same thing

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.890 
then we do the same thing
very<00:03:57.970> close<00:03:58.269> again<00:03:58.659> same<00:03:59.409> bar<00:04:00.099> to<00:04:00.310> six<00:04:00.900> outside

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
very close again same bar to six outside

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.350 
very close again same bar to six outside
strings<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.680> slide<00:04:05.760> okay<00:04:06.760> so<00:04:06.819> that<00:04:07.090> is<00:04:07.120> all

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
strings the slide okay so that is all

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.270 
strings the slide okay so that is all
the<00:04:07.569> same<00:04:07.810> and<00:04:08.140> when<00:04:08.620> we<00:04:08.680> get<00:04:08.769> to<00:04:08.829> that<00:04:09.010> seven

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
the same and when we get to that seven

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.729 
the same and when we get to that seven
there<00:04:09.640> and<00:04:09.849> now<00:04:10.599> we<00:04:10.659> have<00:04:11.079> a<00:04:11.110> different<00:04:11.500> ending

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
there and now we have a different ending

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.410 
there and now we have a different ending
we're<00:04:11.950> going<00:04:12.099> to<00:04:12.159> hit<00:04:12.310> the<00:04:12.459> six<00:04:12.849> on<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:13.120> first

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
we're going to hit the six on the first

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
we're going to hit the six on the first
and<00:04:13.629> third<00:04:13.720> string<00:04:14.110> and<00:04:15.449> then<00:04:16.449> play<00:04:16.690> nine<00:04:17.169> on

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
and third string and then play nine on

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.300 
and third string and then play nine on
the<00:04:17.470> first<00:04:17.739> and<00:04:19.229> then<00:04:20.229> put<00:04:20.680> your<00:04:20.769> third<00:04:21.010> finger

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
the first and then put your third finger

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.740 
the first and then put your third finger
over<00:04:21.639> on<00:04:21.850> the<00:04:21.970> nine<00:04:22.150> on<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.419> fourth<00:04:22.660> string

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
over on the nine on the fourth string

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.029 
over on the nine on the fourth string
and<00:04:22.930> pick<00:04:23.229> those<00:04:23.440> two<00:04:23.650> notes<00:04:23.830> together<00:04:24.039> and

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
and pick those two notes together and

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.469 
and pick those two notes together and
then<00:04:27.039> we're<00:04:27.190> going<00:04:27.280> to<00:04:27.340> add<00:04:27.580> we're<00:04:28.300> going<00:04:28.419> to

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
then we're going to add we're going to

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:30.450 
then we're going to add we're going to
put<00:04:28.570> our<00:04:28.710> second<00:04:29.710> finger<00:04:29.830> at<00:04:29.979> the<00:04:30.039> eighth<00:04:30.190> fret

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
put our second finger at the eighth fret

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.279 
put our second finger at the eighth fret
here<00:04:30.850> and<00:04:31.360> we're<00:04:31.510> going<00:04:31.630> to<00:04:31.690> do<00:04:31.750> a<00:04:31.780> harmonic

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
here and we're going to do a harmonic

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:33.779 
here and we're going to do a harmonic
see<00:04:32.410> quickly<00:04:32.710> got<00:04:32.919> to<00:04:33.010> get<00:04:33.100> that<00:04:33.220> harmonic

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 
see quickly got to get that harmonic

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:36.240 
see quickly got to get that harmonic
