00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
thing I noticed about this bag I really

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.980 
thing I noticed about this bag I really
like<00:01:10.430> cata<00:01:10.700> products<00:01:11.240> but<00:01:11.420> I<00:01:11.479> find<00:01:11.750> you<00:01:11.869> have

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
like cata products but I find you have

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.810 
like cata products but I find you have
to<00:01:12.170> excuse<00:01:12.829> me<00:01:13.009> you<00:01:13.070> have<00:01:13.189> to<00:01:13.369> struggle<00:01:13.759> a

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
to excuse me you have to struggle a

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.310 
to excuse me you have to struggle a
little<00:01:13.939> bit<00:01:14.090> getting<00:01:14.420> the<00:01:14.600> camera<00:01:14.960> in<00:01:15.049> and<00:01:15.229> out

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
little bit getting the camera in and out

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.950 
little bit getting the camera in and out
and<00:01:15.649> I<00:01:16.100> think<00:01:16.189> it's<00:01:16.520> because<00:01:16.909> of<00:01:17.119> this<00:01:17.299> flap

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
and I think it's because of this flap

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.959 
and I think it's because of this flap
that<00:01:17.990> the<00:01:18.380> way<00:01:18.740> they've<00:01:18.979> situated<00:01:19.610> it<00:01:19.729> on<00:01:19.850> the

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:19.969 
that the way they've situated it on the

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:24.399 
that the way they've situated it on the
bag<00:01:20.149> itself<00:01:20.539> but<00:01:21.469> I<00:01:22.240> got<00:01:23.240> my<00:01:23.390> D<00:01:23.450> 200<00:01:24.049> here<00:01:24.229> with

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
bag itself but I got my D 200 here with
