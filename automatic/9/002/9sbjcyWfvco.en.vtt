00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.820
 feeling future I think that the ipe 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.550
 it's an experience that both in the 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.950
 Professional as a staff is very good 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.600
 for all but culturally to me has 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.520
 been what I liked the most, that is, 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.530
 I fell in love with Turkey from the second one 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.660
 because I love the one that goes here 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.280
 imagine what I liked there I go to 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.080
 I learned a lot and we were lucky to 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.030
 that was not going about advertising was about 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.940
 marketing and we believe that actually 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.259
 very complements our career and 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.000
 have the experience of working with 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.470
 business marketing people that 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.950
 he calls us the creative ones and we do not 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.129
 they did too much, either 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.840
 but it was super enriching is very useful 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.360
 work with engineers I also have 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.680
 what to say then I think it's the 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.959
 first campaign that I do in which 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.940
 I really know what I am 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.700
 announcing first hand and that too 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.780
 It has helped a lot and it was very interesting 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.910
 because of that they were professionals of 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.470
 true in agency agencies 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.300
 multinationals and yes we could 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.220
 learn a lot from them about the 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.660
 complementary activities because it was a 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.950
 great opportunity to actually meet 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.480
 everyone with whom you were there not 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.580
 because although in group work 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.810
 dedicated to work in groups you knew 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.000
 your group but the activities 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.440
 complementary activities allowed that 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.260
 there would be integration with the whole world 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.239
 of ipe then I think that both 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.880
 weeks is a time that is very well 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.220
 because you have so many activities is a 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.290
 program so intense that it does not give you time 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.239
 to miss nothing less than what you have 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.269
 here and you completely focus on what 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:06.480
 that you have there in the program at all 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.459
 what you are learning I think it is 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.280
 an added value with respect to the degree 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.890
 because in two weeks you learn to 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.480
 career are you pressed you have to 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.890
 do it right you have to prove before 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.810
 the people who are others 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.160
 is what you know you do not have to leave 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.360
 go and you also have to learn to 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.480
 listen to others 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.480
 i 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:32.360
 very funny very funny amazing 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:36.870
 surprising very intense enriching 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:39.650
 intense fellowship challenge 'respect 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.650
 necessary 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.180
