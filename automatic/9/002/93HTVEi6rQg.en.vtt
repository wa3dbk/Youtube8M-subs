essentially<00:02:01.049> what<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.229> does<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.740> allows

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
essentially what it does is it allows

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.580 
essentially what it does is it allows
you<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:05.329> de<00:02:06.329> las<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.630> flat<00:02:06.840> iron<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.079> have<00:02:07.259> glide

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
you to de las a flat iron to have glide

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.100 
you to de las a flat iron to have glide
down<00:02:07.829> your<00:02:07.890> here

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
down your here

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.230 
down your here
prevents<00:02:09.560> any<00:02:09.770> dents<00:02:10.039> or<00:02:10.430> bumps<00:02:10.880> you<00:02:10.940> know<00:02:11.120> if

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
prevents any dents or bumps you know if

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.210 
prevents any dents or bumps you know if
you<00:02:11.300> flutter<00:02:11.510> in<00:02:11.570> your<00:02:11.780> hair<00:02:12.020> and<00:02:12.140> you<00:02:12.320> stop<00:02:13.010> at

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
you flutter in your hair and you stop at

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.890 
you flutter in your hair and you stop at
a<00:02:13.250> spot<00:02:13.580> where<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.970> hair<00:02:14.150> gets<00:02:14.270> snagged<00:02:14.630> you

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
a spot where the hair gets snagged you

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.420 
a spot where the hair gets snagged you
get<00:02:15.050> like<00:02:15.140> a<00:02:15.230> little<00:02:15.440> dent<00:02:15.710> or<00:02:15.890> rippling<00:02:16.280> your

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
get like a little dent or rippling your

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.780 
get like a little dent or rippling your
hair<00:02:16.640> but<00:02:17.150> take<00:02:17.360> prevents<00:02:17.780> that<00:02:18.110> it<00:02:19.100> makes<00:02:19.610> it

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
hair but take prevents that it makes it

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:20.860 
hair but take prevents that it makes it
easier<00:02:20.090> for<00:02:20.300> the<00:02:20.360> hair<00:02:20.510> to<00:02:20.600> glide<00:02:20.840> through

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
easier for the hair to glide through

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.830 
easier for the hair to glide through
like<00:02:21.380> it<00:02:21.500> literally<00:02:21.890> it's<00:02:22.130> just<00:02:22.340> like<00:02:22.840> it

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
like it literally it's just like it

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.770 
like it literally it's just like it
glides<00:02:24.200> through<00:02:24.380> really<00:02:24.890> really<00:02:25.310> easy<00:02:25.780> with

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
glides through really really easy with

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.110 
glides through really really easy with
this<00:02:27.020> so<00:02:27.590> it's<00:02:27.860> really<00:02:28.160> good<00:02:28.490> if<00:02:28.670> you<00:02:28.790> like<00:02:28.970> to

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
this so it's really good if you like to

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.670 
this so it's really good if you like to
curl<00:02:29.330> your<00:02:29.450> hair<00:02:29.600> with<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.810> flyer<00:02:30.020> because<00:02:30.350> it

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
curl your hair with the flyer because it

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.330 
curl your hair with the flyer because it
just<00:02:30.830> glides<00:02:31.670> it's<00:02:32.240> textured<00:02:33.050> so<00:02:33.800> that<00:02:34.070> if<00:02:34.250> you

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
just glides it's textured so that if you

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.400 
just glides it's textured so that if you
do<00:02:34.520> get<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:34.700> hair<00:02:35.030> that's<00:02:35.270> out<00:02:35.600> of<00:02:35.660> place<00:02:36.140> or<00:02:36.350> a

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
do get a hair that's out of place or a

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.100 
do get a hair that's out of place or a
snagged<00:02:36.890> it<00:02:37.660> straightens<00:02:38.660> it<00:02:38.750> out<00:02:38.780> the

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
snagged it straightens it out the

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.800 
snagged it straightens it out the
texture<00:02:39.500> untape<00:02:40.190> straightens<00:02:41.060> out<00:02:41.240> the<00:02:41.570> hair

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
texture untape straightens out the hair

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.600 
texture untape straightens out the hair
as<00:02:42.140> it<00:02:42.320> goes<00:02:42.500> through<00:02:42.530> so<00:02:43.070> like<00:02:43.220> I<00:02:43.250> said<00:02:43.370> you

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
as it goes through so like I said you

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.449 
as it goes through so like I said you
won't<00:02:43.730> get<00:02:43.940> that<00:02:44.060> dent<00:02:44.540> in<00:02:44.690> your<00:02:44.720> hair<00:02:45.220> it<00:02:46.220> also

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
won't get that dent in your hair it also

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.229 
won't get that dent in your hair it also
helps<00:02:47.000> to<00:02:47.060> evenly<00:02:47.750> disperse<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.709> heat<00:02:49.060> so<00:02:50.060> if

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
helps to evenly disperse the heat so if

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.780 
helps to evenly disperse the heat so if
you<00:02:50.330> have<00:02:50.480> a<00:02:50.510> flat<00:02:51.170> iron<00:02:51.200> that's<00:02:51.680> not<00:02:52.040> even<00:02:52.700> if

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
you have a flat iron that's not even if

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.220 
you have a flat iron that's not even if
it<00:02:52.880> is<00:02:53.000> ceramic<00:02:53.330> but<00:02:53.660> I<00:02:53.690> was<00:02:53.780> going<00:02:53.840> to<00:02:53.959> say<00:02:54.080> now

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
it is ceramic but I was going to say now

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.210 
it is ceramic but I was going to say now
ceramic<00:02:55.480> any<00:02:56.480> kind<00:02:56.989> of<00:02:57.080> flat<00:02:57.260> iron<00:02:57.470> really<00:02:57.890> you

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
ceramic any kind of flat iron really you

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.620 
ceramic any kind of flat iron really you
can<00:02:58.430> get<00:02:58.610> hot<00:02:58.790> spots<00:02:59.090> in<00:02:59.270> your<00:02:59.390> flat<00:02:59.600> iron

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
can get hot spots in your flat iron

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:00.699 
can get hot spots in your flat iron
especially<00:03:00.170> if<00:03:00.230> you're<00:03:00.320> holding<00:03:00.560> it<00:03:00.680> close

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
especially if you're holding it close

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.860 
especially if you're holding it close
where<00:03:01.430> certain<00:03:01.760> parts<00:03:02.180> of<00:03:02.270> the<00:03:02.330> plates<00:03:02.630> will

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
where certain parts of the plates will

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.690 
where certain parts of the plates will
be<00:03:02.989> hotter<00:03:03.230> than<00:03:03.440> others<00:03:03.770> so<00:03:04.250> when<00:03:04.430> you<00:03:04.520> go

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
be hotter than others so when you go

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.560 
be hotter than others so when you go
down<00:03:04.940> your<00:03:05.150> hair<00:03:06.370> it's<00:03:07.370> gonna<00:03:07.700> heat<00:03:08.090> it<00:03:08.270> may

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
down your hair it's gonna heat it may

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.510 
down your hair it's gonna heat it may
heat<00:03:08.780> unevenly<00:03:09.350> where<00:03:09.709> sometimes<00:03:10.040> you<00:03:10.310> flat

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
heat unevenly where sometimes you flat

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.979 
heat unevenly where sometimes you flat
iron<00:03:10.700> a<00:03:10.790> section<00:03:11.180> of<00:03:11.239> your<00:03:11.360> hair<00:03:11.420> and<00:03:11.690> you<00:03:11.810> see

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
iron a section of your hair and you see

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.330 
iron a section of your hair and you see
that<00:03:12.140> part<00:03:12.380> of<00:03:12.500> it<00:03:12.590> straight<00:03:12.860> and<00:03:12.950> part<00:03:13.160> of<00:03:13.190> its

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
that part of it straight and part of its

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.420 
that part of it straight and part of its
not<00:03:13.690> and<00:03:14.690> it<00:03:14.780> also<00:03:14.930> can<00:03:15.320> that<00:03:15.620> that<00:03:15.980> hot<00:03:16.190> spot

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
not and it also can that that hot spot

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.880 
not and it also can that that hot spot
can<00:03:16.610> burn<00:03:16.880> your<00:03:17.060> hair<00:03:17.269> as<00:03:17.420> well<00:03:17.660> so<00:03:18.470> what<00:03:18.769> this

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
can burn your hair as well so what this

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.240 
can burn your hair as well so what this
does<00:03:18.950> is<00:03:19.280> it<00:03:19.310> evenly<00:03:19.760> disperses<00:03:20.330> the<00:03:20.540> heat

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
does is it evenly disperses the heat

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.729 
does is it evenly disperses the heat
across<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:22.580> plates<00:03:22.850> so<00:03:23.630> that<00:03:23.660> it's<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.500> same

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
across the plates so that it's the same

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.830 
across the plates so that it's the same
temperature<00:03:25.340> all<00:03:25.519> the<00:03:26.000> way<00:03:26.120> across<00:03:26.239> on<00:03:26.720> your

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
temperature all the way across on your

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.030 
temperature all the way across on your
flat<00:03:27.019> ironing<00:03:27.260> your<00:03:27.320> hair<00:03:27.410> so<00:03:27.739> you're<00:03:27.920> going

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
flat ironing your hair so you're going

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.160 
flat ironing your hair so you're going
to<00:03:28.130> get<00:03:28.190> an<00:03:28.310> even<00:03:28.780> straightness<00:03:29.780> all<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:30.080> way

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
to get an even straightness all the way

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.660 
to get an even straightness all the way
down<00:03:30.380> and<00:03:30.680> it's<00:03:30.950> going<00:03:31.070> to<00:03:31.130> prevent<00:03:31.430> you<00:03:31.640> from

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
down and it's going to prevent you from

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.570 
down and it's going to prevent you from
brighten<00:03:32.150> your<00:03:32.239> hair<00:03:32.950> so<00:03:33.950> that<00:03:34.340> dumb

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
brighten your hair so that dumb

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.520 
brighten your hair so that dumb
essentially<00:03:35.060> it's<00:03:35.239> what<00:03:35.450> the<00:03:35.660> tape<00:03:35.900> does<00:03:36.200> it

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
essentially it's what the tape does it

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.289 
essentially it's what the tape does it
doesn't<00:03:36.709> really<00:03:36.890> do<00:03:37.070> anything<00:03:37.310> more<00:03:38.269> than

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
doesn't really do anything more than

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.710 
doesn't really do anything more than
that<00:03:38.510> but<00:03:39.140> I<00:03:39.380> absolutely<00:03:40.160> love<00:03:40.400> it<00:03:40.430> and<00:03:40.790> I<00:03:41.269> will

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
that but I absolutely love it and I will

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.490 
that but I absolutely love it and I will
never<00:03:42.790> fly<00:03:43.790> down<00:03:44.000> again<00:03:44.660> unless<00:03:44.989> i'm<00:03:45.200> using

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
never fly down again unless i'm using

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
sheets of tape now this is my method for

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.580 
sheets of tape now this is my method for
doing<00:05:31.480> it<00:05:31.720> so<00:05:31.930> you're<00:05:32.080> going<00:05:32.170> to<00:05:32.230> take<00:05:32.320> the

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
doing it so you're going to take the

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.590 
doing it so you're going to take the
sticky<00:05:32.950> side<00:05:33.160> of<00:05:33.340> the<00:05:33.370> tape<00:05:33.460> and<00:05:33.820> I<00:05:33.910> take<00:05:34.180> the

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
sticky side of the tape and I take the

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.400 
sticky side of the tape and I take the

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
edge of the tape and line it up with the

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.370 
edge of the tape and line it up with the
side<00:05:39.070> of<00:05:39.130> the<00:05:39.340> plate<00:05:39.580> and<00:05:39.820> once<00:05:40.690> you<00:05:40.900> lay<00:05:41.110> it<00:05:41.140> on

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
side of the plate and once you lay it on

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.470 
side of the plate and once you lay it on
there<00:05:41.590> you<00:05:41.740> take<00:05:41.950> a<00:05:42.010> cloth<00:05:42.370> and<00:05:42.670> rub<00:05:43.000> out<00:05:43.240> any

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:43.480 
there you take a cloth and rub out any

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.060 
there you take a cloth and rub out any
bubbles<00:05:43.720> you<00:05:44.050> want<00:05:44.200> to<00:05:44.260> make<00:05:44.380> sure<00:05:44.410> that<00:05:44.920> it's

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
bubbles you want to make sure that it's

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.340 
bubbles you want to make sure that it's
really<00:05:45.310> smooth<00:05:45.760> on<00:05:46.000> the<00:05:46.150> plate<00:05:46.420> once<00:05:47.080> you<00:05:47.230> do

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.350 
really smooth on the plate once you do

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.800 
really smooth on the plate once you do
that<00:05:47.380> just<00:05:47.620> wrap<00:05:48.370> it<00:05:48.400> around<00:05:48.760> the<00:05:49.300> rest<00:05:49.510> of<00:05:49.660> the

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
that just wrap it around the rest of the

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.170 
that just wrap it around the rest of the
way<00:05:49.960> now<00:05:50.830> you<00:05:50.920> could<00:05:51.370> have<00:05:51.490> cut<00:05:51.670> the<00:05:51.790> tape<00:05:51.970> in

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
way now you could have cut the tape in

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.390 
way now you could have cut the tape in
half<00:05:52.420> and<00:05:52.750> just<00:05:53.020> use<00:05:53.350> half<00:05:53.800> of<00:05:53.950> the<00:05:54.070> tape<00:05:54.250> to

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
half and just use half of the tape to

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.300 
half and just use half of the tape to
wrap<00:05:54.550> around<00:05:54.730> I<00:05:55.150> use<00:05:55.810> the<00:05:56.080> entire<00:05:56.560> sheet<00:05:57.100> of

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
wrap around I use the entire sheet of

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
wrap around I use the entire sheet of
tape<00:05:59.100> just<00:06:00.100> because<00:06:00.340> I<00:06:00.370> feel<00:06:00.700> it<00:06:00.850> holds<00:06:01.150> better

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
tape just because I feel it holds better

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.780 
tape just because I feel it holds better
I<00:06:01.420> don't<00:06:01.690> want<00:06:01.840> it<00:06:01.930> to<00:06:02.200> unwrap<00:06:03.010> while<00:06:03.520> I'm

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
I don't want it to unwrap while I'm

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.420 
I don't want it to unwrap while I'm
using<00:06:04.060> it<00:06:04.330> so<00:06:04.540> wrapping<00:06:05.410> it<00:06:05.530> around<00:06:05.590> twice<00:06:05.950> for

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
using it so wrapping it around twice for

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.540 
using it so wrapping it around twice for
me<00:06:06.900> makes<00:06:07.900> me<00:06:08.050> feel<00:06:08.080> more<00:06:08.410> secure<00:06:08.620> so<00:06:09.280> I<00:06:09.310> just

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
me makes me feel more secure so I just

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.130 
me makes me feel more secure so I just
wrap<00:06:09.730> it<00:06:09.760> around<00:06:09.940> again<00:06:10.360> and<00:06:10.390> the<00:06:10.690> next<00:06:10.840> time<00:06:10.990> I

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:11.140 
wrap it around again and the next time I

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.900 
wrap it around again and the next time I
lay<00:06:11.410> that<00:06:11.560> tape<00:06:11.800> across<00:06:12.010> the<00:06:12.130> plate<00:06:12.490> I<00:06:12.670> make

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910 
lay that tape across the plate I make

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.330 
lay that tape across the plate I make
sure<00:06:12.940> I<00:06:13.090> smooth<00:06:13.450> it<00:06:13.540> out<00:06:13.660> again<00:06:13.990> and<00:06:14.200> once<00:06:15.190> I

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.340 
sure I smooth it out again and once I

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.100 
sure I smooth it out again and once I
get<00:06:15.520> it<00:06:15.640> all<00:06:15.820> the<00:06:15.850> way<00:06:16.090> on<00:06:16.270> there<00:06:16.600> take<00:06:16.930> my

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
get it all the way on there take my

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.380 
get it all the way on there take my
cloth<00:06:17.350> and<00:06:17.590> I<00:06:17.650> smooth<00:06:18.100> it<00:06:18.250> out<00:06:18.400> all<00:06:18.820> the<00:06:19.270> way

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:19.390 
cloth and I smooth it out all the way

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:22.920 
cloth and I smooth it out all the way
around<00:06:19.570> the<00:06:20.050> iron<00:06:20.290> and<00:06:21.420> another<00:06:22.420> thing<00:06:22.540> that<00:06:22.840> I

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
around the iron and another thing that I

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.409 
around the iron and another thing that I
do<00:06:22.990> that<00:06:23.380> I<00:06:23.410> didn't<00:06:23.710> show<00:06:23.860> in<00:06:23.980> this<00:06:24.070> video<00:06:24.250> is<00:06:24.730> I

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:25.419 
do that I didn't show in this video is I

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:27.120 
do that I didn't show in this video is I
actually<00:06:25.570> trim<00:06:26.230> the<00:06:26.410> tape<00:06:26.590> around<00:06:26.740> the<00:06:26.919> top

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.130 
actually trim the tape around the top

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.190 
actually trim the tape around the top
and<00:06:27.280> bottom<00:06:27.400> and<00:06:27.730> what<00:06:28.570> you<00:06:28.690> do<00:06:28.840> peel<00:06:29.169> the

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:29.200 
and bottom and what you do peel the

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.270 
and bottom and what you do peel the
backing<00:06:29.380> off<00:06:29.650> the<00:06:29.770> second<00:06:30.100> she

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 
backing off the second she

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.860 
backing off the second she
we're<00:06:30.490> going<00:06:30.580> to<00:06:30.639> do<00:06:30.820> it<00:06:30.940> for<00:06:31.150> the<00:06:31.330> other<00:06:31.570> plate

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 
we're going to do it for the other plate

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.300 
we're going to do it for the other plate
because<00:06:32.170> you<00:06:32.260> need<00:06:32.410> to<00:06:32.560> apply<00:06:32.770> it<00:06:32.860> to<00:06:33.040> the<00:06:33.130> top

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
because you need to apply it to the top

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.340 
because you need to apply it to the top
and<00:06:33.490> bottom<00:06:33.610> so<00:06:34.420> I'm<00:06:34.540> applying<00:06:34.780> it<00:06:35.050> I<00:06:35.110> line

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:35.350 
and bottom so I'm applying it I line

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.070 
and bottom so I'm applying it I line
that<00:06:35.590> edge<00:06:35.770> up<00:06:36.070> on<00:06:36.510> the<00:06:37.510> edge<00:06:37.660> of<00:06:37.810> the<00:06:37.900> plate

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
that edge up on the edge of the plate

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.950 
that edge up on the edge of the plate
and<00:06:38.350> smooth<00:06:39.340> out<00:06:39.490> any<00:06:39.700> bubbles<00:06:39.970> on<00:06:40.360> the<00:06:40.419> plate

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 
and smooth out any bubbles on the plate

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.260 
and smooth out any bubbles on the plate
make<00:06:41.260> sure<00:06:41.290> it's<00:06:41.620> nice<00:06:41.800> and<00:06:41.860> smooth<00:06:42.280> and<00:06:42.460> then

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.270 
make sure it's nice and smooth and then

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.450 
make sure it's nice and smooth and then
I<00:06:43.360> continue<00:06:43.870> to<00:06:43.900> smoothly<00:06:44.320> wrap<00:06:44.860> the<00:06:45.250> tape

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.460 
I continue to smoothly wrap the tape

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.330 
I continue to smoothly wrap the tape
around<00:06:45.520> again<00:06:46.270> and<00:06:46.680> once<00:06:47.680> I<00:06:47.800> go<00:06:47.980> over<00:06:48.190> that

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:48.340 
around again and once I go over that

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.400 
around again and once I go over that
plate<00:06:48.639> again<00:06:48.970> I'm<00:06:49.150> going<00:06:49.270> to<00:06:49.360> smooth<00:06:49.750> it<00:06:50.139> out

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:50.410 
plate again I'm going to smooth it out

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.409 
plate again I'm going to smooth it out
again<00:06:50.919> over<00:06:51.250> the<00:06:51.370> plate<00:06:51.610> that's<00:06:51.820> very<00:06:52.210> very

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:52.419 
again over the plate that's very very

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:54.990 
again over the plate that's very very
important<00:06:53.250> so<00:06:54.250> I'm<00:06:54.340> just<00:06:54.460> going<00:06:54.610> to<00:06:54.700> smooth<00:06:54.910> it

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:55.000 
important so I'm just going to smooth it

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.670 
important so I'm just going to smooth it
all<00:06:55.090> the<00:06:55.240> way<00:06:55.300> out<00:06:55.330> again<00:06:55.720> and<00:06:55.930> then<00:06:56.020> trim<00:06:56.380> the

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:56.680 
all the way out again and then trim the

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.100 
all the way out again and then trim the
excess<00:06:57.280> tape<00:06:57.730> around<00:06:58.060> the<00:06:58.240> top<00:06:58.510> and<00:06:58.540> bottom<00:06:58.840> of

00:06:59.100 --> 00:06:59.110 
excess tape around the top and bottom of

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:03.180 
excess tape around the top and bottom of
the<00:06:59.139> plate<00:06:59.470> and<00:07:01.110> once<00:07:02.110> it's<00:07:02.290> all<00:07:02.500> done<00:07:02.530> this

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:03.190 
the plate and once it's all done this

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.800 
the plate and once it's all done this
isn't<00:07:03.490> in<00:07:03.580> the<00:07:03.700> instructions<00:07:04.360> but<00:07:04.570> what<00:07:04.780> I

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:04.810 
isn't in the instructions but what I

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.800 
isn't in the instructions but what I
like<00:07:05.200> to<00:07:05.440> do<00:07:05.620> I<00:07:05.940> go<00:07:06.940> over<00:07:07.030> and<00:07:07.240> smooth<00:07:07.450> it<00:07:07.540> again

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:07.810 
like to do I go over and smooth it again

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:09.840 
like to do I go over and smooth it again
and<00:07:08.050> then<00:07:08.140> i<00:07:08.230> plug<00:07:08.620> the<00:07:08.830> flat<00:07:09.040> iron<00:07:09.220> in<00:07:09.490> again

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:09.850 
and then i plug the flat iron in again

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.810 
and then i plug the flat iron in again
and<00:07:10.060> heat<00:07:10.780> it<00:07:10.810> up<00:07:10.990> and<00:07:11.350> close<00:07:12.100> the<00:07:12.310> plates<00:07:12.580> to

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:12.820 
and heat it up and close the plates to

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:16.460
