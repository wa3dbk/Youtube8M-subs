00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.190 
doors
I<00:01:02.809> believe<00:01:03.860> this<00:01:04.860> was<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.430> doors<00:01:05.939> was<00:01:06.540> how<00:01:07.080> it

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
I believe this was the doors was how it

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.730 
I believe this was the doors was how it
was<00:01:07.409> opened<00:01:07.860> or<00:01:08.250> easily<00:01:09.979> like<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.270> know

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
was opened or easily like this so I know

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.530 
was opened or easily like this so I know
this<00:01:13.740> part<00:01:14.250> large<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.360> must<00:01:15.689> be<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> panel<00:01:16.530> and

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
this part large it must be a panel and

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:24.469 
this part large it must be a panel and
it<00:01:18.540> was<00:01:19.939> cut<00:01:20.939> from<00:01:21.210> here<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.759> this<00:01:23.759> poles<00:01:24.150> are

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
it was cut from here and this poles are

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.480 
it was cut from here and this poles are
actually<00:01:24.810> right<00:01:24.990> here<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.740> was<00:01:25.890> moved<00:01:26.159> over

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
actually right here it was moved over

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.730 
actually right here it was moved over
here<00:01:27.590> this<00:01:28.590> way<00:01:28.829> way<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.759> do<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.560> they<00:01:31.560> can

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
here this way way to do that is they can

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.649 
here this way way to do that is they can
open<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.310> all<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.640> way<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.060> they<00:01:33.180> can<00:01:33.240> add<00:01:33.630> a

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
open it all the way so they can add a

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.530 
open it all the way so they can add a
shelf<00:01:34.020> inside<00:01:34.470> they<00:01:34.950> can<00:01:35.159> maximize<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.090> using

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
shelf inside they can maximize the using

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.929 
shelf inside they can maximize the using
of<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.049> interior<00:01:37.500> space<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.400> know<00:01:38.640> that

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
of the interior space and you know that

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.810 
of the interior space and you know that
because<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.780> can<00:01:39.990> see<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.560> spot<00:01:40.890> down<00:01:41.250> here

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
because you can see the spot down here

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.690 
because you can see the spot down here
where<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.689> yes<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.439> was<00:01:43.860> originally<00:01:44.430> filled

to<00:02:14.140> me<00:02:14.880> obviously<00:02:15.880> originally<00:02:16.840> this<00:02:17.680> piece<00:02:18.010> is

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
to me obviously originally this piece is

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.780 
to me obviously originally this piece is
supposed<00:02:18.790> not<00:02:19.720> to<00:02:19.780> have<00:02:20.290> a<00:02:20.560> chart<00:02:21.010> down<00:02:21.370> below

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
supposed not to have a chart down below

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.830 
supposed not to have a chart down below
and<00:02:22.560> now<00:02:23.560> it<00:02:23.770> has<00:02:24.010> it<00:02:24.280> I<00:02:24.490> think<00:02:25.210> this<00:02:25.330> must<00:02:25.630> be<00:02:25.750> a

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
and now it has it I think this must be a

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.670 
and now it has it I think this must be a
newly<00:02:26.490> added<00:02:27.840> they<00:02:28.840> added<00:02:29.290> this<00:02:29.530> because

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
newly added they added this because

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.949 
newly added they added this because
because<00:02:32.680> it's<00:02:33.100> inconvenient<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.300> reach<00:02:34.600> stuff

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
because it's inconvenient to reach stuff

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.100 
because it's inconvenient to reach stuff
from<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.380> inside<00:02:35.800> so<00:02:36.190> they<00:02:36.910> had<00:02:37.090> a<00:02:37.120> manager<00:02:37.959> in

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
from the inside so they had a manager in

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.100 
from the inside so they had a manager in
