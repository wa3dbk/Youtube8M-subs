to<00:01:34.320> know<00:01:34.380> how<00:01:34.500> things<00:01:34.710> work<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.939> can<00:01:36.090> do<00:01:36.210> it

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
to know how things work so you can do it

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.660 
to know how things work so you can do it
do<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.810> on<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.049> cheap<00:01:37.079> which<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.040> always<00:01:38.220> the

here's what I suggest you do for

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.710 
here's what I suggest you do for
instance<00:01:43.920> this<00:01:44.340> PA<00:01:44.520> speaker<00:01:45.000> which<00:01:45.420> has<00:01:45.600> this

to a standard radio amplifier output
which<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:50.880> just<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.299> two<00:01:51.659> wires<00:01:51.930> like<00:01:52.290> this

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
which is just to two wires like this

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.649 
which is just to two wires like this
speaker<00:01:53.820> wire<00:01:53.970> I'm<00:01:54.180> going<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.390> connect<00:01:54.600> the

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
speaker wire I'm going to connect the

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.310 
speaker wire I'm going to connect the
speaker<00:01:54.899> wire<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.799> this<00:01:56.270> now<00:01:57.270> first<00:01:58.020> thing<00:01:58.229> you

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
speaker wire to this now first thing you

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.630 
speaker wire to this now first thing you
need<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.469> know<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.770> what's<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.159> phasing<00:01:59.520> of

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
need to know is what's the phasing of

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.069 
need to know is what's the phasing of
the<00:01:59.729> speaker<00:02:00.030> which<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.509> positive<00:02:00.960> which

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
the speaker which is the positive which

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.359 
the speaker which is the positive which
is<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.320> negative<00:02:01.680> because<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:01.920> want<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.219> have

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
is the negative because you want to have

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.069 
is the negative because you want to have
your<00:02:02.490> speakers<00:02:02.850> in<00:02:03.030> correct<00:02:03.630> phasing<00:02:04.020> you

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
your speakers in correct phasing you

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.510 
your speakers in correct phasing you
don't<00:02:04.229> want<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.439> just<00:02:04.560> do<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:05.159> know<00:02:05.189> and

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
don't want to just do it you know and

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.029 
don't want to just do it you know and
and<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.180> do<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.930> old<00:02:07.079> pray<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.560> hope<00:02:07.649> method

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
and and do the old pray and hope method

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.169 
and and do the old pray and hope method
you<00:02:08.129> want<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.369> know<00:02:08.489> for<00:02:08.640> sure<00:02:08.700> what<00:02:09.030> you're

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
you want to know for sure what you're

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.119 
you want to know for sure what you're
doing<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.509> how<00:02:09.629> it's<00:02:10.050> being<00:02:10.229> done<00:02:10.319> properly

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
doing and how it's being done properly

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.400 
doing and how it's being done properly
so<00:02:11.700> here's<00:02:11.879> what<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.060> suggest<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.540> do<00:02:12.690> take

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
so here's what I suggest you do take

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.650 
so here's what I suggest you do take
multi-meter<00:02:13.920> such<00:02:14.250> as<00:02:14.370> this<00:02:14.550> set<00:02:15.360> it<00:02:15.480> to

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
multi-meter such as this set it to

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.510 
multi-meter such as this set it to
continuity<00:02:16.290> which<00:02:16.740> is<00:02:16.920> going<00:02:17.070> to<00:02:17.130> typically

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
continuity which is going to typically

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.680 
continuity which is going to typically
look<00:02:17.700> like<00:02:17.940> this<00:02:18.150> was<00:02:18.300> going<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.510> have<00:02:18.660> a

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
look like this was going to have a

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.110 
look like this was going to have a
little<00:02:18.780> audible<00:02:19.290> sound<00:02:20.160> wave<00:02:20.370> which<00:02:20.730> is<00:02:20.910> what

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
little audible sound wave which is what

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.810 
little audible sound wave which is what
mine<00:02:21.600> has<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.170> almost<00:02:22.620> everyone<00:02:22.950> craftsmen's

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
mine has and almost everyone craftsmen's

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.010 
mine has and almost everyone craftsmen's
flukes<00:02:24.120> they<00:02:24.270> all<00:02:24.450> pretty<00:02:24.570> much<00:02:24.690> have<00:02:24.840> a

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
flukes they all pretty much have a

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.840 
flukes they all pretty much have a
standardized<00:02:25.470> type<00:02:25.680> of<00:02:25.800> logo<00:02:26.100> now<00:02:26.640> what<00:02:26.790> you

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
standardized type of logo now what you

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.760 
standardized type of logo now what you
do<00:02:27.000> is<00:02:27.090> set<00:02:27.240> it<00:02:27.330> onto<00:02:27.450> their<00:02:27.690> take<00:02:28.440> you<00:02:28.560> to

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
do is set it onto their take you to

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.500 
do is set it onto their take you to
probes<00:02:29.100> when<00:02:29.580> you<00:02:29.700> touch<00:02:29.880> these<00:02:30.030> two<00:02:30.090> together

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
probes when you touch these two together

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.660 
probes when you touch these two together
it's<00:02:30.720> gonna<00:02:30.840> make<00:02:31.050> an<00:02:31.170> audible<00:02:31.530> sound<00:02:34.670> like

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
it's gonna make an audible sound like

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.310 
it's gonna make an audible sound like
that<00:02:35.910> so<00:02:36.270> that's<00:02:36.390> what<00:02:36.660> you<00:02:36.780> know<00:02:36.990> that<00:02:37.170> you're

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
that so that's what you know that you're

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.650 
that so that's what you know that you're
connecting<00:02:37.860> one<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.490> other<00:02:38.520> so<00:02:38.970> if<00:02:39.180> you're

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
connecting one to the other so if you're

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.450 
connecting one to the other so if you're
on<00:02:39.780> one<00:02:39.900> side<00:02:40.110> of<00:02:40.140> this<00:02:40.290> plug<00:02:40.590> say<00:02:41.280> for

on one side of this plug say for

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.060 
on one side of this plug say for
instance<00:02:41.760> on<00:02:41.850> this<00:02:41.970> 1/8<00:02:42.330> inch<00:02:42.570> jack<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.860> outer

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
instance on this 1/8 inch jack the outer

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.950 
instance on this 1/8 inch jack the outer
tip<00:02:44.430> is<00:02:44.640> going<00:02:44.790> to<00:02:44.910> be<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.240> positive<00:02:45.630> terminal

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
tip is going to be the positive terminal

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.830 
tip is going to be the positive terminal
of<00:02:46.050> this<00:02:46.260> PA<00:02:46.470> speaker<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.940> back<00:02:48.300> one<00:02:48.600> is<00:02:48.720> going

to be the negative terminal on the

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.670 
to be the negative terminal on the
speaker<00:02:50.280> don't<00:02:51.180> take<00:02:51.450> for<00:02:51.870> granted<00:02:51.900> that<00:02:52.410> you

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
speaker don't take for granted that you

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.850 
speaker don't take for granted that you
know<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.970> stripe<00:02:54.480> what<00:02:54.840> wire<00:02:55.140> is<00:02:55.410> positive

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
know the stripe what wire is positive

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.320 
know the stripe what wire is positive
because<00:02:56.100> in<00:02:56.220> a<00:02:56.310> lot<00:02:56.460> of<00:02:56.490> cases<00:02:56.760> it's<00:02:57.120> the

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
because in a lot of cases it's the

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.140 
because in a lot of cases it's the
complete<00:02:57.810> opposite<00:02:58.410> so<00:02:58.890> never<00:02:59.130> take<00:02:59.430> that<00:02:59.910> for

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
complete opposite so never take that for

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.390 
complete opposite so never take that for
granted<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.780> right<00:03:00.960> way<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.170> do<00:03:01.320> it<00:03:01.470> is<00:03:01.650> do

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
granted the right way to do it is do

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.970 
granted the right way to do it is do
this<00:03:04.370> and<00:03:05.370> this<00:03:05.460> is<00:03:05.520> just<00:03:05.820> a<00:03:05.880> simple<00:03:06.090> 2<00:03:06.360> wire

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
this and this is just a simple 2 wire

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.740 
this and this is just a simple 2 wire
type<00:03:07.980> of<00:03:08.130> deal<00:03:08.280> so<00:03:08.520> I<00:03:08.580> want<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:08.760> separate<00:03:09.540> these

of the 1/8 inch Jack which is going to

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.250 
of the 1/8 inch Jack which is going to
be<00:03:21.990> my<00:03:22.290> positive<00:03:22.830> and<00:03:23.150> just<00:03:24.150> touch<00:03:24.570> through

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
be my positive and just touch through

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.180 
be my positive and just touch through
the<00:03:25.380> insulation<00:03:26.090> on<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.170> wire<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:28.440> there<00:03:29.070> you

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
the insulation on the wire and there you

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.540 
the insulation on the wire and there you
go

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
go

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.850

I<00:03:29.580> can<00:03:30.120> hear<00:03:30.390> audibly<00:03:30.780> that<00:03:31.020> this<00:03:31.230> here<00:03:31.590> is<00:03:31.740> the

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
I can hear audibly that this here is the

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.280 
I can hear audibly that this here is the
other<00:03:32.130> end<00:03:32.400> of<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:33.480> positive<00:03:33.870> terminal<00:03:34.140> of<00:03:34.200> my

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
other end of the positive terminal of my

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.080 
other end of the positive terminal of my
speaker<00:03:34.620> so<00:03:34.770> in<00:03:35.040> this<00:03:35.250> case<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.640> positive

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
speaker so in this case the positive

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.600 
speaker so in this case the positive
wire<00:03:36.270> is<00:03:36.510> positive<00:03:37.200> that's<00:03:38.040> going<00:03:38.250> to<00:03:38.310> be<00:03:38.400> that

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
wire is positive that's going to be that

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.790 
wire is positive that's going to be that
so<00:03:38.880> your<00:03:39.030> negative<00:03:39.450> is<00:03:39.630> going<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.320> be<00:03:40.530> the

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
so your negative is going to be the

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.090 
so your negative is going to be the
solid<00:03:41.160> non<00:03:42.030> striped<00:03:42.420> wire<00:03:42.660> so<00:03:43.410> with<00:03:43.590> that<00:03:43.709> said

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
solid non striped wire so with that said

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.060 
solid non striped wire so with that said
you<00:03:44.760> can<00:03:44.910> just<00:03:44.940> cut<00:03:45.330> these<00:03:45.480> two<00:03:45.720> off<00:03:45.930> take<00:03:46.920> your

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
you can just cut these two off take your

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.699 
you can just cut these two off take your
speaker<00:03:47.400> wire<00:03:47.610> which<00:03:48.450> would<00:03:48.600> be<00:03:48.720> here<00:03:49.050> of

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
speaker wire which would be here of

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:50.900 
speaker wire which would be here of
course<00:03:50.010> on<00:03:50.160> this<00:03:50.280> you're<00:03:50.430> gonna<00:03:50.550> know<00:03:50.760> which

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
course on this you're gonna know which

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.310 
course on this you're gonna know which
is<00:03:51.030> positive<00:03:51.390> which<00:03:51.480> is<00:03:51.510> negative<00:03:51.930> so<00:03:52.080> in<00:03:52.200> my

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
is positive which is negative so in my

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.770 
is positive which is negative so in my
case<00:03:52.380> my<00:03:52.860> red<00:03:53.100> would<00:03:53.580> go<00:03:53.700> to<00:03:53.760> my<00:03:53.970> striped<00:03:54.450> wire

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
case my red would go to my striped wire

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.350 
case my red would go to my striped wire
my<00:03:55.709> solid<00:03:56.100> black<00:03:56.310> will<00:03:56.640> go<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:56.820> my<00:03:56.940> black<00:03:57.150> and

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
my solid black will go to my black and

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.720 
my solid black will go to my black and
then<00:03:57.750> I<00:03:57.810> have<00:03:58.020> a<00:03:58.140> perfect<00:03:58.459> perfect<00:03:59.459> connection

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
then I have a perfect perfect connection

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.210 
then I have a perfect perfect connection
no<00:04:00.090> problem<00:04:00.480> at<00:04:00.570> all<00:04:00.600> and<00:04:00.959> again<00:04:01.739> once<00:04:02.100> you

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
no problem at all and again once you

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.370 
no problem at all and again once you
disconnect<00:04:02.670> that<00:04:03.030> you<00:04:03.390> could<00:04:03.540> take<00:04:03.720> that<00:04:03.750> you

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
disconnect that you could take that you

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.590 
disconnect that you could take that you
could<00:04:04.530> put<00:04:04.650> into<00:04:04.860> an<00:04:04.950> adapter<00:04:05.489> you<00:04:06.000> can<00:04:06.150> put

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
could put into an adapter you can put

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.290 
could put into an adapter you can put
pigtails<00:04:07.140> RCA's<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:08.580> sky's<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:08.820> limit<00:04:09.000> I
