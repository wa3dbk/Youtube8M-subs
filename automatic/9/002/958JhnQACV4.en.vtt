00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
trip out the trip starts by going

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.979 
trip out the trip starts by going
counterclockwise<00:00:44.460> because<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.480> tournament

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
counterclockwise because the tournament

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.959 
counterclockwise because the tournament
went<00:00:46.110> clockwise<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:47.460> first<00:00:47.700> thing<00:00:47.879> that

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
went clockwise the first thing that

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.170 
went clockwise the first thing that
happens<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.570> as<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.079> pushes<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.590> arm<00:00:49.770> back

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
happens is it as it pushes the arm back

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.939 
happens is it as it pushes the arm back
okay

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
okay

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.470 
okay
pushes<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.070> other<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.309> fact<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:53.969> resets

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
pushes the other in fact that it resets

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.880 
pushes the other in fact that it resets
the<00:00:54.660> flag<00:00:55.730> then<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:57.180> drops<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.379> record<00:01:00.890> there's

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
the flag then it drops a record there's

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.860 
the flag then it drops a record there's
nothing<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.460> hit<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.760> flag<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.390> now<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.629> arm

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
nothing to hit the flag so now the arm

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.679 
nothing to hit the flag so now the arm
is<00:01:04.080> being<00:01:04.320> indexed<00:01:04.799> back<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.909> 7-inch

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
is being indexed back to the 7-inch

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.780 
is being indexed back to the 7-inch
position<00:01:07.909> and<00:01:08.909> then<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:10.010> sets<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.189> arm<00:01:11.430> down

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
position and then it sets the arm down

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.969 
position and then it sets the arm down
there<00:01:12.299> right<00:01:12.720> here<00:01:12.900> there's<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.320> set<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.740> arm

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
there right here there's the set the arm

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.940 
there right here there's the set the arm
down<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.689> then<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:16.020> last<00:01:16.170> thing<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.590> comes

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
down and then the last thing it comes

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.090 
down and then the last thing it comes
back<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.939> play<00:01:18.930> position<00:01:19.500> right<00:01:20.070> there

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
back to the play position right there

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.550 
back to the play position right there
where<00:01:20.729> there's<00:01:20.880> nothing<00:01:21.270> engaging<00:01:22.229> the

where there's nothing engaging the
turntable<00:01:23.189> bottom<00:01:23.670> gear<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.360> will<00:01:24.570> stay

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
turntable bottom gear so it will stay

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.649 
turntable bottom gear so it will stay
here<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.320> play<00:01:25.640> this<00:01:26.640> little<00:01:26.909> lever<00:01:27.210> here

to<00:02:15.670> get<00:02:15.790> to<00:02:15.969> this<00:02:16.569> is<00:02:16.749> a<00:02:16.780> common<00:02:17.170> cause<00:02:17.319> of

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
to get to this is a common cause of

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.319 
to get to this is a common cause of
problems<00:02:17.859> right<00:02:18.040> here<00:02:18.219> the<00:02:18.400> trip<00:02:18.639> out<00:02:18.819> this

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:19.329 
problems right here the trip out this

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:21.449 
problems right here the trip out this
has<00:02:19.540> to<00:02:19.659> be<00:02:19.780> very<00:02:20.019> free<00:02:20.469> to<00:02:20.590> move<00:02:20.739> oftentimes

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
has to be very free to move oftentimes

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.640 
has to be very free to move oftentimes
it<00:02:21.670> sticks<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:22.329> that<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:22.930> won't<00:02:23.049> reject<00:02:23.319> when

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
it sticks and that it won't reject when

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.440 
it sticks and that it won't reject when
it<00:02:23.769> gets<00:02:23.920> to<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.099> end<00:02:24.129> of<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.340> record<00:02:24.519> the

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
it gets to the end of the record the

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.929 
it gets to the end of the record the
other<00:02:25.599> thing<00:02:25.840> is<00:02:25.989> this<00:02:26.400> bearing<00:02:27.400> surface<00:02:27.760> here

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:27.939 
other thing is this bearing surface here

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.819 
other thing is this bearing surface here
can<00:02:28.120> freeze<00:02:28.450> because<00:02:29.049> of<00:02:29.139> the<00:02:29.230> oil<00:02:29.409> they<00:02:29.650> use

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
can freeze because of the oil they use

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.459 
can freeze because of the oil they use
is<00:02:30.069> very<00:02:30.239> it<00:02:31.239> tends<00:02:31.689> to<00:02:31.840> turn<00:02:32.019> to<00:02:32.139> superglue

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:32.469 
is very it tends to turn to superglue

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:35.819 
is very it tends to turn to superglue
and<00:02:33.250> this<00:02:33.430> can<00:02:33.639> freeze<00:02:33.909> here<00:02:34.469> what<00:02:35.469> you<00:02:35.590> can<00:02:35.739> do

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
and this can freeze here what you can do

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:37.890 
and this can freeze here what you can do
is<00:02:35.980> you<00:02:36.069> can<00:02:36.189> take<00:02:36.370> this<00:02:36.639> earring<00:02:37.389> off<00:02:37.599> and

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
is you can take this earring off and

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.349 
is you can take this earring off and
then<00:02:38.409> with<00:02:38.560> a<00:02:38.709> disposable<00:02:39.700> cigarette<00:02:40.150> lighter

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:40.359 
then with a disposable cigarette lighter

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:42.000 
then with a disposable cigarette lighter
you<00:02:40.540> could<00:02:40.689> heat<00:02:40.959> this<00:02:41.260> until<00:02:41.769> the<00:02:41.980> oil

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
you could heat this until the oil

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.309 
you could heat this until the oil
becomes<00:02:42.790> fluid<00:02:43.150> again<00:02:43.510> you<00:02:43.659> can<00:02:43.810> pull<00:02:44.019> it<00:02:44.139> off

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
becomes fluid again you can pull it off

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.520 
becomes fluid again you can pull it off
and<00:02:44.549> ask<00:02:45.549> you<00:02:45.639> to<00:02:45.730> take<00:02:45.879> the<00:02:46.030> trip<00:02:46.629> bar<00:02:46.870> off<00:02:47.049> you

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
and ask you to take the trip bar off you

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.439 
and ask you to take the trip bar off you
can<00:02:47.680> take<00:02:47.829> this<00:02:47.949> off<00:02:48.159> and<00:02:48.219> relocate<00:02:49.030> it<00:02:49.060> clean

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:49.449 
can take this off and relocate it clean

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:50.849 
can take this off and relocate it clean
it<00:02:49.569> relocate<00:02:50.019> it<00:02:50.109> and<00:02:50.230> put<00:02:50.319> it<00:02:50.409> back<00:02:50.500> on<00:02:50.709> again

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859 
it relocate it and put it back on again

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:52.649 
it relocate it and put it back on again
but<00:02:51.760> anyway<00:02:52.030> that's<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.269> only<00:02:52.480> two<00:02:52.629> things

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:52.659 
but anyway that's the only two things

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:54.030 
but anyway that's the only two things
that<00:02:52.989> really<00:02:53.019> happened<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.560> these<00:02:53.680> things<00:02:53.829> is

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
that really happened to these things is

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.159 
that really happened to these things is
they<00:02:54.159> get<00:02:54.280> sticky<00:02:54.579> from<00:02:54.849> age<00:02:55.030> and<00:02:55.719> that's<00:02:55.989> it

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:56.169 
they get sticky from age and that's it

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:58.439 
they get sticky from age and that's it
for<00:02:56.349> now
