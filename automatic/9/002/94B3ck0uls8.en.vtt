a lake it's got a keel to keep it on
direction<00:00:54.449> on<00:00:54.600> plane<00:00:55.100> but<00:00:56.100> here<00:00:56.369> that<00:00:56.400> would

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
direction on plane but here that would

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.140 
direction on plane but here that would
hurt<00:00:56.790> you

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
hurt you

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.729 
hurt you

the McKenzie River is called the rub

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.220 
the McKenzie River is called the rub
rail<00:02:17.400> in<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.300> early<00:02:18.540> days<00:02:18.720> most<00:02:19.020> of<00:02:19.170> the

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
rail in the early days most of the

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.809 
rail in the early days most of the
trailers<00:02:19.650> were<00:02:19.680> made<00:02:20.040> with<00:02:20.190> either<00:02:20.400> model

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
trailers were made with either model

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.440 
trailers were made with either model
T<00:02:20.969> or<00:02:21.269> Model<00:02:21.749> A<00:02:22.819> axles<00:02:23.819> because<00:02:24.150> there<00:02:24.299> was<00:02:24.420> a

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
T or Model A axles because there was a

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.929 
T or Model A axles because there was a
lot<00:02:24.689> of<00:02:24.719> them<00:02:24.989> laying<00:02:25.139> around<00:02:25.319> and<00:02:26.040> that<00:02:26.639> wheel

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:26.939 
lot of them laying around and that wheel

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:31.069 
lot of them laying around and that wheel
had<00:02:27.719> no<00:02:28.639> fender<00:02:29.639> and<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:30.510> can<00:02:30.629> see<00:02:30.810> that<00:02:30.989> the

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
had no fender and you can see that the

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:32.839 
had no fender and you can see that the
wheel<00:02:31.260> that<00:02:31.439> has<00:02:31.499> no<00:02:31.769> offender<00:02:32.189> happens<00:02:32.790> to

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
wheel that has no offender happens to

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.160 
wheel that has no offender happens to
hit<00:02:32.939> the<00:02:33.060> boat<00:02:33.239> right<00:02:33.450> where<00:02:33.629> the<00:02:33.749> rubber<00:02:33.959> rail

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
hit the boat right where the rubber rail

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.759 
hit the boat right where the rubber rail
is<00:02:34.379> so<00:02:35.370> this<00:02:35.879> rub<00:02:36.120> rail<00:02:36.329> was<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.599> prevent<00:02:37.049> this

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
is so this rub rail was to prevent this

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.160 
is so this rub rail was to prevent this
boat<00:02:38.129> from<00:02:38.459> running<00:02:38.879> over<00:02:39.090> up<00:02:39.510> against<00:02:39.930> one<00:02:40.079> of

the<00:02:40.230> wheels<00:02:40.409> and<00:02:40.709> rubbing<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.099> hole<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.400> boat

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
the wheels and rubbing a hole the boat

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:42.649 
the wheels and rubbing a hole the boat
on<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.790> way<00:02:41.939> of<00:02:42.060> where<00:02:42.209> you<00:02:42.359> were<00:02:42.420> going

was kind of a natural thing to do

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.449 
was kind of a natural thing to do
evolved<00:03:33.030> into<00:03:33.509> being<00:03:34.259> a<00:03:34.500> guide<00:03:34.769> an<00:03:35.069> outfitter

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
evolved into being a guide an outfitter

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.409 
evolved into being a guide an outfitter
here<00:03:35.699> so<00:03:35.970> I<00:03:37.129> do<00:03:38.129> know<00:03:38.430> that<00:03:38.699> everybody<00:03:39.060> who

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:39.419 
here so I do know that everybody who

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.899 
here so I do know that everybody who
built<00:03:40.049> a<00:03:40.199> boat<00:03:40.349> made<00:03:41.250> their<00:03:41.430> own<00:03:41.549> little

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:41.909 
built a boat made their own little

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:44.089 
built a boat made their own little
changes<00:03:42.479> over<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:42.930> years<00:03:43.199> you<00:03:43.769> know<00:03:43.859> so<00:03:44.040> you

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
changes over the years you know so you

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.530 
changes over the years you know so you
change<00:03:44.370> a<00:03:44.489> few<00:03:44.639> things<00:03:44.849> and<00:03:45.030> then<00:03:45.150> it's<00:03:45.419> a

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
change a few things and then it's a

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.339 
change a few things and then it's a
different<00:03:45.659> design<00:03:46.169> but<00:03:47.099> the<00:03:47.310> basic<00:03:47.699> boat<00:03:47.939> is

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
different design but the basic boat is

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.390 
different design but the basic boat is
something<00:03:49.349> that's<00:03:49.500> just<00:03:49.620> evolved<00:03:50.129> on<00:03:50.250> the

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
something that's just evolved on the

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.780 
something that's just evolved on the
river<00:03:50.579> as<00:03:50.909> people<00:03:51.269> have<00:03:51.449> fished<00:03:52.229> and<00:03:52.530> and<00:03:53.009> run

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
river as people have fished and and run

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.199 
river as people have fished and and run
rapids<00:03:54.269> and<00:03:54.479> everything<00:03:55.549> the<00:03:56.549> nice<00:03:56.970> thing

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
motor it's quiet and to learn how to

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.390 
motor it's quiet and to learn how to
navigate<00:04:03.479> a<00:04:04.049> drift<00:04:04.290> boat<00:04:04.439> on<00:04:04.650> the<00:04:04.769> river<00:04:04.979> is

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
navigate a drift boat on the river is

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.580 
navigate a drift boat on the river is
really<00:04:06.209> learning<00:04:06.569> how<00:04:06.719> to<00:04:06.840> go<00:04:07.079> with<00:04:07.229> the<00:04:07.349> flow

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
really learning how to go with the flow

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.649 
really learning how to go with the flow
and<00:04:07.859> what<00:04:08.609> I<00:04:08.639> have<00:04:08.969> learned<00:04:09.209> over<00:04:09.389> the<00:04:09.629> years

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:09.659 
and what I have learned over the years

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:12.050 
and what I have learned over the years
is<00:04:10.169> that<00:04:10.439> there<00:04:10.739> are<00:04:10.829> some<00:04:10.949> very<00:04:11.250> striking

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
is that there are some very striking

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.059 
is that there are some very striking
parallels<00:04:12.689> between<00:04:12.930> running<00:04:13.560> a<00:04:13.650> river<00:04:13.829> and

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
parallels between running a river and

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.449 
parallels between running a river and
running<00:04:14.879> this<00:04:15.030> thing<00:04:15.239> we<00:04:15.419> call<00:04:15.629> life<00:04:16.459> you

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
running this thing we call life you

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.839 
running this thing we call life you
can't<00:04:18.150> stop<00:04:18.449> time<00:04:18.989> and<00:04:19.320> so<00:04:19.949> the<00:04:20.250> challenge<00:04:20.669> is

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
can't stop time and so the challenge is

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:24.680 
can't stop time and so the challenge is
how<00:04:21.150> how<00:04:21.780> do<00:04:21.840> you<00:04:22.049> negotiate<00:04:23.479> where<00:04:24.479> it<00:04:24.570> is

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
how how do you negotiate where it is

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.860 
how how do you negotiate where it is
you're<00:04:24.870> going

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
you're going

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.379 
you're going
in<00:04:26.200> a<00:04:26.350> most<00:04:26.530> successful<00:04:26.710> way<00:04:27.250> and<00:04:27.580> it's<00:04:28.240> kind

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
in a most successful way and it's kind

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.170 
in a most successful way and it's kind
of<00:04:28.420> like<00:04:28.480> running<00:04:28.750> on<00:04:28.810> a<00:04:28.900> river<00:04:29.880> you<00:04:30.880> get<00:04:31.030> on

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
of like running on a river you get on

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.879 
of like running on a river you get on
the<00:04:31.330> river<00:04:31.480> there<00:04:32.139> in<00:04:32.290> anything<00:04:32.620> you're<00:04:32.770> gonna
