 does not use any chemical 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.650
 Additives contain milligram exactly 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.350
 we mix their shade together 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:38.310
 The pigments are then mixed with the base 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:41.580
 life color still mellowed well and as 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.220
 Total powder in your home

 unlimited shelf life they can now 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.430
 Immediately, the liver starts at home 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.770
 to process to mix the colors 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.560
 Can you order the whole lot or too 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.979
 use subsets 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:07.050
 Mix the color in ratio 1 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:09.989
 1 5 with water that is to 150 grams 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:13.050
 Water give 100 grams of finished 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.720
 note mixed powdered powder 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.090
 in the vessel by mixing the color 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.850
 want to have enough space around it 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.950
 stir well later and the other 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.830
 that they start the water in 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.510
 to do the vessel and then first 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.209
 to add the powder 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.910
 otherwise there is a danger that 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.030
 lumps form because the color in the 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.410
 Hanging the vessel is stuck 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.980
 they can now with a driver 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.019
 mix commercially available quill 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.500
 after you thoroughly confused the color 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:49.470
 the whole thing still has about 30 to 60 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.120
 minutes so that the pigments 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.190
 connect well with the water 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.190
 After that, the color will be repeated 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.380
 Do not be scared vigorously by being stirred 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.980
 in the wet state is the color 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.510
 darker than later after processing 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.400
 we have three for our example 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.060
 different shades for you 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.000
 prepared we are now on a wall to 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.890
 high-quality color worlds want to work 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.930
 facilitate the work and contribute 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.360
 a successful strike result 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.230
 First we glue the ones to paint the 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.010
 surface here green with a high quality 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.620
 adhesive tape 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.989
 and protect the ground and stand 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.200
 the furniture through foils before 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:34.349
 paint splatter press the tape 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.629
 Good on the whole length and stripes 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:39.599
 then again over a large area 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:41.430
 Now a little trick with it 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:44.459
 Do not put new color under the tape 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.440
 running take something of the color 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.470
 in this case, left of the surface 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.170
 located and paint with the edges 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.980
 between adhesive tape and to shape the 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.500
 area one 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.230
 is this film painting then dried 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.650
 we can handle that 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.900
 the mixed vw start the best 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.109
 Tease the color again vigorously 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.060
 before rolling with a suitable roller 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:11.909
 bring the color to the wall 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.340
 because the color is mineral 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:16.979
 the color is very important 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.699
 translucent and stained as long as they are 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.889
 is wet 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:22.919
 Do not be fooled by it and 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:25.470
 wear the color thinly and evenly 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:28.130
 to work with one now 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.720
 natural material absorb base 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.380
 smells like we make of other colors 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:37.070
 you will not find out here 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:40.560
 you can even see the color rests on yours 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:43.130
 Dispose of compost pile as far as the 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.720
 other surfaces are already taped 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.300
 can you there with the other vw 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.699
 go on creamy 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.349
 using is not just earthy tones 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:55.440
 to be able to process 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:58.889
 the range of available 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:01.199
 colors range from light pastel colors to 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:05.190
 towards strong colors like red and yellow 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:08.250
 blue of your creativity are virtually nonexistent 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:11.039
 set limits if you are looking for a 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.500

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:23.099
 Dried , they carry the second 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.990
 painting on it as you notice is that 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:28.710
 Process life have no 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.930

 colors but we process these 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:44.300
 even after applying the colors 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:47.090
 you should use the second color layer 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.270
 Adhesive tape in still wet condition 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.009
 peel paint off the wall 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.560
 the still spotty are the color 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:57.680
 disappears as already mentioned
