00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.920
 first fruits of a new development concept 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.059
 samsung smartphones should be galaxy 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.550
 s6 edge 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.050
 According to the head of samsung j kashin 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.090
 the new flagship company has developed 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.890
 almost from scratch let's try 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.990
 figure out what the smartphone is big 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.119
 design or technology and whether 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.669
 samsung reinvent smartphone 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.860
 galaxy s6 edge looks much better 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.329
 last yearâ€™s flagship nor does he 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.790
 out of the design concept 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.890
 ruler galaxy company either failed 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.110
 completely escape from succession either 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.000
 she deliberately wanted it that as it 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.010
 never looks like s6 edge really 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.230
 well even opponents of samsung design 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.510
 will find him at least pretty 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.399
 main body material in galaxy s6 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.679
 edge is glass corning gorilla 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.780
 glass 4 which covers the display and 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:55.339
 back of the body and into the main 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.289
 feature is more compared to 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:58.999
 gorilla glass 3 strength what in theory 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.800
 allows him to survive a fall without 

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:02.719
 effects additional gain 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.460
 metal construction also gives 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.560
 a frame that frames the body and a bit 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.900
 juts out on his sides to protect 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.330
 display bends build quality in galaxy 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.670
 s6 edge is high all 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.920
 parts fit very tight in contrast 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.229
 from galaxy s5 you got me s6 case cover 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.630
 edge cannot be removed by itself quickly 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.369
 replace batteries no galaxy s6 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.320
 edge of good lies in the hand though 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.869
 initially until the hull is sharp 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.549
 here is not quickly get used to if you get used 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.950
 I do not want you can pick up a case for yourself 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.380
 good shell thickness contributes to this 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.180
 in galaxy s6 edge samsung and 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.469
 used super amoled screen with 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.969
 such a resolution of 2560 by 1440 pixels on 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:42.740
 to paper it may seem redundant 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:45.430
 but this does not negate the fact that 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.990
 the s6 edge screen looks amazing 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.500
 diagonal 5 1 inch with resolution 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.850
 2560 by 1440 points allows display 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.850
 create a picture with density 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.560
 577 pixels per inch thanks to this 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.420
 it seems that you are looking not at the screen but at 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.259
 paper page with very high quality 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.759
 printing 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.130
 this contributes to the fact 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.990
 that there is no air gap display 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.789
 the image on it seems to lie on 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.369
 surfaces this effect is also 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.050
 amplified due to the curved screen in 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.880
 the antutu smartphone test is gaining more 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.170
 sixty nine thousand points what on 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.480
 the moment is the best 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.420
 the result is where such power comes from 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.020
 and the thing is 64 bit 14 nano meter 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.900
 exynos 70 processor 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.040
 320 running at 1 and 5 gigahertz 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.400
 and 2 and 1 gigahertz 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.230
 and updated graphics mali t720 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.180
 worth adding available 3 gigabytes 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.870
 RAM and storage is arranged 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.270
 data 32 64 and 128 gigabytes without 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.950
 side effect expansion 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.600
 high performance smartphones 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.910
 very often heat is noticeable 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.350
 corps this could be expected from 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.240
 galaxy s6 edge 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.800
 however with a high load in 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.990
 mostly during the game we failed 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.040
 unstitch the device above 39 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.750
 degrees Celsius 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.700
 at this temperature the body of the smartphone 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.010
 it gets warm enough yes 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.630
 hot at the same time it is far from any 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.370
 samsung and other top-end smartphones 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.590
 next to the camera unit is a window 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.050
 heart rate sensor compared to 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.460
 5 the algorithm for working with it has not changed for 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.230
 measuring your pulse calm 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.300
 able to attach a finger and to the sensor 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.830
 pulse is measured through the application s 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.570
 health which also keeps everything 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.310
 collected about user activity 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.200
 previous generation information 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.390
 flagship smartphone company samsung 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.010
 used a fingerprint scanner 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.740
 built into the central mechanical 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.600
 key in galaxy s6 edge scanner also 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.160
 not gone anywhere and is on the same 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.900
 place but now in order to 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.270
 unlock it using a smartphone 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.500
 only one touch as 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.420
 expected smartphone works under 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.970
 operating system android 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.140
 version 5 0 2 with updated corporate 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.880
 touchwiz interface 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.140
 the latter began to look nicer 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.790
 got rid of most of the extra 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.500
 elements of the interface logic while 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.310
 little change in user 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.440
 can create unlimited 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.180
 number of desktops and take out on 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.890
 these are application shortcuts from the menu or 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.660
 recently launched menu widgets 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.910
 applications now looks exactly the same 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.500
 like the interface android 50 card 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.730
 applications displayed carousel when 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.709
 this they can be closed each by 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.930
 separately or all at once with one button 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.880
 the previous multitasking mode 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.650
 version of the drag from was option now active 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.360
 by default it can be used 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.370
 post next was an application either 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.620
 reduce the program to a miniature window 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.930
 curved display roll inward also 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.120
 involved in the galaxy s6 edge interface 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.160
 it is used to display the date time 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.290
 weather and alert on the right side when 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.550
 off the main activation screen 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.070
 This function passes if hold 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.450
 finger on the right bend of the display is the same 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.800
 the face may occupy the panel label 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.690
 quick contacts that literally 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.110
 pulled out to the main screen with the right 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.270
 edges 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.260
 There can be 5 such contacts in total. 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.300
 each one has its own color 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.010
 overall interface touchwiz galaxy s6 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.960
 edge is better than previous models 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.400
 samsung and this is not the last role 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.640
 playing using the operating room 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.710
 android 50 systems in galaxy s6 edge 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.390
 used main 16 megapixel 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.000
 camera with optical stabilization and 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.770
 apertures reaching f 1 and 9 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.240
 the last parameter allows you to skip 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.830
 more light that is positive 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.990
 affects the quality of images 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:02.040
 they have galaxy s6 edge is obtained 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.040
 really good 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.980
 One is worth noting that it runs 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.330
 smartphone camera almost instantly 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.370
 at the same time on double pressing central 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.560
 mechanical key is now assigned 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.670
 it is her start the front camera in 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.500
 galaxy s6 edge 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.050
 these megapixel and with the same 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.090
 aperture value 1 and 9 capacity 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.250
 galaxy s6 edge battery is 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.380
 2600 milliampere hour which is not very much 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.970
 by modern standards nevertheless in 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.860
 20 minute use mode 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.020
 calls day work with skype mail 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.910
 browser reading book listening 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.650
 music as well as s6 edge games 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.630
 shows similar to the 5 level 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.850
 autonomy average smartphone can 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.710
 work for about 19 hours with three 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.450
 hours of use of the screen is quite 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.930
 good rate given capacity 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.640
 batteries 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.320
 but if you activate the saving mode 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.630
 energy autonomy may increase 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.790
 down to several days in galaxy s6 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.410
 edge supported fast charging when 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.720
 10 percent charge to 20 percent 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:02.550
 smartphone is charging 10 minutes that 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.640
 allows him to work about another 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.930
 4:00 support wireless charging in s6 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.580
 edge is also present 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.500
 wireless smartphone charging module 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.080
 will charge longer but use 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.060
 it's more convenient with the release of galaxy s6 edge 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.100
 Samsung really succeeded 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.930
 raise the bar for smartphone quality 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.700
 when creating a new flagship was 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.310
 done serious work is good 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.120
 It felt by the attention to detail can not be 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.890
 say that it can be called 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.110
 rethinking the concept of creation 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.970
 smartphone from scratch but here's a serious 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.670
 improvement of each characteristic is quite 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.980
 possible with galaxy s6 edge company 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:37.770
 samsung has not re-invented the smartphone is 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.940
 just noticeably improved it thanks that 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:43.280
