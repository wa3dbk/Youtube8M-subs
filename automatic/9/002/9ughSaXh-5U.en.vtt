00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.150 
today I have the brand new Godzilla pack
of<00:00:23.150> destruction<00:00:24.289> so<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.320> found<00:00:25.619> this<00:00:25.710> at<00:00:25.890> Target

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
of destruction so I found this at Target

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.849 
of destruction so I found this at Target
for<00:00:26.609> $8.99<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.750> looks<00:00:27.930> very<00:00:28.170> cool<00:00:28.560> so<00:00:28.800> I

think<00:00:28.949> that's<00:00:29.250> probably<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.730> good<00:00:29.970> deal<00:00:30.269> this

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
think that's probably a good deal this

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.830 
think that's probably a good deal this
is<00:00:31.260> based<00:00:31.769> on<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.340> new<00:00:32.489> movie<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.540> coming

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
smaller sized version and the figures

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.490

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
I've reviewed before it has a little

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.920 
I've reviewed before it has a little
plane<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.850> has<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.300> little<00:00:45.510> building<00:00:45.719> here

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
plane and it has a little building here

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.619 
plane and it has a little building here
and<00:00:46.289> now<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.530> thing<00:00:46.980> about<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:47.789> you

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
and now the thing about this is that you

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.180 
and now the thing about this is that you
can<00:00:48.750> put<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.989> building<00:00:49.289> up<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.649> he'll<00:00:49.800> smash

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
can put the building up and he'll smash

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.760 
can put the building up and he'll smash
it<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:51.570> looks<00:00:51.840> pretty<00:00:52.110> cool<00:00:52.289> on<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.559> back

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
it so it looks pretty cool on the back

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.029 
it so it looks pretty cool on the back
it<00:00:53.010> says<00:00:53.190> collect<00:00:53.550> them<00:00:53.789> all<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.980> there's<00:00:55.980> a
