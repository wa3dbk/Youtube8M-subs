00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
these are these can be kind of testing I

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.330 
these are these can be kind of testing I
can<00:01:13.200> only<00:01:13.320> imagine<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.710> I'm<00:01:13.860> doing<00:01:13.950> bronze

they only unless you do bronze
challenges<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:15.990> think<00:01:16.020> whenever<00:01:17.010> you're<00:01:17.310> about

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
challenges I think whenever you're about

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.540 
challenges I think whenever you're about
to<00:01:17.610> play<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.820> game<00:01:18.120> but<00:01:19.080> uh<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.710> got<00:01:20.040> lucky<00:01:20.220> here

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
to play a game but uh I got lucky here

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.800 
to play a game but uh I got lucky here
and<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.760> happen<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.060> hit<00:01:21.180> those<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.510> guess<00:01:21.660> this

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
and I happen to hit those I guess this

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.660 
and I happen to hit those I guess this
is<00:01:21.960> like<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.320> work<00:01:22.500> on<00:01:22.680> your<00:01:22.770> crossing<00:01:23.340> skills

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670

which everybody's gonna complain about

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.840 
which everybody's gonna complain about
anyway<00:01:25.800> so<00:01:25.860> probably<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.340> quote<00:01:26.550> should<00:01:26.700> give

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
anyway so probably the quote should give

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.880 
anyway so probably the quote should give
you<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.210> skill<00:01:27.870> game<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.290> work<00:01:28.440> on<00:01:28.560> your<00:01:28.680> cross

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
on somehow it worked out like I always

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.710 
on somehow it worked out like I always
used<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.940> think<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.209> like<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.569> would<00:02:12.690> just

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
used to think that like I would just

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.470 
used to think that like I would just
look<00:02:13.680> at<00:02:13.799> that<00:02:13.950> char<00:02:14.189> there

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
look at that char there

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.880 
look at that char there
by<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.599> way<00:02:14.750> I'm<00:02:14.840> in<00:02:14.900> a<00:02:14.959> sick<00:02:15.440> char<00:02:15.709> there<00:02:15.860> I

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
by the way I'm in a sick char there I

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.710 
by the way I'm in a sick char there I
never<00:02:16.250> make<00:02:16.459> those<00:02:16.610> in<00:02:16.760> FIFA<00:02:17.000> 12<00:02:17.180> but<00:02:17.420> I<00:02:17.450> used

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
never make those in FIFA 12 but I used

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.410 
never make those in FIFA 12 but I used
to<00:02:17.810> think<00:02:18.050> that<00:02:18.110> like<00:02:18.970> you<00:02:19.970> know<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.209> ball

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
to think that like you know the ball

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.490 
to think that like you know the ball
would<00:02:20.540> just<00:02:20.720> never<00:02:20.840> pass<00:02:21.080> it<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.379> right

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
would just never pass it to the right

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.899 
would just never pass it to the right
guy<00:02:21.620> in<00:02:21.709> this<00:02:21.799> game<00:02:21.980> it<00:02:22.099> always<00:02:22.310> passes<00:02:22.580> it<00:02:22.879> to

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:22.909 
guy in this game it always passes it to

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.910 
guy in this game it always passes it to
the<00:02:23.060> right<00:02:23.239> guy<00:02:23.420> not<00:02:24.049> to<00:02:24.230> mention<00:02:24.409> that

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
the right guy not to mention that

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.500

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.369

because almost all my goals were just

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:01.809

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
that except for right there I kind of

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.369 
that except for right there I kind of
got<00:03:01.940> a<00:03:01.970> little<00:03:02.120> kind<00:03:02.810> of<00:03:02.870> did<00:03:02.989> a<00:03:03.019> little<00:03:03.079> bit<00:03:03.349> of

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 
got a little kind of did a little bit of

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:06.009 
got a little kind of did a little bit of
skill<00:03:03.769> moves<00:03:04.040> in<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:05.180> box<00:03:05.390> there<00:03:05.599> but<00:03:05.810> most

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
skill moves in the box there but most

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.559 
skill moves in the box there but most
the<00:03:06.109> time<00:03:06.230> to<00:03:06.890> be<00:03:06.980> honest<00:03:07.340> it<00:03:07.549> really<00:03:07.609> helps<00:03:08.359> me

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
the time to be honest it really helps me

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.479 
the time to be honest it really helps me
that<00:03:09.170> they<00:03:09.500> messed<00:03:09.739> up<00:03:09.859> on<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.069> first<00:03:10.250> touch

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
that they messed up on the first touch

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.390 
that they messed up on the first touch
because<00:03:10.849> what<00:03:11.060> would<00:03:11.180> happen<00:03:11.209> is<00:03:11.920> he<00:03:12.920> would<00:03:13.099> be

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
because what would happen is he would be

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.220 
because what would happen is he would be
running<00:03:13.640> I'd<00:03:14.120> be<00:03:14.299> sprinting<00:03:14.569> cuz<00:03:14.900> I'd<00:03:14.959> hold<00:03:15.140> a

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
running I'd be sprinting cuz I'd hold a

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.890 
running I'd be sprinting cuz I'd hold a
sprint<00:03:15.470> button<00:03:15.650> like<00:03:16.549> always<00:03:16.879> you<00:03:17.060> and<00:03:17.090> he

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
sprint button like always you and he

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.629 
sprint button like always you and he
would<00:03:18.019> mess<00:03:18.230> up<00:03:18.349> the<00:03:18.470> touch<00:03:18.650> and<00:03:19.010> they<00:03:19.519> would

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:19.639 
would mess up the touch and they would

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:20.830 
would mess up the touch and they would
just<00:03:19.760> shoot<00:03:20.000> it<00:03:20.180> right<00:03:20.359> in<00:03:20.510> front<00:03:20.690> of<00:03:20.750> the

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
just shoot it right in front of the

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.150 
just shoot it right in front of the
defender<00:03:21.109> like<00:03:21.319> it<00:03:21.530> would<00:03:21.650> literally<00:03:21.889> he'd

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
defender like it would literally he'd

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.470 
defender like it would literally he'd
kick<00:03:22.310> it<00:03:22.430> so<00:03:22.549> farther<00:03:22.790> from<00:03:22.880> the<00:03:23.030> defender<00:03:23.389> and

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
kick it so farther from the defender and

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.930 
kick it so farther from the defender and
it<00:03:23.599> was<00:03:23.690> usually<00:03:23.989> more<00:03:24.260> of<00:03:24.319> a<00:03:24.440> Pacey<00:03:24.680> guy<00:03:24.980> so<00:03:25.609> it

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
it was usually more of a Pacey guy so it

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.460 
it was usually more of a Pacey guy so it
made<00:03:26.120> it<00:03:26.239> easy<00:03:26.359> for<00:03:26.480> me<00:03:26.690> to<00:03:26.720> just<00:03:26.930> get<00:03:27.049> past<00:03:27.200> him
