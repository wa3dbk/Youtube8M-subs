 it's also very good 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.560
 I already read the internet cigarette 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.230
 that car people are complaining that 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.180
 This car is a drunk car but a lot 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.640
 on the contrary there is this car at the beginning 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.540
 His consumption scared me a bit. 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.250
 was in the range of 8 and 6 km per liter 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.840
 that counted 200 300 kilometers 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.049
 but today this car on the highway 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.610
 stocked with 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:31.710
 alcohol it does in the range of 13 km per 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:34.289
 liter reaching peaks of 14 km of beautiful 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.789
 so the good economy car in a car 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:38.879
 has 1,400 kilograms 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:40.560
 It is a very economical car the car has to 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:42.960
 suspension also very good 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.539
 Of course the jetta is a bit more 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.539
 easy that he is 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:50.580
 but of course there is no way to make miracle the 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:52.650
 car with rim 17 and low profile tires 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.300
 jetta gets to be a little softer 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.159
 soft that crosses 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.639
 but the cost is also not a tough guy and 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:01.500
 has excellent stability is a 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:04.919
 excellent skill also has door 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:09.750
 electric suitcase or trigger here for you 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:11.460
 His athletic Jetta's trunk port is 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.030
 bigger but his trunk is not 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.030
 small 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.909
 and here it is interesting to have a place here 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.710
 in this place here is if some bandit 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:24.379
 holding the guy inside the trunk 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.340
 pulls on this emergency lever and 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:30.090
 trunk adapts 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:33.599
 she can escape then it's two 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:36.960
 cars and excellent is both jetta is the 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:38.460

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.789
 It's my car. 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:45.150
 two cars and very tasty economical 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:47.849
 driving do not drink much has a good engine 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:51.199
 it fully satisfies the car's proposal 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:55.729
 of cars and any doubt the galera 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:55.729

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:04.259
 as well as object it also has local 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:06.719
 to put the drinks in leather, too. 

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:09.210
 So these are two exceptional cars. 

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:11.669
 are two exceptional cars 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.870
 who wants to buy any of these 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:17.029

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:50.790
 I'll put this video on youtube and that's it. 

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:53.730
