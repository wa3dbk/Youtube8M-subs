frog EG set up a very quick a talent

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.780 
frog EG set up a very quick a talent
build<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.799> doing<00:00:14.099> this<00:00:14.219> because<00:00:14.429> there's<00:00:14.730> a

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
build and doing this because there's a

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.400 
build and doing this because there's a
lot<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.089> people<00:00:15.360> that<00:00:15.660> don't<00:00:15.990> really<00:00:16.230> know<00:00:16.379> how

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
lot of people that don't really know how

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.140 
lot of people that don't really know how
to<00:00:16.529> use<00:00:16.650> frog<00:00:16.980> EG<00:00:17.310> in<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.550> ones<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:18.000> actually

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
to use frog EG in the ones that actually

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.450 
to use frog EG in the ones that actually
do<00:00:18.600> they<00:00:19.439> don't<00:00:19.619> use<00:00:19.800> them<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.130> its<00:00:20.250> full

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
do they don't use them to its full

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.790 
do they don't use them to its full
potential<00:00:20.970> because<00:00:21.330> mainly<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:22.380> skills<00:00:22.710> that

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
potential because mainly the skills that

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.750 
potential because mainly the skills that
they<00:00:22.980> have<00:00:23.869> are<00:00:24.869> usually<00:00:25.500> wrong<00:00:25.769> so<00:00:26.490> there's

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
they have are usually wrong so there's

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.439 
they have are usually wrong so there's

your dashing range now of course you

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.700 
your dashing range now of course you
want<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.549> utilize<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.630> as<00:01:24.869> much<00:01:25.229> as<00:01:25.439> possible

possible so you can follow up with your
tornado

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.260 

the<00:01:35.670> tornado<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.870> can<00:01:37.020> also<00:01:37.760> do<00:01:38.760> a<00:01:38.790> little<00:01:39.150> bit

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
the tornado you can also do a little bit

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.300 
the tornado you can also do a little bit
more<00:01:39.480> with<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.840> tornado<00:01:40.080> before<00:01:40.980> right<00:01:41.130> now

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
more with the tornado before right now

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.450 
more with the tornado before right now
let's<00:01:41.880> try<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.210> maximize<00:01:42.600> our<00:01:43.320> dash<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.160> are

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
let's try to maximize our dash and are

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.120 
let's try to maximize our dash and are
stunned<00:01:44.820> ability<00:01:45.660> so<00:01:46.380> first<00:01:46.650> you're<00:01:46.890> going<00:01:47.040> to

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
stunned ability so first you're going to

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.980 
stunned ability so first you're going to
want<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.490> go<00:01:47.640> for<00:01:47.880> hydro<00:01:48.450> splash<00:01:50.330> ice<00:01:51.330> cubes

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
want to go for hydro splash ice cubes

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.730 
want to go for hydro splash ice cubes
and<00:01:53.180> of<00:01:54.180> course<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.750> want<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.020> use<00:01:55.230> the<00:01:55.350> golden

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
and of course you want to use the golden

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.550 
and of course you want to use the golden
watch<00:01:56.300> of<00:01:57.300> course<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.780> want<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.080> use<00:01:58.290> your

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
watch of course you want to use your

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.400 
watch of course you want to use your
dash<00:01:58.890> as<00:01:59.190> much<00:01:59.640> as<00:01:59.880> possible<00:02:00.300> because<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:01.110> does

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
dash as much as possible because it does

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.520 
dash as much as possible because it does
a<00:02:01.590> lot<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:02.070> damage<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:03.600> faster<00:02:04.050> you<00:02:04.080> can<00:02:04.260> do

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.809 

and<00:03:08.500> of<00:03:09.500> course<00:03:09.530> you<00:03:09.920> on<00:03:10.099> go<00:03:10.250> for<00:03:10.430> tornado

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
and of course you on go for tornado

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.660 
and of course you on go for tornado
taking<00:03:11.239> this<00:03:12.170> is<00:03:12.290> very<00:03:12.530> useful<00:03:12.650> because<00:03:13.220> once

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
taking this is very useful because once

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.410 
taking this is very useful because once
you<00:03:13.790> use<00:03:13.909> your<00:03:14.030> tornado<00:03:14.420> it's<00:03:14.840> not<00:03:15.200> as<00:03:15.409> fast<00:03:15.920> as

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
you use your tornado it's not as fast as

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.850 
you use your tornado it's not as fast as
you're<00:03:17.420> walking<00:03:17.659> or<00:03:18.519> new<00:03:19.519> dash<00:03:20.200> it's<00:03:21.200> a<00:03:21.650> little

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
you're walking or new dash it's a little

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.160 
you're walking or new dash it's a little
bit<00:03:21.950> slow<00:03:22.250> so<00:03:22.519> once<00:03:22.760> you<00:03:22.879> get<00:03:23.030> this<00:03:23.269> you're

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
bit slow so once you get this you're

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:31.190 
bit slow so once you get this you're
gonna<00:03:24.290> be<00:03:24.379> able<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:24.650> go<00:03:24.769> everywhere

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.119
