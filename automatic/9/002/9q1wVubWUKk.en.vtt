these colors are as I said are really

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.480 
these colors are as I said are really
pigmented<00:02:51.650> um<00:02:52.510> they<00:02:53.510> go<00:02:53.660> on<00:02:53.810> really<00:02:54.050> strong

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
channels is really good I mean this is

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.410 
channels is really good I mean this is
definitely<00:03:01.550> the<00:03:01.760> best<00:03:03.490> non-mac<00:03:04.490> brand<00:03:05.000> that

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
definitely the best non-mac brand that

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.890 
definitely the best non-mac brand that
is<00:03:05.480> most<00:03:05.870> like<00:03:06.170> Mac<00:03:06.530> or<00:03:06.890> even<00:03:07.280> better<00:03:07.900> stuff

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
is most like Mac or even better stuff

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.750 
is most like Mac or even better stuff
that<00:03:09.110> I<00:03:09.140> bought<00:03:09.230> I<00:03:09.860> mean<00:03:10.100> sometimes<00:03:10.370> you<00:03:10.610> know

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
that I bought I mean sometimes you know

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.850 
that I bought I mean sometimes you know
like<00:03:11.120> bought<00:03:11.570> the<00:03:11.870> Knicks<00:03:12.140> products<00:03:12.710> and<00:03:12.830> i

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
like bought the Knicks products and i

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.370 
like bought the Knicks products and i
thought<00:03:13.070> those<00:03:13.220> are<00:03:13.430> going<00:03:13.580> to<00:03:13.640> be<00:03:13.760> similar<00:03:13.970> to

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
thought those are going to be similar to

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.780 
thought those are going to be similar to
mac<00:03:15.380> but<00:03:15.770> the<00:03:15.860> quality<00:03:16.070> is<00:03:16.250> not<00:03:16.430> as<00:03:16.490> good<00:03:16.730> but

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
mac but the quality is not as good but

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.170 
mac but the quality is not as good but
these<00:03:17.120> most<00:03:17.360> definitely<00:03:17.720> are<00:03:18.910> as<00:03:19.910> good

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
these most definitely are as good

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.920 
these most definitely are as good
quality<00:03:20.660> as<00:03:20.780> mac<00:03:21.020> or<00:03:21.290> better<00:03:21.500> so<00:03:22.570> yeah<00:03:23.570> that's

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
quality as mac or better so yeah that's

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.450 
quality as mac or better so yeah that's
