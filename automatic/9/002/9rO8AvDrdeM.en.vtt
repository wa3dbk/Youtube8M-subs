a push mower engine but this I'm talking

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.150 
a push mower engine but this I'm talking
about<00:00:18.570> this<00:00:18.810> type<00:00:19.050> here<00:00:19.410> it's<00:00:19.560> got<00:00:19.740> an<00:00:19.890> actual

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
about this type here it's got an actual

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.820 
about this type here it's got an actual
mechanical<00:00:20.850> governor<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:22.050> rod<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:22.470> goes<00:00:22.500> in

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
mechanical governor the rod that goes in

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.620 
mechanical governor the rod that goes in
it<00:00:22.950> works<00:00:23.160> off<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.490> whole<00:00:23.670> slinger<00:00:24.060> which<00:00:24.420> has

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
it works off the whole slinger which has

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.900 
it works off the whole slinger which has
counterweights<00:00:25.200> on<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.740> work<00:00:26.640> the

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
counterweights on it to work the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.600 
counterweights on it to work the
governor<00:00:27.810> arm<00:00:28.050> it's<00:00:28.710> pretty<00:00:28.980> simple<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.430> do

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:29.610 
governor arm it's pretty simple to do

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.940 
governor arm it's pretty simple to do
when<00:00:30.090> you're<00:00:30.210> governor<00:00:30.450> arm<00:00:30.810> here<00:00:31.140> there's<00:00:31.860> a

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
when you're governor arm here there's a

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.500 
when you're governor arm here there's a
little<00:00:32.099> rod<00:00:32.369> right<00:00:32.700> here<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.090> middle<00:00:33.360> that

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
little rod right here in the middle that

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.470 
little rod right here in the middle that
goes<00:00:33.660> all<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.899> way<00:00:33.989> inside<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.500> engine<00:00:34.829> and

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
goes all the way inside the engine and

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.680 
goes all the way inside the engine and
you<00:00:36.480> can<00:00:36.629> see<00:00:37.579> this<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.790> three<00:00:39.120> sixteenths

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
you can see this is a three sixteenths

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.560 
you can see this is a three sixteenths
nut<00:00:39.809> driver<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.620> have<00:00:41.280> seen<00:00:41.609> these<00:00:41.789> slotted<00:00:42.390> for

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
nut driver I have seen these slotted for

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.529 
nut driver I have seen these slotted for
like<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.839> straight<00:00:43.260> screw<00:00:43.559> driver<00:00:44.359> this<00:00:45.359> is

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
like a straight screw driver this is

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.020 
like a straight screw driver this is
actually<00:00:45.929> better<00:00:46.170> like<00:00:46.469> this<00:00:46.789> and<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.909> got

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
actually better like this and you got

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.610 
actually better like this and you got
this<00:00:48.239> bolt<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.719> goes<00:00:48.749> all<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.109> way<00:00:49.230> through

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
this bolt that goes all the way through

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.149 
this bolt that goes all the way through
here<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.699> keeps<00:00:50.940> tension<00:00:51.420> on<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.589> so<00:00:53.069> it

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.159 
here it keeps tension on this so it

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.399 
here it keeps tension on this so it
won't<00:00:53.339> slide<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.059> that's<00:00:54.780> what<00:00:54.989> happens

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:55.409 
won't slide on this that's what happens

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:56.739 
won't slide on this that's what happens
a<00:00:55.469> lot<00:00:55.499> of<00:00:55.679> times<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.100> lot<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.249> times<00:00:56.339> these<00:00:56.670> will

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:56.749 
a lot of times a lot of times these will

00:00:56.749 --> 00:00:59.419 
a lot of times a lot of times these will
move<00:00:57.749> on<00:00:58.260> here<00:00:58.499> and<00:00:58.620> that's<00:00:58.739> what<00:00:58.890> throws<00:00:59.159> the

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 
move on here and that's what throws the

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:02.029 
move on here and that's what throws the
governor<00:01:00.300> out<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.659> adjustment<00:01:00.960> which<00:01:01.859> will

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
governor out of adjustment which will

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.310 
governor out of adjustment which will
cause<00:01:02.489> low<00:01:02.819> ping<00:01:03.089> or<00:01:03.239> surging<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.929> the<00:01:04.050> engine

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
cause low ping or surging of the engine

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.120 
cause low ping or surging of the engine
while<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:04.650> running<00:01:09.800> and<00:01:10.800> here's<00:01:10.979> your

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
while it's running and here's your

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.700 
while it's running and here's your
close-up<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.939> what<00:01:12.270> I'm<00:01:12.390> talking<00:01:12.750> about<00:01:12.810> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
close-up of what I'm talking about the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.069 
close-up of what I'm talking about the
first<00:01:13.950> thing<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.280> got<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.490> do<00:01:14.759> is<00:01:15.479> loosen<00:01:15.780> this

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:16.079 
first thing you got to do is loosen this

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:19.389 
first thing you got to do is loosen this
bolt<00:01:16.140> right<00:01:16.500> here<00:01:16.920> when<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.820> governor<00:01:18.270> arm

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
bolt right here when the governor arm

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:22.670 
bolt right here when the governor arm
what<00:01:20.399> this<00:01:20.610> does<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.719> squeezes<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.380> metal

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
what this does it squeezes the metal

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.020 
what this does it squeezes the metal
together<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.189> keep<00:01:23.369> tension<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:23.850> that

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
together so it keep tension on that

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.859 
together so it keep tension on that
shaft<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.570> goes<00:01:24.689> inside<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.229> engine<00:01:29.719> and<00:01:30.719> what

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
shaft it goes inside the engine and what

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.810 
shaft it goes inside the engine and what
you<00:01:30.960> got<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.200> do<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:32.219> got<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.399> hold<00:01:32.610> your

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
you got to do you got to hold your

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.060 
you got to do you got to hold your
governor<00:01:33.149> arm<00:01:33.299> back<00:01:33.539> here<00:01:33.840> until<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.619> maxes

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
governor arm back here until it maxes

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.219 
governor arm back here until it maxes
the<00:01:35.189> throttle<00:01:35.579> out<00:01:35.670> on<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.969> carburetor<00:01:36.479> and

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
the throttle out on the carburetor and

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.800 
the throttle out on the carburetor and
you<00:01:37.380> come<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.680> here<00:01:37.920> with<00:01:38.430> your<00:01:38.460> screwdriver

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
you come in here with your screwdriver

and you turn this just until it stops
you<00:01:42.750> don't<00:01:42.930> want<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.170> force<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.710> because<00:01:43.950> you

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
you don't want to force it because you

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.370 
you don't want to force it because you
can<00:01:44.729> damage<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.329> internal<00:01:45.990> parts<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.320> the

can damage the internal parts of the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.649 
can damage the internal parts of the
engine<00:01:46.469> by<00:01:46.829> doing<00:01:47.039> that<00:01:47.219> so<00:01:47.490> once<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.390> get<00:01:48.539> it

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
engine by doing that so once you get it

engine by doing that so once you get it
set<00:01:49.520> try<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.579> hold<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:50.969> there<00:01:51.149> much<00:01:51.780> better

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
set try to hold it there much better

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.779 
set try to hold it there much better
have<00:01:52.229> two<00:01:52.320> people<00:01:52.799> have<00:01:52.950> somebody<00:01:53.280> else<00:01:53.520> hold

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
have two people have somebody else hold

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.229 

that's<00:02:25.090> all<00:02:25.269> there<00:02:25.420> is<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.840> it

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
that's all there is to it

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.300 
that's all there is to it
and<00:02:28.239> also<00:02:28.660> while<00:02:28.959> you're<00:02:29.050> doing<00:02:29.379> this<00:02:29.620> it's

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
and also while you're doing this it's

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.740 
and also while you're doing this it's
also<00:02:30.459> a<00:02:30.640> good<00:02:30.760> idea<00:02:30.819> to<00:02:31.120> make<00:02:31.300> sure<00:02:31.450> all<00:02:31.629> your

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
also a good idea to make sure all your

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.440 
also a good idea to make sure all your
linkages<00:02:32.290> are<00:02:32.470> working<00:02:33.310> right<00:02:33.489> I<00:02:33.819> started

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
linkages are working right I started

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.940 
linkages are working right I started
this<00:02:34.510> in<00:02:34.569> another<00:02:34.870> video<00:02:35.260> I<00:02:35.319> did<00:02:35.530> on<00:02:35.560> how<00:02:35.890> to

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
this in another video I did on how to

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.350 
this in another video I did on how to
hook<00:02:36.190> up<00:02:36.340> all<00:02:36.519> the<00:02:36.640> linkages<00:02:36.940> on<00:02:37.269> the

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
hook up all the linkages on the

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.020 
hook up all the linkages on the
carburetor<00:02:37.810> but<00:02:38.530> all<00:02:38.680> you<00:02:38.769> got<00:02:38.830> to<00:02:39.040> do<00:02:39.190> when

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
carburetor but all you got to do when

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.670 
carburetor but all you got to do when
this<00:02:40.180> is<00:02:40.330> at<00:02:40.480> idle<00:02:40.870> which<00:02:41.200> is<00:02:41.319> all<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.560> way

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
this is at idle which is all the way

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.940 
this is at idle which is all the way
over<00:02:41.950> here<00:02:42.300> this<00:02:43.300> should<00:02:43.480> be<00:02:43.690> very<00:02:44.560> little

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
over here this should be very little

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.339 
over here this should be very little
spring<00:02:45.430> if<00:02:45.610> any<00:02:45.819> at<00:02:46.000> all<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.450> it<00:02:46.480> and<00:02:47.170> when<00:02:47.260> you

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
spring if any at all to it and when you

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.009 
spring if any at all to it and when you
give<00:02:47.500> it<00:02:47.620> full<00:02:47.860> throttle<00:02:47.890> like<00:02:48.670> this<00:02:49.019> it'll

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
give it full throttle like this it'll

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.430 
give it full throttle like this it'll
have<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.200> real<00:02:50.470> strong<00:02:50.709> spring<00:02:51.280> like<00:02:51.489> this<00:02:51.730> -

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
have a real strong spring like this -

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.729 
have a real strong spring like this -
yeah<00:02:53.440> it<00:02:53.620> does<00:02:54.599> -<00:02:55.599> return<00:02:55.750> to<00:02:56.049> idle<00:02:56.170> should<00:02:56.620> be

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
yeah it does - return to idle should be

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.250 
yeah it does - return to idle should be
real<00:02:56.980> free<00:02:57.420> this<00:02:58.420> is<00:02:58.480> something<00:02:58.959> you<00:02:59.049> should

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
real free this is something you should

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.380 
real free this is something you should
do<00:02:59.470> anytime<00:03:00.010> you<00:03:00.340> have<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:00.519> carburetor<00:03:01.120> off

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
do anytime you have the carburetor off

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.300 
do anytime you have the carburetor off
cause<00:03:02.200> a<00:03:02.230> lot<00:03:02.380> of<00:03:02.470> times<00:03:02.650> you<00:03:02.769> have<00:03:02.890> these<00:03:03.099> two

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
cause a lot of times you have these two

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.949 
cause a lot of times you have these two
bolts<00:03:03.670> out<00:03:03.849> the<00:03:04.030> carburetor<00:03:04.450> can<00:03:04.720> move<00:03:04.930> just

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
bolts out the carburetor can move just

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.440 
bolts out the carburetor can move just
sliced<00:03:05.620> a<00:03:05.799> little<00:03:05.860> bit<00:03:06.160> that<00:03:06.819> can<00:03:07.000> throw<00:03:07.239> this

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
sliced a little bit that can throw this

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.740 
sliced a little bit that can throw this
out<00:03:07.720> so<00:03:08.650> it's<00:03:08.950> kind<00:03:09.160> of<00:03:09.220> like<00:03:09.360> you<00:03:10.360> do<00:03:10.510> anything

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
out so it's kind of like you do anything

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.240 
out so it's kind of like you do anything
on<00:03:11.079> the<00:03:11.200> front<00:03:11.440> end<00:03:11.560> of<00:03:11.620> a<00:03:11.709> vehicle<00:03:11.739> you're

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
on the front end of a vehicle you're

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.140 
on the front end of a vehicle you're
going<00:03:12.430> to<00:03:12.489> do<00:03:12.579> a<00:03:12.610> front<00:03:12.880> end<00:03:13.060> alignment

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
going to do a front end alignment

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.630 
going to do a front end alignment
afterwards<00:03:14.049> it's<00:03:14.769> kind<00:03:14.980> of<00:03:15.040> like<00:03:15.190> you<00:03:15.370> have<00:03:15.489> to

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
afterwards it's kind of like you have to

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.250 
afterwards it's kind of like you have to
adjust<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:16.180> governor<00:03:16.569> every<00:03:16.810> time<00:03:16.989> you<00:03:17.110> do

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
adjust the governor every time you do

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.620 
adjust the governor every time you do
something<00:03:17.590> with<00:03:17.739> the<00:03:17.950> throttle<00:03:18.790> linkage<00:03:19.209> like

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
something with the throttle linkage like

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.390 
something with the throttle linkage like
this<00:03:19.900> or<00:03:20.260> if<00:03:20.560> you<00:03:20.680> do<00:03:20.829> anything<00:03:21.190> to<00:03:21.310> the

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
this or if you do anything to the

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.990 
this or if you do anything to the
carburetor<00:03:21.720> always<00:03:22.720> keep<00:03:22.900> that<00:03:23.049> in<00:03:23.200> mind<00:03:23.380> and

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
carburetor always keep that in mind and

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.370 
carburetor always keep that in mind and
it's<00:03:25.000> often<00:03:25.359> overlooked<00:03:25.870> because<00:03:26.200> a<00:03:26.230> lot<00:03:26.350> of

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
it's often overlooked because a lot of

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.870 
it's often overlooked because a lot of
people<00:03:26.470> don't<00:03:26.650> think<00:03:26.769> you<00:03:26.980> know<00:03:27.100> justice<00:03:27.639> I

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
people don't think you know justice I

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.759 
people don't think you know justice I
didn't<00:03:28.150> from<00:03:28.269> the<00:03:28.329> longest<00:03:28.690> time<00:03:28.900> that's<00:03:29.590> real

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
didn't from the longest time that's real

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.160 
didn't from the longest time that's real
simple<00:03:29.980> to<00:03:30.250> do<00:03:30.459> you<00:03:30.880> do<00:03:31.540> it<00:03:31.569> in<00:03:31.690> probably<00:03:31.959> five

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
simple to do you do it in probably five

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.430 
simple to do you do it in probably five
minutes<00:03:32.819> the<00:03:33.819> engine<00:03:34.060> of<00:03:34.180> my<00:03:34.329> lawnmower<00:03:34.959> needs

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
minutes the engine of my lawnmower needs

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.809 
minutes the engine of my lawnmower needs
this<00:03:35.620> done<00:03:35.859> because<00:03:36.010> the<00:03:36.220> carburetor<00:03:36.579> keeps

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
this done because the carburetor keeps

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.030 
this done because the carburetor keeps
working<00:03:37.030> loose<00:03:37.359> when<00:03:38.290> I<00:03:38.350> notice<00:03:38.590> today<00:03:38.829> when<00:03:38.950> I

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
working loose when I notice today when I

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.289 
working loose when I notice today when I
was<00:03:39.100> cutting<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.400> grass<00:03:39.579> that<00:03:39.850> is<00:03:39.910> starting

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
was cutting the grass that is starting

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.050 
was cutting the grass that is starting
to<00:03:40.420> loafer<00:03:40.900> or<00:03:41.230> surge<00:03:41.980> up<00:03:42.250> and<00:03:42.430> down<00:03:42.639> at<00:03:42.850> the

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
to loafer or surge up and down at the

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.750 
to loafer or surge up and down at the
high<00:03:43.389> rpm<00:03:43.989> and<00:03:44.290> idle<00:03:44.650> good<00:03:44.859> but<00:03:45.609> if<00:03:45.730> it's

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
high rpm and idle good but if it's

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.160 
high rpm and idle good but if it's
urgent<00:03:46.030> I<00:03:46.329> figure<00:03:46.600> that's<00:03:46.750> what<00:03:46.930> it<00:03:47.019> is

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
urgent I figure that's what it is

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.330 
urgent I figure that's what it is
because<00:03:47.319> that<00:03:47.410> carburetor<00:03:47.769> keeps<00:03:48.130> working

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
because that carburetor keeps working

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.490 
because that carburetor keeps working
loose<00:03:48.700> so<00:03:49.569> I<00:03:49.660> want<00:03:49.870> to<00:03:49.900> do<00:03:50.019> that<00:03:50.170> on<00:03:50.290> one<00:03:50.319> head

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
loose so I want to do that on one head

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.050 
loose so I want to do that on one head
here<00:03:50.680> pretty<00:03:50.920> soon<00:03:50.980> and<00:03:51.459> see<00:03:51.670> if<00:03:51.760> that<00:03:51.880> helps

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
here pretty soon and see if that helps

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.199 
here pretty soon and see if that helps
it<00:03:52.389> I<00:03:52.660> would<00:03:53.440> have<00:03:53.530> shut<00:03:53.709> it<00:03:53.739> on<00:03:53.950> it<00:03:54.190> but<00:03:54.940> they'd

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
it I would have shut it on it but they'd

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.520 
it I would have shut it on it but they'd
be<00:03:55.359> easier<00:03:55.569> to<00:03:55.690> show<00:03:55.930> you<00:03:55.989> on<00:03:56.200> this<00:03:56.350> engine

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
be easier to show you on this engine

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.319 
be easier to show you on this engine
here<00:03:56.829> since<00:03:57.100> it's<00:03:57.250> model<00:03:57.549> remote<00:03:57.850> right<00:03:58.120> now

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
here since it's model remote right now
