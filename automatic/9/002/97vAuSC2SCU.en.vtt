00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.030 
then you're going to sort of da bit off
a<00:00:11.400> little<00:00:11.730> bit<00:00:12.259> because<00:00:13.259> if<00:00:13.559> you<00:00:13.679> go<00:00:13.710> right

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
a little bit because if you go right

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.660 
a little bit because if you go right
directly<00:00:15.410> to<00:00:16.410> your<00:00:16.590> paper<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:19.340> it's<00:00:20.340> going<00:00:20.609> to

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
directly to your paper and it's going to

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.269 
directly to your paper and it's going to
leave<00:00:20.880> sort<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.359> marks<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.590> lines<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:23.100> won't

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
leave sort of marks and lines it won't

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:31.150 
leave sort of marks and lines it won't
look<00:00:23.460> soft<00:00:25.580> so<00:00:26.580> then<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.939> start<00:00:27.210> up<00:00:27.330> at<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.480> top

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.130 

okay<00:00:32.160> can<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.520> see<00:00:32.790> okay<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:35.930> just<00:00:36.930> really

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140

okay can you see okay and just really
lightly<00:00:37.500> with<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.860> circular<00:00:38.399> motion<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:43.910> just

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
lightly with a circular motion I just

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:55.790 
lightly with a circular motion I just
sponge<00:00:46.469> over<00:00:47.960> my<00:00:48.960> template

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.610 

like<00:00:56.670> that

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
like that

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.220 
like that
now<00:00:59.399> if<00:00:59.789> I<00:00:59.940> need<00:01:00.120> more<00:01:00.270> ink<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.750> just<00:01:00.960> sort<00:01:01.170> of

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
now if I need more ink I just sort of

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.460 
now if I need more ink I just sort of
Deb<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:02.610> always<00:01:02.820> rub<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.629> off<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.809> little<00:01:04.199> bit

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
Deb and I always rub it off a little bit

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:14.810 
Deb and I always rub it off a little bit
before<00:01:05.299> going<00:01:06.299> on<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.750> my<00:01:07.049> project<00:01:13.759> okay<00:01:14.759> so

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
before going on to my project okay so

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.840 
before going on to my project okay so
then<00:01:15.180> when<00:01:15.300> you<00:01:15.420> remove<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:16.460> you<00:01:17.460> can<00:01:17.610> see

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
then when you remove it you can see

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.420 
then when you remove it you can see
where<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.119> have<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.600> first<00:01:19.040> sort<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.159> cloud

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
where you have the first sort of cloud

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.389 
where you have the first sort of cloud
line<00:01:21.920> and<00:01:22.920> then<00:01:23.909> you're<00:01:24.149> going<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.390> want<00:01:24.600> to

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
line and then you're going to want to

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:34.210 
line and then you're going to want to
maybe<00:01:27.500> just<00:01:28.500> move<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.070> over<00:01:30.710> a<00:01:31.710> little<00:01:31.860> bit<00:01:32.179> and

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
maybe just move it over a little bit and

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.160 
maybe just move it over a little bit and
then<00:01:35.420> you're<00:01:36.420> going<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.750> add<00:01:37.369> in<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:39.360> next

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
then you're going to add in the next

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.109 
then you're going to add in the next
cloud<00:01:41.149> and<00:01:43.159> don't<00:01:44.159> be<00:01:44.280> concerned<00:01:44.670> if<00:01:44.940> you're

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
cloud and don't be concerned if you're

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.740 
cloud and don't be concerned if you're
sort<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.479> going<00:01:45.720> over<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.560> white<00:01:46.970> on<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.030> top

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
sort of going over the white on the top

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.990 
sort of going over the white on the top
cloud<00:01:49.580> it's<00:01:50.580> going<00:01:50.819> to<00:01:50.880> look<00:01:51.000> pretty<00:01:51.050> to<00:01:52.050> worry

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.320 

see

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.520 

I<00:01:59.390> put<00:02:00.050> that<00:02:00.230> one<00:02:00.410> there<00:02:02.230> so<00:02:03.230> you're<00:02:03.380> just

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
I put that one there so you're just

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.800 
I put that one there so you're just
going<00:02:03.710> to<00:02:03.800> keep<00:02:03.980> moving<00:02:04.400> your<00:02:04.610> your<00:02:05.330> template

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
going to keep moving your your template

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.120 
going to keep moving your your template
around<00:02:06.170> so<00:02:06.620> it's<00:02:08.170> not<00:02:09.170> always<00:02:09.560> in<00:02:09.830> the<00:02:09.920> same

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
around so it's not always in the same

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.170 
around so it's not always in the same
place<00:02:10.270> and<00:02:12.340> then<00:02:13.340> your<00:02:13.520> clouds<00:02:13.760> will<00:02:14.030> look

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
place and then your clouds will look

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:22.210 
place and then your clouds will look
really<00:02:14.210> natural

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.180 

and<00:02:22.790> because<00:02:23.270> I've<00:02:23.510> put<00:02:23.780> my<00:02:23.900> mask<00:02:24.170> on<00:02:24.470> my<00:02:24.740> image

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
and because I've put my mask on my image

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:33.450 
and because I've put my mask on my image
I<00:02:25.750> don't<00:02:27.640> have<00:02:28.640> to<00:02:28.850> worry<00:02:29.090> about<00:02:29.270> that<00:02:29.450> at<00:02:29.810> all

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:56.440

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:20.420 
so it's not a bit of time but as you can
see<00:03:00.230> it's<00:03:00.440> really<00:03:01.000> it's<00:03:02.000> not<00:03:02.180> very<00:03:02.390> hard
