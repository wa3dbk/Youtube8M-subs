00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.220
 look a little around you 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.340
 how many devices do not contain computer mouse batteries 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.880
 TV remote control and this is wireless and radio flashlight play 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.059
 we make an incredible consumption of batteries 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.189
 take sylvie for example 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.449
 only for its game console it consumes nearly 150 countries a year 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:29.489
 that sense 50 parent stack 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.930
 result his father has to release each year two beautiful 50 euro notes of 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.930
 his wallet just for the sylvie console 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.120
 and here Sylvie use rechargeable batteries rather than batteries 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.270
 disposable it's very simple his father found the smile he should 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.600
 pay only 4 euros a year short adieu disposable batteries hello batteries 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.960
 rechargeable 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.700
 but beware there is still a warning 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.420
 indeed a rechargeable battery can deliver electric currents 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.580
 Very important 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.060
 see the experience we have realized 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.130
 if we put the negative pole and the positive pole of a battery 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.570
 rechargeable in contact the net that caused the short circuit quickly becomes 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.270
 a camp of saints 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.000
 in a few seconds it burns 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.440
 and the battery can even exploded 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.430
 let's imagine a little that this short circuit happens in the toy of a small child 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.990
 in bed 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.310
 you would have understood it 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.869
 rechargeable batteries are preferable to disposable batteries but 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.069
 that he only used one of the pillars in toddler toys 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.620
 Avoid concise transporting rechargeable batteries in your pocket 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.220
 especially when a bunch of keys 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.800
 the risk of overheating and burns r and m 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.230
 place them in a small plastic case 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.280
 these very simple precautions will save you money 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.340
 thanks to rechargeable batteries without taking risks
