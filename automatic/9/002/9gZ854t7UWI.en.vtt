00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:16.390
 I apologize for the delay with these tutorials 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.599
 itself was waiting 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.269
 the 3 where a photographic montage was made like this 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.800
 uimp tool 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.630
 well in this tutorial we will start working with binner the goal is 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:35.629
 perform the animation of a ball bouncing 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.850
 here we have the initial screen 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.680
 blender tool itself is 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.430
 the three-dimensional space how we can observe it 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.360
 the bar at the beginning speak 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.530
 achieving a lot of complexity that at first glance impresses with the quantity 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.280
 of tools 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.280
 and you can visualize 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.600
 it is necessary to learn 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.340
 its fast and the control combinations that exist related 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.820
 our animation 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.270
 well first let's know what we have in our work area 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.090
 the idea in 3d divided with a grid with a cubes 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.870
 located exactly in the center 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.070
 a camera from which our scene will be filmed and a light in which 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.160
 effects that we design 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.160
 the cursor where the new ones will appear 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.320
 keeping the loss of the wizard so surprised and they moved 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.750
 we can spin 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.750
 work space 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.710
 to increase or decrease the 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.060
 only we can also keep the knob and the control key 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.060
 it's not time and move the mouse 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:12.729
 by pressing yes 

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:15.309
 obviously the shift key and the 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:18.210
 bush we move this one to be able to move to 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.210
 is from the plane where we are 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:27.039
 the colored arrow 

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:30.039
 red indicates the axis of the x 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.129
 the green arrow 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.029
 and the blue arrow he 

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:40.019
 ascetic axis 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.879
 the numeric keypad allows us to obtain the 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.969
 work area lists 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:48.549
 by pressing the key one we can see the zx plane 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.809
 by pressing the 3 key the zeta plane and d 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:58.479
 by pressing the 7 key they observe 

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:01.479
 os the x hyde plane 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.979
 the zero key allows us to see the angle 

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:07.639
 or from the camera 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:11.679
 and the 5 key allows us to change the view with or without perspective 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:17.579
 we came back 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.040
 this initial the x plane I arrived with the key 7 

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:25.529
 in this area we find 

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:28.219
 this work 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:31.219
 we are located mode objects 

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:34.729
 in this area we find 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:37.729
 of manipulation of objects 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:41.530
 by default the work area is in the mode 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.369
 although this mode allows us to move the 

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:50.419
 jet2 in the work area the a key allows us to select or select 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:52.119
 all the 

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:55.119
 emptied of work 

00:03:57.429 --> 00:04:00.429
 to select any object we do 

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:04.149
 that of the mabus 

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:08.609
 by holding down the right click 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:12.639
 you can not move the object in the work area to move it according to the 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:15.639
 grid we keep the control key pressed 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.890
 I cried precision we have nothing 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.819
 shift key 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:28.409
 after moving the left click primes object so that the object remains in the 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:31.330
 new 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.479
 as well 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.699
 you move the object in each of the 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:36.249
 3 following the 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:39.249
 corresponding chas 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:48.249
 it allows us to rotate the object in each 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.930
 by holding the control key pressed gibson 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.930
 the object every five degrees 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.270
 by pressing the shift key we will make a turn 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.139
 I cried precision 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:11.650
 the mode is that and manipulate the torus of allows us to increase or decrease the size 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.650
 of the objects 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.930
 as in the previous cases the control keys and without their modify the 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:23.339
 process 

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:26.339
 or to apply a new size 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.629
 david mode we have the possibility to manipulate masses 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:36.639
 two 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:39.639
 stump modes 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.780
 me with straight lines 

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:27.199
 another go down with plans 

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:50.800
 if we create an object in modules 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.319
 lion this will be attached to the object that we are avoiding to add new 

00:06:55.849 --> 00:07:01.039
 2 we press the spacebar and choose the object that we require this one 

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:02.029
 will appear 

00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:05.029
 the cursor is located 

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:40.479
 when returning to mode 

00:07:53.059 --> 00:07:56.519
 koke and now we start creating our animation 

00:07:57.349 --> 00:07:58.389
 starting from scratch
