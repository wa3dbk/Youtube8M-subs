00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.020
 today we are going to talk about the 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.830
 joints joints 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:16.260
 include great movement that encompass 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.720
 which are the joints and not the vials 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.460
 that allow movement in the 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.250
 upper lower limbs but 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.040
 also it is spoken of two types of 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.310
 union inter or let's talk about the 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.529
 classification 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.180
 and classification of the joints and 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.360
 let's see what type 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:39.379
 fibrous in the fibrous type we are going to 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.809
 find the syndesmosis that allows 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.629
 two bones are separated by a 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.239
 important space joined by tissue 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:50.600
 fibrous connective in the example that 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.910
 we see here is the joint of tibia and 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.720
 Distal fibula that will be joined by 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.720
 fibrous tissue 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.590
 continuing we are going to talk about the 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.530
 classification of the fibrous type 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.590
 suture in this as know that the bones 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.590
 they will be inning in intimate position 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:13.549
 following the wavy line that is going to be 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.659
 united by dense tissue and as an example 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.659
 we have the cranial structure 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.150
 the third type of fibrous tissue we have 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:29.680
 the the plug 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:32.470
 or gone fosis that links the articulation of 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.930
 tooth in this there is no movement between 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.190
 the two parts and fits the hole 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.190
 by connective tissue 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.060
 synovial type joints are 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.040
 those that are going to have a cavity 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.430
 joint joined by a capsule 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.650
 articulate and we're going to have to see that it 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.020
 classify in simple type 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.450
 in which the surface of two bones 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.710
 they participate in the articulation and 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:05.680
 compound if there are more elements 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.870
 joint by the way we're going to see from 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.530
 the joint surface are going to 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.530
 sort out 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.090
 in flat articulation type 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.069
 this flat joint allows few 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.230
 sliding movements the 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.170
 convexity of one adapts to the 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.270
 concavity of the other here we have as 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.800
 example two carpal bones can be 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.800
 Trapezoid trapezoid 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:39.430
 the articulation is fierce ideas or coti what 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:43.250
 ideas here we see that the convex head 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.920
 rounded adapts to a concavity and 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.220
 allows free movement in all 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.990
 directions including rotation here 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.780
 we see that for example we have the 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:57.160
 articulation between the shoulder and the 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.160
 hip joint 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.020
 talking about joints with deal 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.990
 jazz 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:08.320
 is a modified co-thyroid in which 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:11.050
 the coti the ellipsoidal and superficial 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:15.270
 accommodates a hemisphere in this case 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.270
 we see the metacarpophalangeal joint 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:22.870
 metacarpophalangeal movements are 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:26.430
 from rotation to deduction and deduction 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.430
 that are going to be limited 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:35.680
 Ellipsoidal joint or carpal radio 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:41.040
 in this we are going to see that he has a 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:43.680
 receptacle the smooth vidal and a shank 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.780
 the lip I'm dal that allows movements 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:51.659
 flexion extension to deduction 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.150
 adduction but not rotation the typical 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:56.250
 example is the radio joint 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.840
 carpal 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.060
 articulation truck today 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.849
 in this trick joint today we're going 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:08.450
 to see what comprises a pivot in which 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:10.730
 a bone serves as a shank instead the 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.670
 another and its ligaments form a circle 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:17.090
 that his movement will surround him 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.459
 principal is that of the example rotation 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.120
 the articulation that we are seeing in the 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:25.170
 aksoy atlanto scheme of a 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.820
 continuing we are going to talk about the 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:32.610
 articulation in ciliary or saddle 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:35.190
 the surface of a bone is concave in 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.760
 one direction and convex in another 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.760
 direction and the second shows contour 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:45.660
 reciprocal and allows more movements 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:50.670
 limited in extension and flexion to 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:54.060
 reduction and adduction and limited rotation 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:59.480
 the typical example here we see that in the 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.480
 metacarpal trapezius joint 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:06.090
 and finally we are going to talk about the 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.400
 lemon ying joint or hinge in the 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:12.090
 what the movement is going to do in a 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.750
 only axis and is arranged in shape 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.750
 cross 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.940
 and they're only going to be limited to 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:23.880
 the flexion and extension we have a 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:27.530
 example here is the articulation between 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.530
 the humerus and ulna
