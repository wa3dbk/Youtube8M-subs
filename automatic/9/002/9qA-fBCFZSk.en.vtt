we're<00:00:20.070> all<00:00:20.130> from<00:00:20.310> creative<00:00:20.640> backgrounds<00:00:21.180> and

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
we're all from creative backgrounds and

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.089 
we're all from creative backgrounds and
so<00:00:21.419> from<00:00:21.599> the<00:00:21.689> very<00:00:21.720> beginning<00:00:22.050> we<00:00:22.710> set<00:00:22.950> out<00:00:23.070> to

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:23.099 
so from the very beginning we set out to

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:24.890 
so from the very beginning we set out to
build<00:00:23.400> tools<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:24.060> supported<00:00:24.509> the<00:00:24.540> needs<00:00:24.779> of

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
build tools that supported the needs of

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.090 
build tools that supported the needs of
other<00:00:25.080> creatives<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.680> people<00:00:25.980> like

other creatives and people like

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.679 
other creatives and people like
ourselves<00:00:26.220> specifically<00:00:27.180> willing<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.570> build

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
ourselves specifically willing to build

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.420 
ourselves specifically willing to build
tools<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.380> helped<00:00:28.740> eliminate<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.250> barriers

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
tools that helped eliminate the barriers

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.339 
tools that helped eliminate the barriers
between<00:00:29.640> thought<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.180> creation<00:00:30.869> when<00:00:31.289> we

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
between thought and creation when we

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.960 
between thought and creation when we
thought<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.560> center<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.160> was<00:00:32.580> a<00:00:32.610> tool

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
thought the center of that was a tool

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.640 
thought the center of that was a tool
that<00:00:33.000> was<00:00:33.390> very<00:00:33.510> natural<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.110> us<00:00:34.140> from<00:00:34.379> very

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 
that was very natural to us from very

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.040 
that was very natural to us from very

early on jots evolution has always been

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.720 
early on jots evolution has always been
about<00:00:37.199> how<00:00:37.620> do<00:00:37.680> we<00:00:37.800> make<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.129> incredibly<00:00:38.460> easy

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
about how do we make it incredibly easy

we've<00:00:52.590> added<00:00:52.800> palm<00:00:53.219> rejection<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.180> a

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
we've added palm rejection this is a

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.090 
we've added palm rejection this is a
huge<00:00:54.539> leap<00:00:54.780> forward<00:00:54.890> artists<00:00:55.890> have<00:00:55.980> been

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
huge leap forward artists have been

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.529 
huge leap forward artists have been
having<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> hard<00:00:56.430> time<00:00:56.640> drawing<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.420> was

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
having a hard time drawing it was

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.029 
having a hard time drawing it was
unnatural<00:00:58.199> when<00:00:58.379> you're<00:00:58.500> trying<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.829> draw<00:00:59.010> on

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
unnatural when you're trying to draw on

unnatural when you're trying to draw on
a<00:00:59.190> tablet<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.760> your<00:00:59.879> palm<00:01:00.090> draw<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.449> line

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
a tablet and your palm draw a line

that's<00:01:01.050> not<00:01:01.289> how<00:01:01.469> paperwork's<00:01:02.070> about<00:01:02.430> how<00:01:02.550> a

that's not how paperwork's about how a
canvas<00:01:03.239> works<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:03.989> we<00:01:04.110> dropped<00:01:04.259> touch<00:01:04.470> for

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:04.770 
canvas works and so we dropped touch for

we've been able to sync up things so

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.570 
we've been able to sync up things so
