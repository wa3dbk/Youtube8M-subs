00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
with the critical hit chance now my six

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.380 
with the critical hit chance now my six
kill<00:00:43.770> was<00:00:43.950> when<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.160> was<00:00:44.399> unsure<00:00:44.579> if<00:00:44.940> these<00:00:45.149> are

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
kill was when I was unsure if these are

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.690 
kill was when I was unsure if these are
all<00:00:45.539> no-brainers<00:00:46.350> but<00:00:47.070> over<00:00:47.520> power

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
all no-brainers but over power

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.700 
all no-brainers but over power
increasing<00:00:48.510> my<00:00:48.629> crit<00:00:48.899> chance<00:00:49.110> seemed<00:00:49.530> like

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
increasing my crit chance seemed like

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.090 
increasing my crit chance seemed like
the<00:00:49.890> best<00:00:50.190> move<00:00:50.579> here<00:00:50.989> I<00:00:51.989> suppose

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
the best move here I suppose

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.840 
the best move here I suppose
no<00:00:53.250> weapons<00:00:53.789> roll<00:00:53.940> wouldn't<00:00:54.210> really<00:00:54.329> work

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
no weapons roll wouldn't really work

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.950 
no weapons roll wouldn't really work
yeah<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:56.879> think<00:00:57.059> that's<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.510> best<00:00:57.690> choice

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
yeah I think that's the best choice

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.290 
yeah I think that's the best choice
maybe<00:00:58.350> hammer<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.250> now<00:00:59.340> hammer<00:00:59.640> isn't<00:01:00.090> as

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
maybe hammer and now hammer isn't as

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.060 
maybe hammer and now hammer isn't as
good<00:01:00.420> as<00:01:00.539> frenzy<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.050> yeah<00:01:01.170> overpower<00:01:01.920> with

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
good as frenzy so yeah overpower with

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.680 
good as frenzy so yeah overpower with
the<00:01:02.129> crit<00:01:02.309> chance<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.820> my<00:01:03.030> passives<00:01:03.539> are

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
the crit chance and my passives are

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.179 
the crit chance and my passives are
ruthless<00:01:04.170> obviously<00:01:04.619> weapons<00:01:05.010> master

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189
