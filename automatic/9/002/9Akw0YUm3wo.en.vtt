that I used in my other tutorial but
it's<00:04:56.850> just<00:04:57.000> such<00:04:57.090> a<00:04:57.150> nice<00:04:57.539> neutral<00:04:57.840> shade<00:04:58.259> and

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
it's just such a nice neutral shade and

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.260 
it's just such a nice neutral shade and
because<00:04:58.710> I<00:04:58.740> have<00:04:58.949> such<00:04:59.160> bold<00:04:59.490> eyes<00:04:59.669> it<00:05:00.090> just

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
because I have such bold eyes it just

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.879 
because I have such bold eyes it just
makes<00:05:00.419> sense<00:05:00.509> for<00:05:00.870> this<00:05:00.990> look<00:05:01.229> so<00:05:01.560> I'm<00:05:01.830> going

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
makes sense for this look so I'm going

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:04.969 
makes sense for this look so I'm going
to<00:05:02.370> be<00:05:02.490> using<00:05:02.610> my<00:05:02.880> fingers<00:05:03.300> to<00:05:03.330> apply<00:05:03.990> that<00:05:04.440> to

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
to be using my fingers to apply that to

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:12.380 
to be using my fingers to apply that to
my<00:05:05.340> cheeks

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.300 

then<00:05:13.290> because<00:05:13.560> I<00:05:13.650> had<00:05:13.800> a<00:05:13.830> little<00:05:14.040> bit<00:05:14.220> more

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
then because I had a little bit more

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.680 
then because I had a little bit more
money<00:05:14.490> left<00:05:14.700> in<00:05:14.790> the<00:05:14.880> budget<00:05:14.940> I<00:05:15.240> figured<00:05:15.540> why

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
money left in the budget I figured why

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.600 
money left in the budget I figured why
not<00:05:15.750> go<00:05:15.900> for<00:05:16.020> shanna<00:05:16.500> lips<00:05:16.830> and<00:05:17.070> put<00:05:17.400> a<00:05:17.430> gloss

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
not go for shanna lips and put a gloss

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.760
