and<00:02:01.179> then<00:02:01.479> the<00:02:01.569> crack<00:02:01.780> right<00:02:01.989> here<00:02:02.050> is<00:02:02.259> a<00:02:02.289> weak

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
and then the crack right here is a weak

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.150 
and then the crack right here is a weak
spot<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:04.090> there's<00:02:04.660> a<00:02:04.780> little<00:02:04.989> flimsy<00:02:05.200> and<00:02:05.649> I

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
spot so there's a little flimsy and I

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.400 
spot so there's a little flimsy and I
bashed<00:02:06.670> it<00:02:06.849> pretty<00:02:07.060> hard<00:02:07.239> so<00:02:07.599> I<00:02:07.840> already<00:02:08.259> have

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
bashed it pretty hard so I already have

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.499 
bashed it pretty hard so I already have
another<00:02:08.979> body<00:02:09.220> that<00:02:09.520> I<00:02:09.729> need<00:02:09.910> to<00:02:09.970> paint<00:02:10.149> up<00:02:10.300> but

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
another body that I need to paint up but

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:11.670 
another body that I need to paint up but
we're<00:02:10.690> gonna<00:02:10.780> keep<00:02:10.989> this<00:02:11.170> one<00:02:11.230> for<00:02:11.560> a<00:02:11.590> little

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
we're gonna keep this one for a little

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.850 
we're gonna keep this one for a little
bit<00:02:11.890> just<00:02:11.920> for<00:02:12.670> bashing<00:02:13.150> around<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:14.470> here's

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
bit just for bashing around and here's

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:15.740 
bit just for bashing around and here's
the<00:02:15.040> inside

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
the inside

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.250 
the inside
of<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:16.380> of<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.130> buggy<00:02:17.310> I<00:02:17.840> said<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:18.870> went<00:02:19.110> with

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
of the of the buggy I said I went with

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.640 
of the of the buggy I said I went with
the<00:02:19.440> lrp<00:02:20.310> combo<00:02:21.090> here<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.540> I'm<00:02:22.200> liking<00:02:22.560> it

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
the lrp combo here and I'm liking it

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.260 
the lrp combo here and I'm liking it
it's<00:02:22.800> pretty<00:02:23.040> cool<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:23.520> don't<00:02:23.880> really<00:02:24.000> have<00:02:24.120> any

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
it's pretty cool I don't really have any

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.670 
it's pretty cool I don't really have any
issues<00:02:24.420> with<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.990> was<00:02:25.140> easy<00:02:25.320> for<00:02:25.530> me<00:02:25.590> to

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
issues with it it was easy for me to

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.060 
issues with it it was easy for me to
program<00:02:26.130> it<00:02:26.460> does<00:02:26.760> have<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:26.970> PC<00:02:27.420> interface<00:02:28.070> cord

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
program it does have a PC interface cord

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.010 
program it does have a PC interface cord
that<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.310> can<00:02:29.460> buy<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:30.240> program<00:02:30.630> it<00:02:30.750> with<00:02:30.870> the

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
that you can buy to program it with the

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.630 
that you can buy to program it with the
with<00:02:31.350> your<00:02:31.500> computer<00:02:31.860> but<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.340> doesn't<00:02:32.550> really

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
with your computer but it doesn't really

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.010 
with your computer but it doesn't really
have<00:02:32.820> that<00:02:32.850> many<00:02:33.120> features<00:02:33.420> that<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:33.870> would

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
have that many features that that would

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.470 
have that many features that that would
be<00:02:34.110> necessary<00:02:34.400> but<00:02:35.400> it<00:02:35.610> does<00:02:35.940> have<00:02:36.120> some<00:02:36.300> cool

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
be necessary but it does have some cool

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.790 
be necessary but it does have some cool
features<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:36.840> are<00:02:37.050> using<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.320> program<00:02:37.650> with

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
features that are using a program with

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.340 
features that are using a program with
these<00:02:37.920> two<00:02:38.070> little<00:02:38.220> buttons<00:02:38.610> here<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:39.320> yeah<00:02:40.320> I

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
these two little buttons here and yeah I

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.930 
these two little buttons here and yeah I
mean<00:02:40.590> if<00:02:40.740> I<00:02:40.830> can<00:02:41.010> figure<00:02:41.190> it<00:02:41.340> out<00:02:41.400> anybody<00:02:41.790> else

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
mean if I can figure it out anybody else

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.020 
mean if I can figure it out anybody else
can<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:42.420> its<00:02:43.350> cost<00:02:43.800> wise<00:02:44.070> it's<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:44.730> little<00:02:44.940> on

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
can so its cost wise it's a little on

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.710 
can so its cost wise it's a little on
the<00:02:45.060> pricey<00:02:45.150> side<00:02:45.800> it's<00:02:46.800> working<00:02:47.190> fine<00:02:47.540> it<00:02:48.540> has

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
the pricey side it's working fine it has

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.570 
the pricey side it's working fine it has
these<00:02:48.900> plug<00:02:49.260> features<00:02:49.770> instead<00:02:50.100> of<00:02:50.220> soldering

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
these plug features instead of soldering

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.640 
these plug features instead of soldering
your<00:02:51.030> connections<00:02:51.660> on<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:51.959> at<00:02:52.290> first<00:02:52.530> I

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
your connections on it at first I

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.870 
your connections on it at first I
thought<00:02:52.830> that'd<00:02:53.010> be<00:02:53.040> kind<00:02:53.370> of<00:02:53.459> cool<00:02:53.670> but

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
thought that'd be kind of cool but

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.090 
thought that'd be kind of cool but
actually<00:02:54.440> it's<00:02:55.440> kind<00:02:55.680> of<00:02:55.709> a<00:02:55.800> pain<00:02:55.950> in<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.040> neck

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
actually it's kind of a pain in the neck

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.560 
actually it's kind of a pain in the neck
because<00:02:56.489> if<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:56.730> do<00:02:56.880> batch<00:02:57.060> this<00:02:57.239> pretty<00:02:57.450> hard

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
because if you do batch this pretty hard

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.120 
because if you do batch this pretty hard
you<00:02:57.750> slide<00:02:58.050> out<00:02:58.080> and<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:58.500> have<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.800> make<00:02:58.980> sure

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
you slide out and you have to make sure

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.430 
you slide out and you have to make sure
that<00:02:59.220> they're<00:02:59.400> always<00:02:59.520> in<00:02:59.900> but<00:03:00.900> that's<00:03:01.260> only

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
that they're always in but that's only

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.110 
that they're always in but that's only
really<00:03:01.800> happened<00:03:02.220> after<00:03:02.430> some<00:03:02.640> some<00:03:02.970> mega

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
really happened after some some mega

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.199 
really happened after some some mega
jumps<00:03:03.540> that<00:03:03.600> I<00:03:03.720> took<00:03:03.780> so<00:03:04.340> yeah<00:03:05.340> for<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.090> most

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
jumps that I took so yeah for the most

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.370 
jumps that I took so yeah for the most
part<00:03:06.420> it's<00:03:06.510> pretty<00:03:06.540> cool<00:03:06.870> what<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.080> mistakes

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
part it's pretty cool what the mistakes

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.990 
part it's pretty cool what the mistakes
I<00:03:07.530> made<00:03:07.739> at<00:03:07.860> first<00:03:08.040> as<00:03:08.190> I<00:03:08.280> tried<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.580> cinch<00:03:08.820> all

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
I made at first as I tried to cinch all

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.440 
I made at first as I tried to cinch all
these<00:03:09.180> wires<00:03:09.510> up<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.350> that<00:03:11.250> actually<00:03:11.700> created

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
these wires up and that actually created

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.120 
these wires up and that actually created
more<00:03:12.480> stress<00:03:13.050> on<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.350> plugs<00:03:13.770> and<00:03:13.920> I<00:03:14.010> was

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
more stress on the plugs and I was

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.280 
more stress on the plugs and I was
popping<00:03:14.310> my<00:03:14.550> sensor<00:03:14.910> wire<00:03:15.060> popping<00:03:16.020> some<00:03:16.200> of

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
popping my sensor wire popping some of

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.420 
popping my sensor wire popping some of
these<00:03:16.380> up<00:03:16.590> so<00:03:16.709> I<00:03:16.739> just<00:03:16.950> kind<00:03:17.130> of<00:03:17.160> left<00:03:17.310> them

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
these up so I just kind of left them

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.670 
these up so I just kind of left them
free<00:03:17.760> in<00:03:17.850> here<00:03:18.000> now<00:03:18.120> this<00:03:19.020> is<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.350> only<00:03:19.530> way<00:03:19.650> I

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
free in here now this is the only way I

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.410 
free in here now this is the only way I
could<00:03:19.799> really<00:03:19.980> mount<00:03:20.310> it<00:03:20.459> to<00:03:20.610> get<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.120> body<00:03:21.299> on

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
could really mount it to get the body on

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.180 
could really mount it to get the body on
so<00:03:21.840> all<00:03:22.019> these<00:03:22.170> cables<00:03:22.380> would<00:03:22.709> kind<00:03:22.890> of<00:03:22.950> be<00:03:23.070> in

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
so all these cables would kind of be in

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.920 
so all these cables would kind of be in
the<00:03:23.220> center<00:03:23.610> it<00:03:24.000> does<00:03:24.180> hang<00:03:24.450> out<00:03:24.570> a<00:03:24.630> little<00:03:24.810> bit

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
the center it does hang out a little bit

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.930 
the center it does hang out a little bit
here<00:03:25.170> in<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.350> back<00:03:25.500> corner<00:03:25.830> but<00:03:26.459> for<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.820> most

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
here in the back corner but for the most

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.180 
here in the back corner but for the most
part<00:03:27.060> it<00:03:27.299> it<00:03:27.510> sits<00:03:27.810> stays<00:03:28.080> put<00:03:28.350> and<00:03:28.860> it<00:03:29.010> works

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
part it it sits stays put and it works

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.789 
part it it sits stays put and it works

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
a little pinion gear here and you get

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.500 
a little pinion gear here and you get
you<00:03:35.310> do<00:03:35.430> get<00:03:35.580> a<00:03:35.610> servo<00:03:35.850> horn<00:03:36.030> I<00:03:36.150> don't<00:03:36.330> know<00:03:36.390> if

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
you do get a servo horn I don't know if

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.199 
you do get a servo horn I don't know if
that<00:03:36.690> was<00:03:36.870> common<00:03:37.440> in<00:03:37.560> previous<00:03:38.130> models<00:03:38.519> but

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
that was common in previous models but

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.330 
that was common in previous models but
it<00:03:39.480> did<00:03:39.660> come<00:03:39.780> with<00:03:39.840> a<00:03:39.959> servo<00:03:40.260> horn<00:03:40.440> yeah<00:03:41.310> I

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
it did come with a servo horn yeah I

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.110 
it did come with a servo horn yeah I
went<00:03:41.549> with<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:41.959> high<00:03:42.959> tech<00:03:43.230> 7<00:03:43.440> 955<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.880> a<00:03:44.940> team

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
went with the high tech 7 955 to a team

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.360 
went with the high tech 7 955 to a team
here<00:03:45.450> servo<00:03:45.959> which<00:03:46.079> is<00:03:46.200> great<00:03:46.530> and<00:03:46.769> I've<00:03:47.250> eaten

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
here servo which is great and I've eaten

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.370 
here servo which is great and I've eaten
a<00:03:47.519> crap<00:03:47.760> out<00:03:47.970> of<00:03:48.000> it<00:03:48.120> now<00:03:48.690> one<00:03:48.959> thing<00:03:49.110> I<00:03:49.200> want<00:03:49.230> to

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
a crap out of it now one thing I want to

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.660 
a crap out of it now one thing I want to
talk<00:03:49.500> about<00:03:49.910> when<00:03:50.910> I<00:03:50.940> got<00:03:51.239> this<00:03:51.510> RC<00:03:52.340> it<00:03:53.340> really

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
talk about when I got this RC it really

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.460 
talk about when I got this RC it really
blew<00:03:53.850> my<00:03:54.000> mind<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.660> know<00:03:54.750> if<00:03:54.930> I<00:03:55.019> was<00:03:55.170> to<00:03:55.260> do<00:03:55.380> an

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
blew my mind you know if I was to do an

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.660 
blew my mind you know if I was to do an
unboxing<00:03:55.680> of<00:03:56.040> anything<00:03:56.340> I<00:03:56.430> should<00:03:56.579> have

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
unboxing of anything I should have

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.130 
unboxing of anything I should have
probably<00:03:56.820> done<00:03:57.060> around<00:03:57.329> this<00:03:57.450> RC<00:03:57.840> because

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
probably done around this RC because

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.890 
probably done around this RC because
this<00:03:58.650> is<00:03:58.829> just<00:03:59.070> overall<00:03:59.610> a<00:03:59.880> very<00:04:00.120> robust<00:04:00.780> very

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
this is just overall a very robust very

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.920 
this is just overall a very robust very
nice<00:04:01.260> looking<00:04:01.650> car<00:04:01.950> and<00:04:02.450> nice<00:04:03.450> looking<00:04:03.630> buggy

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
nice looking car and nice looking buggy

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.140 
nice looking car and nice looking buggy
but<00:04:04.920> one<00:04:05.220> of<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.430> things<00:04:05.640> that<00:04:05.760> was<00:04:05.880> an<00:04:06.000> issue

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
but one of the things that was an issue

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.750 
but one of the things that was an issue
is<00:04:06.450> right<00:04:06.630> here<00:04:07.049> this<00:04:07.739> little<00:04:07.980> link<00:04:08.340> when<00:04:08.730> I

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
is right here this little link when I

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.850 
is right here this little link when I
when<00:04:09.030> I<00:04:09.060> screwed<00:04:09.480> the<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:10.049> Bolton<00:04:10.680> through

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
when I screwed the the Bolton through

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:11.509 
when I screwed the the Bolton through
the<00:04:10.950> bottom

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
the bottom

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.940 
the bottom
I<00:04:11.570> sold<00:04:12.570> some<00:04:12.660> shavings<00:04:13.470> came<00:04:13.680> out<00:04:13.799> and<00:04:13.890> they

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
I sold some shavings came out and they

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.650 
I sold some shavings came out and they
were<00:04:14.010> actually<00:04:14.190> rust<00:04:14.579> colored<00:04:14.940> and<00:04:15.450> it<00:04:15.570> was

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
were actually rust colored and it was

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.569 
were actually rust colored and it was
completely<00:04:16.140> stripped<00:04:16.320> in<00:04:16.590> it<00:04:16.739> for<00:04:17.400> some

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
completely stripped in it for some

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.330 
completely stripped in it for some
reason<00:04:17.910> when<00:04:18.120> it<00:04:18.180> came<00:04:18.359> to<00:04:18.570> me<00:04:18.690> this<00:04:19.350> little

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
reason when it came to me this little

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.730 
reason when it came to me this little
guy<00:04:20.459> here<00:04:20.760> this<00:04:20.940> little<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:22.049> eyelet<00:04:22.440> on<00:04:22.530> this

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
guy here this little the eyelet on this

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.680 
guy here this little the eyelet on this
this<00:04:23.010> link<00:04:23.280> here<00:04:23.520> was<00:04:23.789> actually<00:04:24.060> kind<00:04:24.660> of

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
this link here was actually kind of

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.800 
this link here was actually kind of
corroded

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
corroded

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.030 
corroded
and<00:04:25.960> it<00:04:26.139> stripped<00:04:26.410> out<00:04:26.560> right<00:04:26.740> away<00:04:26.830> so<00:04:27.010> I

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
and it stripped out right away so I

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.980 
and it stripped out right away so I
threw<00:04:27.310> both<00:04:27.550> of<00:04:27.730> it<00:04:27.880> right<00:04:28.630> here<00:04:28.810> with<00:04:28.930> a

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
threw both of it right here with a

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.770 
threw both of it right here with a
little<00:04:29.200> nut<00:04:29.380> so<00:04:29.950> I<00:04:29.980> had<00:04:30.160> to<00:04:30.220> do<00:04:30.340> that<00:04:30.750> not<00:04:31.750> a

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
little nut so I had to do that not a

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.690 
little nut so I had to do that not a
huge<00:04:32.110> deal<00:04:32.290> not<00:04:32.560> a<00:04:32.620> big<00:04:32.889> deal<00:04:33.100> and<00:04:33.280> I<00:04:33.370> think<00:04:33.610> the

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
huge deal not a big deal and I think the

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.400 
huge deal not a big deal and I think the
server<00:04:33.940> saving<00:04:34.480> function<00:04:34.870> isn't<00:04:35.020> going<00:04:35.260> to<00:04:35.320> be

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
server saving function isn't going to be

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.200 
server saving function isn't going to be
affected<00:04:35.919> by<00:04:36.040> this<00:04:36.100> little<00:04:36.639> through<00:04:36.850> boat<00:04:37.030> but

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
affected by this little through boat but

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.370 
affected by this little through boat but
now<00:04:37.330> it<00:04:37.450> doesn't<00:04:37.630> have<00:04:37.810> I<00:04:38.020> don't<00:04:38.110> have<00:04:38.230> an

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
now it doesn't have I don't have an

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.280 
now it doesn't have I don't have an
issue<00:04:38.530> with<00:04:38.740> it<00:04:39.600> another<00:04:40.600> thing<00:04:40.780> that<00:04:40.840> I<00:04:41.080> broke

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
issue with it another thing that I broke

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.320 
issue with it another thing that I broke
and<00:04:41.710> this<00:04:41.830> was<00:04:42.010> partially<00:04:42.490> my<00:04:42.639> fault<00:04:42.669> was<00:04:43.090> a

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
and this was partially my fault was a

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.030 
and this was partially my fault was a
crack<00:04:43.720> that<00:04:43.930> the<00:04:44.139> battery<00:04:44.470> case<00:04:44.740> here<00:04:45.010> a

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
crack that the battery case here a

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.950 
crack that the battery case here a
little<00:04:45.310> bit<00:04:45.490> but<00:04:46.090> when<00:04:46.270> I<00:04:46.300> first<00:04:46.600> put<00:04:46.840> my

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
little bit but when I first put my

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.570 
little bit but when I first put my
battery<00:04:47.380> and<00:04:47.500> I<00:04:47.560> tried<00:04:47.830> to<00:04:47.919> cinch<00:04:48.190> all<00:04:48.400> these

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
battery and I tried to cinch all these

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.250 
battery and I tried to cinch all these
cables<00:04:49.030> in<00:04:49.180> here<00:04:49.389> with<00:04:49.570> the<00:04:49.690> battery<00:04:50.020> and<00:04:50.169> it

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
cables in here with the battery and it

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.520 
cables in here with the battery and it
created<00:04:50.770> a<00:04:50.800> ooh<00:04:51.570> it<00:04:52.570> wasn't<00:04:53.080> a<00:04:53.110> very<00:04:53.200> tight

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
created a ooh it wasn't a very tight

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.440 
created a ooh it wasn't a very tight
environment<00:04:53.830> for<00:04:54.400> the<00:04:54.490> battery<00:04:54.850> so<00:04:55.330> the

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
environment for the battery so the

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:56.670 
environment for the battery so the
battery<00:04:55.720> actually<00:04:55.990> came<00:04:56.139> out<00:04:56.290> the<00:04:56.410> battery

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
battery actually came out the battery

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.740 
battery actually came out the battery
shell<00:04:57.220> crack<00:04:57.550> now<00:04:57.790> before<00:04:58.390> you<00:04:58.630> know

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
shell crack now before you know

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.630 
shell crack now before you know
everybody<00:04:59.140> writes<00:04:59.770> in<00:04:59.950> and<00:05:00.100> tells<00:05:00.400> me<00:05:00.520> how

everybody writes in and tells me how

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.310 
everybody writes in and tells me how
dangerous<00:05:01.030> that<00:05:01.180> is<00:05:01.240> it's<00:05:01.510> not<00:05:01.660> that<00:05:01.870> bad<00:05:02.110> and

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
dangerous that is it's not that bad and

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.750 
dangerous that is it's not that bad and
I<00:05:02.380> duct-taped<00:05:02.620> it<00:05:02.950> but<00:05:03.100> that's<00:05:03.250> one<00:05:03.610> of<00:05:03.700> the

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
I duct-taped it but that's one of the

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.040 
I duct-taped it but that's one of the
reasons<00:05:04.030> I'm<00:05:04.120> not<00:05:04.150> showing<00:05:04.450> the<00:05:04.570> battery<00:05:04.930> of

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
reasons I'm not showing the battery of

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.590 
reasons I'm not showing the battery of
this<00:05:05.140> video<00:05:05.700> but<00:05:06.700> I<00:05:06.760> do<00:05:06.820> have<00:05:07.030> it<00:05:07.120> put<00:05:07.300> back<00:05:07.450> the

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
this video but I do have it put back the

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.000 
this video but I do have it put back the
other<00:05:07.750> it's<00:05:07.900> working<00:05:08.230> fine<00:05:08.410> I've<00:05:08.620> used<00:05:08.830> it

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
other it's working fine I've used it

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.040 
other it's working fine I've used it
many<00:05:09.160> times<00:05:09.490> now<00:05:09.730> so<00:05:10.390> that's<00:05:10.660> not<00:05:10.840> an<00:05:10.930> issue

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
many times now so that's not an issue

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.140 
many times now so that's not an issue
but<00:05:11.320> as<00:05:11.560> it<00:05:11.770> hasn't<00:05:12.040> slid<00:05:12.490> around<00:05:12.790> in<00:05:12.910> here<00:05:13.060> it

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
but as it hasn't slid around in here it

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.670 
but as it hasn't slid around in here it
also<00:05:13.240> busted<00:05:13.750> the<00:05:13.840> battery<00:05:14.140> tray<00:05:14.320> so<00:05:14.530> that's

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
also busted the battery tray so that's

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.880 
also busted the battery tray so that's
not<00:05:14.830> a<00:05:14.890> really<00:05:15.160> expensive<00:05:15.370> upgrade<00:05:16.890> another

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
not a really expensive upgrade another

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.290 
not a really expensive upgrade another
thing<00:05:18.100> I<00:05:18.160> had<00:05:18.280> to<00:05:18.310> replace<00:05:18.550> I'd<00:05:18.790> replace<00:05:19.090> one

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
thing I had to replace I'd replace one

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.330 
thing I had to replace I'd replace one
of<00:05:19.390> these<00:05:19.479> one<00:05:19.660> of<00:05:19.690> these<00:05:19.840> poor<00:05:20.169> and<00:05:20.860> I<00:05:20.950> saw<00:05:21.190> on

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
of these one of these poor and I saw on

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.030 
of these one of these poor and I saw on
other<00:05:21.580> other<00:05:22.419> buggies<00:05:22.900> and<00:05:22.930> other<00:05:23.410> kits<00:05:23.770> that

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
other other buggies and other kits that

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.650 
other other buggies and other kits that
they<00:05:24.250> actually<00:05:24.430> have<00:05:24.700> a<00:05:24.729> third<00:05:25.150> strap<00:05:25.479> that

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
they actually have a third strap that

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.030 
they actually have a third strap that
goes<00:05:25.720> along<00:05:26.169> this<00:05:26.350> way<00:05:26.530> and<00:05:26.770> I<00:05:26.800> think<00:05:26.830> that

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040 
goes along this way and I think that

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
goes along this way and I think that
would<00:05:27.280> be<00:05:27.370> kind<00:05:27.580> of<00:05:27.639> cool

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
would be kind of cool

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.640 
would be kind of cool
Mugen<00:05:28.720> doesn't<00:05:28.990> offer<00:05:29.110> anything<00:05:29.410> like<00:05:29.620> that

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
Mugen doesn't offer anything like that

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.650 
Mugen doesn't offer anything like that
but<00:05:30.340> that<00:05:30.490> might<00:05:30.640> be<00:05:30.669> kind<00:05:31.000> of<00:05:31.090> a<00:05:31.150> cool<00:05:31.330> mod<00:05:31.510> in

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
but that might be kind of a cool mod in

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.000 
but that might be kind of a cool mod in
the<00:05:31.720> future<00:05:32.020> to<00:05:32.140> have<00:05:32.229> a<00:05:32.290> strap<00:05:32.590> going<00:05:32.800> this

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
the future to have a strap going this

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.200 
the future to have a strap going this
way<00:05:33.160> because<00:05:33.340> that's<00:05:33.550> how<00:05:33.790> the<00:05:33.850> battery

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
way because that's how the battery

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.260 
way because that's how the battery
shifts<00:05:34.630> front<00:05:34.840> the<00:05:34.960> back<00:05:35.550> so<00:05:36.550> yeah<00:05:36.790> I<00:05:36.850> busted<00:05:37.180> a

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
shifts front the back so yeah I busted a

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.090 
shifts front the back so yeah I busted a
battery<00:05:37.540> strap<00:05:37.720> the<00:05:37.930> battery<00:05:38.200> tray<00:05:38.440> have

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
battery strap the battery tray have

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.560 
battery strap the battery tray have
busted<00:05:39.250> my<00:05:39.520> battery<00:05:39.930> and<00:05:41.729> this<00:05:42.729> some<00:05:43.240> some<00:05:43.479> of

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
busted my battery and this some some of

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.029 
busted my battery and this some some of
the<00:05:43.630> screws<00:05:43.870> do<00:05:44.050> back<00:05:44.229> out<00:05:44.470> after<00:05:44.770> a<00:05:44.800> lot<00:05:45.010> of

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 
the screws do back out after a lot of

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:47.550 
the screws do back out after a lot of

gets it well not completely
indestructible<00:06:07.180> but<00:06:07.600> it<00:06:07.720> is<00:06:07.840> definitely<00:06:08.020> very

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:08.289 
indestructible but it is definitely very

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:14.529

now<00:06:24.810> I<00:06:24.840> have<00:06:25.020> two<00:06:25.169> models<00:06:25.380> programmed<00:06:26.009> in

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 
now I have two models programmed in

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.400 
now I have two models programmed in
there<00:06:26.599> other<00:06:27.599> than<00:06:27.630> that<00:06:27.870> yeah<00:06:27.990> the<00:06:28.080> proline

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410 
there other than that yeah the proline

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:29.930 
there other than that yeah the proline
calibers<00:06:28.860> that's<00:06:29.099> kind<00:06:29.280> of<00:06:29.370> that's<00:06:29.639> kind<00:06:29.729> of<00:06:29.849> a

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 
calibers that's kind of that's kind of a

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.510 
calibers that's kind of that's kind of a
standard<00:06:30.150> for<00:06:30.539> me<00:06:30.630> now<00:06:30.780> this<00:06:31.770> this<00:06:32.039> buggy<00:06:32.400> is

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 
standard for me now this this buggy is

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.760 
standard for me now this this buggy is
way<00:06:32.699> too<00:06:32.759> big<00:06:33.030> for<00:06:33.060> my<00:06:33.270> track<00:06:33.539> but<00:06:34.319> these<00:06:34.590> are

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:34.770 
way too big for my track but these are

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.640 
way too big for my track but these are
good<00:06:34.949> tires<00:06:35.160> for<00:06:35.490> the<00:06:35.520> are<00:06:35.849> the<00:06:36.300> street<00:06:36.650> and
