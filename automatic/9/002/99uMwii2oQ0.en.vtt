 Very good, welcome to cooking step by step, today we are going to prepare lentil stew, 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:37.620
 and these are the ingredients that we're going to need, in this case I'm going to use lentils from 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.390
 type pardina that are a few lentils a little smaller, and the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:51.280
 is to put the lentils in soaking for 3 to 5 hours, in case we do not have time to put 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:01:02.680
 Soaking lentils we are going to use them directly and we are going to have to cook them a little more, 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:36.909
 let's cut the onion and the pepper in cubes 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:44.090
 and in a saucepan with a little olive oil we are going to fry some cut garlic 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:59.229
 in sheets, for this recipe with 1 or 2 cloves of garlic it will be fine, add the pepper, 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:39.220
 the onion, and we are going to add the chopped pork, when the meat starts to take 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:03:24.060
 color we are going to add the lentils with the water and we will cut the potatoes in quarters and 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:58.090
 the carrot in slices, we incorporate it to the rest of the ingredients and we put salt and 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:23.620
 pepper to taste, add the bay leaves and let cook for 30 to 45 minutes 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:37.520
 approximately, we can also add a little bit of paprika to give a little more flavor, 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:51.540
 and we have our lentil stew ready, a greeting and until the next video.
