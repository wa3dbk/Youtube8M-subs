why<00:00:18.480> did<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:18.750> take<00:00:18.869> 20<00:00:19.199> days<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.380> find<00:00:19.770> them<00:00:19.949> if

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
why did it take 20 days to find them if

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.130 
why did it take 20 days to find them if
they<00:00:20.220> had<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.520> radar<00:00:20.880> track<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.510> they<00:00:21.930> knew

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
they had the radar track and they knew

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.140 
they had the radar track and they knew
approximately<00:00:22.529> where<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.220> mountain<00:00:23.609> was<00:00:23.820> why

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
approximately where the mountain was why

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.300 
approximately where the mountain was why
did<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.449> take<00:00:24.600> so<00:00:24.660> long<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:25.170> find<00:00:25.410> them<00:00:25.590> and

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
did it take so long to find them and

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.570 
did it take so long to find them and
when<00:00:26.550> they<00:00:26.580> did<00:00:26.910> find<00:00:27.269> them<00:00:27.510> they<00:00:28.230> say<00:00:28.500> that

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
when they did find them they say that

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.220 
when they did find them they say that
that<00:00:29.580> they<00:00:29.699> were<00:00:29.760> going<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.179> do<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.599> DNA<00:00:31.050> test

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
that they were going to do a DNA test

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.530 
that they were going to do a DNA test
and<00:00:31.710> they<00:00:31.830> would<00:00:31.980> have<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.399> DNA<00:00:32.790> testing<00:00:33.360> two

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
and they would have that DNA testing two

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.860 
and they would have that DNA testing two
or<00:00:33.660> three<00:00:33.870> days<00:00:34.020> how<00:00:34.739> do<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:34.920> bro<00:00:35.370> at<00:00:35.760> DNA<00:00:36.690> in

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
or three days how do you bro at DNA in

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.049 
or three days how do you bro at DNA in
two<00:00:37.110> days<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.680> compare<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.219> other<00:00:38.340> DNA<00:00:38.910> it

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
two days and compare it to other DNA it

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.000 
two days and compare it to other DNA it
can't<00:00:39.300> be<00:00:39.420> done<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.930> don't<00:00:40.469> even<00:00:40.649> think<00:00:40.739> we<00:00:40.860> can

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
can't be done I don't even think we can

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.350 
can't be done I don't even think we can
do<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.129> today<00:00:41.370> they<00:00:41.610> certainly<00:00:41.910> couldn't<00:00:42.180> do

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
do it today they certainly couldn't do

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.080 
do it today they certainly couldn't do
it<00:00:42.480> in<00:00:42.590> 1997<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.160> why<00:00:44.340> were<00:00:44.489> they<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:44.640> sure<00:00:45.059> that

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
it in 1997 so why were they so sure that

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.950 
it in 1997 so why were they so sure that
that<00:00:45.300> was<00:00:45.480> kept<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:45.840> Craig<00:00:46.079> buttons<00:00:46.410> body<00:00:47.960> none

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
that was kept in Craig buttons body none

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.700 
that was kept in Craig buttons body none
of<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.170> makes<00:00:49.230> any<00:00:49.559> sense<00:00:49.680> none<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:54.710> if

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
of this makes any sense none of it if

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.069 
of this makes any sense none of it if
the<00:00:56.520> plane<00:00:56.760> was<00:00:57.090> track<00:00:57.480> going<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.020> straight

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
the plane was track going in a straight

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.830 
the plane was track going in a straight
line<00:00:58.760> although<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.059> government<00:01:00.180> says<00:01:00.660> that

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
line although the government says that

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.560 
line although the government says that
was<00:01:00.960> being<00:01:01.170> manually<00:01:01.620> flown<00:01:01.920> then<00:01:02.730> then<00:01:03.210> then

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
was being manually flown then then then

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.660 
was being manually flown then then then
what<00:01:04.199> did<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.409> indicate<00:01:04.650> if<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.040> was<00:01:05.129> flying<00:01:05.489> in

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
what did it indicate if it was flying in

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.000 
what did it indicate if it was flying in
a<00:01:05.760> beeline<00:01:06.270> for<00:01:06.330> New<00:01:06.720> York<00:01:06.960> mountain<00:01:07.409> that

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
a beeline for New York mountain that

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.320 
a beeline for New York mountain that
that<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.030> was<00:01:09.299> on<00:01:09.659> autopilot<00:01:10.850> okay<00:01:11.850> and

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
that that it was on autopilot okay and

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.789 
that that it was on autopilot okay and
what<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.840> do<00:01:12.990> when<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.229> get<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.530> one<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.680> these

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
what you do when you get in one of these

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.499 
what you do when you get in one of these
planes<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.460> set<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.729> dial<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.180> direction

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
planes is you set a dial a direction

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.179 
planes is you set a dial a direction
finder<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.229> push<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.710> coordinates

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
finder and you push in the coordinates

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.350 
finder and you push in the coordinates
where<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.430> want<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.700> go<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.180> hit<00:01:18.330> a

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
where you want to go and you hit a

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.870 
where you want to go and you hit a
button<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.750> plane<00:01:19.110> will<00:01:19.290> take<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.619> there

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
button that plane will take you there

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.420 
button that plane will take you there
straight<00:01:20.880> right<00:01:21.360> on<00:01:21.890> one<00:01:22.890> interesting<00:01:23.400> thing

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
straight right on one interesting thing

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.039 
straight right on one interesting thing
to<00:01:23.640> note<00:01:24.020> want<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.080> go<00:01:25.170> back<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:25.590> map<00:01:25.830> here

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
to note want to go back to this map here

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.450 
to note want to go back to this map here
which<00:01:28.049> gets<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.650> whole<00:01:28.829> idea<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.189> whether

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
which gets to the whole idea of whether

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.649 
which gets to the whole idea of whether
or<00:01:29.549> not<00:01:29.670> he<00:01:29.939> was<00:01:30.060> actually<00:01:32.150> flying<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.329> plane

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
or not he was actually flying the plane

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.200 
or not he was actually flying the plane
is<00:01:34.520> a<00:01:35.520> course<00:01:36.000> correction<00:01:36.240> which<00:01:36.780> occurred

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
is a course correction which occurred

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.819 
is a course correction which occurred
right<00:01:39.210> here<00:01:40.880> okay<00:01:41.880> now<00:01:42.750> one<00:01:43.470> thing<00:01:43.500> about

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
right here okay now one thing about

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.830 
right here okay now one thing about
remote-controlled<00:01:44.549> aircraft<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:45.270> if<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.630> it

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
remote-controlled aircraft is if you it

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.420 
remote-controlled aircraft is if you it
is<00:01:45.990> being<00:01:46.229> remote<00:01:46.560> controlled<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:47.070> got<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.250> guy

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
is being remote controlled you got a guy

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.920 
is being remote controlled you got a guy
