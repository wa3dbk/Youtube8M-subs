00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 Welcome to a new guide 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.529
 to be different online here at the games 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.440
 for you i am so evo and it acts 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.320
 this to be the first treasure tonight in 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.179
 The stone, however, is really about 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.490
 I could show the aspects close by 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.460
 it also on the map again 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.380
 exactly where I am now 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:27.810
 the blue dot is on the map 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.859
 yes, we'll give it a try 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.599
 or 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.059
 I'll show you where she is because I already 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.140
 knows exactly where to look here 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:40.079
 exactly the point where we start from the 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.550
 mep and go straight through it now 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.460
 take a little while till we get there 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.739
 arrive there too 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.539
 we now have the stairs to the right 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.940
 seen to bypass left where 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.840
 Now walk past it that from 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.399
 what we saw on the map and 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.070
 the front that is already the tree you 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.109
 on the map could see where the arrow 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.660
 We had to show now 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.250
 However, left of the tree on the left 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.840
 further up 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.830
 I have to hide a bit 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:16.650
 if synonymous say quite a while 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.790
 searched for it really cool there is 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.580
 I have not seen it yet 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.470
 also the video so far a bit 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.689
 hiding behind a small tree and 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.700
 while behind these and two are 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.920
 always hiding behind such bad hills 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.520
 shows exactly the exact point again 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.880
 on the i 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.520
 there we are there we have to go too 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.680
 it is exactly here that we should place it 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.189
 of course, the mud out here and 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.729
 pick up 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:45.829
 they almost forbid them to do the crate 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.740
 up and thus have the first 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:52.229
 sweetheart card completed 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:56.159
 Nevertheless, you got the sword here 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:59.159
 two dealers and the halls fragment 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.670
 stone rest I have, I think so 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.670
 found 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.870
 we can just look again if we 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.810
 still have the card in 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:13.590
 if day was like at different with 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.300
 glasses exactly she is not there anymore us 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.510
 I still have the second map on it 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.410
 I am going to go now 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.330
 I have found it to you, of course, 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.260
 again a video about it I am once 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.180
 for seeing 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.930
 I hope I could help you and see you 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.930
