something to light sabers even take that

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.630 
something to light sabers even take that
but<00:02:27.450> other<00:02:27.570> than<00:02:27.780> that<00:02:28.010> no<00:02:29.010> issues<00:02:29.370> with<00:02:29.549> the

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
platforming gameplay at all you can do

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.680 
platforming gameplay at all you can do
double<00:02:31.440> jumps<00:02:31.769> it's<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.280> lot<00:02:32.519> Metroid<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.239> all

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
double jumps it's a lot Metroid and all

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.420 
double jumps it's a lot Metroid and all
different<00:02:33.930> characters<00:02:34.530> have<00:02:34.769> just<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.250> right

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
different characters have just the right

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.370 
different characters have just the right
sense<00:02:35.730> of<00:02:35.880> weight<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.540> momentum<00:02:36.660> in<00:02:37.290> their

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
sense of weight and momentum in their

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.039 
sense of weight and momentum in their
platforming<00:02:38.100> so<00:02:38.519> these<00:02:38.760> parts<00:02:39.180> definitely

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
platforming so these parts definitely

00:02:40.049 --> 00:03:04.390 
platforming so these parts definitely
play<00:02:40.260> well

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.400
