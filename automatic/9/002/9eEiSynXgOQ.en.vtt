 a gel in this and I love it because it 

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:42.120
 I apply bengasi on my hair and I 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.699
 helps them to stay that way in their mild 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.409

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.289

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.570
 halloween makeups that state 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.369
 doing usually good almost 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.130
 I always believe in all the videos I've 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.630
 used this background makeup and also 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.159
 I'm running out but I 'm going to have 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.530
 than buying another one and if it would buy another 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.320
 time because I love I love how 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.100
 it is applied as in cream use my 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.960
 brush to blur it very well and if I 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.409
 love doing that if it lasts all the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.090
 day 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.800
 as I was saying this is the meter that the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.840
 only background makeup that used this 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.220
 month is for knit makeup 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.049
 day to day that is the only one that is 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.700
 using I have it here on the desk and 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.740
 I have not caught another where I have my 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.810
 organizer where I have my makeup not 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.369
 is using another one than this other 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.049
 product that you have been trying are 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.119
 these wipes and again compress 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.789
 little stars to remove makeup 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.799
 These are my favorites and I tried other 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.720
 those of carrot but not really 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.580
 I liked them so much because I felt like 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.799
 I fell that my face was leaving me 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.259
 like red it did not feel like it burned me 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.150
 they do not do me a bit and that's why 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.530
 have been my favorites are 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.450
 I left to use because it was using 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.700
 the baby wipes that I also 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.480
 they like they are very economic but again 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.090
 I bought these are favorite this video 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.040
 I think it's going to be favorites of the month of 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.490
 October but more I've almost focused 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.410
 as in halloween not halloween but the 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.020
 products I used after I 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.670
 I remove the halloween makeup because 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.850
 another product that has been my favorite is 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.800
 this is one to remove the makeup a 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.870
 make-up remover that says it takes away the 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.180
 Makeup cleans and moisturizes the 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.990
 skin and if I use it this is like in 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.340
 cream 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.140
 You can use a wipe to remove 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.330
 makeup after I continue with my routine 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.010
 for facial care that uses a cleanser 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.010
 in a toner a moisturizer 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.200
 all that if you would be interested to see the video 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.390
 of how I take care of myself and karaoke or products 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.070
 I use this video for cleaning 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.720
 I leave in the information box but if 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.860
 This has been my favorite product because 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.920
 whenever I remove the makeup 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.690
 fast and easy another product that has been 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.430
 my favorite and others again is a 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.560
 product that is used a lot for 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.710
 makeovers milestone and why is this 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.580
 palette 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:14.740
 the shadow are matte and I love them because 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.990
 It has a lot of variety of colors 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.840
 shadows and if you apply a prime in the 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.830
 shadows highlights very well and if it's wrong 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.840
 in action my favorite 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.550
 In addition it is also very economical 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.160
 you can find in the jarque shop 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.950
 You can also buy several stores 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.320
 find this online I bought it 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.500
 by internet that in case you had a 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.600
 little broken but it has served me and 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.640
 has liked health for a long time I think 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.070
 I'm going to need another one because 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.530
 calls ending the shadows are 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.880
 reaching to the bottom and as a last 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.470
 product that you have been using me 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.900
 quite a while I'm using a 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.700
 maybelline eyeliner but this is not 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.620
 stepped this transitions delineator 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.740
 formula I like this because they have three 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.420
 comes a black coffee and blue color and has 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:02.080
 been my favorite because it is very creamy 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.060
 applies very well lasts a lot and is black 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.380
 I've been a worm a lot again 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.970
 for halloween makeup but 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.940
 I was also using it to make myself a 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.250
 delineated and is super good I love 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.860
 for makeup everyday also 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.350
 the blue is a very nice color the coffee 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.359
 used but if it is in good quality 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.940
 I feel that if they work well for me 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.910
 they last a lot and I think we have to have 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.490
 buy another one because I'm already 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.050
 finishing and those have been my favorites 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.970
 of the month of October as I said no 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.220
 I was wearing a lot of other makeup 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.020
 because we are being more make-up 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.850
 for the halloween but as well as 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.590

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.750
 video every Wednesday that today what 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.190
 I'm recording and sorry that if you

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.730

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.200
 several girls do not like it but that's why 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.640
 I have this video for you 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.540
 excuse me again that it is a little 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.670
 Quick 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.380
 but it's going to end only for only 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.600
