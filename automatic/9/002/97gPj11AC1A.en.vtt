00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.960 
because permiten is in Olympic so I
think<00:02:34.320> this<00:02:34.830> is<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.010> very<00:02:35.250> good<00:02:35.459> highlight<00:02:35.790> for

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
think this is a very good highlight for

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.720 
think this is a very good highlight for
other<00:02:36.420> sports<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:36.959> if<00:02:37.620> you<00:02:37.769> compare<00:02:38.190> this<00:02:38.489> big

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
other sports and if you compare this big

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.150 
other sports and if you compare this big
tournament<00:02:38.970> with<00:02:39.540> such<00:02:39.900> smaller<00:02:40.440> european

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
tournament with such smaller european

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.610 
tournament with such smaller european
one<00:02:41.370> is<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.880> important<00:02:42.450> for<00:02:42.510> Asian<00:02:43.019> players<00:02:43.290> to

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
one is it important for Asian players to

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.699 
one is it important for Asian players to
come<00:02:43.860> here<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.459> compete<00:02:44.970> with<00:02:45.209> Europeans<00:02:46.080> now

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
come here and compete with Europeans now
