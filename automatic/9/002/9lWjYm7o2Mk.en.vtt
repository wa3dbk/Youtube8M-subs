00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.600
 the ajax women played last 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.219
 Friday at home against FC Utrecht 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.349
 without the expense was spared 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.970
 for the top match against FC Twente 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.610
 Ed Engelkes' team went looking 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.579
 to the third victory 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:25.060
 corner ajax of the holy mountain at the 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:28.919
 first pole and did not 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.919
 did the referee say the bet 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:36.270
 we achieved what we do through the bar 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.270
 ajax close to the one 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.740
 good action 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.390
 the sacred mountain pulls completely free 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:51.390
 the back 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:01:02.199
 not a dick sailor again completely free 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:07.119
 meters of space he gets the knight 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:11.700
 hogwoning along with lunging is there 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.700
 cross to this must be a will no 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.090
 it's a kaagman 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:28.549
 shot from distance 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.549
 am just right next to the moorrees attempt 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.729
 the musts 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.850
 well done of the must well well 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.009
 put back and kaagman is co 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.759
 200 cat lay 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.759
 pear goal 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.920
 the knight for the line well seen from 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.920
 the referee 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:00.450
 head of a utrecht playful and in between 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.520
 Delleman now wakes up calling all the way 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.580
 with it 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.740
 the 16 van utrecht delleman himself withdraws 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.209
 just not such a joint for the knight 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.850
 from fc utrecht in between 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:15.019
 because by p cylinder head now nothing to it 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.019
 the hand says the referee 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.230
 seems rightly enough of the dick 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.580
 of useful none like lying one more 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.220
 times telleman 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.180
 Well shoot but the knight 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.970
 lunging 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.280
 no, so what a chance for Ajax 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.400
 the final phase of the competition 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.430
 first here whether or not a penalty 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.480
 mixer land presumably goes to 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.850
 the ground 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.940
 hogedijk the knight lay back from this 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.690
 lunking state shoots again 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.690
 don't get to do it 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:00.390
 does it succeed what the knight the knight 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.860
 brook brook again twice and afterwards 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.440
 is the final signal 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.480
 and so ajax plays a draw against fc 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.970
 utrecht 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.690
 it will actually be dissatisfied well 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.710
 does it have to 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:16.170
 settle for this 0 0 then live 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.970
 with a result as zero but not zero 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.010
 the way you behave us on 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.140
 the field currently i have been just 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.580
 told you should be deeply ashamed and what you 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.660
 now shows that it makes no sense at all 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.010
 on 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.260
 just a joke in the hand 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.120
 I think we just don't team up 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.890
 the field did not state why it 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.020
 our heads really have absolutely nothing 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.130
 show what was missing tonight 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.020
 all a game 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.510
 now a bit of fun a piece of parsi 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.080
 a bit of enthusiasm and that starts already 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.920
 on me 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.320
 and then you can still do so well 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.030
 play football but if there is not then 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.830
 hold it up and then it is right for you 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.170
 say one point here on one or another 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.820
 way it doesn't come out and I think 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.380
 that every player that is on it even because 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.100
 that has known and just got it 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.050
 know themselves 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.370
 yes i hope this is a good lesson 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.739
 string Tuesday because if we put this in them 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.980
 show little will come of it 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.980
 justly
