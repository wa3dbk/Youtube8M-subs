00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:14.140 

I'll<00:01:05.620> be<00:01:05.800> playing<00:01:06.100> yeah

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.030

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
it's a classic rocket minibox remember

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.450 
it's a classic rocket minibox remember
seeing<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> video<00:01:22.560> with<00:01:22.710> Paul<00:01:22.920> Gilbert<00:01:23.160> and

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
seeing a video with Paul Gilbert and

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.740 
seeing a video with Paul Gilbert and
Paul<00:01:23.640> Gilbert<00:01:23.880> actually<00:01:24.210> uses<00:01:24.360> one<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.660> these

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
Paul Gilbert actually uses one of these

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.410 
Paul Gilbert actually uses one of these
things<00:01:25.020> I'd<00:01:25.200> use<00:01:25.530> done<00:01:25.710> last<00:01:25.890> mr.<00:01:26.220> bit<00:01:26.430> if<00:01:27.240> you

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
things I'd use done last mr. bit if you

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.499 
things I'd use done last mr. bit if you
use<00:01:27.540> all<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.750> these<00:01:27.930> for<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.850> Marshall<00:01:29.850> I'm<00:01:30.450> a

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
use all of these for a Marshall I'm a

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.359 
use all of these for a Marshall I'm a
too<00:01:30.840> much<00:01:31.080> for<00:01:31.350> twelve<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.740> one<00:01:31.830> half<00:01:32.190> on<00:01:32.340> top

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
too much for twelve to one half on top

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.280 
too much for twelve to one half on top
about<00:01:32.700> an<00:01:32.850> hour<00:01:33.000> now<00:01:33.690> you've<00:01:33.840> got<00:01:33.960> two<00:01:34.110> inputs

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
about an hour now you've got two inputs

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.930 
about an hour now you've got two inputs
your<00:01:34.680> while<00:01:34.830> again<00:01:35.070> stirs<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.430> low<00:01:35.580> impedance

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
your while again stirs the low impedance

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.340 
your while again stirs the low impedance
so<00:01:36.270> it's<00:01:36.390> basically<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.900> same<00:01:37.020> thing<00:01:37.080> that

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
so it's basically the same thing that

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:50.950 
so it's basically the same thing that
game<00:01:37.800> quieter<00:01:38.490> that's<00:01:38.670> all

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.720 

they<00:01:51.960> were<00:01:52.260> volume<00:01:52.620> and<00:01:52.770> tone<00:01:52.980> as<00:01:53.250> your<00:01:53.460> entire

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 
they were volume and tone as your entire

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.270 
they were volume and tone as your entire
thing<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.150> through<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.720> toe<00:01:55.070> I'll<00:01:56.070> show<00:01:56.220> you

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
thing is through the toe I'll show you

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.969 
thing is through the toe I'll show you
what<00:01:56.400> it<00:01:56.490> does<00:01:56.520> on<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:57.390> bride<00:01:57.690> channel<00:01:58.080> on<00:01:58.680> the

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
what it does on the bride channel on the

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.190 
what it does on the bride channel on the
normal<00:01:59.310> timings<00:01:59.850> on<00:02:00.030> full<00:02:00.300> whack<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:00.870> you<00:02:00.930> kind

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
normal timings on full whack so you kind

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:15.490 
normal timings on full whack so you kind
of<00:02:01.229> get<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:03.440> this<00:02:04.440> total<00:02:06.260> war<00:02:08.660> half<00:02:10.760> three<00:02:11.760> boys

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.660 

it<00:02:16.500> is<00:02:16.530> basically<00:02:16.890> just<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.250> increasing

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
it is basically just a increasing

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.570 
it is basically just a increasing
trouble<00:02:18.120> Oh

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
trouble Oh

trouble Oh
moving<00:02:20.580> along<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:21.000> channel<00:02:21.270> two<00:02:21.510> which<00:02:21.930> is<00:02:22.050> a

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
moving along to channel two which is a

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.350 
moving along to channel two which is a
lot<00:02:22.260> base<00:02:22.470> here<00:02:22.800> it's<00:02:23.190> like<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.340> place<00:02:23.610> exactly

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
lot base here it's like a place exactly

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.210 
lot base here it's like a place exactly
I<00:02:24.390> can<00:02:24.420> play<00:02:24.660> sense<00:02:24.959> don't<00:02:25.290> like<00:02:25.440> bet<00:02:25.739> it's

I can play sense don't like bet it's

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.440 
I can play sense don't like bet it's
like<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.340> base<00:02:26.580> channel<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.030> normal<00:02:27.300> times

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
like a base channel the normal times

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.760 
like a base channel the normal times
more<00:02:27.600> of<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.810> kind<00:02:27.959> of<00:02:27.989> a<00:02:28.050> base<00:02:28.260> job

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
more of a kind of a base job

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.440 
more of a kind of a base job
everything's<00:02:29.670> will<00:02:29.760> fall<00:02:30.000> where<00:02:30.209> you<00:02:30.239> see

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
what this one sounds like let's do this

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:53.539 
what this one sounds like let's do this
in<00:02:32.220> c-sharp<00:02:33.260> sitting<00:02:34.260> on<00:02:34.320> a<00:02:34.350> power<00:02:34.620> cord

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.630
