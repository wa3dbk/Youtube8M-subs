a whole man there's some I found and so
then<00:00:14.759> you're<00:00:14.940> just<00:00:15.179> gonna<00:00:15.830> measure<00:00:16.830> around

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
then you're just gonna measure around

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.349 
then you're just gonna measure around
your<00:00:17.850> neck<00:00:18.270> with<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.800> string<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.250> find<00:00:20.850> where

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
it and it's in a loop you're gonna just

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.530 
it and it's in a loop you're gonna just
take<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:34.100> put<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.219> through<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.270> hole

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
take that and put it through the hole

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.569 
take that and put it through the hole
out<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.950> other<00:00:38.100> side<00:00:38.809> pull<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:40.100> put<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.340> other

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
out the other side pull it put the other

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.450 
out the other side pull it put the other
side<00:00:41.969> through<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.809> loop<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.800> then<00:00:43.950> just<00:00:44.190> pull

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
side through the loop and then just pull

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.160 
side through the loop and then just pull
it<00:00:45.230> then<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:47.160> cannot<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:48.000> can<00:00:48.360> use<00:00:48.600> beads<00:00:48.930> if
