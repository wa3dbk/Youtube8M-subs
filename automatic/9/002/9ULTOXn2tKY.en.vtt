00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
they make sense to her and she doesn't

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.800

she<00:00:29.589> certainly<00:00:30.009> it's<00:00:30.609> hard<00:00:30.849> to<00:00:30.970> predict<00:00:31.300> what

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
she certainly it's hard to predict what

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.550

she's<00:00:32.380> going<00:00:32.590> to<00:00:32.740> do<00:00:33.630> but<00:00:34.630> if<00:00:35.110> you<00:00:35.350> were<00:00:35.440> inside

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
of her head it all makes sense and when

weren't give away the scene but the

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.669 
weren't give away the scene but the
camera<00:01:57.999> sort<00:01:58.149> of<00:01:58.240> keeps<00:01:58.569> going<00:01:58.780> back<00:01:58.990> to<00:01:59.200> her

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
camera sort of keeps going back to her

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:01.289 
camera sort of keeps going back to her
face<00:01:59.920> as<00:02:00.100> she's<00:02:00.280> observing<00:02:00.520> something<00:02:00.999> which

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
face as she's observing something which

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.149 
face as she's observing something which
struck<00:02:01.780> me<00:02:01.810> as<00:02:01.990> quite<00:02:02.170> sort<00:02:02.380> of<00:02:02.409> feline<00:02:02.859> and<00:02:03.130> I

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
struck me as quite sort of feline and I

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:04.739 
struck me as quite sort of feline and I
wondered<00:02:03.459> if<00:02:03.639> there<00:02:03.939> were<00:02:04.030> any<00:02:04.209> other<00:02:04.299> kind<00:02:04.689> of

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:04.749 
wondered if there were any other kind of

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:06.120 
wondered if there were any other kind of
feline<00:02:05.170> qualities<00:02:05.590> that<00:02:05.709> you<00:02:05.829> try<00:02:06.069> to

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
feline qualities that you try to

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.190 
feline qualities that you try to
incorporate<00:02:06.429> into<00:02:06.789> a<00:02:06.909> character<00:02:07.270> um

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
incorporate into a character um

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.650 
incorporate into a character um
I<00:02:09.259> think<00:02:10.009> because<00:02:10.310> she's<00:02:10.550> never<00:02:10.729> referred<00:02:11.450> to

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
I think because she's never referred to

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.440 
I think because she's never referred to
as<00:02:11.840> Catwoman<00:02:12.530> in<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:13.700> film<00:02:13.940> I<00:02:14.120> didn't<00:02:14.360> feel

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
as Catwoman in the film I didn't feel

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.320 
as Catwoman in the film I didn't feel
any<00:02:14.599> great<00:02:14.780> pressure<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.560> make<00:02:15.830> her

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
any great pressure to make her

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.360 
any great pressure to make her
particularly<00:02:17.330> feline<00:02:18.170> but<00:02:18.440> I<00:02:18.470> what<00:02:18.920> I<00:02:18.950> wanted

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
particularly feline but I what I wanted

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.559 
particularly feline but I what I wanted
it<00:02:19.489> to<00:02:19.519> be<00:02:19.760> was<00:02:19.940> rather<00:02:20.599> than<00:02:20.870> have<00:02:21.080> one

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
it to be was rather than have one

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.059 
it to be was rather than have one
distinct<00:02:23.569> character<00:02:24.050> trait<00:02:24.379> that<00:02:24.680> felt<00:02:24.920> like

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
distinct character trait that felt like

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.070 
distinct character trait that felt like
a<00:02:25.129> cat<00:02:25.400> I<00:02:25.610> wanted<00:02:25.940> her<00:02:26.090> to<00:02:26.120> sort<00:02:26.420> of<00:02:29.080> resemble

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
meant to go in it but once you figure

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.180 
meant to go in it but once you figure
that<00:04:09.410> out<00:04:09.560> it's<00:04:09.769> okay

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970

for this film I didn't know what it was
for<00:04:28.000> I<00:04:28.540> didn't<00:04:29.020> know<00:04:29.080> what<00:04:29.170> the<00:04:29.260> character<00:04:29.710> was

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
for I didn't know what the character was

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.920 
for I didn't know what the character was
I<00:04:30.160> just<00:04:30.310> knew<00:04:30.400> that<00:04:30.550> Chris<00:04:31.000> Nolan<00:04:31.360> had<00:04:31.600> a<00:04:31.630> part

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
I just knew that Chris Nolan had a part

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.440 
I just knew that Chris Nolan had a part
and<00:04:32.230> I<00:04:32.290> was<00:04:32.610> kind<00:04:33.610> of<00:04:33.700> the<00:04:33.790> right<00:04:33.910> age<00:04:34.090> for<00:04:34.120> it

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
and I was kind of the right age for it

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.690 
and I was kind of the right age for it
and<00:04:34.630> that<00:04:34.750> was<00:04:34.960> that<00:04:35.650> got<00:04:35.860> me<00:04:35.980> on<00:04:36.070> a<00:04:36.100> plane<00:04:36.430> and

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
and that was that got me on a plane and

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.860 
and that was that got me on a plane and
I<00:04:36.730> flew<00:04:36.760> across<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:37.210> country<00:04:37.330> and<00:04:37.810> I<00:04:37.840> just

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
I flew across the country and I just

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.430 
I flew across the country and I just
basically<00:04:38.080> sat<00:04:38.470> outside<00:04:38.620> his<00:04:38.860> door<00:04:38.890> waving<00:04:40.440> he

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
basically sat outside his door waving he

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.830 
basically sat outside his door waving he
is<00:04:41.830> such<00:04:44.070> it's<00:04:45.070> hard<00:04:45.370> to<00:04:45.970> talk<00:04:46.390> about<00:04:46.570> him

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
is such it's hard to talk about him

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.300 
is such it's hard to talk about him
because<00:04:47.170> you<00:04:47.440> when<00:04:47.590> you<00:04:47.680> use<00:04:47.890> words<00:04:48.100> like

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
because you when you use words like

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.790 
because you when you use words like
brilliant<00:04:48.700> and<00:04:49.180> important<00:04:49.720> and<00:04:49.990> genius<00:04:50.440> they

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
brilliant and important and genius they

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.500 
brilliant and important and genius they
get<00:04:50.950> bandied<00:04:51.370> about<00:04:51.460> a<00:04:51.610> lot<00:04:51.910> and<00:04:52.120> I<00:04:52.180> think<00:04:52.390> that

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
get bandied about a lot and I think that

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.200 
get bandied about a lot and I think that
they<00:04:52.660> are<00:04:52.810> overused<00:04:53.530> and<00:04:53.770> so<00:04:53.950> in<00:04:54.220> a<00:04:54.310> way<00:04:54.460> and

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
they are overused and so in a way and

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.640 
they are overused and so in a way and
that's<00:04:55.450> a<00:04:55.570> shame<00:04:55.810> because<00:04:55.990> when<00:04:56.290> it<00:04:56.380> comes<00:04:56.470> to

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
that's a shame because when it comes to

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.070 
that's a shame because when it comes to
someone<00:04:56.830> like<00:04:57.010> Chris<00:04:57.280> who<00:04:58.180> earns<00:04:58.420> them<00:04:58.780> and

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
someone like Chris who earns them and

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.900 
someone like Chris who earns them and
and<00:04:59.680> and<00:04:59.860> so<00:05:00.520> much<00:05:00.670> more<00:05:02.190> you<00:05:03.190> feel<00:05:03.460> like<00:05:03.730> they

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
and and so much more you feel like they

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.180 
and and so much more you feel like they
underserve<00:05:04.590> what<00:05:05.590> it<00:05:05.680> is<00:05:05.770> that<00:05:05.950> you're<00:05:06.040> trying

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
underserve what it is that you're trying

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.710 
underserve what it is that you're trying
to<00:05:06.400> say<00:05:06.730> I<00:05:07.560> I<00:05:08.560> think<00:05:09.430> the<00:05:10.360> best<00:05:10.540> way<00:05:10.690> to

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
to say I I think the best way to

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.540
