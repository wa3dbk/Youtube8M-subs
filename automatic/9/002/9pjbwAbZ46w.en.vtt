00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.170 
pumpkin Duke is attacking faster than
theirs<00:04:08.840> without<00:04:09.290> proc<00:04:09.950> stacking<00:04:10.610> so<00:04:11.030> that

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
theirs without proc stacking so that

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.180 
theirs without proc stacking so that
pumpkin<00:04:11.450> Duke<00:04:11.600> it<00:04:11.870> did<00:04:12.170> get<00:04:12.350> a<00:04:12.440> proc<00:04:12.769> off<00:04:12.980> the

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
pumpkin Duke it did get a proc off the

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.970 
pumpkin Duke it did get a proc off the
second<00:04:13.610> um<00:04:13.760> he<00:04:14.630> started<00:04:15.290> attacking<00:04:15.709> because

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
second um he started attacking because

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.070 
second um he started attacking because
that<00:04:16.250> pumpkin<00:04:16.669> there<00:04:16.880> that<00:04:17.060> Cupid<00:04:17.540> rocking

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
that pumpkin there that Cupid rocking

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.800 
that pumpkin there that Cupid rocking
but<00:04:18.620> our<00:04:18.890> pumpkin<00:04:19.580> Duke<00:04:19.729> was<00:04:20.030> still<00:04:20.390> attacking

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
but our pumpkin Duke was still attacking

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.960 
but our pumpkin Duke was still attacking
faster<00:04:21.440> even<00:04:21.859> though<00:04:22.010> their<00:04:22.400> pumpkin<00:04:22.820> Duke

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
faster even though their pumpkin Duke

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.000 
faster even though their pumpkin Duke
had<00:04:23.300> stacks<00:04:23.720> on<00:04:23.990> them<00:04:24.169> that<00:04:24.380> that<00:04:24.830> is

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
had stacks on them that that is

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.770 
had stacks on them that that is
absolutely<00:04:25.580> ridiculous<00:04:26.090> and<00:04:26.120> goes<00:04:26.390> to<00:04:26.570> show

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
absolutely ridiculous and goes to show

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.430 
absolutely ridiculous and goes to show
that<00:04:27.020> a<00:04:27.340> preserve<00:04:28.340> on<00:04:28.580> a<00:04:28.610> pumpkin<00:04:29.360> Duke<00:04:29.510> is<00:04:29.750> so

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
that a preserve on a pumpkin Duke is so

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.190 
that a preserve on a pumpkin Duke is so
much<00:04:30.979> better<00:04:31.430> it's<00:04:31.790> going<00:04:32.210> to<00:04:32.330> result<00:04:32.780> in<00:04:32.930> more

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
much better it's going to result in more

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.260 
much better it's going to result in more
stacks<00:04:33.620> rather<00:04:33.950> than<00:04:34.220> revite<00:04:34.669> and<00:04:34.910> it's<00:04:35.030> going

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
stacks rather than revite and it's going

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.900 
stacks rather than revite and it's going
to<00:04:35.419> just<00:04:35.930> be<00:04:36.050> so<00:04:36.470> much<00:04:36.650> more<00:04:36.860> effective<00:04:37.190> than

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
to just be so much more effective than

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.110 
to just be so much more effective than
revite<00:04:38.570> now<00:04:39.530> maybe<00:04:39.890> if<00:04:40.280> you<00:04:40.310> have<00:04:40.550> a<00:04:40.580> 505

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
revite now maybe if you have a 505

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.440 
revite now maybe if you have a 505
revite<00:04:41.620> maybe<00:04:42.620> take<00:04:42.950> that<00:04:43.190> I<00:04:43.400> don't<00:04:43.789> know<00:04:43.970> but

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
revite maybe take that I don't know but

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.879 
revite maybe take that I don't know but
I<00:04:44.690> know<00:04:44.750> for<00:04:45.110> a<00:04:45.140> fact<00:04:45.200> that<00:04:45.440> person
