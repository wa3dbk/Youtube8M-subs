 kids can be different since 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.790
 we have the game of naruto but of the 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.460
 ninja 2 because this game is a one 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.949
 combination between final fantasy and then 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.860
 the theme of naruto as soon as this 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.869
 game would come being non-canonical 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.670
 because he does not have a place like that 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:13.150
 pass team against history 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.979
 adult the model the game is like this is rpg 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.020
 pretty similar to final fantasy in 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.670
 also seriously gameplay or rather 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.580
 gameplay trailer I do not know what I'm going to put 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.320
 but I'm watching the game good for 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.670
 most of the game the state of 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.190
 character and it shows on the screen 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.100
 higher 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.690
 to part in the bottom the player 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.160
 can control a wide variety of 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.060
 characters needed to complete 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.810
 certain tasks there are many characters 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.060
 usable in which they are 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.820
 Naruto in its base mode and / tail mode 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.869
 the blades in their base mode and the sayo 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:49.240
 damn level 2 is already assured accusa usa 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.189
 educates and an environment in which you can 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.220
 customize and you can put your 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.720
 own youtube course with the 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.869
 course of the level that you are advancing 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.539
 you the game itself is very long is a 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.759
 little bit short but it 's pretty 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.310
 entertaining levels precipitate the 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.979
 game is very entertaining from my 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.899
 favorites in the fourth place we have to 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.390
 Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Spins 3 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.430
 This name is very long so finally 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.549
 can you tell Naruto 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.610
 axel 3 or have cars and can the routine 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:23.080
 Cruise 3 is already another because different 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.180
 pronunciations in different countries 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.220
 Well, this game starts from where 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.250
 begins shippuden to where it ends 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.500
 with with payne beating pain after 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.870
 come the fourth great and there but it 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.810
 it remains until pain well then this game 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:42.069
 was launched in 2010 in america and 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.170
 europe was in summer a few months later 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.959
 the character is quite broad we counted 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.700
 with almost all the characters the most 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.739
 important that your habit in your way 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.980
 cunningham who is my born the lightning 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:56.560
 yellow himar uses sharp and notches 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.780
 and it's called everything and many others 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.060
 find the game mode features 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.939
 more than 80 game missions a new 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.879
 multiplayer 2 versus 2 1 2 1 and three 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:10.329
 verses 1 whether they are 2d or 3d the game is 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:12.249
 balanced between 2d and 3d has like 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:15.370
 number 3 I have the game of naruto 

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:16.870
 shippuden ultimate ninja storm 2 is fine 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.419
 Well this is the first game to come out 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.090
 for the xbox 360 console but also 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:23.400
 appeared to give play station 3 this 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.590
 game has a graphic quality 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.919
 much better than the version of the award 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:33.280
 shippuden ultimate ninja and all three 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:35.919
 either because there is a portable the game 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.829
 previous and this game then it's from a 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:40.120
 desk console already 62 360 and 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.010
 Playstation 3 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.760
 this game is shown as one of the 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.370
 video games based on 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.110
 to his series the story is from when 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.209
 a car returns with a leaf to the 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.640
 battle of pain the combat of those key 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.230
 versus and lerby has many new 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.450
 of play and what attracted me most this 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.549
 game was the gameplay because it is 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.799
 very different from the games previously 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.239
 that he had told them in second place 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:05.629
 we have the shippuden naruto game 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.980
 ultimate ninja storm this generations 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:08.810
 game went on sale in two versions 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.819
 earlier which is so normal that 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.319
 includes about the game and an edition of 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.030
 collector that includes in addition to a 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.419
 I play a CD with the soundtrack of the 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.650
 game and various collectibles 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.930
 its story mode is not equal to 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.580
 previous deliveries this is based on the 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.419
 consecutive fights through images 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:29.090
 between the fights there are around 50 65 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:31.160
 minutes of videos not seen in the anime 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.740
 this game has different stories of 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.199
 different characters included in your 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.800
 story mode and in each one they are exhibited 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:41.270
 the most relevant battles to each ninja 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.920
 contains a fairly acceptable variety 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.640
 of characters 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.830
 characters are a majority majority of 60 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.440
 characters we have more than 60 characters 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.260
 to choose and has many scenarios 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.770
 hidden what I liked and characters 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.780
 I support well and the best naruto game is 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.110
 the naruto shippuden ultimate ninja storm 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.630
 3 football well, this game is the one 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.760
 more characters has is the longest the 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.730
 exact date the game was launched 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:14.870
 It was nothing more and nothing less than 5 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:17.300
 March 2013 and in Europe the 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.650
 April 18 , 2013 regarding the 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.110
 story begins with a flashback 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.760
 of the attack of huinca with blade for later 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.800
 go with the previous facts of the 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.360
 summit of the 5 streets after the 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.950
 destruction of with leaf ending 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.570
 until the fight of the 5 k is 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.120
 against mother to the girl and the 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.160
 confrontation naruto and killer well 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.220
 against extinguishers 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.420
 girl clearly this story will occupy 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.310
 a fragment of that listening 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.670
 and gay schümann that they would use in a suit 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.680
 when they are on their target 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:46.020
 the campaign of this game has 10 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.390
 chapters without including the prologue and 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.720
 fragments this game contains a 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:53.770
 pretty well done graphic quality is 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.199
 the best graphic engine 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.090
 Naruto without contracting the last and ninjas 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:01.710
 round 4 that already came out in its salsa phase 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.710
 it is obviously developing 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.020
 the one that has more things because 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.130
 has more characters more for the best 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.430
 everyone's campaign 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:11.860
