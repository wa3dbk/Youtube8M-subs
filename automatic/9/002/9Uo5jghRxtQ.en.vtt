and<00:04:35.450> apparently<00:04:35.780> I<00:04:36.050> guess<00:04:37.480> there<00:04:38.480> were

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
lawsuits against this park we probably

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.870 
lawsuits against this park we probably
didn't<00:04:43.520> have<00:04:43.610> enough<00:04:43.940> money<00:04:44.270> to<00:04:45.520> keep<00:04:46.520> it<00:04:46.700> open

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
didn't have enough money to keep it open

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.620 
didn't have enough money to keep it open
anymore<00:04:47.450> and<00:04:47.810> then<00:04:48.260> they<00:04:48.760> closed<00:04:49.760> the<00:04:50.390> park

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
anymore and then they closed the park

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:57.910 
anymore and then they closed the park
for<00:04:50.960> good<00:04:54.670> and<00:04:55.670> then<00:04:56.200> for<00:04:57.200> some<00:04:57.470> reason<00:04:57.500> they

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
for good and then for some reason they

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.480 
for good and then for some reason they
never<00:04:58.220> did<00:04:58.670> anything<00:04:59.000> else<00:04:59.420> with<00:04:59.750> it<00:04:59.960> so<00:05:00.490> the

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
never did anything else with it so the

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:55.460 
never did anything else with it so the
slides<00:05:01.850> ended<00:05:02.390> up<00:05:02.510> in<00:05:02.720> this<00:05:02.840> condition

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.940

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:58.950 
yeah look at that down there should be

00:05:58.950 --> 00:07:14.350 
yeah look at that down there should be
about<00:05:59.010> like<00:05:59.670> sliding<00:06:00.030> into<00:06:00.270> a<00:06:00.420> cave
