00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.840
 many people all and I would 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:13.070
 I had promised today I bring you the 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:17.460
 basically the solution to the challenge 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:21.710
 a simple sheet of the world and we divide it 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.710
 in half 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:29.439
 and then we're going to divide it into four 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:32.039
 parts longitudinally now that 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.039
 we are one 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.000
 we do not bend in this sense 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:43.730
 and then we doubled it again 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.730
 thus 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.790
 we see it true 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:06.600
 and we get those forms 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:08.189
 you can see 444 parts do 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.950
 Now what you have to do is 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.960
 make two cuts can be a here 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.200
 come here and one here 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:21.509
 all right 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.520
 do it with the help of say or a 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:28.530
 idea like this one that faster for 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:31.110
 cut and they should cut to height 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.150
 until you reach the middle of the sheet or 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.979
 least for that can only divided the 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.060
 half so we can cut 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.509
 quickly without many measures we cut 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.509
 the other side 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.759
 make sure that the closest to the middle 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.500
 and make a cut in the other direction 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.740
 that has to cut it in the middle of the 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.740
 sheet 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.240
 now we have done good 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.290
 we simply here we have the 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.370
 leaf that rises that is oriented and 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.680
 we make sure that this sheet that 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.230
 approximately 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.930
 to 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.720
 same height as half of our 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.180
 leaf and now comes the magic that is 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.569
 when we rotate them in this 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.700
 sense 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.439
 and there you get that phenomenon pretty 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:39.859
 curious and so we get our sheet 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:41.840
 mysterious obviously you have 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:43.879
 to do this with a leaf without bending it 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.099
 to be noticed so they do not get noticed 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:48.579
 the folds and pass more unnoticed 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.579
 how to do it 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.380
 and good people that was the video 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.900
 subscribe to my channel for more videos 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.760
 for new challenges and good is not 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.810
 seeing in a next chapter on the side 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.810
