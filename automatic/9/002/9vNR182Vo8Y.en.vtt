 the last sensations and especially the 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.529
 strategies already forming a small 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.470
 little for the first test that will be the 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.330

 on the program this Wednesday short session 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.030
 working on the plate before an ultimate 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.340
 scheduled jump training this Thursday 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.579
 installed at julien epaillard houara 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.309
 of the mosque tri 40 km from caen 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.780
 riders are relaxed but already very 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.690
 focused on the goal 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.530
 it's a very quiet place 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.219
 environmental trail conditions are 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.410
 extraordinary we made a first 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.879
 course yesterday today just a 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.620
 basically flat work 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.629
 because a lot of journalists are 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.039
 come to disturb us we opted for 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.409
 not take a hotel we live in a 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.330
 house together i'm waiting we came back 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.189
 some basic things have to 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.810
 to eat we try to be the most united 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.299
 possible to have activities together 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.820
 and to further tighten the ties that has 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.680
 already through this group on monday they 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.340
 will enter the ornano stadium for the 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.470
 warm up 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.060
 the first test that of speed 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.460
 will take place on tuesday 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.689
 and according to each horse of 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.630
 strategies are emerging 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.140
 massera desire to serve the 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.600
 team 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.850
 from the first test we have two 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.070
 very fast couples 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.439
 patrice with orion and pénélope with 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.850
 flora must be very very careful 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.009
 report to this test 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.570
 the ideal is to be placed in the 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.010
 in the first three four after 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.440
 it's not either 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.210
 a need to finish the chase the 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.890
 hunting in the lead is not that it's not 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.750
 the hunt test that makes us win 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.490
 by cons must be careful it can 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.870
 also we put ourselves a little bit in 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.080
 embarrassment if we make a very bad 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.090
 thing 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.010
 it depends a bit on the configuration of the 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.480
 course when I run after he takes 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.000
 a huge crowd but if it's really 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.470
 all distances tight I could not 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.420
 no longer enter lines in a 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.800
 gallop and if after I can not 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.869
 take off a stride for example I'm 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.920
 pretty confident now that's still a 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.970
 championship there is a little bit 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.160
 unknown because there are never 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.130
 ran so will have to see on the format 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.140
 championship so if he can be so 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.940
 performing that summer these last 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.800
 contest I have great confidence in it 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.800
 I know she'll be here 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.870
 it is certain for the hunt it is true 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.620
 that and it's duly fast but I want 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.720
 neither 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.159
 demolish it for the fake the next day 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.230
 in quotation marks go too fast and 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:37.239
 take too much risk with regard to philippe 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.830
 war he will designate the names of the four 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.140
 selected Sunday or Monday 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.730
 after the draw of the passage of the 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.000
 teams I always race and a 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.290
 rider so that's going to be decided from here the 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.150
 end of the week or maybe we 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.730
 may wait until Monday it was good 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.980
 that we look at our adapt our 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.150
 strategy according to the course and in 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.150
 function of the starting number
