00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
results this is your clay figurine so

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.180 
results this is your clay figurine so
you<00:02:03.630> start<00:02:03.900> off<00:02:04.050> as<00:02:04.230> a<00:02:04.260> white<00:02:04.500> clay<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:07.190> now

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
you start off as a white clay and now

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.160 
you start off as a white clay and now
we've<00:02:08.340> got<00:02:08.490> to<00:02:08.580> clean<00:02:08.790> out<00:02:08.940> some<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.210> the<00:02:09.450> some

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
we've got to clean out some of the some

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.450 
we've got to clean out some of the some
of<00:02:10.290> the<00:02:10.350> debris<00:02:10.590> down<00:02:10.830> there<00:02:10.890> at<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:11.160> bottom

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
of the debris down there at the bottom

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.080 
of the debris down there at the bottom
by<00:02:11.550> your<00:02:11.580> feet

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
by your feet

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.610 
by your feet
and<00:02:12.570> once<00:02:12.720> we've<00:02:12.840> got<00:02:12.960> that<00:02:12.990> debris<00:02:13.290> cleaned

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
and once we've got that debris cleaned

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.230 
and once we've got that debris cleaned
out<00:02:13.770> we<00:02:14.310> start<00:02:14.550> filling<00:02:14.790> in<00:02:14.970> all<00:02:15.060> these<00:02:15.180> holes

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
out we start filling in all these holes

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.880 
out we start filling in all these holes
because<00:02:15.810> sometimes<00:02:16.200> there's<00:02:16.380> some<00:02:16.500> gaps<00:02:16.710> in

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
because sometimes there's some gaps in

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.110 
because sometimes there's some gaps in
the<00:02:16.950> sensor<00:02:17.220> data<00:02:17.400> mm-hmm

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
the sensor data mm-hmm

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.550 
the sensor data mm-hmm
now<00:02:18.330> that<00:02:18.510> we've<00:02:18.600> got<00:02:18.750> these<00:02:18.870> holes<00:02:19.110> fill<00:02:19.350> then

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
now that we've got these holes fill then

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.650 
now that we've got these holes fill then
we're<00:02:20.310> gonna<00:02:20.430> start<00:02:20.730> wrapping<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.180> textures

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
we're gonna start wrapping the textures

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.680 
we're gonna start wrapping the textures
back<00:02:21.840> around<00:02:22.080> here<00:02:22.320> so<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.520> camera<00:02:23.970> takes<00:02:24.420> two

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
back around here so the camera takes two

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.360 
back around here so the camera takes two
kinds<00:02:25.050> of<00:02:25.080> images<00:02:25.440> one<00:02:25.740> of<00:02:25.770> them<00:02:25.950> is<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.070> depth

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
kinds of images one of them is a depth

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.280 
kinds of images one of them is a depth
image<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.390> depth<00:02:27.600> image<00:02:27.900> is<00:02:28.020> like<00:02:28.170> an

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
image and the depth image is like an

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.260 
image and the depth image is like an
infrared<00:02:28.709> fingerprint<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.820> it<00:02:29.940> just<00:02:30.090> takes

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
infrared fingerprint and it just takes

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.880 
infrared fingerprint and it just takes
millions<00:02:30.570> of<00:02:30.810> measurements<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.709> that's

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
millions of measurements and that's

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.620 
millions of measurements and that's
where<00:02:32.070> you<00:02:32.130> get<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.370> white<00:02:32.520> clay<00:02:32.790> from<00:02:33.090> the

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
where you get the white clay from the

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.750 
where you get the white clay from the
other<00:02:33.780> type<00:02:34.020> of<00:02:34.170> image<00:02:34.410> is<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.590> color<00:02:35.040> image<00:02:35.340> and

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
other type of image is a color image and

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.890 
other type of image is a color image and
now<00:02:36.090> what<00:02:36.240> we're<00:02:36.360> going<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.510> do<00:02:36.660> is<00:02:36.810> we're

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
now what we're going to do is we're

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.410 
now what we're going to do is we're
gonna<00:02:36.959> wrap<00:02:37.380> all<00:02:37.650> those<00:02:37.890> color<00:02:38.220> images<00:02:38.790> back

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
gonna wrap all those color images back

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.020 
gonna wrap all those color images back
around<00:02:39.810> your<00:02:39.990> figurine<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.830> add<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.790> color

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
around your figurine and add the color

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.180 
around your figurine and add the color
textures<00:02:42.720> back<00:02:43.140> into<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.500> model

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
textures back into the model

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.000 
textures back into the model
oh<00:02:45.150> so<00:02:45.570> there<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:45.750> is<00:02:46.280> there<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.310> am<00:02:48.770> you<00:02:49.770> know<00:02:49.800> my
