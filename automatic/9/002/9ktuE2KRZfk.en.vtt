do<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.750> same<00:02:37.870> thing<00:02:38.080> for<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.319> bottom<00:02:38.470> select

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
do the same thing for the bottom select

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.420 
do the same thing for the bottom select
all<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.970> bottom<00:02:40.269> faces<00:02:40.750> hit<00:02:41.680> new<00:02:41.980> unwrapped

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
all the bottom faces hit new unwrapped

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.590 
all the bottom faces hit new unwrapped
and<00:02:44.010> go<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.069> the<00:02:45.519> back<00:02:46.269> of<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:46.630> and<00:02:48.390> size<00:02:49.390> it

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
and go to the back of it and size it

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:56.940 
and go to the back of it and size it
down<00:02:49.750> too<00:02:54.900> so<00:02:55.900> now<00:02:56.080> you<00:02:56.140> got<00:02:56.350> the<00:02:56.440> front<00:02:56.680> and

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
down too so now you got the front and

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.110 
down too so now you got the front and
the<00:02:57.250> back<00:02:57.400> of<00:02:57.610> it<00:02:58.500> now<00:02:59.500> that's<00:02:59.680> pretty<00:02:59.860> good

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
the back of it now that's pretty good

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.289 
the back of it now that's pretty good
except<00:03:01.120> for<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.959> middle<00:03:02.170> vertices<00:03:03.150> kind<00:03:04.150> of

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
except for the middle vertices kind of

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:11.670 
except for the middle vertices kind of
have<00:03:04.480> faces<00:03:05.110> all<00:03:05.530> along<00:03:05.950> them<00:03:07.319> so<00:03:10.440> if<00:03:11.440> you<00:03:11.470> want

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
have faces all along them so if you want

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.050 
have faces all along them so if you want
to<00:03:11.799> change<00:03:12.040> that<00:03:12.630> you<00:03:13.630> can<00:03:13.840> just<00:03:14.700> select<00:03:15.700> all

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
to change that you can just select all

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:26.149 
to change that you can just select all
those

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:36.470 

there<00:03:27.159> and<00:03:27.609> then<00:03:28.599> just<00:03:31.799> either<00:03:34.709> size<00:03:35.709> it<00:03:35.950> down

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
there and then just either size it down

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.959 
there and then just either size it down
and<00:03:38.609> put<00:03:39.609> it<00:03:39.670> into<00:03:39.909> like<00:03:40.030> a<00:03:40.060> black<00:03:40.359> area<00:03:41.969> so

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:42.969 
and put it into like a black area so

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:45.360 
and put it into like a black area so
then<00:03:43.150> it<00:03:43.269> would<00:03:43.389> look<00:03:43.569> like<00:03:43.629> just<00:03:44.019> an<00:03:44.650> edge<00:03:45.219> of

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
then it would look like just an edge of

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.089 
then it would look like just an edge of
a<00:03:45.430> coin<00:03:45.639> or<00:03:46.450> you<00:03:46.599> can<00:03:46.750> size<00:03:46.959> it<00:03:46.989> down<00:03:47.379> and<00:03:47.799> get<00:03:48.069> a

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
a coin or you can size it down and get a

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.369 
a coin or you can size it down and get a
gray<00:03:48.549> part<00:03:49.030> which<00:03:49.629> would<00:03:49.810> probably<00:03:49.989> look<00:03:50.260> a

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:50.379 
gray part which would probably look a

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:57.920 
gray part which would probably look a
little<00:03:50.530> bit<00:03:50.709> better<00:03:55.049> like<00:03:56.049> that<00:03:56.290> for<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:56.709> coin

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
little bit better like that for the coin

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.959 
little bit better like that for the coin
that<00:03:58.930> looks<00:03:59.109> okay<00:03:59.409> or<00:04:00.250> you<00:04:00.489> can<00:04:00.639> get<00:04:00.760> a<00:04:00.819> whole

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:00.969 
that looks okay or you can get a whole

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:02.729 
that looks okay or you can get a whole
different<00:04:01.269> texture<00:04:01.689> but<00:04:02.019> I<00:04:02.290> don't<00:04:02.530> want<00:04:02.650> to

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
different texture but I don't want to

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.610 
different texture but I don't want to
get<00:04:03.129> another<00:04:03.280> texture<00:04:03.790> this<00:04:03.909> is<00:04:03.969> good<00:04:04.180> enough

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
get another texture this is good enough

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.479 
get another texture this is good enough
okay<00:04:05.620> so<00:04:06.310> once<00:04:06.489> you<00:04:06.609> got<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:06.819> coin<00:04:07.949> two<00:04:08.949> phases

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
okay so once you got the coin two phases

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.610 
okay so once you got the coin two phases
you<00:04:10.709> want<00:04:11.709> to<00:04:12.599> put<00:04:13.599> the<00:04:13.750> actual<00:04:13.930> texture<00:04:14.500> on

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
you want to put the actual texture on

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.099 
you want to put the actual texture on
for<00:04:14.829> rendering<00:04:15.189> so<00:04:15.730> go<00:04:15.879> down<00:04:16.000> to<00:04:16.150> shading<00:04:16.539> the

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
for rendering so go down to shading the

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.520 
for rendering so go down to shading the
shading<00:04:17.139> tab<00:04:17.590> add<00:04:17.949> new<00:04:18.479> go<00:04:19.479> to<00:04:19.509> the<00:04:19.720> texture

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
shading tab add new go to the texture

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:21.499 
shading tab add new go to the texture
buttons<00:04:20.919> right<00:04:21.160> there

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:21.509 
buttons right there

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:26.790 
buttons right there
go<00:04:22.509> to<00:04:22.570> add<00:04:23.080> new<00:04:23.250> and<00:04:24.840> texture<00:04:25.840> would<00:04:26.470> just<00:04:26.710> be

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
go to add new and texture would just be

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.480 
go to add new and texture would just be
an<00:04:26.889> image<00:04:27.220> go<00:04:27.580> to<00:04:27.610> the<00:04:28.570> texture<00:04:28.930> type<00:04:29.110> load<00:04:30.039> it

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
an image go to the texture type load it

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.290 
an image go to the texture type load it
should<00:04:30.759> be<00:04:30.880> right<00:04:31.060> here<00:04:31.090> and<00:04:32.909> go<00:04:33.909> back<00:04:34.120> into

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
should be right here and go back into

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.460 
should be right here and go back into
the<00:04:34.389> shading<00:04:34.810> tab<00:04:35.190> go<00:04:36.190> to<00:04:36.270> map<00:04:37.270> input<00:04:37.780> and<00:04:38.110> go

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
the shading tab go to map input and go

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.779 
the shading tab go to map input and go
to<00:04:38.530> UV<00:04:39.009> for<00:04:39.669> the<00:04:39.759> calculations<00:04:40.389> and<00:04:41.729> go<00:04:42.729> to

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
to UV for the calculations and go to

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:47.310 
to UV for the calculations and go to
mouth<00:04:43.270> to<00:04:43.599> go<00:04:44.500> to<00:04:44.680> Noor<00:04:45.009> and<00:04:45.870> you<00:04:46.870> can<00:04:47.020> put<00:04:47.199> up

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
mouth to go to Noor and you can put up

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.260 
mouth to go to Noor and you can put up
this<00:04:47.500> to<00:04:47.979> make<00:04:48.240> it<00:04:49.240> stand<00:04:49.840> out<00:04:50.080> more<00:04:51.120> if<00:04:52.120> you

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
this to make it stand out more if you

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.960 
this to make it stand out more if you
want<00:04:52.770> it<00:04:53.770> makes<00:04:53.949> it<00:04:54.070> look<00:04:54.220> a<00:04:54.430> little<00:04:54.610> bit<00:04:54.789> more

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
want it makes it look a little bit more

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.070 
want it makes it look a little bit more
realistic<00:04:57.389> but<00:04:58.389> it<00:04:58.539> doesn't<00:04:58.780> work<00:04:58.870> in<00:04:59.020> the

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
realistic but it doesn't work in the

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.460 
realistic but it doesn't work in the
game<00:04:59.259> engine<00:04:59.650> so<00:05:00.210> just<00:05:01.210> keep<00:05:02.169> that<00:05:02.199> in<00:05:02.380> mind

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
game engine so just keep that in mind

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:08.629 
game engine so just keep that in mind
and<00:05:03.419> I<00:05:04.419> think<00:05:04.659> that's<00:05:04.870> pretty<00:05:05.080> much<00:05:05.259> it<00:05:07.080> you

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
and I think that's pretty much it you

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.089 
and I think that's pretty much it you
can<00:05:09.639> try<00:05:09.880> rendering<00:05:10.180> this<00:05:10.740> make<00:05:11.740> sure<00:05:11.919> your

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:12.099 
can try rendering this make sure your

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:14.760 
can try rendering this make sure your
camera<00:05:12.310> is<00:05:12.520> in<00:05:12.639> the<00:05:12.699> right<00:05:12.849> place<00:05:13.680> also<00:05:14.680> you

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
camera is in the right place also you

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.379 
camera is in the right place also you
might<00:05:14.889> want<00:05:14.949> to<00:05:15.159> rotate<00:05:15.310> it<00:05:15.490> to<00:05:15.789> get<00:05:15.940> a<00:05:16.120> better

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
might want to rotate it to get a better

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:21.400 
might want to rotate it to get a better
view<00:05:16.750> of<00:05:16.930> it

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:27.850 

okay<00:05:23.710> I'm<00:05:24.710> just<00:05:24.770> going<00:05:25.040> to<00:05:25.070> render<00:05:25.340> this<00:05:26.860> so

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
okay I'm just going to render this so

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.680 
okay I'm just going to render this so
that<00:05:28.130> looks<00:05:28.340> like<00:05:28.430> it<00:05:28.730> has<00:05:28.880> a<00:05:28.910> little<00:05:29.120> bit<00:05:29.390> too

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
that looks like it has a little bit too

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.030 
that looks like it has a little bit too
much<00:05:31.420> normal<00:05:32.420> because<00:05:33.230> it's<00:05:33.500> pretty<00:05:33.800> bumpy

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.040 
much normal because it's pretty bumpy

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.680 
much normal because it's pretty bumpy
but<00:05:35.030> you<00:05:35.120> get<00:05:35.240> the<00:05:35.330> point

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
but you get the point

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.960 
but you get the point
you<00:05:35.990> can<00:05:36.170> turn<00:05:36.320> down<00:05:36.380> that<00:05:38.470> like<00:05:39.470> that<00:05:39.650> much

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
you can turn down that like that much

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:48.520 
you can turn down that like that much
render<00:05:40.970> it<00:05:42.700> that<00:05:43.700> looks<00:05:43.850> better<00:05:44.000> and<00:05:47.410> this<00:05:48.410> is

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
render it that looks better and this is
