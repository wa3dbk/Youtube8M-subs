00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.000
 multiplayer analysis we started 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.730
 we started with the interface of 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.480
 multiplayer that is an interface 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.550
 totally new when we started in 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.099
 Multiplayer mode post first brings us 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.100
 here where we have quick match 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.170
 personalized game herd of wolves the 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.510
 abstergo training story 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.870
 events and plate 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.210
 Quick game as you all know 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.800
 as its own name indicates departure 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.860
 fast you give and start a game in 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.620
 any game mode or any 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.649
 game that has personalized game 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.540
 we enter and in personalized game 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:00.059
 we can choose in all against all 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.760
 team team goals with 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.610
 against all game modes are as 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.800
 death is sought and killed 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.380
 the map we can not choose it only 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.580
 you can choose in private mode in the 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.620
 private games 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.580
 then we are in the goal of this 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.920
 team we have domain hunting and assault 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.930
 artifact compared to the 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.110
 revelations and fifth have removed 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.910
 enough game modes 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.640
 it's a shame because there were some 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:34.270
 pretty funny like stealing 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.670
 artifact or escort for example after 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.360
 we have all the simple death that is 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.490
 a simple death of revelations that is 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.640
 a duel to death without skills now 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.440
 we have the wolf pack that is the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:52.180
 new multiplayer mode that they have put 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:55.420
 in 63 that consists of missions 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.580
 cooperatives with friends or herd of 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.369
 open wolves would be with people who do not 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.680
 know and well then we would have herd 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.509
 of wolves with invitation that is already seen 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.820
 invite friends who can only 4 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:10.420
 telling you herd of wolves is 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.970
 normal difficult and in extreme and 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.410
 we will try and I will bring you games with 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.010
 people 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.390
 and good and later to teach in 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.210
 the pack of wolves that I have not yet 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.760
 tested we went to the following here 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.850
 we have the wolf pack as I said 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.080
 what is the same 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:34.860
 we go back the story of abstergo 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:38.010
 here what we have we have a father are 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.010
 the levels 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.520
 I see that I get dizzy 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.490
 up to level 50 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:51.240
 and in between each level and at the level 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:55.440
 own there are a series of challenges that you can 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:57.870
 complete that I do not know if you can repeat them 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.550
 I think if you can try to be with 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.220
 this here the challenge where can you 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.020
 complete unlock videos like 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.430
 this 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.170
 here there is another one here 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.269
 that the videos now teach them is 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.819
 well I will teach them I will upload them better 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:17.209
 said training that's one thing 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.120
 quite new and that has surprised me and 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.379
 that gave me an idea to make a video 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.450
 apart from the initiation session and such 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.250
 There is the stage where you can 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.859
 explore the map that you choose you can 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.260
 pick a character and give you a 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:33.530
 turn around the map with time 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.170
 infinite and it is a new way that will suffice 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.150
 that have surprised me and I have a video 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.609
 some videos designed to do with that 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.650
 way well now we go to the 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:45.519
 bar above we have several 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:49.040
 news such as the center 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.930
 abstergo social that we had before 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.180
 in multiplayer but now there's 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.110
 like several other things like for example 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.290
 competitions in progress 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.580
 It was once quite different but 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.170
 now they have changed 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:08.000
 but for example you get the 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:12.380
 classification of the one I am looking for in it 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.270
 search took the highest score 5850 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.580
 and here I have the people that I have 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.040
 added that player has also been sought 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:22.970
 and there you have your score and this is 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:25.550
 just to try 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.400
 be up as you will check the 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:31.310
 right where it puts social goals 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:34.940
 as overtones as it puts a 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:37.210
 a cap or a goal and you have 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.620
 try to get it I already got it 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.410
 it's not that difficult either, it's rewarding 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.969
 and points to buy things from 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.860
 multiplayer 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:49.079
 then here is here would be currently 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.539
 and simple death kill up 

00:04:49.079 --> 00:04:55.710
 take all game modes of 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:57.990

 super easy super easy level ups 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.430
 here in this game 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.260
 hall of fame 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.950
 Here we have a wolf pack 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:15.800

 community goal this is a 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:29.279
 goal that has put soft where 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:33.869

 Invitations received in the play vale 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.270
 but that's a new thing too I do not know 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:03.629
 why do they put more news here and 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:05.819
