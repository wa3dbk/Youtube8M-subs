00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.880
 those partly 2-def. coordination training for school and 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.580
 Club we put exercises out of the build-up training 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.850
 Assignments become more complex and the exercise courses more difficult than in the 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.420
 Basic Training 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.780
 a successful training requires besides the fast and the 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.080
 Precise implementation of the exercises of basic training is also SME's couriers 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.860
 Prerequisites for the liquid execution of difficult tasks 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.860
 enable 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.180
 In this video you will also find exercises in which general coordinative 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.600
 Tasks associated with sports-specific techniques 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.400
 a general coordination training merit performance development 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.400
 the way to a high play ability in a marginal sport 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.790
 Therefore, a versatile coordination training in child and 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.790
 Youth area not missing 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.410
 Everybody should flare up in the children and youth training 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.990
 coordinative tasks 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.380
 simple organizational forms as we provide the framework for a square 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.890
 sensible coordinative Souter program 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.849
 which should be designed in a fundamentally varied and motivating way 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:26.639
 For example, we will do the exercises from the run and jump ABC with others 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:29.059
 coordinative content 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:30.969
 as mentioned in part one 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:34.680
 gets a good eye by running in the zipper system 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.500
 Eid feeling developed as the players according to a predetermined pattern through the meter 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:39.219
 to run 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:42.589
 Of course, this can also be done in other forms of organization 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:44.099
 schools 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.099
 Franconia 

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:13.779
 the players have to concentrate a lot on the turn in the game 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:16.779
 right distance to the partner to run through the middle 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:49.719
 it requires follow-up to partner exercises like a good workout 

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:53.029
 because the players have to break synchronously after a physical contact 

00:03:53.029 --> 00:03:56.559
 land safely and continue the running movement quickly
