this rig up take your inline lead this
is<00:01:08.380> four<00:01:08.619> ounces<00:01:08.740> doesn't<00:01:09.280> have<00:01:09.399> to<00:01:09.520> be<00:01:09.610> that

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
is four ounces doesn't have to be that

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.499 
is four ounces doesn't have to be that
big<00:01:10.030> I<00:01:10.299> quite<00:01:11.110> like<00:01:11.259> a<00:01:11.290> big<00:01:11.560> hook<00:01:11.770> set<00:01:12.070> the<00:01:12.189> hook

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
big I quite like a big hook set the hook

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:18.090 
big I quite like a big hook set the hook
and<00:01:13.509> just<00:01:14.159> push<00:01:15.159> that<00:01:15.969> swivel<00:01:16.829> inside<00:01:17.829> there

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
and just push that swivel inside there

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.789 
and just push that swivel inside there
it<00:01:18.340> should<00:01:18.700> fit<00:01:19.000> nice<00:01:19.210> and<00:01:19.240> neatly<00:01:19.719> and<00:01:20.049> easily

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
it should fit nice and neatly and easily

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.499 
it should fit nice and neatly and easily
I've<00:01:20.979> actually<00:01:21.189> cut<00:01:21.549> a<00:01:21.579> bit<00:01:21.850> of<00:01:21.969> that<00:01:22.090> insert

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
I've actually cut a bit of that insert

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.170 
I've actually cut a bit of that insert
out<00:01:22.840> so<00:01:23.320> that<00:01:23.469> it<00:01:23.590> slides<00:01:23.920> in<00:01:24.250> nice<00:01:24.729> and<00:01:24.939> gently

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
out so that it slides in nice and gently

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.789 
out so that it slides in nice and gently
you<00:01:25.329> don't<00:01:25.539> want<00:01:25.780> that<00:01:25.960> jammed<00:01:26.350> in<00:01:26.590> there

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
you don't want that jammed in there

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.380 
you don't want that jammed in there
remember<00:01:27.100> we're<00:01:27.399> trying<00:01:27.549> to<00:01:27.700> get<00:01:27.850> this<00:01:28.000> leg<00:01:28.240> to

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
remember we're trying to get this leg to

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.980 
remember we're trying to get this leg to
drop<00:01:28.600> off<00:01:28.780> now<00:01:29.619> pass<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:31.060> leader<00:01:31.299> then<00:01:31.600> around

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
drop off now pass the leader then around

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.599 
drop off now pass the leader then around
the<00:01:32.140> outside<00:01:32.170> their<00:01:32.680> leg<00:01:32.829> some<00:01:33.070> guys<00:01:33.250> put<00:01:33.520> it

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:33.609 
the outside their leg some guys put it

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:35.730 
the outside their leg some guys put it
around<00:01:33.820> here<00:01:34.180> I<00:01:34.359> tend<00:01:34.899> to<00:01:34.960> put<00:01:35.170> it<00:01:35.259> over<00:01:35.409> the

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
around here I tend to put it over the

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.649 
around here I tend to put it over the
shortest<00:01:36.189> distance<00:01:36.399> that<00:01:36.969> seems<00:01:37.240> to<00:01:37.390> work<00:01:37.420> the

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
shortest distance that seems to work the

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.700 
shortest distance that seems to work the
best<00:01:38.039> with<00:01:39.039> the<00:01:40.020> insert<00:01:41.020> that's<00:01:41.259> coming<00:01:41.560> out

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
best with the insert that's coming out

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.969 
best with the insert that's coming out
of<00:01:41.799> the<00:01:42.009> inside<00:01:42.430> of<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:42.960> lead

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
of the inside of the lead

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.600 
of the inside of the lead
and<00:01:45.119> just<00:01:46.119> slide<00:01:46.920> Patel<00:01:47.920> rubber<00:01:48.159> on<00:01:48.340> make<00:01:48.579> sure

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
and just slide Patel rubber on make sure

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.600 
and just slide Patel rubber on make sure
that<00:01:49.030> that<00:01:49.240> that's<00:01:49.840> wet<00:01:50.200> so<00:01:50.979> that<00:01:51.009> the<00:01:51.369> tail

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
that that that's wet so that the tail

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.050 
that that that's wet so that the tail
rubber<00:01:51.820> slides<00:01:52.210> off<00:01:52.390> nice<00:01:52.600> and<00:01:52.630> easily<00:01:54.060> and

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
rubber slides off nice and easily and

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.590 
rubber slides off nice and easily and
that<00:01:55.090> should<00:01:55.539> lay<00:01:55.719> on<00:01:55.899> the<00:01:56.020> bottom<00:01:56.170> like<00:01:57.009> so

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
that should lay on the bottom like so

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.120 
that should lay on the bottom like so
when<00:01:58.600> you<00:01:58.630> get<00:01:58.810> a<00:01:58.840> take<00:01:59.110> my<00:01:59.409> fish<00:01:59.649> moves<00:01:59.890> off

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
when you get a take my fish moves off

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.359 
when you get a take my fish moves off
shakes<00:02:01.000> his<00:02:01.179> head<00:02:01.360> and<00:02:01.770> then<00:02:02.770> level<00:02:03.009> come<00:02:03.220> off

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
shakes his head and then level come off

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.539 
shakes his head and then level come off
with<00:02:03.850> very<00:02:04.000> little<00:02:04.210> pressure<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:06.130> can<00:02:06.340> see

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
with very little pressure you can see

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.240 
with very little pressure you can see
inside<00:02:06.970> the<00:02:07.210> insert<00:02:07.659> I've<00:02:07.929> cut<00:02:08.590> a<00:02:08.619> section<00:02:08.979> of

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
inside the insert I've cut a section of

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.400 
inside the insert I've cut a section of
that<00:02:09.280> out<00:02:09.610> making<00:02:10.330> sure<00:02:10.569> that<00:02:11.080> when<00:02:11.290> the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
that out making sure that when the

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.030 
that out making sure that when the
swivels<00:02:12.360> pushed<00:02:13.360> inside<00:02:13.569> it<00:02:14.290> really<00:02:14.590> is<00:02:14.860> only

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040
