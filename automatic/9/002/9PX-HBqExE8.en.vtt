 replenishes part or all of one or 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.209
 several teeth permanently 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.550

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:19.890
 the dentist and the prosthetist so 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.170

 nails or any other type of element 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.079
 harmful because many crowns or 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.600
 bridges are covered with a layer of 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.550
 porcelain that can be damaged when the 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.530
 porcelain fracture the solution 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.989
 permanent involves removing the crown or 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.260
 the bridge in its entirety and replace it 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.210

 if you do it in crowded places 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.539
 because a glass impact in the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.909
 porcelain could produce a fracture 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:05.580
 unexpected in the anterior teeth 4 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:07.290

 new yes 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.280
 because a delay can cause the 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.650
 space, preventing repositioning 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.740
 of said bridge or the appearance of 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.200
 infections or other types of problems 5

 dental floss since prostheses tend to 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.810

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.520
 bacteria from their union with the tooth or in 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.570
