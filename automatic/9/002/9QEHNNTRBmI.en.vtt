00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.690
 be all is more this new video where 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.130
 I bring you a boxing of this sleeve 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.050
 I think you see a lot of trouble 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.690
 this I just bought it a little while ago 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.369
 here I leave you at the bottom in the 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.280
 store I will not buy them and they can 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.680
 find your promotions and good etc 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:31.200
 let's start with the unpacking 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.240
 of this that does not have much science 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.960
 let's see here is a cover of the 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:40.910
 brand bands 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:44.000
 and well that way we can see that it's 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:48.340
 well has the brand here the brand of 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.530
 this side and we can also see what 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.110
 that has this part of here that where 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.760
 the cables go the camera and well then 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.260
 Now let's try it with the iphone 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.320
 5 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.140
 let's see how it looks in this case 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.080
 in the iphone 5 phone is a case 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.080
 rubber does not have any problem this 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.300
 funda enter I like it 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.900
 and so far I think there's 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:17.170
 finished the unboxing of this sleeve not 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.090
 It was a lot of science and we are going to 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.390
 try the buttons to see how the 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.220
 Unlock button is very good 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.860
 so I want it to see the button 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.140
 volume and then if you do not have any 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.950
 problem is excellent the cover what 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.830
 I feel very comfortable the truth this is 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.290
 texture that you have here is like that of the 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.260
 shoes go and well if you do not have any 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.610
 problem let's see the camera's if 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.890
 have something 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.940
 and it's through fly we're going to dodge the plan 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.210
 that side 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.950
 and we are going to take a picture 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.420
 Well, the photo came out 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.250
 and there as a small 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.049
 like you see an outline here black 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.170
 but it can be arranged with the light of the 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:04.240
 day we do not have any more problems until 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.520
 here finished the unboxing of this case 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.160
 of the brand fans I hope you have them 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.780
 liked that you liked it very well and not 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.860

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.160

 is this mica that is for the iphone 5 already 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.300
 this is the best this side 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.330
 see own and you see that it has made me lose 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.050
 here it looks perfectly good to lose and 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.050
 until it ends 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:50.590
