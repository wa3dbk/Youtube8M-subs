00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
today so first thing and one of the

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.349 
today so first thing and one of the
biggest<00:00:17.010> things<00:00:17.310> in<00:00:17.430> my<00:00:17.550> opinion<00:00:17.760> is<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.119> maps

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
biggest things in my opinion is the maps

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.120 
biggest things in my opinion is the maps
because<00:00:18.539> Matt's<00:00:19.230> going<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.470> play<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.619> huge<00:00:19.920> part

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
because Matt's going to play a huge part

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.290 
because Matt's going to play a huge part
in<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.369> game<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.609> you<00:00:20.670> know<00:00:20.820> I'm<00:00:21.119> going<00:00:21.210> to

in the game and you know I'm going to

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.939 
in the game and you know I'm going to
probably<00:00:21.449> grow<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.990> love<00:00:22.199> these<00:00:22.410> maps<00:00:22.590> over

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
probably grow to love these maps over

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.920 
probably grow to love these maps over
the<00:00:23.010> next<00:00:23.070> year<00:00:23.310> or<00:00:23.340> so<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.760> this<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.539> that<00:00:24.689> one

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
the next year or so and this is that one

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.210 
the next year or so and this is that one
of<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.080> first<00:00:25.289> confirmed<00:00:25.500> maps<00:00:25.859> going<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.160> be

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
of the first confirmed maps going to be

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.259 
of the first confirmed maps going to be
in<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.340> game<00:00:26.460> this<00:00:26.580> one<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:26.880> actually<00:00:26.970> called

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
in the game this one is actually called

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.480 
in the game this one is actually called
aftermath<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.109> this<00:00:28.470> is<00:00:28.710> set<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:29.130> ruined

downtown LA and this is probably after

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.080

the<00:00:31.710> kind<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:31.980> invasion<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.610> virtually<00:00:32.910> see

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
the kind of invasion you virtually see

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.610 
the kind of invasion you virtually see
in<00:00:33.239> all<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.450> kind<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.660> trailers<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.110> know<00:00:34.200> in

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
in all the kind of trailers you know in

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.810 
in all the kind of trailers you know in
all<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.800> trailers<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.309> far<00:00:35.340> you've<00:00:35.700> actually

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
all the trailers so far you've actually

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.760 
all the trailers so far you've actually
seen<00:00:36.090> la<00:00:36.690> been<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:37.020> smoke<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:37.649> is

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
seen la been in smoke and this is

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.900 
seen la been in smoke and this is
actually<00:00:37.829> gonna<00:00:38.070> be<00:00:38.190> off<00:00:38.399> them<00:00:38.610> off<00:00:38.700> that

actually gonna be off them off that

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.220 
actually gonna be off them off that
hence<00:00:39.120> why<00:00:39.300> it's<00:00:39.329> called<00:00:39.570> aftermath<00:00:40.020> and

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
hence why it's called aftermath and

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.450

the<00:01:06.869> only<00:01:06.990> other<00:01:07.080> map<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.619> we<00:01:07.680> actually<00:01:07.890> know

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
the only other map that we actually know

the only other map that we actually know
about<00:01:08.070> at<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.460> moment<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.820> one<00:01:09.000> called

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
about at the moment is one called

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.940 
about at the moment is one called
socotra<00:01:09.869> island<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:10.890> actually

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
socotra island and this is actually

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.890 
socotra island and this is actually
based<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.490> Yemen<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.090> not<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.330> lot<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.540> actually

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
based in Yemen and not a lot is actually

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.359 
based in Yemen and not a lot is actually
known<00:01:13.049> about<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.439> map<00:01:13.619> at<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.950> moment<00:01:14.310> but

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
known about this map at the moment but

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.800 
known about this map at the moment but
the<00:01:14.700> were<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> couple<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.210> scenes<00:01:15.390> from<00:01:15.600> the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
the were a couple of scenes from the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.300 
the were a couple of scenes from the
front<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.110> videos<00:01:16.409> yesterday<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.890> think<00:01:17.220> that

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
front of videos yesterday I think that

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.679 
front of videos yesterday I think that
this<00:01:17.430> two<00:01:17.850> pictures<00:01:18.090> right<00:01:18.330> here<00:01:18.479> might

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
this two pictures right here might

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.570 
this two pictures right here might
actually<00:01:18.810> be<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.290> cultural<00:01:19.590> island<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.009> not

research at the time seeing what i only

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.160 
research at the time seeing what i only
use<00:01:44.820> me<00:01:44.939> later<00:01:45.180> actually<00:01:45.570> said<00:01:45.780> about<00:01:45.930> knife

in<00:01:46.380> one<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.009> things<00:01:47.130> he<00:01:47.280> did<00:01:47.399> say<00:01:47.549> was<00:01:47.729> that

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
in one of the things he did say was that

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.069 
in one of the things he did say was that
he<00:01:47.970> wished<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.509> knife<00:01:48.689> had<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:48.990> be

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
he wished that the knife had to be

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.569 
he wished that the knife had to be
equipped<00:01:49.409> before<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.860> could<00:01:50.009> use<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:50.490> you

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
equipped before you could use it so you

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.499 
equipped before you could use it so you
could<00:01:50.670> just<00:01:50.820> run<00:01:50.970> around<00:01:51.060> with<00:01:51.270> your<00:01:51.360> knife

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
could just run around with your knife

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.510 
could just run around with your knife
all<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.810> time<00:01:51.990> kind<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.590> takes<00:01:52.649> our<00:01:53.070> panning

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
all the time kind of takes our panning

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.560 
all the time kind of takes our panning
knifing<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.939> game<00:01:54.090> for<00:01:54.240> everyone<00:01:54.450> else

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
knifing in the game for everyone else

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.359 
knifing in the game for everyone else
but<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:55.170> know<00:01:55.259> only<00:01:55.470> use<00:01:55.680> me<00:01:55.829> Blake<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.250> just

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
but you know only use me Blake and just

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.859 
but you know only use me Blake and just
run<00:01:56.520> around<00:01:56.640> with<00:01:56.850> his<00:01:56.939> knife<00:01:57.090> out<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.479> this

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
run around with his knife out and this

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.359 
run around with his knife out and this
image<00:01:58.140> right<00:01:58.290> here<00:01:58.350> at<00:01:58.590> he<00:01:58.710> shows<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> guy<00:01:59.159> with

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
image right here at he shows a guy with

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.580 
image right here at he shows a guy with
a<00:01:59.399> knife<00:01:59.670> out<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.719> doesn't<00:02:01.259> like<00:02:01.469> his

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
a knife out and it doesn't like his

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.139 
a knife out and it doesn't like his
mitts<00:02:01.829> wipe<00:02:02.070> I<00:02:02.280> think<00:02:02.490> he's<00:02:02.579> actually<00:02:02.700> had<00:02:03.030> the

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
mitts wipe I think he's actually had the

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.850 
mitts wipe I think he's actually had the
knife<00:02:03.299> there<00:02:03.540> for<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.719> while<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.380> do<00:02:04.439> think

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
knife there for a while and I do think

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.959 
knife there for a while and I do think
they're<00:02:05.100> actually<00:02:05.159> going<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.520> change<00:02:05.759> the

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
they're actually going to change the

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.789 
they're actually going to change the
knifing<00:02:06.329> system<00:02:06.689> in<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.990> game<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:07.590> do

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
knifing system in the game that you do

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.260 
knifing system in the game that you do
have<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.129> equip<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.580> knife<00:02:08.759> before<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.119> can

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
have to equip the knife before you can

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.910 
have to equip the knife before you can
use<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.420> or<00:02:09.629> possibly<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.050> fact<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.379> might

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
use it or possibly the fact that might

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.890 
use it or possibly the fact that might
she<00:02:11.069> be<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.220> secondary<00:02:11.670> weapon<00:02:12.090> so<00:02:12.270> that'd<00:02:12.810> be

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
she be a secondary weapon so that'd be

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.850 
she be a secondary weapon so that'd be
pretty<00:02:13.050> cool<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.379> be

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
pretty cool that be

the<00:02:28.440> killstreaks<00:02:28.980> in<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.160> game<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.400> this<00:02:29.520> is

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
the killstreaks in the game and this is

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.280 
the killstreaks in the game and this is
another<00:02:29.820> kind<00:02:30.030> of<00:02:30.150> multiplayer<00:02:30.540> screen<00:02:30.900> when

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
another kind of multiplayer screen when

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.080 
another kind of multiplayer screen when
actually<00:02:31.590> sure<00:02:31.770> what<00:02:32.100> this<00:02:32.310> map<00:02:32.580> is<00:02:32.610> this

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
actually sure what this map is this

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.030 
actually sure what this map is this
again<00:02:33.420> could<00:02:33.690> be<00:02:33.840> so<00:02:33.960> cultural<00:02:34.260> island<00:02:34.560> not

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
again could be so cultural island not

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.170 
again could be so cultural island not
too<00:02:35.160> sure<00:02:35.310> but<00:02:35.520> when<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.730> things<00:02:35.910> I<00:02:36.000> want<00:02:36.150> to

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
too sure but when the things I want to

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.520 
too sure but when the things I want to
point<00:02:36.270> out<00:02:36.450> in<00:02:36.600> this<00:02:36.690> map<00:02:36.900> is<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.230> bottom

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
point out in this map is the bottom

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.930 
point out in this map is the bottom
right-hand<00:02:37.650> corner<00:02:37.890> this<00:02:38.670> is<00:02:38.760> where<00:02:38.880> the

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
right-hand corner this is where the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.340 
right-hand corner this is where the
killstreaks<00:02:39.420> on<00:02:39.540> this<00:02:39.750> is<00:02:39.840> quite<00:02:40.050> a<00:02:40.080> strange

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
killstreaks on this is quite a strange

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.600 
killstreaks on this is quite a strange
you<00:02:40.470> can<00:02:40.590> actually<00:02:40.740> see<00:02:40.920> in<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.310> bottom<00:02:41.400> that

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
you can actually see in the bottom that

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.770 
you can actually see in the bottom that
it<00:02:41.700> does<00:02:41.850> actually<00:02:41.970> say<00:02:42.270> that<00:02:42.420> this<00:02:42.480> is<00:02:42.540> from

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
it does actually say that this is from

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.540 
it does actually say that this is from
the<00:02:42.810> multiplayer<00:02:43.320> looks<00:02:43.950> like<00:02:44.160> you've<00:02:44.310> kind

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
the multiplayer looks like you've kind

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.949 
the multiplayer looks like you've kind
of<00:02:44.610> got<00:02:44.730> four<00:02:44.940> killstreaks<00:02:45.450> at<00:02:45.570> once<00:02:45.780> and

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
of got four killstreaks at once and

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.360 
of got four killstreaks at once and
they're<00:02:46.080> all<00:02:46.200> kind<00:02:46.500> of<00:02:46.530> assigned<00:02:47.220> to

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
they're all kind of assigned to

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.280 
they're all kind of assigned to
different<00:02:47.520> directions<00:02:48.150> on<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.420> d-pad<00:02:48.600> so

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
different directions on the d-pad so

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
different directions on the d-pad so
it's<00:02:49.410> pretty<00:02:49.560> strange<00:02:49.709> i'm<00:02:49.890> not<00:02:50.010> sure<00:02:50.100> if<00:02:50.220> this

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
it's pretty strange i'm not sure if this

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.860 
it's pretty strange i'm not sure if this
is<00:02:50.370> finalized<00:02:50.910> but<00:02:51.060> one<00:02:51.240> thing<00:02:51.540> that<00:02:51.570> you<00:02:51.720> can

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
is finalized but one thing that you can

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.780 
is finalized but one thing that you can
actually<00:02:52.020> see<00:02:52.170> that<00:02:52.440> is<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.709> EMP<00:02:53.220> so<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:53.760> looks

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
actually see that is the EMP so it looks

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.100 
actually see that is the EMP so it looks
like<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.120> EMP<00:02:54.510> is<00:02:54.540> actually<00:02:54.870> gonna<00:02:54.959> be<00:02:55.080> a

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
like the EMP is actually gonna be a

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.260 
like the EMP is actually gonna be a
killstreak<00:02:55.530> in<00:02:55.860> black<00:02:56.160> ops<00:02:56.340> 2<00:02:56.430> which<00:02:56.730> pretty

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
killstreak in black ops 2 which pretty

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.100 
killstreak in black ops 2 which pretty
strange<00:02:57.510> you<00:02:57.600> know<00:02:57.690> we<00:02:57.810> haven't<00:02:58.050> actually

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
strange you know we haven't actually

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.020 
strange you know we haven't actually
seen<00:02:58.410> an<00:02:58.560> EMP<00:02:58.950> in<00:02:59.160> any<00:02:59.310> of<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.520> tryout<00:02:59.850> games

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
seen an EMP in any of the tryout games

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.729 
seen an EMP in any of the tryout games
before<00:03:00.239> purely<00:03:01.020> because<00:03:01.200> they've<00:03:01.440> been<00:03:01.470> based

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
before purely because they've been based

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:02.930 
before purely because they've been based
in<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:01.950> past<00:03:02.130> but<00:03:02.310> this<00:03:02.430> one<00:03:02.580> is<00:03:02.670> obviously

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
in the past but this one is obviously

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.850 
in the past but this one is obviously
good<00:03:03.120> me<00:03:03.239> in<00:03:03.300> the<00:03:03.390> future<00:03:03.540> not<00:03:04.320> too<00:03:04.470> sure<00:03:04.650> the

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
good me in the future not too sure the

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:05.900 
good me in the future not too sure the
other<00:03:04.980> ones<00:03:05.130> are<00:03:05.220> it<00:03:05.310> looks<00:03:05.459> like<00:03:05.580> it<00:03:05.700> may<00:03:05.880> be

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
other ones are it looks like it may be

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.120 
other ones are it looks like it may be
an<00:03:06.180> attack<00:03:06.420> helicopter<00:03:06.600> on<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.200> down<00:03:07.530> on<00:03:07.739> the

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
an attack helicopter on the down on the

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.440 
an attack helicopter on the down on the
right<00:03:08.280> actually<00:03:08.610> looks<00:03:08.790> suspiciously<00:03:09.360> like

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
right actually looks suspiciously like

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.030 
right actually looks suspiciously like
the<00:03:09.720> Blackbirds<00:03:10.170> I'll<00:03:10.410> be<00:03:10.530> interesting<00:03:10.920> to

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
the Blackbirds I'll be interesting to

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.590 
the Blackbirds I'll be interesting to
know<00:03:11.160> what<00:03:11.700> you<00:03:11.790> guys<00:03:11.880> think<00:03:12.120> about<00:03:12.239> that<00:03:12.450> do

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
know what you guys think about that do

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.670 
know what you guys think about that do
you<00:03:12.630> think<00:03:12.690> that's<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.080> Blackbird<00:03:13.470> do<00:03:13.590> you

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
you think that's the Blackbird do you

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.170 
you think that's the Blackbird do you
think<00:03:13.830> the<00:03:13.920> black<00:03:14.070> bed<00:03:14.280> will<00:03:14.489> be<00:03:14.610> returning<00:03:14.970> in

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
think the black bed will be returning in

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.030 
think the black bed will be returning in
black<00:03:15.390> ops<00:03:15.540> 2<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:15.959> can<00:03:16.380> actually<00:03:16.650> see<00:03:16.800> another

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
black ops 2 and can actually see another

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.199 
black ops 2 and can actually see another
screenshot<00:03:17.340> right<00:03:17.580> here<00:03:17.730> showing<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.060> kind
