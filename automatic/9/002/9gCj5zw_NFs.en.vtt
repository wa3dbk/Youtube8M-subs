I<00:00:59.960> recommend<00:01:00.960> replacing<00:01:01.079> these<00:01:01.500> stickers

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
I recommend replacing these stickers

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.000

popping a piece out we get an obvious

popping a piece out we get an obvious

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
wall only reason I didn't was because I

I<00:03:30.299> recommend<00:03:30.690> this<00:03:31.019> cube<00:03:31.290> not<00:03:31.980> at<00:03:32.129> all<00:03:32.250> in<00:03:32.910> many

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120

ways<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:33.450> cube<00:03:33.629> just<00:03:33.840> seems<00:03:34.019> like<00:03:34.139> a<00:03:34.200> rush

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
ways the cube just seems like a rush

product the design seems to have

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.360

potential<00:03:36.840> but<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:37.079> cube<00:03:37.260> is<00:03:37.349> a<00:03:37.410> mess<00:03:37.709> the

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370
