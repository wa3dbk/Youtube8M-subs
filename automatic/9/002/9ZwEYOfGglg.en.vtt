00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
shiny and oily at the front you find two

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.479 
shiny and oily at the front you find two
speakers<00:03:27.260> I'm<00:03:27.829> not<00:03:28.010> sure<00:03:28.160> what<00:03:28.310> the<00:03:28.370> two

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
speakers I'm not sure what the two

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.670 
speakers I'm not sure what the two
speakers<00:03:28.790> actually<00:03:28.910> do<00:03:29.239> at<00:03:29.390> this<00:03:29.510> point<00:03:29.750> but<00:03:29.989> I

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
speakers actually do at this point but I

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.620 
speakers actually do at this point but I
think<00:03:31.010> it<00:03:31.370> works<00:03:31.549> together<00:03:31.730> for<00:03:32.000> a<00:03:32.180> 2.0

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
think it works together for a 2.0

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.350 
think it works together for a 2.0
channel<00:03:33.079> audio<00:03:33.440> system<00:03:33.829> or<00:03:34.160> audio<00:03:34.549> output<00:03:34.970> so

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
channel audio system or audio output so

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.430 
channel audio system or audio output so
that's<00:03:35.510> pretty<00:03:35.630> good<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:38.690> battery<00:03:39.019> lasts<00:03:39.380> a
