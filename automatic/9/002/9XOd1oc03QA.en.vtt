00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
so hey guys and welcome to my farming

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.760 
so hey guys and welcome to my farming
guide<00:00:02.639> for<00:00:03.120> orokin<00:00:03.419> cells<00:00:03.570> and<00:00:04.080> neurons<00:00:04.319> in

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
guide for orokin cells and neurons in

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.950 
guide for orokin cells and neurons in
warframe<00:00:05.339> I<00:00:05.700> chose<00:00:06.029> those<00:00:06.240> two<00:00:06.299> because<00:00:06.839> they

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
warframe I chose those two because they

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.169 
warframe I chose those two because they
are<00:00:07.020> very<00:00:07.259> rare<00:00:07.680> and<00:00:07.950> they're<00:00:08.309> high<00:00:08.820> in<00:00:08.849> demand

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
are very rare and they're high in demand

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.850 
are very rare and they're high in demand
because<00:00:09.719> they<00:00:09.870> are<00:00:09.929> used<00:00:10.170> in<00:00:10.380> many<00:00:10.590> different

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
because they are used in many different

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.009 
because they are used in many different
crafting<00:00:11.490> recipes<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.240> because<00:00:12.599> people<00:00:12.960> are

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
crafting recipes and because people are

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.780 
crafting recipes and because people are
having<00:00:13.200> trouble<00:00:13.469> farming<00:00:14.130> them<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.460> decided

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
having trouble farming them I decided

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.460 
having trouble farming them I decided
I'll<00:00:14.969> make<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.179> quick<00:00:15.540> guide<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.139> will<00:00:16.260> show

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
I'll make a quick guide and I will show

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.720 
I'll make a quick guide and I will show
you<00:00:16.500> where<00:00:16.800> I<00:00:17.039> farm

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
you where I farm

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.300 
you where I farm
orokin<00:00:18.420> cells<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:18.930> neurons<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:20.039> first

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
orokin cells and neurons and the first

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.340 
orokin cells and neurons and the first
mission<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:20.850> probably<00:00:21.210> my<00:00:21.359> favorite<00:00:21.900> as<00:00:22.050> well

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
mission and probably my favorite as well

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.939 
mission and probably my favorite as well
is<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.830> orokin<00:00:23.100> derelict<00:00:23.760> assassinate<00:00:24.359> aka

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
is the orokin derelict assassinate aka

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.529 
is the orokin derelict assassinate aka
dilettantes<00:00:25.949> mission<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.519> this<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.119> awesome

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
dilettantes mission and this is awesome

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.029 
dilettantes mission and this is awesome
because<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.050> couple<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.380> things<00:00:28.590> first<00:00:28.859> of

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
because of a couple of things first of

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.400 
because of a couple of things first of
all<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.189> don't<00:00:29.460> need<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.730> necrose<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.720> it's

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
all you don't need a necrose and it's

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.530 
all you don't need a necrose and it's
also<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.800> way<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:31.949> get<00:00:32.340> necros<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.329> best

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
also the way to get necros the best

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.030 
also the way to get necros the best
farming<00:00:33.960> frame<00:00:34.260> in<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.500> game<00:00:34.680> because<00:00:35.010> of

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
farming frame in the game because of

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.580 
farming frame in the game because of
desecrate<00:00:35.719> lapham<00:00:36.719> this<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:36.930> also<00:00:37.200> very<00:00:37.440> much

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
desecrate lapham this is also very much

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.470 
desecrate lapham this is also very much
solo<00:00:37.950> bus<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.280> can<00:00:38.430> do<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.760> on<00:00:38.850> your<00:00:38.969> own<00:00:39.059> as

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
solo bus you can do it on your own as

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.660 
solo bus you can do it on your own as
long<00:00:39.510> as<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:39.989> have<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.410> tanky<00:00:40.860> frame<00:00:41.129> like<00:00:41.430> the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
long as you have a tanky frame like the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.389 
long as you have a tanky frame like the
Rhino<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.420> an<00:00:43.110> automatic<00:00:43.739> weapon<00:00:43.890> that's<00:00:44.280> at

Rhino and an automatic weapon that's at

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.950 
Rhino and an automatic weapon that's at
least<00:00:44.430> half<00:00:44.789> decent<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.539> in<00:00:45.629> this<00:00:45.750> footage

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
least half decent and in this footage

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.350 
least half decent and in this footage
I'm<00:00:46.260> using<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.770> normal<00:00:46.950> soma<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:48.030> mission

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
I'm using the normal soma this mission

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.299 
I'm using the normal soma this mission
is<00:00:48.450> also<00:00:48.809> very<00:00:49.079> fast<00:00:49.350> as<00:00:49.649> long<00:00:49.800> as<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.070> rush

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
is also very fast as long as you rush

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.100 
is also very fast as long as you rush
past<00:00:50.610> all<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.149> enemies<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.780> just<00:00:51.960> go

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
past all the enemies and just go

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.680 
past all the enemies and just go
straight<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.739> Fontes<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.250> each<00:00:53.820> head<00:00:54.390> or

straight to the Fontes and each head or

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.810 
straight to the Fontes and each head or

tentacle of levanti's is in phase one

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.330 
tentacle of levanti's is in phase one
has<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.300> chance<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.899> dropping<00:00:58.109> one<00:00:58.559> orokin<00:00:59.070> cell

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
has a chance of dropping one orokin cell

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.000 
has a chance of dropping one orokin cell
or<00:00:59.579> one<00:01:00.059> new<00:01:00.420> route<00:01:00.600> sometimes<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.649> will<00:01:01.829> get

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
or one new route sometimes you will get

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.250 
or one new route sometimes you will get
to<00:01:02.340> orokin<00:01:02.730> cells<00:01:02.760> in<00:01:03.149> Phase<00:01:03.329> one<00:01:03.359> once<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:04.080> even

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
to orokin cells in Phase one once I even

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260 
to orokin cells in Phase one once I even
got<00:01:04.530> three<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.159> then<00:01:05.610> when<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.820> go<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.939> Phase

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
got three and then when you go to Phase

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.170 
got three and then when you go to Phase
two<00:01:06.299> any<00:01:06.750> fall<00:01:06.960> down<00:01:07.229> Lafont<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.159> himself<00:01:08.400> also

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
two any fall down Lafont is himself also

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.210 
two any fall down Lafont is himself also
as<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> chance<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.229> dropping<00:01:10.380> either<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.979> new

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
as a chance of dropping either a new

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.609 
as a chance of dropping either a new
route<00:01:11.400> or<00:01:11.700> an<00:01:12.030> orokin<00:01:12.479> cell<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.350> as<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.500> can

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
route or an orokin cell so as you can

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.679 
route or an orokin cell so as you can
see<00:01:13.680> here<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.580> mission<00:01:14.880> summary<00:01:15.210> screen<00:01:15.420> I

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
see here on the mission summary screen I

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.719 
see here on the mission summary screen I
got<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.140> rock<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.530> cells<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:16.890> one<00:01:17.130> nirodh<00:01:17.490> from

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
got to rock in cells and one nirodh from

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.789 
got to rock in cells and one nirodh from
this<00:01:17.909> run<00:01:18.150> which<00:01:18.390> took<00:01:18.600> me<00:01:18.840> somewhere<00:01:19.590> between

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
this run which took me somewhere between

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.249 
this run which took me somewhere between
four<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.369> five<00:01:20.580> minutes<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.600> that's<00:01:22.020> pretty

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
four and five minutes and that's pretty

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.840 
four and five minutes and that's pretty
much<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.590> only<00:01:22.890> mission<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.310> does<00:01:23.580> not

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
much the only mission that does not

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.060 
much the only mission that does not
require<00:01:24.060> necros<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:24.900> it's<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.710> way<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.860> get

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
require necros and it's the way to get

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.920 
require necros and it's the way to get
necro<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.490> it's<00:01:26.640> pretty<00:01:26.820> good<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.240> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
necro so it's pretty good and the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.899 
necro so it's pretty good and the
missions<00:01:28.229> from<00:01:28.380> now<00:01:28.619> on<00:01:28.890> don't<00:01:29.520> require

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
missions from now on don't require

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.300 
missions from now on don't require
necros<00:01:30.420> but<00:01:30.960> they<00:01:31.320> are<00:01:31.439> infinitely<00:01:32.100> better

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
necros but they are infinitely better

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.609 
necros but they are infinitely better
with<00:01:32.759> necros<00:01:33.329> that's<00:01:33.659> desecrating<00:01:34.380> all<00:01:34.500> the

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
with necros that's desecrating all the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.230 
with necros that's desecrating all the
time<00:01:34.799> because<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.189> increases<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.820> chance<00:01:36.090> of

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
time because it increases the chance of

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.109 
time because it increases the chance of
you<00:01:36.390> getting<00:01:36.720> one<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.020> these<00:01:37.229> resources

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
you getting one of these resources

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.969 
you getting one of these resources
significantly<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.659> orokin<00:01:40.200> cells<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.770> best

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
significantly so orokin cells the best

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.069 
significantly so orokin cells the best
mission<00:01:41.250> for<00:01:41.610> me<00:01:41.759> if<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:42.060> don't<00:01:42.299> want<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.689> run<00:01:42.869> an

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
mission for me if I don't want to run an

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.929 
mission for me if I don't want to run an
overly<00:01:43.649> specific<00:01:43.860> group<00:01:44.340> which<00:01:44.549> I'll<00:01:44.729> talk

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
overly specific group which I'll talk

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.600 
overly specific group which I'll talk
about<00:01:45.000> later<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:46.380> one<00:01:46.649> on<00:01:46.799> Jupiter<00:01:47.399> it's

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
about later is this one on Jupiter it's

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.370 
about later is this one on Jupiter it's
a<00:01:47.729> survival<00:01:48.299> mission<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:48.689> you're<00:01:48.840> fighting<00:01:49.079> a

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
a survival mission so you're fighting a

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.230 
a survival mission so you're fighting a
steady<00:01:49.680> stream<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:50.009> enemies<00:01:50.159> it's<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.939> dark

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
steady stream of enemies it's a dark

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.480 
steady stream of enemies it's a dark
sector<00:01:51.720> mission<00:01:52.049> which<00:01:52.350> means<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:53.040> has<00:01:53.280> a

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
sector mission which means it has a

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.280 
sector mission which means it has a
higher<00:01:53.970> chance<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.720> dropping<00:01:55.640> resources<00:01:56.640> and

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
higher chance of dropping resources and

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.530 
higher chance of dropping resources and
you<00:01:58.290> can<00:01:58.439> do<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.649> solo<00:01:58.890> which<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.820> also<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.270> plus

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
you can do it solo which is also a plus

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.880 
you can do it solo which is also a plus
because<00:02:00.840> sometimes<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.259> don't<00:02:01.380> want<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.680> run

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
because sometimes you don't want to run

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.740 
because sometimes you don't want to run
in<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.070> group<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:03.119> know<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.329> get<00:02:03.570> into

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
in a group and you know you get into

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.179 
in a group and you know you get into
survival<00:02:04.229> you're<00:02:04.560> like<00:02:04.680> okay<00:02:04.950> I'm<00:02:05.040> going<00:02:05.130> to

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
farm some orokin cells and then people

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.389 
farm some orokin cells and then people
want<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.409> finish<00:02:07.710> after<00:02:07.860> five<00:02:08.190> minutes

want to finish after five minutes

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.669 
want to finish after five minutes

you<00:02:16.530> don't<00:02:16.680> want<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:16.980> run<00:02:17.189> an<00:02:17.310> overly<00:02:17.700> specific

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
you don't want to run an overly specific

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.149 
you don't want to run an overly specific

group for Draco which I will talk about

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.460 
group for Draco which I will talk about
in<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.489> minute<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:21.090> you<00:02:21.390> do<00:02:21.599> have<00:02:21.810> necros<00:02:22.230> this

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
in a minute and you do have necros this

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.470 
in a minute and you do have necros this
one<00:02:22.650> is<00:02:22.769> doable<00:02:23.099> without<00:02:23.579> necros<00:02:24.030> but<00:02:24.269> once

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
one is doable without necros but once

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.300 
one is doable without necros but once
again<00:02:24.599> necros<00:02:25.110> increases<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.799> chance<00:02:26.069> of<00:02:26.189> you

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
again necros increases the chance of you

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.520 
again necros increases the chance of you

and<00:03:16.920> weapons<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.940> fastest<00:03:18.690> so<00:03:19.230> if<00:03:19.319> you<00:03:19.410> do

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
and weapons the fastest so if you do

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.740 
and weapons the fastest so if you do
have<00:03:19.889> access<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:20.579> this<00:03:20.730> very<00:03:21.030> specific<00:03:21.540> group

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
have access to this very specific group

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.069 
have access to this very specific group
there<00:03:21.989> is<00:03:22.109> no<00:03:22.590> reason<00:03:23.220> to<00:03:23.790> not<00:03:24.090> do<00:03:24.510> this<00:03:24.750> other

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
there is no reason to not do this other

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.589 
there is no reason to not do this other
than<00:03:25.349> well<00:03:25.709> it's<00:03:26.040> just<00:03:26.160> a<00:03:26.489> snorefest<00:03:26.879> it's

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
than well it's just a snorefest it's

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.140 
than well it's just a snorefest it's
really<00:03:27.930> boring<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.500> do<00:03:29.220> this<00:03:29.459> mission<00:03:29.849> in<00:03:30.000> my

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
really boring to do this mission in my

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.849 
really boring to do this mission in my
opinion<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:30.720> that's<00:03:31.049> it<00:03:31.260> for<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.650> orokin

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
opinion and that's it for the orokin

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.220 
opinion and that's it for the orokin
cells<00:03:31.980> let's<00:03:32.579> move<00:03:32.849> on<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.329> new<00:03:33.599> roads<00:03:33.810> now

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
cells let's move on to new roads now

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.659 
cells let's move on to new roads now
we're<00:03:34.440> going<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.620> go<00:03:34.709> to<00:03:34.769> earth<00:03:35.099> and<00:03:35.430> since

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:35.669 
we're going to go to earth and since

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:37.970 
we're going to go to earth and since

Cambria has been converted to spy we're

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
gonna run Lua or Lu a or tical Tikal I

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.539 
gonna run Lua or Lu a or tical Tikal I
don't<00:03:43.650> know<00:03:43.709> how<00:03:43.799> to<00:03:43.859> pronounce<00:03:44.069> these<00:03:44.340> things

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
don't know how to pronounce these things

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.849 
don't know how to pronounce these things
don't<00:03:44.699> judge<00:03:44.909> me<00:03:45.090> now<00:03:45.720> you<00:03:45.780> can<00:03:46.079> run<00:03:46.470> either

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
don't judge me now you can run either

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.680 
don't judge me now you can run either
one<00:03:47.190> of<00:03:47.220> those<00:03:47.459> it<00:03:47.760> doesn't<00:03:48.090> matter<00:03:48.269> which<00:03:48.479> one

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
one of those it doesn't matter which one

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.899 
one of those it doesn't matter which one
you<00:03:48.810> run<00:03:49.079> but<00:03:49.530> there<00:03:49.739> are<00:03:49.859> slight<00:03:50.190> differences

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:50.909 
you run but there are slight differences

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.180 
you run but there are slight differences
so<00:03:51.150> first<00:03:51.419> of<00:03:51.599> all<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.870> Lua<00:03:52.169> one<00:03:52.440> has<00:03:52.979> the

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
so first of all the Lua one has the

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.750 
so first of all the Lua one has the
standard<00:03:54.079> survival<00:03:55.079> defense<00:03:55.760> excavation

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
standard survival defense excavation

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.569 
standard survival defense excavation
loot<00:03:57.299> table<00:03:57.569> so<00:03:58.229> generally<00:03:59.010> you're<00:03:59.190> gonna<00:03:59.400> get

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
loot table so generally you're gonna get

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.520 
loot table so generally you're gonna get
fewer<00:03:59.940> new<00:04:00.150> roads<00:04:00.419> because<00:04:00.750> it's<00:04:00.900> not<00:04:01.079> a<00:04:01.109> dark

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
fewer new roads because it's not a dark

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.710 
fewer new roads because it's not a dark
sector<00:04:01.979> mission<00:04:02.280> but<00:04:03.030> you're<00:04:03.389> going<00:04:03.510> to<00:04:03.569> get

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
sector mission but you're going to get

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.250 
sector mission but you're going to get
more

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
more

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.939 
more
void<00:04:04.739> keys<00:04:05.099> that<00:04:05.639> being<00:04:05.940> all<00:04:06.150> tier<00:04:06.750> 1<00:04:06.989> to<00:04:07.409> 2<00:04:07.680> and

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:07.949 
void keys that being all tier 1 to 2 and

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:10.819 
void keys that being all tier 1 to 2 and
tier<00:04:08.310> 3<00:04:08.400> keys<00:04:09.209> alright<00:04:09.989> so<00:04:10.169> if<00:04:10.260> you<00:04:10.290> want<00:04:10.590> void

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
tier 3 keys alright so if you want void

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.369 
tier 3 keys alright so if you want void
keys<00:04:11.159> and<00:04:11.489> some<00:04:12.269> new<00:04:12.449> route<00:04:12.659> you<00:04:12.989> should<00:04:13.199> run

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
keys and some new route you should run

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.830 
keys and some new route you should run
Lua<00:04:13.799> now<00:04:14.489> if<00:04:14.790> you<00:04:14.940> run<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.299> Dark<00:04:15.569> Sector

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
Lua now if you run the Dark Sector

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.750 
Lua now if you run the Dark Sector
mission<00:04:16.320> you<00:04:16.530> will<00:04:16.680> of<00:04:16.829> course<00:04:17.039> get<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.400> Dark

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
mission you will of course get the Dark

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.399 
mission you will of course get the Dark
Sector<00:04:18.030> loot<00:04:18.419> table<00:04:18.570> which<00:04:18.870> means<00:04:18.900> you<00:04:19.229> can

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:19.409 
Sector loot table which means you can

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:21.589 
Sector loot table which means you can
get<00:04:19.530> mods<00:04:19.799> like<00:04:20.070> life<00:04:20.400> strike<00:04:20.820> and<00:04:21.060> once<00:04:21.449> again

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
get mods like life strike and once again

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.779 
get mods like life strike and once again
because<00:04:22.049> it<00:04:22.260> is<00:04:22.469> a<00:04:22.740> dark<00:04:23.099> sector<00:04:23.520> mission

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
because it is a dark sector mission

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.070 
because it is a dark sector mission
you're<00:04:24.180> gonna<00:04:24.419> get

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
you're gonna get

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.619 
you're gonna get
more<00:04:25.460> resources<00:04:26.460> because<00:04:26.819> I<00:04:27.120> think<00:04:27.389> it's<00:04:27.509> like

00:04:27.619 --> 00:04:27.629 
more resources because I think it's like

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:30.290 
more resources because I think it's like
15%<00:04:28.080> increased<00:04:29.009> chance<00:04:29.400> I<00:04:29.669> can't<00:04:30.090> read<00:04:30.270> it

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
15% increased chance I can't read it

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.480 
15% increased chance I can't read it
it's<00:04:30.659> too<00:04:30.900> small<00:04:31.169> on<00:04:31.349> my<00:04:31.500> screen<00:04:31.770> but<00:04:32.250> I<00:04:32.280> think

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
it's too small on my screen but I think

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.420 
it's too small on my screen but I think
you<00:04:32.550> get<00:04:32.729> 15%<00:04:33.150> more<00:04:33.780> resource<00:04:34.379> drops<00:04:34.800> from

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
you get 15% more resource drops from

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.790 
you get 15% more resource drops from
enemies<00:04:35.789> so<00:04:36.090> once<00:04:36.539> again<00:04:36.659> if<00:04:36.930> you<00:04:37.139> want<00:04:37.469> some

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
enemies so once again if you want some

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.029 
enemies so once again if you want some
new<00:04:37.979> roads<00:04:38.039> and<00:04:38.370> some<00:04:39.180> void<00:04:39.360> Keys<00:04:39.659> run<00:04:40.319> Lua<00:04:40.620> the

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
new roads and some void Keys run Lua the

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:43.159 
new roads and some void Keys run Lua the
normal<00:04:41.580> excavation<00:04:42.210> mission<00:04:42.479> if<00:04:42.629> you<00:04:42.689> want

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
normal excavation mission if you want

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.159 
normal excavation mission if you want

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
more new routes and maybe maybe get a

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.679 
more new routes and maybe maybe get a

the Dark Sector mission on earth now
just<00:04:51.509> to<00:04:51.599> give<00:04:51.750> you<00:04:51.870> a<00:04:51.900> couple<00:04:52.379> of<00:04:52.620> tips<00:04:52.949> and

just to give you a couple of tips and
tricks<00:04:53.280> I<00:04:53.699> suppose<00:04:54.030> for<00:04:54.270> the<00:04:54.330> excavation

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
tricks I suppose for the excavation

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.800 
tricks I suppose for the excavation
mission<00:04:55.319> you<00:04:55.680> need<00:04:55.919> a<00:04:56.099> running<00:04:56.580> excavator<00:04:57.419> for

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
mission you need a running excavator for

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.110 
mission you need a running excavator for
enemies<00:04:58.319> to<00:04:58.349> spawn<00:04:58.949> if<00:04:59.250> you<00:04:59.520> don't<00:04:59.819> have<00:05:00.030> an

enemies to spawn if you don't have an
excavator<00:05:00.599> enemies<00:05:01.080> will<00:05:01.259> not<00:05:01.289> spawn<00:05:01.770> and<00:05:02.039> if

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
excavator enemies will not spawn and if

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.339 
excavator enemies will not spawn and if
the<00:05:02.460> excavator<00:05:02.969> runs<00:05:03.300> out<00:05:03.539> of<00:05:03.569> power<00:05:03.990> they

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:04.349 
the excavator runs out of power they
