and<00:02:21.750> scissors<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:23.040> I've<00:02:23.250> got<00:02:23.489> some<00:02:24.239> small

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
hand shovels in different sizes you'll

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.400 
hand shovels in different sizes you'll
find<00:02:27.840> that<00:02:28.320> for<00:02:28.860> different<00:02:29.220> jobs<00:02:29.930> one<00:02:30.930> shovel

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
find that for different jobs one shovel

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.590 
find that for different jobs one shovel
might<00:02:31.769> be<00:02:32.010> way<00:02:32.370> better<00:02:32.519> than<00:02:32.790> another<00:02:33.060> shovel

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
might be way better than another shovel
