hi I'm Alan Lightner with expert village

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.289 
hi I'm Alan Lightner with expert village
we're<00:00:04.410> talking<00:00:04.770> about<00:00:04.890> the<00:00:05.580> role<00:00:05.819> of<00:00:05.850> the

we're talking about the role of the
different<00:00:06.720> instruments<00:00:07.319> in<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.830> steel<00:00:08.069> drum

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
different instruments in the steel drum

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.509 
different instruments in the steel drum
family<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:09.150> how<00:00:10.110> they<00:00:10.320> function<00:00:10.650> in<00:00:11.099> a

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
family and how they function in a

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.490 
family and how they function in a
traditional<00:00:12.059> setting<00:00:12.090> if<00:00:12.750> you're<00:00:13.320> playing

traditional setting if you're playing

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.980 
traditional setting if you're playing
with<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.799> full<00:00:14.160> steel<00:00:14.700> band<00:00:15.030> with<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.599> full

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
range of instruments how the various

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.439 
range of instruments how the various
instruments<00:00:19.320> fit<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:20.670> next<00:00:20.970> one<00:00:21.119> we're<00:00:21.270> going

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
instruments fit the next one we're going

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.230 
instruments fit the next one we're going
to<00:00:21.539> talk<00:00:21.720> about<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.680> double<00:00:23.130> second<00:00:23.730> the

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
to talk about is the double second the

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.640 
to talk about is the double second the
double<00:00:24.600> second<00:00:24.930> we've<00:00:25.019> already<00:00:25.170> spoken<00:00:25.439> about

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
double second we've already spoken about

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.589 
double second we've already spoken about
the<00:00:26.010> tinner<00:00:26.220> pan<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.970> double<00:00:27.330> tinner<00:00:27.480> pan

the tinner pan and the double tinner pan

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.450 
the tinner pan and the double tinner pan
now<00:00:28.410> we're<00:00:28.529> going<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.680> move<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.130> double

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
now we're going to move to the double

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.240 
now we're going to move to the double
second<00:00:29.910> pan<00:00:30.349> which<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.650> instrument<00:00:32.040> that

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
steel band is to also support melody

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.100 
steel band is to also support melody
occasionally<00:01:18.200> but<00:01:20.060> more<00:01:21.060> importantly<00:01:21.930> I

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
occasionally but more importantly I

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.870 
occasionally but more importantly I
would<00:01:22.560> say<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.159> more<00:01:23.610> often<00:01:24.650> to<00:01:25.650> play<00:01:26.070> chords

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
would say and more often to play chords

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.530 
would say and more often to play chords
and<00:01:27.090> rhythm<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:28.670> function<00:01:29.670> as<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.909> guitar

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
and rhythm to function as the guitar

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.179 
and rhythm to function as the guitar
player<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.900> what<00:01:31.350> we<00:01:31.500> might<00:01:31.530> think<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.979> an<00:01:32.130> a

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
player and what we might think of an a

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.789 
player and what we might think of an a
normal<00:01:32.549> kind<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.090> pop<00:01:33.299> situation<00:01:33.960> they're

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
normal kind of pop situation they're

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.850 
normal kind of pop situation they're
going<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.189> support<00:01:35.579> some<00:01:35.790> some<00:01:36.299> melodic<00:01:36.540> ideas

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
going to support some some melodic ideas

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.800 
going to support some some melodic ideas
but<00:01:37.860> mostly<00:01:38.400> it's<00:01:38.729> for<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.030> harmony<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.600> the

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
but mostly it's for the harmony and the

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.980 
but mostly it's for the harmony and the
rhythm<00:01:40.020> there<00:01:40.799> are<00:01:41.070> specific<00:01:41.759> patterns<00:01:42.329> that

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
rhythm there are specific patterns that

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.120 
rhythm there are specific patterns that
double<00:01:43.649> seconds<00:01:44.100> players<00:01:44.399> play<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:46.130> calypso

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
double seconds players play in calypso

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.340 
double seconds players play in calypso
and<00:01:47.159> soca<00:01:47.430> music<00:01:48.270> which<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:48.899> generally<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350

steel<00:01:52.140> bands<00:01:52.350> play<00:01:53.360> I'm<00:01:54.360> going<00:01:54.630> to

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
steel bands play I'm going to

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.380 
steel bands play I'm going to
demonstrate<00:01:55.369> some<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.399> those<00:01:56.579> now<00:01:56.790> I'll<00:01:57.000> start

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
demonstrate some of those now I'll start

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.069 
demonstrate some of those now I'll start
with<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:58.290> first<00:01:58.560> one<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.689> give<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.840> chance

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
with the first one and give you a chance

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.260 
with the first one and give you a chance
to<00:02:01.259> practice<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.159> we'll<00:02:02.399> use<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.969> same

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
to practice that and we'll use that same

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.690 
to practice that and we'll use that same
little<00:02:03.600> melody<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.200> we've<00:02:04.350> been<00:02:04.530> using<00:02:04.829> that

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
little melody that we've been using that
