00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello friends welcome to our 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.540
 our community 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:10.920
 Today I'm going to show you how to support and 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.600
 restore the folder of fs for those who 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.860
 they do not know the folder of fs in which 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.070
 keeps the information of our 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.750
 terminal both the email product code 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.039
 and some other files that makes 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.800
 our have it works in a way 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.380
 optimal and why I tell them to support 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.449
 because sometimes when we install custom 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.789
 rom for what they are fans to try 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.829
 the custom rom 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.730
 sometimes you can delete the folder without 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.220
 that one wants 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.490
 in the procedure is eliminated and if not 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:42.840
 you have done that backup because it is difficult 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:48.240
 what it is to restore and 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:50.670
 or I can write a with a code 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.160
 corrupt email well the only thing we have 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.750
 what to do is the following to do 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.940
 this backup of the fs folder 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.650
 we have to have root access and they 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.190
 I recommend this application that is called 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:04.290
 root explorer as you can see we are in 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.479
 what is the root of what of our 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.190
 terminal and here these in these files 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.500
 are the ones that make our system 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.210
 sandro work properly ok let's go 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.130
 to make a backup of the fs folder 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.380
 as you can see here we have it and these 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.690
 are the files these files are the 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.060
 most important of our terminal them 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.729
 I say those who like to approve question 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.790
 rom always make a copy of our 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.530
 fs folder because if you erase them and 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.810
 they have not done it is difficult what is the 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.869
 I restore to restore our terminal and 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.490
 when we lose that card 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.619
 they offer some installation always in 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.390
 our terminal will be out of network 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.580
 and we will not be able to enter the network of 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.640
 your operator comes the only thing we have 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.110
 what to do is select and we go 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.660
 of says copy 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.780
 and we're just going to copy it in 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:54.180
 our microsd memory on the external and 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.180
 we go where do I go and here where 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.530
 says external sd card we select the 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.240
 folder where we want to have the backup 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:05.430
 from this folder and we give you move here 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.970
 we hope you realize what the 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:13.110
 copy as you can see 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.320
 well already once done this now if 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.780
 we want to compress the only we give to 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:21.260
 compress like zipi and we see that it is 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.260
 compressing 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.770
 As you can see, the folder has been created 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.860
 compressed to this direction let's go 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:35.730
 We're going to move the chip 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.740
 we are going to move him here as they can 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.310
 see we have already done what is the 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.530
 the backup of this folder this step is 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.570
 super important we have to have 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.880
 backed what this folder is because 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.040
 if not at any time we will invite 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.950
 Some rom can give problems can 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.870
 remove that folder and your terminal 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.590
 it will be unusable 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:03.010
 and sometimes it is difficult what is 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.950
 restore for what he is doing is 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:10.810
 subscribe forgiveness overwrite what is 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.510
 email but it's a process that I 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.360
 I see a little 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.510
 complex why I recommend them better 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.730
 do your back well once 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.470
 they have done that support and they are given some 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.520
 problem because the only thing they have to 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.340
 do is 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:31.530
 and you 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:35.430
 leave here let's do it from scratch 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.660
 an example they have and that their terminal 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.370
 they have eliminated what is the 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.010
 fs folder we just have to be a 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.790
 the explorer route we go to the folder 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.980
 where we have 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.580
 copied the 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:52.760
 the support of the FS I in my case what 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:56.390
 I have s 3 the cd backup the only thing 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.150
 what we have to do is copy this 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.670
 folder we give you copy here and once 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.860
 copied we do it we go to the 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.860
 root and as you can see here we have 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.890
 we are not going here as you can see here 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.930
 we have what is the folder fs once 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.300
 that we hit here will tell us 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:19.889
 that is going to overwrite what is this 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:21.269
 folder but combine to give 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.430
 next I will not do it because I have it 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:28.169
 done but first of all we have to 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:30.150
 give ride in rr or if you do not give to that 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:33.240
 option hereu will not be able to restore it 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.250
 then they give him mount hereu and ready 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.650
 once copied they give it to combine and they give it 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.139
 replace all the files and give it to 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.120
 accept and he only replaces once 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:43.770
 done this keeps pressed what is 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.630
 the button off 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.950
 keep it pressed until he alone 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.260
 turn off do not get paid here 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.020
 just keep it pressed and give it 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.120
 to pay and ready to restart the terminal and 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.150
 you will work as I did 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:00.389
 previously well this has been fast 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.700
 what is the backup and the restoration 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:04.560
