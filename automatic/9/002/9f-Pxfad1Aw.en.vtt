00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:06.710
 hello dear people here is the fashion of 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.349
 timo vollenkemper 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:13.700
 this is my first unboxing video for 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:17.070
 my page and for the youtube channel 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:20.910
 Today I want you to be cooler 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:24.390
 master design and 120 v show 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:32.399
 I want to unpack her right here 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:33.809
 would have been in nice rescue on it 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.140
 we the same again standing cooler 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:44.120
 master course tip 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:49.950
 I'll say the cooler and the pump 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:53.370
 hoses exist that the side and 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.829
 once 20 v compatible with intels 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:03.239
 virtually all current sockel also at 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:06.180
 one df m2m 1 mg m3 plus for example 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.020
 even if this is still standing here 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.390
 it is a liquid cpu cooler that you can not 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.119
 Tool for this needs a complete 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:21.750
 radiator and an efficient and blog 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:23.460
 Water can not say I grabbed the 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.790
 crates for you to watch what's inside 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.810
 is 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.810
 I wish you a lot of fun 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:59.010
 we have the manual immediately 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:02:01.020
 listed what else in the still 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:10.649
 show in another video but today 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:19.739
 once 120 then it goes on 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:22.700
 affect many women her brother 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.700
 master is on it 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:38.270
 unloved caviar lobster with three-point 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:46.900
 connection 24 core business with Philip 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:58.760
 Dahm 8 600 to 2400 revolutions problem 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:03:00.709
 the point right what books that 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.110
 means that is the points 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:08.720
 this is the plate then on the cpu 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:10.310
 sits and under it the stickers 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.100
 remove fire 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.390
 the thermal grease is otherwise applied 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.709
 the whole thing could not work 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.950
 is started by a 3 pin 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:24.890
 connection simply plugged from mainburg 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:33.470
 For example, find a system then 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:45.650
 that's even cooler here 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:46.720
 Master on it in a closed 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.829
 system 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.829
 So that your system on good temperature 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.730
 the whole already dismantled 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:10.359
 all fits almost always 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:11.769
 still so against any noise that would like 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:15.540
 mount after the second half 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.540
 screw holes have on both sides 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:26.139
 this one also has a thickness of 25 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.949
 cm and the fan that means in total 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:28.949
 amazon 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:05:10.270
 assembly material respective fraction frank 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.740
 plate once again internally once 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:20.180
 Divide yourself then put it like that 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:23.960
 you would tremble for the iron 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.580
 I want to hang up by Finkenberg 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:31.729
 show you in another video 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:35.740
 still a few screws will be synonymous 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:35.740
 spacer and woman 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:42.740
 the most important is always very nice though 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:49.040
 you have it with you, that's it 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:49.790
 thermal grease natural color 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.200
 applied 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:57.250
 a bit spread too much to 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:01.150
 you can make the whole tree 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:04.520
 this I would say the first time on block 5 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:07.040
 fight back then the assembly in 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.970
 we will show you another video 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.590
 look at the box once 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:16.250
 everything stands for pressure what was so 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:18.890
 cpu only support then the dimension 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:22.190
 the whole story so how big 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:24.500
 Thick the radiator is made of aluminum for 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:27.290
 example we stand then we have 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:31.750
 here the fan new level that is the 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:40.250
 Leaves of the air some connect 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:42.020
 this one between 19 and 40 dba one can 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:45.860
 still live well in any case with 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:48.860
 not too loud for the connection and what 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:52.850
 What you have so beard 600 women 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:55.340
 thanks be that power it was then first 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.930
 to an unboxing video thank you 

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.550
 Message heart not at the company 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.470
 krÃ¼ger measure me the whole to 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:03.680
 must have provided for you 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.250
 unpack and yes I hope you had 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.360
 fun 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:11.530
 I wish you a nice day 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:11.530
 to day
