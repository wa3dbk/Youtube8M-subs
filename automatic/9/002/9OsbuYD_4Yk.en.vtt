00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:11.580
 I just detach his shirt back up 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.120
 you eat the biennial death and that's it 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.350
 go david bernard hi joe the difference 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.029
 between a pessimist nor optimist 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.130
 important to know but no it's 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.029
 true yes because it allows us to 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.560
 muscle actually makes the muscle of optimism 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.519
 it gets muscle either you knew it no 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.779
 only to go further we will put 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.490
 some things in context because 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.779
 you understand what optimism is 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.610
 so I 'll get them anyway 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.420
 far enough either the larousse thinks of 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.850
 pay attention here optimism miss me 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.309
 I say of the human being a state of mind 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.680
 who perceives the world and the universe of 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.200
 positive way the world the foundation 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.700
 of optimism goes back to Socrates Platon 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.039
 the prophecy and then of oneself 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.289
 aristotle anymore today you grosso 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.600
 modo I say if Plato and Aristotle 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.219
 created you speak of optimistic I think that 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.850
 you play I embark collecting 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.770
 think now 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.750
 and then I thought why not 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.930
 put it even simpler than sow and 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.970
 you the most immersed summary possible 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.280
 but the tension along the series is going 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.170
 maybe shock it's a fault 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.270
 by the way leaving hockey so so 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.580
 there are three major types of 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.259
 people first being the 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:26.939
 pessimistic then the pessimists to 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:28.759
 others and to the world it is realistic to a 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.070
 scratch me I hear it's a bit like that 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.390
 and finally there are the optimists and 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.130
 the optimists of what they do it's 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.079
 that they are trying to look a little bit more 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.600
 far than lows at km 40 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.920
 Touati stays in the arcade 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.490
 below the poop 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.310
 well I had not seen him worried so so 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.030
 the great aaa sphere to bring back to 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.649
 this conclusion 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.840
 the big difference between 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.869
 optimistic and pessimistic is that 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.700
 the optimists they train to challenge 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.740
 gravity 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.630
 it's a cosmic goose of the gravity of 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.770
 so does pull down so natural 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.659
 best moment the trend 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.459
 exactly there are difficult times 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.770
 or three are more likely to see the 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.610
 dog poop drying appliances and 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.710
 so the question is when 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.020
 licra do you make the decision 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.110
 to make a conscious effort to challenge 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.640
 gravity and back up to observe 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.590
 what is going up or is it 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.000
 that you dream focus and towards 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.700
 problematic and Croatian 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.680
 so then to beef up his optimism 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.120
 yes three shocks all that is what they 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.130
 grant and courage and fear 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.130
 to have a moment that it comes 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.340
 so so three stages of 5 the first 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.380
 stele jean euphele conscious effort of 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.760
 challenge gravity ok i'm taking a step in 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.320
 before life before doing two for you 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.510
 I'm not here to sell a formula 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.400
 magical labro their success the ch'ti who 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.810
 personal growth does not exist 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.390
 not hockey that you have to do 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.550
 a conscious effort the second pose yourself 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.709
 a question called reframing you 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.930
 so three change the frame be changed 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.480
 your perception in this case is there 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.360
 something positive that I do not have 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.590
 still noticed in the situation so 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.420
 that's what it forces you to do is 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.739
 just to see the poop all the 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.340
 do you say is this something I 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.780
 feel good so you force a 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.400
 noticed what works what 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.049
 could possibly work and 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.390
 the third you use a mantra 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.760
 Scottish well interesting I am 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.190
 curious to discover what this 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.200
 situation will make me you how is the 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.720
 world will make me evolve or grow to 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.190
 middle term so from below in the universe 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.870
 which obviously will make you evolve 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.580
 by little more complicated than that three 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.049
 steps all five listen thank you 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.709
 infinitely of the city it was 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.130
 interesting when your story of 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.600
 europe 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.950
 but now me because I'm going to have 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.209
 a little dog poop in the street I 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.250
 may be tempted to lift it 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.049
 to see 504 after all of a thing 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.610
 for those for whom it is difficult 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.080
 to be optimistic martin luther king 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.480
 said that I love it the real thing 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.430
 grandeur of a man is not measured 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.989
 moms he is comfortable but when 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.180
 are going through a period of controversy and 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.470
 of challenges quite than thank you for being here 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.560
 in the stuffing menus but that's 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.560
 perhaps
