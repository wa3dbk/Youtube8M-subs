00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:04.449
 President, KCC 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:10.249
 Initially 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:11.810
 Active as a full-time writer 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.810
 I will. 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.939
 I'm doing business mainly 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.149
 I'm doing this for the abdominal foreign exchange setup. 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.920
 Well, plus that. 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.089
 We also have performances. 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:30.470
 Fourth, I went to one team reading each time. 

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:33.340
 I designed more than twice the nation 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.500
 Mindel 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.490
 There is no 50,000 action principle, 700 million 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.490
 I thought it would not be the same again. 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.810
 It is important to expect that 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.320
 by meredith If the elderly thinks that osen is an extension to the skin 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.050
 I think the native game rash is the same as 51 years old 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.810
 There is also a nickname there that turns into a riot and so overcome 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.420
 You have a poison thing. 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.810
 I'm not doing it. 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.320
 So one 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.050
 Would I have had a presence base? 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.680
 Also, 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.159
 I have a lot of time, 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.990
 The mind is also vulnerable to the atmosphere, 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.619
 If the amount 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.990
 No matter how much I feel 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.470
 You can put your car in a 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.689
 I have a pain in my body, 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:31.330
 Remain important to his team coming out 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.950
 Yeah. I'll give it to the front team. 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.930
 And I feel so sick, 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.110
 I was sick. 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.860
 That I should hurt me 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.660
 Well I do not know because it hurts the next day 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.680
 And slender 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.110
 I would not have done that. 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.800
 I can not. 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.600
 I thought I had a career that I could not understand. 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.300
 this is 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.790
 How can I be such a pain? 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.580
 I was too sick to go to the hospital 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.100
 On a senior agenda 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.760
 Beyond 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.760
 Especially if you say you're sick, 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.769
 As CEO. 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.939
 How did you get together and ask this question? 

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:14.969
 I'll put you right there. 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:17.419
 I can not be sensitive. 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:21.299
 The election of the chairman of the hospital in the hospital raised 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.319
 When I said it was sick, 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.900
 The bus was exactly 44 cents a day for Dell 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:32.599
 I was thinking. 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.639
 When I was admitted to the hospital 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:38.629
 All the patients are worth it. 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.639
 Will 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:43.629
 No matter how the industry has to be Kanno, 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:44.329
 People 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.779
 Can not it hurt? so 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:51.969
 However, we have to build consensus and study 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:52.890
 I wanted to 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.599
 But what I thought was the most competitive competition 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:02.409
 Such extreme symptoms of non-vocal 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:07.289
 I did not know that the effort was already over 5.3 

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:09.809
 At this time of neon listening to moss 

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:12.809
 And more important 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:14.939
 b National @ 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:17.939
 when the knife is stuck or does not 

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:20.239
 Continue 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.969
 It's a big problem 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:25.969
 It looks like Kolon was exposed. 

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:29.539
 I have an aspect. so 

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:32.539
 I think so. 

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:35.379
 Desire or 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:36.670
 Then it can be done 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.159
 Hope that was not there Frustrated hope Those things were in the rain 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:42.839
 1004 

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:46.549
 A curtain of size may be an illegal symptom 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:47.419
 I will. 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:51.930
 So that's where I made it myself. Besides 

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:54.939
 If you can create food and people 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.499
 At the very least I thought I might be able to get treatment 

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:05.719
 But when he was having fun mosquitoes popping up at the time 

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:09.509
 It is the infinite, 

00:04:10.779 --> 00:04:12.499
 I also have rides. 

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:16.419
 So they can feel some pleasure when it's four teams 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.729
 I thought it was. so 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.560
 To the people, 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.159
 As a recreation or amusing game, 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:27.099
 which 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:30.099
 So the impact of Seoul 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.860
 I made an exchange. 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.570
 Without having memories 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.629
 Through each other's memories 

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:41.479
 I have my medicines 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:46.259
 I am happy to be healed and to be an audience, 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:47.069
 How 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:49.309
 more 

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:52.849
 I wonder if I could have a fun story. 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:56.009
 I thought I might be interested in it.
