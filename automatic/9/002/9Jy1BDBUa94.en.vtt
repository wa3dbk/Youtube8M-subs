 direct updates of this rom to 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.340
 this version is characterized by being a 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.489
 rom pretty stable to be based on the 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.160
 roma I was 4.1.2 but adding 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.289
 visuals and special features 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.699
 s 3000 to be able to start with this 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:50.710
 tutorial we need to meet some 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.690
 requirements the first of them is 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.760
 have downloaded the rom and have it 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.500
 copied to internal or external memory 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.910
 from our device the rumba will be 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.500
 here in the description of the video where 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.429
 you will download it from the direct link 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.690
 and copy it from your computer to your s 3 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:06.610
 min and as if it were a file 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.230
 completely normal the second 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.420
 requirement to be able to install this 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.820
 rom is being a root user on your computer and 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.370
 have flashed some advanced recovery 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.970
 the advanced coating can be this w 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.530
 cwv recovery so if you do not know how 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.270
 be a root user or you do not have precious 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.130
 double cd review me the description of 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.110
 video where we have our tutorial 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.180
 step by step as a requirement 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.680
 important we mention that you must 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.140
 Back up all your information 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.000
 files messages applications and everything 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.590
 others that you have important in the 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.630
 internal memory of the computer as 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.700
 we will perform a clean installation and 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.590
 this will remove any type of file 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.450
 that you have in the internal memory of your 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.369
 phone after you have downloaded the 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.140
 rom to copy it the memory of our 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.149
 team be root user and have arrow 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.369
 of the double cd or in recovery we can 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.320
 start with the tutorial the first step and 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.229
 very important then it is to turn our 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.210
 team let's turn it off and let's go 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.310
 in recovery mode the recovery mode 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.990
 we can enter directly to him leaving 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.149
 press the volume keys up 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.440
 the home key and the power key to 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.810
 same time so let's leave 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.300
 sustained so that our 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.580
 team one more time and then we can 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.290
 enter in this way that in our 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.390
 tutorial of the rut we already explained you well 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.549
 how it works after a couple of 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.330
 seconds we can let go as we are 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.000
 inside him 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.410
 and remember that we can move with 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.420
 the volume keys up and down or 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.970
 simply select the option 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.350
 touching it live on the screen 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.970
 First of all, we're going to eliminate everything 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.650
 trace of files that are contained 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.820
 in our team to perform this 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.440
 clean installation the first thing that 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.520
 we have to do is select the 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.010
 option that says high invoice web 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.080
 ricet we move and select the 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.300
 option if we let the team here 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.680
 do the work after this we are going to 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.420
 select the option that is equal ph 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.030
 partition to remove any other 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.930
 type of garbage that stays hosted 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.070
 in our team 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.780
 after this we are going to look 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.070
 quickly the rom depending where 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.630
 you have copied it we selected 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.000
 the option to install if you promise to leave 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.090
 your reports if you are in the 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.340
 internal or external memory when explaining whether 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.770
 is in your memory microsd in our 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.810
 case we select the internal one we look for 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.760
 our folder where we copied 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.470
 our rom and we're going to select the 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.410
 breaks is here is missing in its version 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.810
 1.5 we give it to you and let's start 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.610
 with this installation here then 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.650
 begins the installation of the rom the 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.360
 process takes approximately 3 to 5 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.130
 minutes and we just have to wait 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.350
 that this progress bar ends 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.140
 to be able to finish with is installed 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.730
 after a couple of ten minutes 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.680
 precisely five we have this message 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.260
 what says install for medicare complete 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.690
 then we can move to the 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.880
 part up and give here what says go 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.190
 back and then the first option that is 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.080
 took the system we pressed it and 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.970
 then let's wait for the team 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.040
 restart and make the first boot 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.050
 remember that this one takes a little bit more 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.400
 Time to be first and then we will 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.770
 where are you arranging all the files 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.290
 we can only wait to be able 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.690
 start using our this 3 mini 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.430
 with this new clothes well ready already 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.050
 we are starting our branch here 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.760
 we are simply going to configure all 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.800
 our parameters like what is the 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.530
 language our google account and so on 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.690
 wireless networks so let's go to 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.370
 configure and we continue once 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.100
 entering the break we can find 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.140
 that is completely empty and this what 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.700
 they make for our rom so be 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.710
 much faster here simply 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.080
 we can add all our widgets 

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:25.840
 launchers customizations inclusive 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.520
 everything we want to add the text 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.530
 because it is completely empty as 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.000
 you can see and change a bit here what 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.790
 it's the dow that are 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.920
 where is a custom launcher and 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.320
 As you can see, there are some 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.870
 applications with which it comes by 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.700
 default is this rom already has the root 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.070
 browser obviously have the permissions 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.770
 of superuser already active to be able 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.180
 install ex post modules comes inclusive 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.050
 with a pre-installed version of 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.090
 whatsapp and then obviously there the 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.430
 lamp that always comes to be used 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.410
 at any time so let's go 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.240
 reviewing a bit so they can be given 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.700
 account of how many visual improvements 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.250
 contain and to begin with we have 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.320
 is the notification bar in the 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.630
 top part that modifies the 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.890
 visuals here all blue here 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:16.419
 we can use these two to be able to 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:19.480
 give our team a better look 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:21.850
 we have this multitasking button here 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.440
 we can press it and well there we have 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.169
 all our applications that are 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.970
 active or inactive and good too 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:29.380
 we can go directly to the 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.770
 configuration of our team here 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.750
 we can see 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.270
 in our team because it is a 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.580
 version 4.1.2 on which it is based 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.110
 this branch is a version of living it 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.180
 which assures us that it will be a 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.819
 quite stable version in our 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.430
 equipment the camera also works to the 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:49.220
 perfection as we can see here to be 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.530
 based on this breaks stock works without 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.960
 problems as well as the camera 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.940
 front and all recording modes 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.800
 the most striking of the rom undoubtedly 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.800
 this person vision in blue of the 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.800
 tous which also give you that 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:06.919
 unique touch to this rom , however, 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:09.349
 beyond the visual part it ensures 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:11.750
 have an extremely good performance 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:13.880
 in terms of battery and also in the 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.580
 performance with other applications 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.650
 the fast rom enter into category one of 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.380
 the best roms you can install in 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.639
 your s 3 mini is pretty good in that 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.550
 to performance as we already had 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:27.650
 mentioned and the battery yields quite 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.440
 well so if you have one of 3 mini and 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.240
 you like the stock mode because you do not want 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.719
