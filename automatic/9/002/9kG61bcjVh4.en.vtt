00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
during nothing new November but maybe

00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:59.650 
during nothing new November but maybe
you<00:00:58.219> guys<00:00:58.370> will<00:00:58.550> see<00:00:58.699> why<00:00:58.820> I<00:00:58.850> had<00:00:59.149> to<00:00:59.300> get<00:00:59.449> them

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
you guys will see why I had to get them

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.569 
you guys will see why I had to get them
and<00:00:59.960> I<00:01:00.019> did<00:01:00.230> end<00:01:00.469> up<00:01:00.559> finding<00:01:00.800> a<00:01:01.309> Christmas

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
and I did end up finding a Christmas

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.000 
and I did end up finding a Christmas
present<00:01:02.000> for<00:01:02.329> my<00:01:02.390> mom<00:01:02.719> which<00:01:03.440> I<00:01:03.589> can't<00:01:03.800> show

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
present for my mom which I can't show

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.890 
present for my mom which I can't show
you<00:01:04.070> because<00:01:04.339> she<00:01:04.640> watches<00:01:05.000> these<00:01:05.180> videos<00:01:05.300> but

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
you because she watches these videos but

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.570 
you because she watches these videos but
I<00:01:05.960> did<00:01:06.200> end<00:01:06.350> up<00:01:06.440> finding<00:01:06.650> something<00:01:07.100> for<00:01:07.430> her

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
I did end up finding something for her

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.690 
I did end up finding something for her
so<00:01:08.020> maybe<00:01:09.020> it<00:01:09.200> offsets<00:01:09.410> the<00:01:09.890> fact<00:01:10.100> that<00:01:10.220> I<00:01:10.430> shop

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
so maybe it offsets the fact that I shop

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.300 
so maybe it offsets the fact that I shop
during<00:01:11.000> nothing<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:11.480> November<00:01:12.020> maybe<00:01:12.620> no
