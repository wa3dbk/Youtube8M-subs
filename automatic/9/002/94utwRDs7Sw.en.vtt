00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:16.060
 2015 we are at the stand marker with since 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.490
 beautiful with stefano martinello that yes 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.260
 he is in charge of group marketing 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.570
 we are here to talk about a product 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.890
 particular product that won one 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.220
 important world therefore product 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:30.040
 of the year for ispo awards 2015 it is 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.689
 of market keeping and of which we want 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.510
 to know a little of everything 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.980
 in particular how mark had arrived at 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.420
 this product and what its are 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.000
 intentions 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.399
 hello well surely a novelty 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.550
 regarding the market a little 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:49.539
 let's say the del light attack of the 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:53.879
 freeride a dedicated attack above all 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:56.559
 to those who now want to join the climb with 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.449
 to then have a descent with 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.420
 certain characteristics above all 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:05.140
 let's say security so the attack is 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:08.050
 then an attack was studied from scratch 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.270
 totally new an attack with with i 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.130
 pin then with the classic one what 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.350
 it is called classically attacking 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.810
 but with the characteristic of having one 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.170
 he will pursue a downhill career 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:23.400
 just for one for a speech of 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.470
 security and transmission of movements 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.570
 a very interesting attack and a lot 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.460
 important for 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.940
 for the ski trade for everything 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:37.790
 what is the new idea of scilla 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:40.550
 new idea of ​​freeride therefore lightness 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.920
 a very intuitive attack after it 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.070
 we will also see technically explained e 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.920
 especially what we care about 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.780
 we want to underline a speech by di 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.400
 safety 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.400
 for which it was studied 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.720
 arthur lanthaler the task of explaining us 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:18.080
 the technical functions of this ping ping 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.420
 the operation of that brand 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.290
 kingpin so very very easy 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.769
 entering the tip practically introduced 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.980
 I push down and the attack closes 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:34.329
 automatically without much pressure if 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.760
 I go up the ros on that handle 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:39.950
 the front attack closed at that time 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.560
 I can't get out 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.799
 if I go uphill I always leave it 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.989
 myth closed that lever back 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.989
 I crush down 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.620
 the stop is automatically locked 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:56.780
 the attack closes and then they are uphill 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.840
 the situation I am with the ball 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:03.349
 always here on the stop and this is already a 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.650
 rise with the tip stick 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:09.409
 or even with the rollers with the nets 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:13.160
 rotelline I can open the ulss 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:17.180
 attack on 7 degrees or for this 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.700
 part still at 13 degrees 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.419
 if I want to go a little closer 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.690
 descent also with seal skins la 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:29.030
 possibility of opening the attack raise a 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.849
 near the foot, bring the lever in 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.400
 ahead crush down and go 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:39.169
 automatically downhill though I have to 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.639
 open front on the ski module when I have it 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:44.319
 made that descent even with skins 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:48.459
 from head to toe from behind 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:51.829
 I lift my foot and bring the lever back 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:54.169
 I automatically go back down it 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:56.810
 stopo closes the attack is closed and me 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:59.090
 I'm already maneuvering to go again 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.889
 uphill 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:05.510
 I don't have to leave the attack either 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:09.169
 downhill not even important uphill 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:13.639
 here we have six springs up front there 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:16.880
 more pressure to tip this a maneuver 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:19.489
 forward even if it should fall here 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.849
 uphill it doesn't even open practically 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.140
 sometimes it happens coelho here from 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:26.030
 point of view of the transmission of 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.800
 impulses especially downhill because 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.650
 then this too is the part that interests you 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.870
 just the freeriders have an attack that 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.830
 it's like an attack from virtually 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.570
 down and this seems to be like that 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.479
 does it transmit the movements in this 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:44.450
 so effective manner in descent and so that 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:48.320
 here in tip like I said before we have 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:52.250
 the six mole where already more strength on 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:55.570
 tips and from behind is so practically the 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:59.330
 open heel when that entered that 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:01.849
 powetrain smith the clichés the fair close 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.969
 and automatically here on the heel 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:07.340
 we have that very very wide 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:09.979
 pressure and the foot is very much 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.760
 stable inside the attack the more we have 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:17.990
 the outside where the attack is fixed on 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:21.529
 skis on 38 mm even on the widest skis 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.810
 or more security plus stability well 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:29.889
 we thank the lanthaler mountain guide 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:29.889
 from the stand marker from the beautiful ispo 2015
