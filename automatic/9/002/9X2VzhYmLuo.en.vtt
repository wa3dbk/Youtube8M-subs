when you turn it on over here to the
driver's<00:02:30.020> side<00:02:31.210> there's<00:02:32.210> the<00:02:32.420> wood<00:02:32.600> trim

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.800 
driver's side there's the wood trim
again<00:02:34.580> it<00:02:34.760> looks<00:02:34.880> like<00:02:34.970> a<00:02:35.030> pet<00:02:35.240> was<00:02:35.360> probably

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
again it looks like a pet was probably

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.720 
again it looks like a pet was probably
hanging<00:02:36.620> in<00:02:36.830> this<00:02:36.950> window<00:02:37.310> here<00:02:37.490> and

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
hanging in this window here and

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.950 
hanging in this window here and
scratched<00:02:38.690> and<00:02:38.870> clawed<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:39.230> soft<00:02:39.470> wood<00:02:40.960> and

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
scratched and clawed the soft wood and

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.010 
scratched and clawed the soft wood and
here's<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.470> door<00:02:42.650> handle<00:02:43.010> again<00:02:44.020> probably

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
here's the door handle again probably

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.470 
here's the door handle again probably
from<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:45.530> pet<00:02:45.910> outside<00:02:46.910> of<00:02:47.030> that<00:02:47.120> if<00:02:47.240> that's<00:02:47.360> the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
from a pet outside of that if that's the

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.020 
from a pet outside of that if that's the
worst<00:02:47.660> thing<00:02:47.810> I<00:02:47.870> had<00:02:47.960> to<00:02:48.020> say<00:02:48.170> about<00:02:48.200> it<00:02:48.970> now<00:02:49.970> if

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
worst thing I had to say about it now if

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.430 
worst thing I had to say about it now if
I<00:02:50.090> go<00:02:50.210> around<00:02:50.300> here<00:02:50.690> you<00:02:50.840> can<00:02:50.960> see<00:02:51.110> in<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.260> back

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
I go around here you can see in the back

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.140 
I go around here you can see in the back
window<00:02:51.740> again<00:02:52.250> where<00:02:52.400> that<00:02:52.430> rust<00:02:52.730> was<00:02:52.910> you<00:02:53.030> can

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
window again where that rust was you can

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.630 
window again where that rust was you can
see<00:02:53.270> in<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.420> hats<00:02:53.660> shelf<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:55.280> so<00:02:55.460> you'll<00:02:55.610> see

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
see in the hats shelf and so you'll see

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.010 
see in the hats shelf and so you'll see
some<00:02:55.790> water<00:02:56.150> damage<00:02:56.570> and<00:02:56.600> then<00:02:56.750> in<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:56.900> back

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
some water damage and then in the back

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.690 
some water damage and then in the back
shelf<00:02:57.320> it<00:02:57.500> probably<00:02:57.920> held<00:02:58.100> water<00:02:58.280> at<00:02:58.550> one

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
shelf it probably held water at one

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.250 
shelf it probably held water at one
point<00:02:58.880> or<00:02:59.030> another<00:02:59.060> I<00:02:59.480> don't<00:02:59.840> know<00:02:59.960> where<00:03:00.140> the

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
point or another I don't know where the

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.630 
point or another I don't know where the
water<00:03:00.440> came<00:03:00.620> in<00:03:00.830> because<00:03:00.890> the<00:03:01.070> seals<00:03:01.430> look

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
water came in because the seals look

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.340 
water came in because the seals look
good<00:03:01.850> back<00:03:02.150> here<00:03:02.950> it<00:03:03.950> looked<00:03:04.190> like<00:03:05.350> nowhere

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
good back here it looked like nowhere

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.320 
good back here it looked like nowhere
whatsoever<00:03:06.910> but<00:03:07.910> it<00:03:07.970> could<00:03:08.150> have<00:03:08.240> been

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
whatsoever but it could have been

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.670 
whatsoever but it could have been
repaired<00:03:08.660> and<00:03:08.780> this<00:03:08.930> is<00:03:09.080> probably<00:03:09.380> a<00:03:09.470> scent

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
repaired and this is probably a scent

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.340 
repaired and this is probably a scent
another<00:03:09.890> item<00:03:10.100> that<00:03:10.480> has<00:03:11.480> yet<00:03:11.750> to<00:03:11.870> be<00:03:11.990> repaired

another item that has yet to be repaired

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.970 
another item that has yet to be repaired

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
walk around here and open the trunk area

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:27.990 
walk around here and open the trunk area
give<00:03:20.930> you<00:03:21.020> a<00:03:21.050> look<00:03:21.140> in<00:03:21.290> there

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.690 

and<00:03:29.000> there's<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:29.600> trunk<00:03:29.840> you<00:03:30.430> can<00:03:31.430> see<00:03:31.610> over

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
and there's the trunk you can see over

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.950 
and there's the trunk you can see over
there<00:03:31.850> in<00:03:31.910> the<00:03:32.000> corners<00:03:32.360> there's<00:03:32.510> possibly

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:32.960 
there in the corners there's possibly

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.660 
there in the corners there's possibly
some<00:03:33.170> water<00:03:33.440> damage<00:03:34.070> from<00:03:34.400> that<00:03:34.600> water<00:03:35.600> stains

some water damage from that water stains

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.650 
some water damage from that water stains
outside<00:03:37.670> that<00:03:37.850> the<00:03:37.970> trunk<00:03:38.240> is<00:03:38.360> actually<00:03:38.600> in

outside that the trunk is actually in

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.150 
outside that the trunk is actually in
pretty<00:03:38.690> good<00:03:38.960> condition<00:03:39.290> for<00:03:39.800> a<00:03:39.830> car<00:03:40.010> that's

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
pretty good condition for a car that's

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.230 
pretty good condition for a car that's
30<00:03:40.400> years<00:03:40.640> old<00:03:42.130> so<00:03:43.130> it's<00:03:43.250> a<00:03:43.280> great<00:03:43.550> project<00:03:43.850> car

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
30 years old so it's a great project car

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:57.890 
30 years old so it's a great project car
and<00:03:44.780> let's<00:03:45.110> go<00:03:45.200> into<00:03:45.320> the<00:03:45.410> hood<00:03:45.530> real<00:03:45.710> quick

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.759 

that's<00:03:58.900> your<00:03:59.080> engine<00:04:01.110> again<00:04:02.110> we<00:04:02.260> notice<00:04:02.440> mild

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
that's your engine again we notice mild

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.180 
that's your engine again we notice mild

a nickel size with the oil drop nothing
major<00:04:15.610> but<00:04:16.329> imagine<00:04:16.750> you<00:04:16.840> probably<00:04:16.930> have<00:04:17.199> to

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
major but imagine you probably have to

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.599 
major but imagine you probably have to
do<00:04:17.380> seals<00:04:17.650> in<00:04:17.769> this<00:04:17.889> because<00:04:18.070> the<00:04:18.130> car<00:04:18.310> is<00:04:18.400> 30

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
do seals in this because the car is 30

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.250 
do seals in this because the car is 30
years<00:04:18.760> old<00:04:19.060> and<00:04:19.329> seals<00:04:19.600> dry<00:04:19.840> out<00:04:19.989> in<00:04:20.109> any<00:04:20.199> other

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
years old and seals dry out in any other

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.990 
years old and seals dry out in any other
car<00:04:20.590> so<00:04:20.859> it's<00:04:21.400> not<00:04:21.459> like<00:04:21.609> it's<00:04:21.729> a<00:04:21.760> major

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
car so it's not like it's a major

car so it's not like it's a major
overhaul<00:04:22.449> or<00:04:22.840> a<00:04:23.080> rebuilding<00:04:23.560> of<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:23.710> engine
