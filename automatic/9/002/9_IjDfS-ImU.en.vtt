which<00:00:43.379> how<00:00:43.500> I've<00:00:43.680> been<00:00:43.829> doing<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.640> should

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
which how I've been doing it you should

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.430 
which how I've been doing it you should
they'll<00:00:44.940> be<00:00:45.180> oh<00:00:45.450> there's<00:00:45.660> one<00:00:45.899> claw<00:00:46.140> right<00:00:46.200> off

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
they'll be oh there's one claw right off

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.709 
they'll be oh there's one claw right off
the<00:00:46.559> bat<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.090> usually<00:00:48.090> they'll<00:00:48.510> be<00:00:48.600> other

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
the bat and usually they'll be other

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.360 
the bat and usually they'll be other
people<00:00:49.020> here<00:00:49.170> because<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.590> think<00:00:49.649> it's<00:00:49.890> part<00:00:50.280> of

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
people here because I think it's part of

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.569 
people here because I think it's part of
the<00:00:51.079> there's<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.170> heart<00:00:52.410> nearby<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.520> know

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
the there's a heart nearby and I know

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.010 
the there's a heart nearby and I know
sometimes<00:00:53.879> these<00:00:54.210> drinks<00:00:54.539> get<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.870> way<00:00:54.960> so

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
sometimes these drinks get in the way so

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.069 
sometimes these drinks get in the way so
people<00:00:55.410> will<00:00:55.500> kill<00:00:55.710> them<00:00:55.860> off<00:00:56.480> so<00:00:57.480> that's<00:00:57.750> one

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
people will kill them off so that's one

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.470 
people will kill them off so that's one
downside<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:59.100> but<00:00:59.340> then<00:00:59.520> again<00:00:59.550> sometimes

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
downside to it but then again sometimes

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.180 
downside to it but then again sometimes
it<00:01:00.750> can<00:01:00.870> be<00:01:00.899> helpful<00:01:01.320> because<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:02.010> have<00:01:02.100> other

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
it can be helpful because you have other

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.460 
it can be helpful because you have other
people<00:01:02.399> helping<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.969> but<00:01:03.379> doesn't<00:01:04.379> really

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
people helping you but doesn't really

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.140 
people helping you but doesn't really
matter<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:04.890> most<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.309> them<00:01:05.400> will<00:01:05.640> spawn<00:01:05.880> here

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
matter so most of them will spawn here

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.649 
matter so most of them will spawn here
at<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.530> egg<00:01:07.530> area<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.189> also<00:01:08.729> another<00:01:09.270> area

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
at this egg area and also another area

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.740 
at this egg area and also another area
over<00:01:09.990> here<00:01:10.460> for<00:01:11.460> them<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.060> spawn<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.570> there

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
over here for them to spawn it there

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.660 
over here for them to spawn it there
must<00:01:12.960> be<00:01:13.110> somebody<00:01:13.350> else<00:01:13.619> over<00:01:13.920> here<00:01:14.100> killing

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
must be somebody else over here killing

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.440 
must be somebody else over here killing
 because<00:01:15.380> they're<00:01:16.380> not<00:01:16.530> all<00:01:16.740> dead<00:01:17.450> well

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
 because they're not all dead well

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.160 
 because they're not all dead well
they're<00:01:18.600> all<00:01:18.780> dead<00:01:19.100> so<00:01:20.810> there's<00:01:21.810> lots<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.080> the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
they're all dead so there's lots of the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.510 
they're all dead so there's lots of the
hatchlings<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.009> won't<00:01:23.159> be<00:01:23.340> able<00:01:23.430> to

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
hatchlings that you won't be able to

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.850 
hatchlings that you won't be able to
stack<00:01:23.820> but<00:01:24.150> don't<00:01:24.299> worry<00:01:24.420> about<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.770> just<00:01:25.770> go

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
stack but don't worry about that just go

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
stack but don't worry about that just go
ahead<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.130> here<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.369> kill<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.640> marsh

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
ahead and here and kill the marsh

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.530

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
the drop rates are pretty good on this

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.700 
the drop rates are pretty good on this
they're<00:01:35.520> pretty<00:01:35.700> solid<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.119> should<00:01:36.299> say<00:01:36.710> but

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
they're pretty solid I should say but

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.480 
they're pretty solid I should say but

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
actually not too expensive on the

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
out there for farming them we got end up

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.000 
out there for farming them we got end up
just<00:03:06.390> getting<00:03:06.720> one<00:03:06.960> more<00:03:07.170> scale<00:03:07.500> in<00:03:07.680> one<00:03:07.830> more

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
just getting one more scale in one more

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.080 
just getting one more scale in one more
claw<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.820> drops<00:03:09.090> are<00:03:09.300> pretty<00:03:09.660> solid<00:03:11.090> but

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
claw the drops are pretty solid but

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.580 
claw the drops are pretty solid but
again<00:03:12.330> it's<00:03:12.510> kind<00:03:12.660> of<00:03:12.690> awkward<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:13.140> do<00:03:13.380> when

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
again it's kind of awkward to do when

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.810 
again it's kind of awkward to do when
you<00:03:13.680> have<00:03:13.860> other<00:03:14.250> people<00:03:14.610> in<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.790> area

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
you have other people in the area

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.960 
you have other people in the area
farming<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.600> exact<00:03:15.870> same<00:03:16.110> thing<00:03:16.730> so<00:03:17.730> I<00:03:17.760> mean

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
farming the exact same thing so I mean

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:18.830 
farming the exact same thing so I mean
it's<00:03:18.090> just<00:03:18.150> something<00:03:18.360> that<00:03:18.480> you<00:03:18.630> have<00:03:18.660> to

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
it's just something that you have to

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.979 
it's just something that you have to
deal<00:03:19.140> with<00:03:19.170> with<00:03:19.620> in<00:03:19.770> Guild<00:03:20.040> Wars<00:03:20.130> but<00:03:20.760> uh

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
deal with with in Guild Wars but uh

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.940 
deal with with in Guild Wars but uh
again<00:03:21.989> here<00:03:22.290> you<00:03:22.350> don't<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.620> keep<00:03:22.739> on<00:03:22.830> coming

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
again here you don't to keep on coming

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.229

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
kill this good sky out of here stake

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.630 
kill this good sky out of here stake
through<00:03:42.390> him<00:03:42.600> and<00:03:42.950> I<00:03:43.950> will<00:03:44.070> finish<00:03:44.250> off<00:03:44.489> this

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
through him and I will finish off this

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.330 
through him and I will finish off this
last<00:03:44.880> break<00:03:45.300> here<00:03:45.510> for<00:03:45.750> our<00:03:45.989> final<00:03:46.620> kill<00:03:46.860> and

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
last break here for our final kill and

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.910 
last break here for our final kill and
yep<00:03:48.269> so<00:03:48.450> we<00:03:48.870> end<00:03:48.989> up<00:03:49.050> getting<00:03:49.170> two<00:03:49.560> skills

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
yep so we end up getting two skills

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.820 
yep so we end up getting two skills
there<00:03:50.160> so<00:03:50.459> I<00:03:50.489> mean<00:03:50.730> that's<00:03:50.880> pretty<00:03:51.090> solid<00:03:51.630> and

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
there so I mean that's pretty solid and

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.280 
there so I mean that's pretty solid and
within<00:03:52.830> about<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.580> time<00:03:53.820> of<00:03:54.030> I<00:03:54.269> farmed<00:03:55.050> a<00:03:55.140> bit

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
within about the time of I farmed a bit

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.199 
within about the time of I farmed a bit
before<00:03:55.470> that<00:03:55.650> also<00:03:56.160> so<00:03:56.430> I<00:03:56.610> mean<00:03:57.000> I've<00:03:57.090> probably

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
before that also so I mean I've probably

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.100 
before that also so I mean I've probably
farmed<00:03:57.750> for<00:03:57.959> maybe<00:03:59.360> 10<00:04:00.360> minutes<00:04:00.570> in<00:04:00.690> total<00:04:00.840> and

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
farmed for maybe 10 minutes in total and

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.900 
farmed for maybe 10 minutes in total and
we<00:04:01.200> end<00:04:01.350> up<00:04:01.380> with<00:04:01.560> five<00:04:01.769> claws<00:04:01.980> and<00:04:02.340> four

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
we end up with five claws and four

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.850 
we end up with five claws and four
scales<00:04:03.239> so<00:04:03.420> it<00:04:03.510> means<00:04:03.660> pretty<00:04:03.900> solid<00:04:04.230> and<00:04:04.380> I'm

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860
