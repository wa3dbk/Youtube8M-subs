 we have to do is put more the 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:55.040

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.330
 hand is worth 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.040
 I'm going to do 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.790
 A) Yes 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.920
 I'm not going to put it like that so I do not remember 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.460
 How was it 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.460
 look 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.350
 party 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:19.370
 and we can move 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:20.870
 and until this day is like a flare of 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.819
 the real life 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.660
 you know, it 's the same 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.540
 He says 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.660
 and he gives us more we are talking and he calls us 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.780
 now do not come 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:40.560
 then the other 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.660
 it's been a long time since 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:48.140
 but there are only two types in the flare and 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.140
 the other one that I do not remember and how it was 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.660
 this is a come 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:12.430
 Well, it simply tells us that 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:16.209
 that is to say marta rockets for rockets not 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:19.900
 but it's going to flares not take out the 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:22.299
 encounters of your Roman change and you're 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.959
 it's only two I want to say that we do not 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.959
 is going to give more 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.990
 and this seems to be done a little bit 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.980
 more than fire but 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:44.460
 nothing else in this consists in the fires 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.660
