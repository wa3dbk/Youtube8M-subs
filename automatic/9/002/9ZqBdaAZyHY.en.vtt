00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
use a double boiler because you can do

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.510

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
it constantly because it will burn

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.470

we're<00:00:58.140> just<00:00:58.320> gonna<00:00:59.780> blend<00:01:00.780> together<00:01:01.050> here<00:01:01.620> a

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
we're just gonna blend together here a

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.320 
we're just gonna blend together here a

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
little back and we're going to add to

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.160 
little back and we're going to add to
this<00:01:06.570> two<00:01:07.200> eggs<00:01:08.270> and<00:01:09.270> I'm<00:01:09.510> not<00:01:09.689> using<00:01:09.930> the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
this two eggs and I'm not using the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.500 
this two eggs and I'm not using the
KitchenAid<00:01:10.650> for<00:01:10.920> this<00:01:11.040> today<00:01:11.400> because<00:01:11.880> it

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
KitchenAid for this today because it

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.660 
KitchenAid for this today because it
does<00:01:12.750> tupa<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.320> job<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.920> want<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.460> wind

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
does tupa the job you want this to wind

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.060 
does tupa the job you want this to wind
up<00:01:14.880> with<00:01:15.090> crumbs<00:01:15.500> and<00:01:16.500> when<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.770> do<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:16.950> in<00:01:17.009> the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
up with crumbs and when you do it in the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.859 
up with crumbs and when you do it in the
kitchen<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.640> turns<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.000> into<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.299> dough<00:01:18.570> so

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
kitchen a that turns it into a dough so

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:31.750 
kitchen a that turns it into a dough so
we'll<00:01:19.650> add<00:01:19.860> two<00:01:20.729> eggs<00:01:24.259> stir<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.500> man

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.180 

and<00:01:32.760> we're<00:01:32.970> going<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.210> cut<00:01:33.450> into<00:01:33.690> this<00:01:34.020> one<00:01:34.920> cup

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
and we're going to cut into this one cup

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.000 
and we're going to cut into this one cup
of<00:01:35.220> cold<00:01:35.700> butter<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.690> it's<00:01:37.320> much<00:01:37.500> easier<00:01:37.920> if

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
of cold butter and it's much easier if

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.820 
of cold butter and it's much easier if
you<00:01:38.070> just<00:01:38.370> cut<00:01:38.580> it<00:01:38.730> up<00:01:38.820> into<00:01:39.120> chunks<00:01:39.510> and<00:01:39.930> then

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
you just cut it up into chunks and then

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.350 
you just cut it up into chunks and then
you<00:01:40.950> can<00:01:41.100> kind<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.460> blend<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.300> the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
you can kind of blend it in and the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.969 
you can kind of blend it in and the
easiest<00:01:42.780> way<00:01:43.080> is<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.410> use<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:44.360> little<00:01:45.979> blender

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
easiest way is to use a little blender

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.830 
easiest way is to use a little blender
like<00:01:47.190> this<00:01:47.430> if<00:01:47.610> you've<00:01:47.760> got<00:01:48.000> one<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.420> can<00:01:48.600> use

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
like this if you've got one you can use

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.660 
like this if you've got one you can use
a<00:01:48.869> couple<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.440> knives<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:50.040> just<00:01:50.250> takes<00:01:50.490> a

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
a couple of knives it just takes a

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.980 
a couple of knives it just takes a
little<00:01:50.820> longer<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:53.090> it<00:01:54.090> just<00:01:54.360> takes<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.750> little

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
little longer and it just takes a little

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.450 
little longer and it just takes a little
bit<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.260> want<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.500> cut<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.800> in<00:01:55.920> until<00:01:56.250> it's

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
bit you want to cut it in until it's

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.030 
bit you want to cut it in until it's
just<00:01:56.670> rough<00:01:56.940> crumbs<00:01:57.380> okay<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:58.650> is<00:01:58.710> what

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
just rough crumbs okay and this is what

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.790 
just rough crumbs okay and this is what
you<00:01:59.190> want<00:01:59.400> you<00:01:59.790> want<00:01:59.970> just<00:02:00.210> small<00:02:00.570> crumbs<00:02:01.200> you

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
you want you want just small crumbs you
