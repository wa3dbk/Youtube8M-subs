00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.470
 hello everyone with you andrey andreev my 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:09.559
 site all point dot ru 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:16.470
 1200 4 decompose the task in digits and 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:18.020
 the first number we have is 49,000 8 we need 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.150
 each figure is represented as 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:27.960
 separate addend something on that 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:35.190
 such 4 is 40 thousand plus the second digit 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:39.230
 nine nine is 9000 hundreds we have zero 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.790
 do not write dozens we do not write zero 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.309
 eight is just eight 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.629
 she we have it just 8 ones here 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.190
 so signs don't even know 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.120
 how to explain it seems to me that it is 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:01:00.770
 so simple there is nothing difficult there is 67 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:03.660
 million eight hundred 13700 42 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.479
 but look here from one 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.770
 that's thousands that's millions how many 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.280
 million 67 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:17.820
 the first figure is 60 million so 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:19.320
 write 60 million plus well i don't have 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.960
 breaks into one line so i will with 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:28.740
 new line write on seven 7 it 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:35.540
 7 million 7 million plus eight is 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:40.680
 800 thousand 800 thousand plus 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:43.920
 one is 10 thousand plus 10,000 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.530
 if you notice me every time zero 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.299
 less and less here were 7 zeros 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.049
 there are already six zeros 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.049
 here 50 and here 4 0 well, and will continue 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.979
 all the time on 10 smaller 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:04.770
 three is 3000 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:08.670
 three 3007 is 700 we have plus four 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.800
 it's 40 plus 2 more 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.440
 that is, if I have the most zero 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.390
 no, but everything is clean all business is three digits 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.660
 some here I get this here 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.580
 a combination each time by 10 smaller 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.310
 if i have 0 here in numbers i. 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:28.830
 i'm missing some 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:32.459
 it was 4 0 3 0 2 0 skipping 10 skipping 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.170
 just eight right away write in the comments 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.090
 Is everything clear in solving this problem? 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.620
