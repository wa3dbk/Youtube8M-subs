00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.199 
I've noticed about the touch screen on
this<00:02:51.050> is<00:02:51.680> you<00:02:51.950> can<00:02:52.099> use<00:02:52.130> your<00:02:52.400> finger<00:02:52.849> a<00:02:52.880> lot

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
this is you can use your finger a lot

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.390 
this is you can use your finger a lot
easier<00:02:53.510> than<00:02:53.750> we'll<00:02:53.989> put<00:02:54.200> on<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.440> original

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
easier than we'll put on the original

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.390 
easier than we'll put on the original
intent<00:02:55.730> of<00:02:55.790> es<00:02:56.290> so<00:02:57.290> that's<00:02:57.470> that's<00:02:58.069> a<00:02:58.220> good

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
intent of es so that's that's a good

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.380 
intent of es so that's that's a good
pitch<00:02:58.610> right<00:02:58.790> there<00:03:00.430> ok<00:03:01.430> I'll<00:03:01.550> quickly<00:03:01.880> run

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
pitch right there ok I'll quickly run

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.290 
pitch right there ok I'll quickly run
through<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:02.870> apps<00:03:03.140> i<00:03:03.500> guess<00:03:03.850> we<00:03:04.850> have<00:03:05.060> your

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
through the apps i guess we have your

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.630 
through the apps i guess we have your
main<00:03:05.569> controls<00:03:06.019> here<00:03:06.430> notification<00:03:07.430> game

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
main controls here notification game

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.240 
main controls here notification game
notes<00:03:09.459> friends<00:03:10.459> list<00:03:11.170> brightness<00:03:12.170> that<00:03:12.500> jazz

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
notes friends list brightness that jazz

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.090 
notes friends list brightness that jazz
then<00:03:14.180> you<00:03:14.390> have<00:03:14.569> your<00:03:16.000> card<00:03:17.000> slot<00:03:17.480> game<00:03:18.100> and

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
then you have your card slot game and

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.690 
then you have your card slot game and
that's<00:03:19.280> just<00:03:19.370> an<00:03:19.670> example<00:03:19.880> of<00:03:20.569> the<00:03:20.690> 3d<00:03:21.019> video

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
that's just an example of the 3d video

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.100 
that's just an example of the 3d video
that<00:03:22.700> would<00:03:22.880> be<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.330> audio<00:03:23.810> recorder<00:03:25.000> and

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
that would be the audio recorder and

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.350 
that would be the audio recorder and
that<00:03:27.110> is<00:03:27.350> the<00:03:27.620> photo<00:03:27.950> app<00:03:28.160> you<00:03:28.400> can<00:03:28.489> do<00:03:28.670> various

hug<00:03:38.600> shadow<00:03:38.959> application<00:03:39.830> i<00:03:39.920> guess<00:03:40.040> it's

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
hug shadow application i guess it's

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.449 
hug shadow application i guess it's
called<00:03:40.870> me<00:03:41.870> application<00:03:42.650> and<00:03:42.920> there's<00:03:43.250> me

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
called me application and there's me

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.020 
called me application and there's me
plaza<00:03:43.760> with<00:03:44.390> a<00:03:44.420> thing<00:03:44.660> called<00:03:44.900> streetpass<00:03:46.030> but

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
plaza with a thing called streetpass but

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.780 
plaza with a thing called streetpass but
actually<00:03:47.510> makes<00:03:48.410> so<00:03:48.769> when<00:03:48.890> you<00:03:49.040> pass<00:03:49.400> someone

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790
