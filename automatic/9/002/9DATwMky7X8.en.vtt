00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
all right we got three main styles of

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.570 
all right we got three main styles of
tricycle<00:00:04.259> rear<00:00:04.410> ends<00:00:04.830> whether<00:00:05.250> they're

is<00:00:13.799> actually<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.250> tab<00:00:14.490> for<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.849> original

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
is actually the tab for the original

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.960 
is actually the tab for the original
ebrake<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:16.379> was<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.529> lever<00:00:16.800> here<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.279> I<00:00:17.760> had<00:00:17.880> to

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
ebrake it was a lever here and I had to

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.880 
ebrake it was a lever here and I had to
tap<00:00:18.600> that'll<00:00:18.960> sit<00:00:19.140> down<00:00:19.289> on<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.500> back<00:00:19.680> wheel

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
tap that'll sit down on the back wheel

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.269 
tap that'll sit down on the back wheel
to<00:00:20.400> hold<00:00:20.520> it<00:00:20.670> from<00:00:20.760> rolling<00:00:20.970> away<00:00:21.180> but<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.439> have

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
to hold it from rolling away but I have

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.890 
to hold it from rolling away but I have
a<00:00:23.340> kickstand<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.939> do<00:00:24.060> that<00:00:24.210> chilly<00:00:24.449> purpose

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
a kickstand to do that chilly purpose

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.859 
a kickstand to do that chilly purpose
for<00:00:25.109> me<00:00:25.260> on<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.430> way<00:00:26.550> these<00:00:26.760> work<00:00:27.029> from<00:00:27.779> the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
for me on the way these work from the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.109 
for me on the way these work from the
sprocket<00:00:28.410> run<00:00:28.740> straight<00:00:29.039> back<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.609> this

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
sprocket run straight back to this

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.380 
sprocket run straight back to this
sprocket<00:00:30.990> here<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.619> it's<00:00:32.369> got<00:00:32.520> an<00:00:32.610> axle<00:00:33.149> shaft

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
sprocket here and it's got an axle shaft

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.810 
sprocket here and it's got an axle shaft
that<00:00:33.719> runs<00:00:33.930> from<00:00:34.200> here<00:00:34.559> all<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.130> way<00:00:35.340> back<00:00:35.610> to

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
that runs from here all the way back to

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.270 
that runs from here all the way back to
this<00:00:35.940> axle<00:00:36.450> so<00:00:36.690> basically<00:00:37.110> when<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:37.980> turn

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
this axle so basically when you turn

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.709 
this axle so basically when you turn
this<00:00:38.430> rocket<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:40.079> crank<00:00:40.379> moves<00:00:41.450> on<00:00:42.450> the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
this rocket to the crank moves on the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.200 
this rocket to the crank moves on the
other<00:00:42.809> side<00:00:43.129> it's<00:00:44.129> just<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.520> dummy<00:00:44.730> size<00:00:45.030> it

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
other side it's just a dummy size it

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.049 
other side it's just a dummy size it
takes<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.510> regular<00:00:45.870> front<00:00:46.140> wheel<00:00:46.460> so<00:00:47.460> dealing

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
takes a regular front wheel so dealing

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.670 
takes a regular front wheel so dealing
with<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.390> only<00:00:48.539> thing<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.870> need<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.079> adapt

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
with the only thing you need to adapt

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.220 
with the only thing you need to adapt
that<00:00:49.829> bicycle<00:00:50.579> into<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.969> tricycle<00:00:51.600> would<00:00:52.079> be

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
that bicycle into a tricycle would be

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.299 
that bicycle into a tricycle would be
this<00:00:52.440> back<00:00:52.680> end<00:00:52.980> in<00:00:53.420> an<00:00:54.420> extra<00:00:54.780> front<00:00:55.050> wheel

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
this back end in an extra front wheel

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.010 
this back end in an extra front wheel
then<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.460> got<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.610> tricycle<00:00:57.239> there<00:00:57.809> pretty

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
then you got a tricycle there pretty

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.869 
then you got a tricycle there pretty
Universal<00:00:58.739> as<00:00:58.890> these<00:00:59.640> big<00:01:00.120> tabs<00:01:00.570> here<00:01:00.840> and

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
Universal as these big tabs here and

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.130 
Universal as these big tabs here and
they<00:01:02.879> just<00:01:03.059> bolt<00:01:03.300> right<00:01:03.420> on<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.750> drop<00:01:03.960> off

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
they just bolt right on to the drop off

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.350 
they just bolt right on to the drop off
sir

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
sir

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.899 
sir
another<00:01:06.360> style<00:01:06.659> back<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.700> would<00:01:08.700> be<00:01:08.729> the

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
another style back in would be the

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.000 
another style back in would be the
differential<00:01:09.360> style

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
differential style

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.899 
differential style
this<00:01:11.010> one<00:01:12.560> has<00:01:13.560> two<00:01:13.770> Drive<00:01:14.040> shafts<00:01:14.340> in<00:01:14.670> the

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
this one has two Drive shafts in the

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.080 
this one has two Drive shafts in the
center<00:01:15.830> it's<00:01:16.830> placed<00:01:17.070> on<00:01:17.280> for<00:01:17.490> 20<00:01:17.759> inch<00:01:17.909> wheels

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
center it's placed on for 20 inch wheels

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.480 
center it's placed on for 20 inch wheels
it's<00:01:18.299> actually<00:01:18.570> 24<00:01:19.020> inch<00:01:19.200> back<00:01:19.409> end<00:01:19.680> but<00:01:20.189> I

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
it's actually 24 inch back end but I

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.870 
it's actually 24 inch back end but I
converted<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.540> 20<00:01:22.130> and<00:01:23.130> they<00:01:23.580> would<00:01:23.700> have<00:01:23.850> a

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
converted to a 20 and they would have a

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.289 
converted to a 20 and they would have a
differential<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:25.200> rides<00:01:25.470> in<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.770> middle

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
differential the rides in the middle

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.260 
differential the rides in the middle
just<00:01:27.299> like<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.479> car<00:01:28.100> and<00:01:29.100> but<00:01:29.520> instead<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.909> a

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
just like a car and but instead of a

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.390 
just like a car and but instead of a
drive<00:01:30.810> shaft<00:01:31.049> turning<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.530> yoke<00:01:31.740> turning<00:01:32.280> a

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
drive shaft turning a yoke turning a

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.460 
drive shaft turning a yoke turning a
ring<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.759> pinion<00:01:32.820> gear<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.020> differential

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
ring and pinion gear to the differential

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.530 
ring and pinion gear to the differential
it's<00:01:34.950> just<00:01:35.280> chain<00:01:35.610> strengthening

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
it's just chain strengthening

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.460 
it's just chain strengthening
differential<00:01:37.640> I'm<00:01:38.640> rebuilding<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.210> one<00:01:39.420> I

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
differential I'm rebuilding this one I

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.899 
differential I'm rebuilding this one I
don't<00:01:40.470> seal<00:01:40.829> bangs<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.369> everything<00:01:41.670> need<00:01:41.880> to

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
don't seal bangs and everything need to

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.770 
don't seal bangs and everything need to
be<00:01:42.000> replaced<00:01:42.500> and<00:01:43.759> then<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:45.000> other<00:01:45.450> style

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
be replaced and then the other style

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.929 
be replaced and then the other style
back<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.259> would<00:01:46.439> be<00:01:46.500> like<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:46.979> one<00:01:47.250> where<00:01:47.549> it

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
back in would be like this one where it

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.910 
back in would be like this one where it
actually<00:01:48.450> has<00:01:50.360> from<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.479> crank<00:01:52.020> back<00:01:52.290> it'll

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
actually has from the crank back it'll

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.120 
actually has from the crank back it'll
come<00:01:53.100> back<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:54.079> center<00:01:55.079> hub<00:01:55.290> there's<00:01:55.710> one<00:01:55.920> I

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
come back to a center hub there's one I

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.240 
come back to a center hub there's one I
call<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.520> element<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.090> exact<00:01:57.360> terminus<00:01:58.020> but

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
call it element the exact terminus but

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.690 
call it element the exact terminus but
this<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> coaster<00:01:59.880> brake<00:02:00.060> hub<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.509> basically

bicycle wheel that goes on here and then
on<00:02:33.909> this<00:02:33.969> side<00:02:34.359> there's<00:02:34.689> no<00:02:34.900> flange<00:02:35.230> but<00:02:36.189> there

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
on this side there's no flange but there

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.640 
on this side there's no flange but there
are<00:02:36.430> sealed<00:02:36.639> bearings<00:02:37.150> between<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.079> hub<00:02:38.290> and

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
are sealed bearings between the hub and

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.409 
are sealed bearings between the hub and
the<00:02:38.769> axle<00:02:39.250> so<00:02:39.879> when<00:02:40.719> the<00:02:40.840> shaft<00:02:41.079> turns<00:02:42.419> the

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:43.419 
the axle so when the shaft turns the

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:45.300 
the axle so when the shaft turns the
wheel<00:02:43.599> can<00:02:43.870> spin<00:02:44.139> around<00:02:44.290> it<00:02:44.620> without<00:02:44.739> having

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
wheel can spin around it without having

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.839 
wheel can spin around it without having
any<00:02:45.579> resistance<00:02:46.260> that<00:02:47.260> weights<00:02:47.669> one<00:02:48.669> wheel

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
any resistance that weights one wheel

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.869 
any resistance that weights one wheel
drive<00:02:49.590> just<00:02:50.590> like<00:02:50.739> this<00:02:51.040> one<00:02:51.250> would<00:02:51.430> be<00:02:51.459> one

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879 
drive just like this one would be one

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.920 
drive just like this one would be one
wheel<00:02:52.060> drive<00:02:53.159> within<00:02:54.159> the<00:02:54.930> differential

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
wheel drive within the differential

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.830 
wheel drive within the differential
style<00:02:56.319> would<00:02:56.620> be<00:02:56.650> actually<00:02:57.250> 2<00:02:57.430> wheel<00:02:57.579> drive

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
style would be actually 2 wheel drive

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.420 
style would be actually 2 wheel drive
there's<00:02:58.840> advantages<00:02:59.169> and<00:02:59.560> disadvantages<00:03:00.250> to

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
there's advantages and disadvantages to

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.599 
there's advantages and disadvantages to
both<00:03:00.840> but<00:03:01.840> those<00:03:02.349> are<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.590> three<00:03:02.859> main<00:03:03.069> styles

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:03.609 
both but those are the three main styles

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:07.050 
both but those are the three main styles
of<00:03:03.760> tricycle<00:03:04.359> rear<00:03:04.719> ends<00:03:05.730> if<00:03:06.730> you<00:03:06.790> have<00:03:06.939> any

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
of tricycle rear ends if you have any

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.180 
of tricycle rear ends if you have any
more<00:03:07.150> questions<00:03:07.629> just<00:03:07.930> let<00:03:08.560> me<00:03:08.620> know<00:03:09.180> thanks
