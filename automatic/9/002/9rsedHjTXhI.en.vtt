V here and I just wanted to share with
you<00:00:03.629> guys<00:00:03.659> my<00:00:03.810> video<00:00:04.350> I<00:00:04.680> made<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:04.920> really<00:00:05.339> really

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
you guys my video I made a really really

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.600 
you guys my video I made a really really
awesome<00:00:06.000> pulse<00:00:06.720> weapon<00:00:07.170> and<00:00:07.410> I<00:00:07.440> felt<00:00:08.340> like<00:00:08.460> it

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
awesome pulse weapon and I felt like it

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.669 
awesome pulse weapon and I felt like it
was<00:00:08.700> good<00:00:08.849> enough<00:00:09.030> to<00:00:09.090> show<00:00:09.360> you<00:00:09.420> guys

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:09.679 
was good enough to show you guys

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:12.350 
was good enough to show you guys
probably<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:11.099> best<00:00:11.340> one<00:00:11.550> I've<00:00:11.700> used<00:00:11.730> so<00:00:12.120> far

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
probably the best one I've used so far

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.350 
probably the best one I've used so far
so<00:00:13.019> here's<00:00:13.830> everything<00:00:14.130> on<00:00:14.400> it<00:00:14.580> for<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.089> stock

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
so here's everything on it for the stock

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.599 
so here's everything on it for the stock
I've<00:00:15.599> got<00:00:15.780> dampening<00:00:16.350> so<00:00:16.560> we<00:00:16.650> can<00:00:16.859> make<00:00:17.490> the

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
I've got dampening so we can make the

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.090 
I've got dampening so we can make the
recoil<00:00:18.060> not<00:00:18.300> so<00:00:18.510> unbearable<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.650> trigger

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
recoil not so unbearable the trigger

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.800 
recoil not so unbearable the trigger
I've<00:00:20.279> got<00:00:20.460> spooling<00:00:20.880> so<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.359> can<00:00:21.570> have<00:00:21.689> an

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
I've got spooling so I can have an

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.109 
I've got spooling so I can have an
incredibly<00:00:22.350> high<00:00:22.619> rate<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:22.859> fire<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.760> scope

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
incredibly high rate of fire the scope

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.580 
incredibly high rate of fire the scope
is<00:00:24.330> really<00:00:24.600> important<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.109> have<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.350> laser

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
is really important I have the laser

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.439 
is really important I have the laser
guidance<00:00:26.099> system<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:26.730> every<00:00:27.060> one<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.240> these

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
guidance system so every one of these

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.650 
guidance system so every one of these
shots<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.529> going<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.890> be<00:00:29.060> targeted<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.359> are

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
shots is going to be targeted and are

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.540 
shots is going to be targeted and are
going<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.019> move<00:00:31.230> slowly<00:00:31.619> towards<00:00:32.219> wherever

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
going to move slowly towards wherever

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.670 
going to move slowly towards wherever
I'm<00:00:32.700> aiming<00:00:33.210> which<00:00:33.750> obviously<00:00:34.260> helps

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
I'm aiming which obviously helps

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.860 
I'm aiming which obviously helps
accuracy<00:00:35.250> magazine<00:00:36.239> since<00:00:36.570> I'm<00:00:36.719> using

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
accuracy magazine since I'm using

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.150 
accuracy magazine since I'm using
spooling<00:00:37.260> I'm<00:00:37.500> going<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.680> want<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.920> use<00:00:38.010> the

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
spooling I'm going to want to use the

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.069 
spooling I'm going to want to use the
high-capacity<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.210> can<00:00:39.420> have<00:00:39.600> more<00:00:39.809> shots

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
high-capacity so I can have more shots

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.799 
high-capacity so I can have more shots
to<00:00:40.260> shoot<00:00:40.469> basically<00:00:41.010> barrel<00:00:41.969> I'm<00:00:42.210> also<00:00:42.629> using

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
to shoot basically barrel I'm also using

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.869 
to shoot basically barrel I'm also using
the<00:00:43.230> Gatling<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:43.950> can<00:00:44.190> just<00:00:44.399> have<00:00:44.550> more

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
the Gatling so I can just have more

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.299 
the Gatling so I can just have more
bullets<00:00:45.239> come<00:00:45.600> out<00:00:45.750> like<00:00:46.079> just<00:00:46.469> blast<00:00:47.010> them

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
bullets come out like just blast them

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.100 
bullets come out like just blast them
with<00:00:47.340> as<00:00:47.579> many<00:00:47.760> things<00:00:48.030> as<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.390> possibly<00:00:48.780> can

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
with as many things as I possibly can

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.529 
with as many things as I possibly can
I'm<00:00:49.710> also<00:00:49.920> using<00:00:50.070> Tesla<00:00:50.850> because<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.180> don't

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
I'm also using Tesla because I don't

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.900 
I'm also using Tesla because I don't
like<00:00:51.840> slug<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:52.680> game<00:00:52.890> for<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.190> pulse

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
like slug in this game for the pulse

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.959 
like slug in this game for the pulse
weapons<00:00:54.329> didn't<00:00:54.629> do<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.840> for<00:00:54.870> me<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:56.160> Tesla<00:00:56.910> is

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
weapons didn't do it for me and Tesla is

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.540 
weapons didn't do it for me and Tesla is
awesome<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.570> mean<00:00:57.719> come<00:00:57.899> on<00:00:57.989> it's<00:00:58.140> Tesla<00:00:58.530> but<00:00:59.100> I

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
awesome I mean come on it's Tesla but I

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.520 
awesome I mean come on it's Tesla but I
also<00:01:00.090> use<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.480> corkscrew<00:01:01.020> which<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.320> really

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
also use the corkscrew which is really

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.229 
also use the corkscrew which is really
important<00:01:01.890> because<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.129> ups<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.430> damage<00:01:02.879> just

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
important because it ups the damage just

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.140 
important because it ups the damage just
a<00:01:03.539> little<00:01:04.049> bit<00:01:04.229> but<00:01:05.010> since<00:01:05.610> I'm<00:01:05.760> using<00:01:05.970> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
a little bit but since I'm using the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.270 
a little bit but since I'm using the
later<00:01:06.299> laser<00:01:06.689> guidance<00:01:07.170> system<00:01:07.260> what<00:01:08.159> it's

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
later laser guidance system what it's

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.100 
later laser guidance system what it's
actually<00:01:08.369> going<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.760> do<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.030> as<00:01:09.240> its<00:01:09.510> spiraling

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
actually going to do is as its spiraling

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.320 
actually going to do is as its spiraling
it's<00:01:10.380> going<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.950> come<00:01:11.189> closer<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.670> it's<00:01:12.150> going

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
it's going to come closer and it's going

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.090 
it's going to come closer and it's going
to<00:01:12.390> be<00:01:12.479> more<00:01:12.630> accurate<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.560> I'm<00:01:13.740> going<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.950> show

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
to be more accurate so I'm going to show

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.890 
to be more accurate so I'm going to show
you<00:01:14.130> guys<00:01:14.400> what<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:14.790> weapon<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.360> like<00:01:15.630> in

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
you guys what this weapon is like in

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.770 
you guys what this weapon is like in
battle<00:01:16.619> if<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.759> could<00:01:17.909> give<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.180> name<00:01:18.360> it'd<00:01:18.630> be

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
battle if I could give it a name it'd be

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.480 
battle if I could give it a name it'd be
the<00:01:18.930> blue<00:01:19.110> tornado<00:01:19.619> because<00:01:19.860> look<00:01:20.220> at<00:01:20.340> this

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
the blue tornado because look at this

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.510 
the blue tornado because look at this
thing<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:21.659> just<00:01:21.990> annihilates<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.310> just

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
thing it just annihilates it is just

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.990 
thing it just annihilates it is just
fantastic<00:01:24.049> I<00:01:25.049> think<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.830> only<00:01:26.040> real<00:01:26.520> problem

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
fantastic I think the only real problem

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.109 
fantastic I think the only real problem
with<00:01:27.119> this<00:01:27.270> gun<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.110> reload<00:01:28.710> but<00:01:29.400> as<00:01:29.880> long

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
with this gun is the reload but as long

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.490 
with this gun is the reload but as long
as<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.360> guys<00:01:30.479> are<00:01:30.540> good<00:01:30.840> at<00:01:30.869> diving<00:01:31.380> around

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
as you guys are good at diving around

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.960 
as you guys are good at diving around
while<00:01:31.829> you're<00:01:31.950> reloading<00:01:32.130> then<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.729> really

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
while you're reloading then you really

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.730 
while you're reloading then you really
shouldn't<00:01:33.210> have<00:01:33.299> any<00:01:33.509> problems<00:01:33.990> but<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.530> just

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
shouldn't have any problems but it just

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.060 
shouldn't have any problems but it just
decimates<00:01:35.520> people<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.090> mean<00:01:36.270> seriously

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
decimates people I mean seriously

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.819 
decimates people I mean seriously
atomizes<00:01:38.070> it's<00:01:38.340> just<00:01:38.579> awesome<00:01:39.619> but<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.650> could

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
atomizes it's just awesome but I could

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.649 
atomizes it's just awesome but I could
never<00:01:40.950> use<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.549> setup<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.090> everybody<00:01:42.450> else

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
never use this setup that everybody else

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.539 
never use this setup that everybody else
does<00:01:42.899> that's<00:01:43.200> basically<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.280> pulse

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
does that's basically the the pulse

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.060 
does that's basically the the pulse
shotgun<00:01:45.149> setup<00:01:45.540> because<00:01:46.049> it's<00:01:46.259> just<00:01:46.409> too<00:01:46.649> weak

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
shotgun setup because it's just too weak

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.160 
shotgun setup because it's just too weak
it<00:01:47.399> just<00:01:47.880> doesn't<00:01:48.240> do<00:01:48.329> enough<00:01:48.450> damage<00:01:48.630> that

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
it just doesn't do enough damage that

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.410 
it just doesn't do enough damage that
needs<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.439> be<00:01:49.530> done<00:01:49.740> but<00:01:50.280> this<00:01:50.490> just<00:01:50.820> just

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
needs to be done but this just just

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.920 
needs to be done but this just just
destroys<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:53.159> um<00:01:53.399> that's<00:01:53.759> basically<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.450> this

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
destroys so um that's basically it this

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.359 
destroys so um that's basically it this
