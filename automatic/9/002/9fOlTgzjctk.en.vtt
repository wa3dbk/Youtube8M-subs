00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:16.209 
now we're going to talk about some

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.630 
now we're going to talk about some
specific<00:00:16.510> drills<00:00:17.320> that<00:00:17.770> are<00:00:17.830> extension<00:00:18.490> so

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
specific drills that are extension so

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.420 
specific drills that are extension so
the<00:00:18.760> basic<00:00:19.119> progression<00:00:20.009> one<00:00:21.009> of<00:00:21.130> the<00:00:21.279> four

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.430 
the basic progression one of the four

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:22.890 
the basic progression one of the four
gonna<00:00:21.580> start<00:00:21.820> off<00:00:21.939> with<00:00:21.970> some<00:00:22.150> no<00:00:22.599> poles

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900 
gonna start off with some no poles

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.170 
gonna start off with some no poles
drills<00:00:24.329> but<00:00:25.329> but<00:00:26.079> holding<00:00:26.439> poles<00:00:26.710> as<00:00:27.099> a<00:00:27.160> way<00:00:28.119> to

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
drills but but holding poles as a way to

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.929 
drills but but holding poles as a way to
work<00:00:28.869> on<00:00:29.020> stabilizing<00:00:29.289> the<00:00:29.860> core<00:00:30.099> so<00:00:30.820> the

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
work on stabilizing the core so the

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:32.510 
work on stabilizing the core so the
focus<00:00:31.270> of<00:00:31.300> these<00:00:31.450> drills<00:00:31.750> is<00:00:32.050> going<00:00:32.259> to<00:00:32.320> be<00:00:32.439> a

eye pinky in the eye means that's the

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:12.490 
eye pinky in the eye means that's the
height<00:03:10.849> of<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.090> hands<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.989> hands<00:03:12.230> should<00:03:12.349> be

height of the hands the hands should be

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.959 
height of the hands the hands should be
approximately<00:03:12.859> shoulder<00:03:13.700> width<00:03:13.879> apart

before<00:03:14.750> are<00:03:15.170> roughly<00:03:15.709> vertical<00:03:16.540> so<00:03:17.540> now<00:03:17.689> let's

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
before are roughly vertical so now let's

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.629 
before are roughly vertical so now let's
bring<00:03:18.079> our<00:03:18.290> hands<00:03:18.500> up<00:03:18.799> into<00:03:19.219> the<00:03:19.310> B<00:03:19.459> to

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:19.639 
bring our hands up into the B to

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:22.360 
bring our hands up into the B to
alternate<00:03:20.060> position<00:03:20.739> and<00:03:21.739> as<00:03:21.859> you<00:03:22.010> bring<00:03:22.189> your

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.219 

vertical<00:04:04.549> forearm<00:04:05.060> and<00:04:05.840> then<00:04:05.959> you're<00:04:06.139> going

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:06.229 
vertical forearm and then you're going

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:08.380 
vertical forearm and then you're going
to<00:04:06.290> be<00:04:06.409> able<00:04:06.560> to<00:04:06.769> engage<00:04:07.489> your<00:04:07.699> abs

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.460 
so that's where the - that's another

engaging the upper body so what we're
going<00:05:51.810> to<00:05:51.870> do<00:05:52.080> here<00:05:52.530> is<00:05:52.860> we're<00:05:53.100> going<00:05:53.190> to<00:05:53.280> do<00:05:53.460> a

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
going to do here is we're going to do a

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.210 
going to do here is we're going to do a
modification<00:05:54.390> of<00:05:54.840> a<00:05:54.900> robot<00:05:55.290> drill<00:05:55.560> where<00:05:56.040> we

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
modification of a robot drill where we

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.910 
modification of a robot drill where we
really<00:05:57.030> think<00:05:57.360> about<00:05:57.660> having<00:05:58.260> a<00:05:58.530> strong

00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:58.920 
really think about having a strong

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.060 
really think about having a strong
double<00:05:59.490> pole<00:05:59.730> and<00:06:00.150> a<00:06:00.570> strong<00:06:00.900> abs<00:06:01.290> engagement

double pole and a strong abs engagement

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.750 
double pole and a strong abs engagement
and<00:06:02.460> then<00:06:03.150> we're<00:06:03.330> going<00:06:03.420> to<00:06:03.480> move<00:06:04.050> into<00:06:04.380> that

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760 
and then we're going to move into that

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:16.700 
and then we're going to move into that
into<00:06:05.760> a<00:06:05.790> V<00:06:06.210> 2<00:06:06.420> of<00:06:06.930> V<00:06:07.110> to<00:06:15.110> start<00:06:16.110> with<00:06:16.320> just<00:06:16.530> a

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
into a V 2 of V to start with just a

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.790 
into a V 2 of V to start with just a
double<00:06:17.010> pole<00:06:17.250> motion<00:06:17.730> and<00:06:17.940> then<00:06:18.510> small<00:06:19.410> steps

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
double pole motion and then small steps

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:35.890 
double pole motion and then small steps
and<00:06:20.100> then

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.960
