00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
grip is hollow but yeah I saved well I

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.190 
grip is hollow but yeah I saved well I
personally<00:05:15.210> didn't<00:05:15.960> but<00:05:16.169> I<00:05:16.760> I<00:05:17.990> can't<00:05:18.990> believe

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
vintage pellet guns with it people just

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.529 
vintage pellet guns with it people just
don't<00:05:23.520> know<00:05:23.610> what<00:05:23.760> they<00:05:23.880> have<00:05:24.060> so<00:05:24.300> they<00:05:24.390> just
