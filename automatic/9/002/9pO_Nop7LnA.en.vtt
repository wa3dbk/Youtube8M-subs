in<00:00:09.570> this<00:00:10.440> video<00:00:10.650> we'll<00:00:11.099> be<00:00:11.160> taking<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.610> look<00:00:11.730> at

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
in this video we'll be taking a look at

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.900 
in this video we'll be taking a look at
how<00:00:12.150> you<00:00:12.210> might<00:00:12.480> use<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:13.019> step<00:00:13.349> mode<00:00:13.620> and

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
how you might use the step mode and

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.880 
how you might use the step mode and
control<00:00:14.910> mode<00:00:15.150> together<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.320> create<00:00:16.500> more

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
control mode together to create more

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.150 
control mode together to create more
interesting<00:00:17.460> patterns<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.210> sequences<00:00:19.160> let's

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
interesting patterns and sequences let's

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.040 
interesting patterns and sequences let's
start<00:00:20.310> by<00:00:20.580> first<00:00:20.850> creating<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.390> really<00:00:21.689> simple

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
start by first creating a really simple

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.349 
start by first creating a really simple
pattern<00:00:22.470> in<00:00:22.650> step<00:00:22.949> mode<00:00:23.160> so<00:00:23.939> we're<00:00:24.180> going<00:00:24.269> to

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
pattern in step mode so we're going to

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.320 
pattern in step mode so we're going to
start<00:00:24.600> with<00:00:24.689> kick<00:00:25.260> 0808<00:00:25.949> one<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.580> this<00:00:27.180> is

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
start with kick 0808 one and this is

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.169 
start with kick 0808 one and this is
going<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.599> go<00:00:27.720> on<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.189> 15<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.670> nine<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.090> the

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
going to go on the 15 the nine and the

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.049 
going to go on the 15 the nine and the
13<00:00:31.579> so<00:00:32.579> I'll<00:00:32.759> start<00:00:33.120> playing<00:00:33.210> this<00:00:34.940> there<00:00:35.940> we

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
13 so I'll start playing this there we

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.389 
13 so I'll start playing this there we
have<00:00:36.239> our<00:00:36.390> kick<00:00:36.719> drum<00:00:36.800> the<00:00:37.800> next<00:00:38.010> thing<00:00:38.129> we<00:00:38.340> are

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
have our kick drum the next thing we are

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.510 
have our kick drum the next thing we are
going<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.610> do<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:39.030> add<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.780> clap<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.890> go<00:00:41.129> select

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
going to do is add a clap so go select

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.350 
going to do is add a clap so go select
then<00:00:42.090> we're<00:00:42.570> going<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.780> select<00:00:42.960> clap<00:00:43.829> 808<00:00:44.370> now

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
then we're going to select clap 808 now

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.450 
then we're going to select clap 808 now
this<00:00:45.480> clap<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.960> going<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.200> go<00:00:46.350> on<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.829> five<00:00:47.100> and

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
this clap is going to go on the five and

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:55.450 
this clap is going to go on the five and
a<00:00:47.610> 13<00:00:53.059> alright<00:00:54.059> let's<00:00:54.329> add<00:00:54.539> another<00:00:55.020> element

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
a 13 alright let's add another element

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.630 
a 13 alright let's add another element
now<00:00:56.460> we<00:00:56.520> are<00:00:56.820> going<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.270> add<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.809> stair<00:00:58.350> too<00:00:58.890> so

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
now we are going to add the stair too so

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.209 
now we are going to add the stair too so
we'll<00:00:59.760> go<00:00:59.910> select<00:01:00.590> then<00:01:01.590> we're<00:01:01.800> going<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.010> go

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
we'll go select then we're going to go

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.980 
we'll go select then we're going to go
to<00:01:03.320> snare<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.500> there<00:01:05.250> we<00:01:05.339> go<00:01:05.810> we're<00:01:06.810> going<00:01:06.930> to

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
to snare to there we go we're going to

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.350 
to snare to there we go we're going to
add<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.260> snare<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.920> two<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.580> seven<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.119> 10

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
add the snare on the two to seven to 10

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:17.990 
add the snare on the two to seven to 10
and<00:01:09.600> 15<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.710> we<00:01:10.799> go<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:12.920> 7<00:01:13.920> 10<00:01:14.729> 15<00:01:16.759> finally<00:01:17.759> we

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
and 15 so we go to 7 10 15 finally we

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.060 
and 15 so we go to 7 10 15 finally we
are<00:01:18.150> going<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.540> add<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.990> cowbell<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.770> round<00:01:19.979> it

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
are going to add a cowbell to round it

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.980 
are going to add a cowbell to round it
all<00:01:20.189> off<00:01:20.430> because<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.270> can<00:01:21.420> always<00:01:21.600> use<00:01:21.840> more

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
all off because you can always use more

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.730 
all off because you can always use more
cowbell<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:23.280> we're<00:01:23.490> going<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.670> go<00:01:23.759> select

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
cowbell so we're going to go select

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.440 
cowbell so we're going to go select
cowbell<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.040> then<00:01:26.759> we<00:01:26.909> are<00:01:26.970> going<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.299> put

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
cowbell and then we are going to put

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:41.840 
cowbell and then we are going to put
this<00:01:27.600> on<00:01:27.810> 60<00:01:38.630> now<00:01:39.630> let's<00:01:39.990> move<00:01:40.200> on<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.850> control

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
this on 60 now let's move on to control

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.300 
this on 60 now let's move on to control
mode<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.600> will<00:01:42.780> put<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.049> into<00:01:43.680> control<00:01:44.159> mode

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
mode so it will put it into control mode

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.109 
mode so it will put it into control mode
by<00:01:44.520> clicking<00:01:44.990> control<00:01:45.990> up<00:01:46.200> at<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.350> top<00:01:46.530> and

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
by clicking control up at the top and

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.490 
by clicking control up at the top and
now<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.270> we<00:01:48.360> have<00:01:48.390> our<00:01:48.540> pattern<00:01:49.200> laid<00:01:49.350> out

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
now that we have our pattern laid out

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.920 
now that we have our pattern laid out
we're<00:01:50.130> going<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.430> edit<00:01:51.149> some<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.600> sound

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
we're going to edit some of the sound

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.200 
we're going to edit some of the sound
parameters<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.890> just<00:01:53.159> make<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.670> little<00:01:54.000> bit

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
parameters to just make it a little bit

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.370 
parameters to just make it a little bit
more<00:01:54.390> interesting<00:01:54.710> let's<00:01:55.710> start<00:01:56.310> by<00:01:56.670> first

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
more interesting let's start by first

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.590 
more interesting let's start by first
changing<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.710> level<00:01:59.219> of<00:01:59.399> our<00:01:59.640> cowbell<00:02:00.270> since

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
changing the level of our cowbell since

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.730 
changing the level of our cowbell since
that<00:02:00.750> was<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.869> last<00:02:01.140> sound<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.560> we<00:02:01.649> were

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
that was the last sound that we were

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.950 
that was the last sound that we were
working<00:02:01.920> with<00:02:02.240> so<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.570> want<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.810> make<00:02:03.869> sure

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
working with so you want to make sure

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.059 
working with so you want to make sure
that<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.560> have<00:02:04.799> set<00:02:05.399> yourself<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:06.060> sound<00:02:06.540> and

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
that you have set yourself to sound and

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.900 
that you have set yourself to sound and
now<00:02:08.069> we<00:02:08.129> are<00:02:08.459> going<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.970> go<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.599> out<00:02:09.750> tab

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
now we are going to go to the out tab

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.510 
now we are going to go to the out tab
we<00:02:11.210> talked<00:02:11.450> about<00:02:11.570> this<00:02:11.900> in<00:02:12.140> our<00:02:12.770> control<00:02:13.220> mode

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
we talked about this in our control mode

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.180 
we talked about this in our control mode
video<00:02:14.200> so<00:02:15.200> we're<00:02:15.410> going<00:02:15.500> to<00:02:15.590> go<00:02:15.620> ahead<00:02:15.740> and

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
video so we're going to go ahead and

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.580 
video so we're going to go ahead and
just<00:02:16.730> lower<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.270> volume<00:02:17.630> down<00:02:17.660> a<00:02:17.990> bit<00:02:18.320> so

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
just lower the volume down a bit so

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.980 
just lower the volume down a bit so
we'll<00:02:18.860> go<00:02:19.040> to<00:02:19.510> about<00:02:20.510> minus<00:02:22.120> 12<00:02:23.120> or<00:02:23.360> so<00:02:23.780> and

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
we'll go to about minus 12 or so and

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.350 
we'll go to about minus 12 or so and
we're<00:02:24.830> going<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.010> pan<00:02:25.340> this<00:02:25.640> a<00:02:25.790> little<00:02:26.000> bit<00:02:26.210> to

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
we're going to pan this a little bit to

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.660 
we're going to pan this a little bit to
the<00:02:26.480> right<00:02:26.510> so<00:02:26.900> we're<00:02:27.020> going<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.200> go<00:02:27.260> pan<00:02:27.670> just

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
the right so we're going to go pan just

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.650 
the right so we're going to go pan just
to<00:02:28.790> about<00:02:29.090> thirty<00:02:29.450> percent<00:02:30.670> now<00:02:31.670> let's<00:02:32.120> go<00:02:32.390> and

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
to about thirty percent now let's go and

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.280 
to about thirty percent now let's go and
select<00:02:33.410> our<00:02:33.830> snare<00:02:34.460> so<00:02:35.090> we'll<00:02:35.210> go<00:02:35.300> select<00:02:35.690> and

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
select our snare so we'll go select and

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.590 
select our snare so we'll go select and
we're<00:02:37.190> going<00:02:37.310> to<00:02:37.370> go<00:02:37.520> to<00:02:37.880> our<00:02:38.390> snare<00:02:39.080> 8082<00:02:40.600> this

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
we're going to go to our snare 8082 this

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.210 
we're going to go to our snare 8082 this
we<00:02:41.780> are<00:02:41.900> also<00:02:42.050> going<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:42.320> change<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.740> level<00:02:43.010> so

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
we are also going to change the level so

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.880 
we are also going to change the level so
we'll<00:02:43.370> go<00:02:43.520> down<00:02:43.760> just<00:02:44.150> a<00:02:44.330> little<00:02:44.480> bit<00:02:44.600> to<00:02:45.530> about

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
we'll go down just a little bit to about

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.610 
we'll go down just a little bit to about
six<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:46.690> we'll<00:02:47.690> leave<00:02:47.870> it<00:02:48.050> at<00:02:48.170> that

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
six and we'll leave it at that

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.699 
six and we'll leave it at that
next<00:02:50.340> we're<00:02:50.549> going<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.730> go<00:02:50.879> to<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.390> clap<00:02:51.870> so<00:02:52.409> do

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
next we're going to go to the clap so do

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.149 
next we're going to go to the clap so do
select<00:02:53.360> clap<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.659> for<00:02:55.500> this<00:02:55.590> one<00:02:55.799> we<00:02:56.129> are

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
select clap and for this one we are

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:00.380 
select clap and for this one we are
actually<00:02:56.580> going<00:02:57.360> to<00:02:57.840> start<00:02:58.590> by<00:02:59.489> changing<00:03:00.060> the

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
actually going to start by changing the

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.750 
actually going to start by changing the
level<00:03:00.659> and<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.049> pan<00:03:01.260> so<00:03:02.040> we'll<00:03:02.340> change<00:03:02.549> the

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
level and the pan so we'll change the

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.580 
level and the pan so we'll change the
level<00:03:03.060> back<00:03:03.269> down<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:04.379> about<00:03:05.599> minus<00:03:06.599> 12<00:03:07.079> or<00:03:07.319> so

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
level back down to about minus 12 or so

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.619 
level back down to about minus 12 or so
and<00:03:07.860> we're<00:03:08.579> going<00:03:08.700> to<00:03:08.730> pan<00:03:09.000> this<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.299> the<00:03:09.390> left

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
and we're going to pan this to the left

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.780 
and we're going to pan this to the left
so<00:03:09.930> we'll<00:03:10.079> do<00:03:10.260> and<00:03:10.470> minus<00:03:11.310> and<00:03:11.579> about<00:03:12.360> 34<00:03:13.049> right

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
so we'll do and minus and about 34 right

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.509 
so we'll do and minus and about 34 right
now<00:03:14.790> on<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.090> clap<00:03:15.360> we<00:03:15.659> are<00:03:15.720> also<00:03:15.900> going<00:03:16.319> to

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
now on the clap we are also going to

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.149 
now on the clap we are also going to
change<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:18.000> pitch<00:03:18.420> a<00:03:18.629> little<00:03:18.780> bit<00:03:19.019> so<00:03:19.890> we're

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 
change the pitch a little bit so we're

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.660 
change the pitch a little bit so we're
going<00:03:20.280> to<00:03:20.370> go<00:03:20.549> into<00:03:20.579> our<00:03:21.150> modules<00:03:22.549> and<00:03:23.549> then

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
going to go into our modules and then

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.650 
going to go into our modules and then
we're<00:03:23.849> going<00:03:23.940> to<00:03:24.000> want<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.269> make<00:03:24.359> sure<00:03:24.390> we're

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
we're going to want to make sure we're

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.839 
we're going to want to make sure we're
set<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:24.840> sampler<00:03:25.379> well<00:03:26.370> then<00:03:26.459> I'm<00:03:26.519> going<00:03:26.640> to<00:03:26.670> go

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
set to sampler well then I'm going to go

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.599 
set to sampler well then I'm going to go
to<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.090> second<00:03:27.690> page<00:03:28.129> so<00:03:29.129> we<00:03:29.250> can<00:03:29.400> use<00:03:29.489> this

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
to the second page so we can use this

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.699 
to the second page so we can use this
button<00:03:29.849> here<00:03:30.000> now<00:03:30.780> to<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:30.930> second<00:03:31.230> page<00:03:31.319> and

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
button here now to the second page and

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.339 
button here now to the second page and
then<00:03:32.040> we<00:03:32.190> are<00:03:32.250> going<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.489> change<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:33.060> tune

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
then we are going to change the tune

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.580 
then we are going to change the tune
down<00:03:34.349> to<00:03:34.620> something<00:03:34.859> like<00:03:35.220> for<00:03:36.379> now<00:03:37.379> let's

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
down to something like for now let's

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.130 
down to something like for now let's
take<00:03:37.799> a<00:03:37.980> listen<00:03:38.280> to<00:03:38.640> our<00:03:39.060> pattern<00:03:39.599> now<00:03:39.780> and

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
take a listen to our pattern now and

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.380 
take a listen to our pattern now and
you'll<00:03:40.620> notice<00:03:40.799> it's<00:03:41.099> much<00:03:41.700> more<00:03:41.940> interesting

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
you'll notice it's much more interesting

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:51.589 
you'll notice it's much more interesting
than<00:03:42.420> we<00:03:42.629> had<00:03:42.870> it<00:03:43.019> before<00:03:50.209> so<00:03:51.209> this<00:03:51.299> has<00:03:51.390> been<00:03:51.540> a

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
than we had it before so this has been a

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.680 
than we had it before so this has been a
quick<00:03:51.959> overview<00:03:52.109> of<00:03:52.680> how<00:03:52.920> you<00:03:52.980> can<00:03:53.340> use

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
quick overview of how you can use

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.479 
quick overview of how you can use
control<00:03:54.690> mode<00:03:54.900> with<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:55.500> step<00:03:55.769> sequencer<00:03:56.280> mode

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
control mode with a step sequencer mode

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.849 
control mode with a step sequencer mode
to<00:03:56.970> create<00:03:57.329> more<00:03:57.569> interesting<00:03:58.109> patterns<00:03:58.590> that

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
to create more interesting patterns that

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.339 
to create more interesting patterns that
you<00:03:58.919> can<00:03:59.190> use<00:03:59.459> in<00:03:59.669> your<00:04:00.299> live<00:04:00.569> performance<00:04:01.169> for

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
you can use in your live performance for

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:03.799 
you can use in your live performance for
production
