very easy to get to you just have to
pull<00:02:10.399> this<00:02:10.880> tab<00:02:11.180> up<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:12.200> access<00:02:12.620> it<00:02:12.800> when<00:02:12.950> you

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
need to and we start looking at this

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.190 
need to and we start looking at this
maybe<00:02:14.960> when<00:02:15.200> you<00:02:15.290> get<00:02:15.410> close<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.770> 100,000<00:02:17.200> and

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
maybe when you get close to 100,000 and

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.350 
maybe when you get close to 100,000 and
right<00:02:18.440> in<00:02:18.620> here<00:02:18.980> there's<00:02:19.340> your<00:02:19.580> fuse<00:02:19.820> box<00:02:20.090> so

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
in here we can actually control all

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.860 
in here we can actually control all
different<00:02:22.520> fuses<00:02:22.970> that<00:02:23.440> affect<00:02:24.460> lighting

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
different fuses that affect lighting

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.660 
different fuses that affect lighting
air-conditioning<00:02:26.870> and<00:02:26.960> so<00:02:27.170> on

air-conditioning and so on

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.660 
air-conditioning and so on
