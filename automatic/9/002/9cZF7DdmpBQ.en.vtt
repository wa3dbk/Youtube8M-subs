corner there can be a whole lot of
visual<00:00:34.570> clues<00:00:34.840> that<00:00:35.020> we'll<00:00:35.170> be<00:00:35.289> looking

visual clues that we'll be looking
forward<00:00:35.860> to<00:00:35.950> give<00:00:36.129> us<00:00:36.219> an<00:00:36.309> idea<00:00:36.399> of<00:00:36.730> what<00:00:36.910> we're

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
forward to give us an idea of what we're

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:38.670 
forward to give us an idea of what we're
going<00:00:37.210> to<00:00:37.329> encounter<00:00:37.480> one<00:00:38.320> of<00:00:38.410> the<00:00:38.469> first

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
going to encounter one of the first

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.990 
going to encounter one of the first
things<00:00:38.890> we'd<00:00:39.070> be<00:00:39.190> looking<00:00:39.430> for<00:00:39.610> would<00:00:39.730> be<00:00:39.850> any

speed advisory signs other things we

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.430 
speed advisory signs other things we
would<00:00:42.640> look<00:00:42.790> for<00:00:43.030> is<00:00:43.300> the<00:00:43.840> tightness<00:00:44.110> of<00:00:44.380> the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
would look for is the tightness of the

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.170 
would look for is the tightness of the
corner<00:00:44.860> does<00:00:45.280> it<00:00:45.430> disappear<00:00:45.850> out<00:00:46.000> of<00:00:46.030> view

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.569 
corner does it disappear out of view
it's<00:00:46.960> got<00:00:47.140> double<00:00:47.500> white<00:00:47.649> lines<00:00:47.950> it's<00:00:48.250> telling

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
it's got double white lines it's telling

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:50.580 
it's got double white lines it's telling
us<00:00:48.640> that<00:00:48.790> it's<00:00:48.940> a<00:00:49.030> fairly<00:00:49.390> tight<00:00:49.630> corner<00:00:50.079> have

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
us that it's a fairly tight corner have

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.050 
us that it's a fairly tight corner have
a<00:00:50.680> look<00:00:50.829> at<00:00:50.950> the<00:00:51.040> camber<00:00:51.460> it's<00:00:51.670> leaning

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.060 
a look at the camber it's leaning

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.000 
a look at the camber it's leaning
towards<00:00:52.450> us<00:00:52.600> all<00:00:52.780> of<00:00:53.230> these<00:00:53.350> things<00:00:53.680> will<00:00:53.890> give

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
towards us all of these things will give

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.920 
towards us all of these things will give
us<00:00:54.130> an<00:00:54.250> idea<00:00:54.640> of<00:00:54.910> what<00:00:55.450> speed<00:00:55.750> we<00:00:55.899> should

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
us an idea of what speed we should

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.350 
us an idea of what speed we should
approach<00:00:56.700> bearing<00:00:57.700> in<00:00:57.820> mind<00:00:57.850> that<00:00:58.239> it's

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
approach bearing in mind that it's

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.880 
approach bearing in mind that it's
always<00:00:58.720> better<00:00:58.960> to<00:00:59.110> approach<00:00:59.500> a<00:00:59.649> corner

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
always better to approach a corner

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.290 
always better to approach a corner
slower<00:01:00.190> than<00:01:00.430> you<00:01:00.520> think<00:01:00.700> we<00:01:00.940> can<00:01:01.059> always

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
slower than you think we can always

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.180 
slower than you think we can always
accelerate<00:01:01.840> out<00:01:02.020> of<00:01:02.230> the<00:01:02.320> corner<00:01:02.620> but<00:01:03.040> it's

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
accelerate out of the corner but it's

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.039 
accelerate out of the corner but it's
very<00:01:03.370> hard<00:01:03.640> to<00:01:03.760> adjust<00:01:04.239> your<00:01:04.420> speed<00:01:04.719> when<00:01:04.930> you

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
very hard to adjust your speed when you

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.459 
very hard to adjust your speed when you
are<00:01:05.290> in<00:01:05.799> the<00:01:06.009> corner<00:01:06.869> now<00:01:07.869> the<00:01:07.960> second<00:01:08.320> of<00:01:08.380> our

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:08.469 
are in the corner now the second of our

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:10.859 
are in the corner now the second of our
peers<00:01:08.740> are<00:01:08.950> paths<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:10.030> way<00:01:10.210> that<00:01:10.390> we<00:01:10.479> enter<00:01:10.840> a

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
peers are paths the way that we enter a

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:12.749 
peers are paths the way that we enter a
corner<00:01:11.290> where<00:01:11.619> we<00:01:11.799> are<00:01:11.979> half<00:01:12.189> way<00:01:12.219> around<00:01:12.520> the

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
corner where we are half way around the

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.309 
corner where we are half way around the
corner<00:01:13.030> and<00:01:13.270> where<00:01:13.479> we<00:01:13.600> finish<00:01:13.899> the<00:01:14.020> corner

00:01:14.309 --> 00:01:14.319 
corner and where we finish the corner

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:17.099 
corner and where we finish the corner
plays<00:01:14.829> a<00:01:14.859> huge<00:01:15.310> part<00:01:15.459> in<00:01:15.969> our<00:01:16.119> safety<00:01:16.479> so<00:01:17.079> we

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:17.109 
plays a huge part in our safety so we

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:19.859 
plays a huge part in our safety so we
need<00:01:17.380> to<00:01:17.499> think<00:01:17.679> about<00:01:17.799> where<00:01:18.549> to<00:01:18.729> enter<00:01:18.939> when

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
need to think about where to enter when

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:21.330 
need to think about where to enter when
we're<00:01:20.049> going<00:01:20.289> into<00:01:20.439> a<00:01:20.560> corner<00:01:20.859> we<00:01:21.069> want<00:01:21.249> to

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
we're going into a corner we want to

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.730 
we're going into a corner we want to
maximize<00:01:21.819> our<00:01:22.060> view<00:01:22.450> depending<00:01:23.259> on<00:01:23.409> where<00:01:23.709> I

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
maximize our view depending on where I

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.069 
maximize our view depending on where I
enter<00:01:24.159> the<00:01:24.340> corner<00:01:24.609> it<00:01:24.850> will<00:01:25.209> dictate<00:01:25.630> how<00:01:25.810> far

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079 
enter the corner it will dictate how far

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:28.469 
enter the corner it will dictate how far
I<00:01:26.109> can<00:01:26.439> see<00:01:26.619> through<00:01:26.889> the<00:01:27.039> corner<00:01:27.369> the<00:01:27.999> wider<00:01:28.299> I

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
I can see through the corner the wider I

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.840 
I can see through the corner the wider I
can<00:01:28.749> start<00:01:29.049> a<00:01:29.200> corner<00:01:29.590> out<00:01:29.619> here<00:01:30.159> as<00:01:30.279> long<00:01:30.789> as

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
can start a corner out here as long as

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.719 
can start a corner out here as long as
it's<00:01:31.149> safe<00:01:31.329> I<00:01:31.689> can<00:01:32.259> see<00:01:32.529> more<00:01:33.130> through<00:01:33.549> my

it's safe I can see more through my

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.940 
it's safe I can see more through my
corner<00:01:34.179> so<00:01:34.600> when<00:01:34.779> we<00:01:34.929> enter<00:01:35.319> a<00:01:35.350> corner<00:01:35.770> we're

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
corner so when we enter a corner we're

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.769 
corner so when we enter a corner we're
going<00:01:36.159> to<00:01:36.310> enter<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:36.729> corner<00:01:36.939> as<00:01:37.119> wide<00:01:37.420> as<00:01:37.630> we

00:01:37.769 --> 00:01:37.779 
going to enter the corner as wide as we

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:40.410

can<00:01:37.810> safely<00:01:38.259> to<00:01:39.099> maximise<00:01:39.579> our<00:01:39.819> view<00:01:40.119> through

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
can safely to maximise our view through

can safely to maximise our view through
the<00:01:40.539> corner<00:01:41.069> so<00:01:42.069> now<00:01:42.219> we<00:01:42.279> find<00:01:42.609> ourselves<00:01:42.729> in

it's very difficult to bring a corn

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.930 
it's very difficult to bring a corn
are<00:02:22.390> in<00:02:22.510> tighter<00:02:22.810> so<00:02:23.800> our<00:02:23.950> coronary<00:02:24.310> path<00:02:24.640> was

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
are in tighter so our coronary path was

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.450 
are in tighter so our coronary path was
in<00:02:25.240> too<00:02:25.720> wide<00:02:25.900> for<00:02:25.930> maximum<00:02:26.500> vision<00:02:26.740> in<00:02:26.980> the

the left-hand side one last thing that

the left-hand side one last thing that
we<00:02:37.240> want<00:02:37.270> to<00:02:37.450> think<00:02:37.510> about<00:02:37.690> is<00:02:38.020> when<00:02:38.230> we<00:02:38.260> start

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
we want to think about is when we start

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.700 
we want to think about is when we start
steering<00:02:39.250> so<00:02:40.120> if<00:02:40.330> we<00:02:40.480> tip<00:02:40.750> in<00:02:40.900> too<00:02:41.110> early<00:02:41.530> if<00:02:41.590> we

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
steering so if we tip in too early if we

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.620 
steering so if we tip in too early if we
start<00:02:41.950> steering<00:02:42.280> too<00:02:42.550> early<00:02:42.910> we're<00:02:43.300> going<00:02:43.510> to

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
start steering too early we're going to

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.420 
start steering too early we're going to
end<00:02:43.780> up<00:02:43.930> hitting<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.260> apex<00:02:44.770> of<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:44.950> curve<00:02:45.040> and

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
end up hitting the apex of the curve and

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.700 
end up hitting the apex of the curve and
then<00:02:45.910> run<00:02:46.240> very<00:02:46.630> wide<00:02:46.930> at<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.170> exit<00:02:47.560> which<00:02:47.680> is

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
then run very wide at the exit which is

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.520 
then run very wide at the exit which is
very<00:02:47.980> dangerous<00:02:48.520> so<00:02:49.030> as<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.150> general<00:02:49.570> rule<00:02:49.600> we

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
very dangerous so as a general rule we

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.530 
very dangerous so as a general rule we
want<00:02:50.800> to<00:02:50.950> start<00:02:51.400> steering<00:02:51.700> a<00:02:51.940> little<00:02:52.450> bit

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
want to start steering a little bit

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.940 
want to start steering a little bit
later<00:02:52.810> than<00:02:53.080> your<00:02:53.200> thing<00:02:53.410> that's<00:02:53.650> going<00:02:53.890> to

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
later than your thing that's going to

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.770 
later than your thing that's going to
allow<00:02:54.130> you<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:54.340> have<00:02:54.490> that<00:02:54.640> nice<00:02:54.910> smooth<00:02:55.300> into

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
allow you to have that nice smooth into

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.470 
allow you to have that nice smooth into
wide<00:02:56.020> offer<00:02:56.740> in<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.070> middle<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:57.490> then<00:02:58.030> finish

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
wide offer in the middle and then finish

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.270 
wide offer in the middle and then finish
tight<00:02:58.780> this<00:02:59.350> is<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.590> safest<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:00.220> most

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
tight this is the safest and most

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.480 
tight this is the safest and most
flexible<00:03:00.910> way<00:03:01.090> of<00:03:01.120> cornering<00:03:02.310> so<00:03:03.310> we've

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
flexible way of cornering so we've

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:04.800 
flexible way of cornering so we've
looked<00:03:03.700> at<00:03:03.910> two<00:03:04.120> of<00:03:04.240> our<00:03:04.390> peers<00:03:04.660> our

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
looked at two of our peers our

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.110 
looked at two of our peers our
preparation<00:03:05.500> and<00:03:05.680> our<00:03:05.800> paths<00:03:06.070> now<00:03:06.760> to<00:03:06.820> look<00:03:07.000> at

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
preparation and our paths now to look at

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.150 
preparation and our paths now to look at
the<00:03:07.240> third<00:03:07.450> one<00:03:07.660> which<00:03:07.900> is<00:03:07.930> posture<00:03:08.560> posture

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
the third one which is posture posture

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.610 
the third one which is posture posture
is<00:03:09.370> very<00:03:09.459> important<00:03:10.420> before<00:03:11.020> we<00:03:11.260> start

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
is very important before we start

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.400 
is very important before we start
steering<00:03:11.830> a<00:03:12.010> corner<00:03:12.430> we<00:03:12.880> want<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.360> turn<00:03:14.140> our

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
steering a corner we want to turn our

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.350 
steering a corner we want to turn our
head<00:03:14.650> and<00:03:14.830> look<00:03:15.280> as<00:03:15.400> far<00:03:15.670> through<00:03:15.940> the<00:03:15.970> corner

and my whole upper body is just leaning
slightly<00:03:38.440> more<00:03:39.070> than<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:39.400> SCOOTER<00:03:39.760> into<00:03:40.090> the

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
slightly more than the SCOOTER into the

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
turning correctly it also means that I

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.400 
turning correctly it also means that I
don't<00:03:45.340> have<00:03:45.580> to<00:03:45.820> lean<00:03:46.030> my<00:03:46.269> scooter<00:03:46.870> quite<00:03:47.170> as
