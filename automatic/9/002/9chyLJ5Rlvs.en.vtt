00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:18.619
 for me it's like they 're ready at the best 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.449
 and with this I bring you an episode of a 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.009
 new series that I'm going to start doing 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.140
 how good is going to be a series that nothing 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.599
 more rise when I think of something 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.480
 strange and good is to follow the slobber and the 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.790
 is going to name crazy things, I think what 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.110
 that would fit him better and well 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.730
 it happened nothing else because in a comment 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.010
 I saw what would happen if we put 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.629
 a lot of trees together in the mode 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.370
 of the tri capi hector for those who do not 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.440
 know what is the mode of tree capita and 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.180
 smooth leave them in the description of 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.770
 video to be seen and well then nothing 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.780
 more then teach fast basically what 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.120
 What we do is cut the super trees 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.150
 quick and then it occurred to me to make a 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.970
 madness 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.900
 and that's why they're doing this series 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.000
 there is also another mode called 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.730
 absorbent now that is a mod that I already 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.670
 had gone up before you basically put 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.050
 a block of snow in the water and then that 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.090
 block of snow as it absorbs all the 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.400
 water and also because another madness could 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.810
 be putting that block of snow then in the 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.070
 ocean to see what happens 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.440
 to see if it absorbs the entire ocean although 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.180
 I do not think but good and today because 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.830
 I bring you with the three capita mold and 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.570
 they turn madness that how to do just 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.970
 gather a lot of trees from the jungle 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.470
 as you can see there are all facts 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.210
 ball 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.770
 we are going to be creative so that 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.650
 teach more or less I hope that I do not go 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.690
 to take long since then conte i think 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.050
 that enough trees as you can see 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.150
 they are all linked with wood from this 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.760
 way and well let's see what we can 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.410
 do with this thing I'm going to cut the 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.900
 block up to see what happens to the 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.450
 take out all the woods and super 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.390
 mega rain of wood for which I 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.980
 I think if that is going to happen and this way 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.200
 put a diamond ax because if I 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.540
 I put any other type of h then 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.010
 will end because according to this with the 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.920
 model three capi aitor shit poplars with 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:03.760
 a wooden ax all blocks 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:07.450
 that they fall wear out of that of the 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.950
 tool not then yes with the hd's 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.869
 wood to the sections the last block then 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.370
 everything is as if we had cut block 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.630
 so all these obviously goes 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.670
 to finish and we are going to cut all 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.950
 complete then with a diamond me 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.690
 I think it's going to cut everything 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.209
 I do not think the diamond is over with 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.470
 this superstructure of trees like 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.360
 you can see the trees this one got 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.820
 to my poor house he took a look at us 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.270
 and then tell me what you think about this day 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.980
 of this miniseries type we could say it 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.600
 because every time I think of some 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.550
 madness with some way basically going to 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.070
 be with mods too, it can be with 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.830
 a solid content but that something that 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.780
 it would be very healthy more like once something like that 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.100
 but normally this series would be with 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.720
 some way you can do some 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.540
 madness for I will bring you life 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.180
 being this madness not 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.700
 As you can see today, the tri capi 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.700
 aitor the trees walk to inside 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.540
 my house there 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:05.450
 and well I hope you do not exploit my pc 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:07.620
 We are ready with tun tun 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.240
 or I'm going to make it back so they can see 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.470
 how the wood rain falls is going to be 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.000
 an immense rain let's see no 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.970
 we have nothing the inventory let's see 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.970
 how much we managed to put together all 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.930
 what the hell 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.840
 this is the guy that you 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.840
 friends 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.530
 I thought that in his profile they stayed 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.170
 a few trees placing the 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.790
 seem older - which apparently with the 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.430
 of diamond I do not know why he does not shut up 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.290
 everything but but good as 20 no 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.820
 very many wood remained the quanta 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.930
 we float surely did not bind 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:54.470
 well let's finish cutting down 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.580
 wood rain 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:00.240
 wood rain 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:02.130
 I'm going to fail is that apparently I have 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.200
 to give to the tree because this wood that 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.660
 it's here I put it and I think with that 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.400
 way it does not work maybe that's why there 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.120
 fails 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.120
 oh my god 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:17.209
 how many trees did I have to plant here 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:20.000
 all in the area up to the sky and already 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.769
 had apparently not come out as I believed 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.620
 that was going to come out because of these blocks 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.870
 fails or my god 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.000
 now we 're going to go to mode 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.830
 survival so they can see how much 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.830
 how much wood can we put together 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.740
 rain rain rain rain hahaha 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.320
 the new rain of minecraft rain of 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.280
 wood 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.280
 there was no saint 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:51.340
 name look well how was my poor 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.340
 wooden garden 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:56.370
 oh my god 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.800
 come on let's go sprint here in front of 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.110
 monitor just listen to the sound of 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.590
 the little bubble is the peak of so much wood 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.590
 what's here 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:12.849
 there is no look at this, it made you want to be 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:16.230
 breakdance pum pum pum 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:17.920
 to dance the poor block 7 take it 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.350
 we'll see 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:23.220
 the break the block break dancers like no 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.569
 how not 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.460
 you thought that is to survive the tree 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:29.889
 true but no one survives to see 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:36.460
 let's see how much wood friends 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:39.370
 together 2 4 6 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.919
 stacks 64 of pure wood of the jungle 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.009
 nothing more with almost a click were the 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:46.090
 wta like five clicks due to feil but 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:49.090
 but we can see that we continue to take 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.740
 more and more and more and more wood in here 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.409
 above 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.950
 way 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:59.620
 this is very crazy is to see 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:02.650
 good if I start to take each block 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.360
 obviously we will never end then 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.920
 we already take what we reach as 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.310
 can you see this is what we achieve 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:11.500
 join with our ax 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.750
 and well, I just wanted to do this 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.400
 because I wanted to see what happened 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.290
 and I said not pointed it will record and then 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.450
 I said because I do not do a series myself 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.680
 I think that the series would be fine and 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.060
 I repeat that this series will make every 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.449
 time I can think of some madness with 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.189
 some that comes out 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:28.590
 If there are not many follies as good to 

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:30.029
 do is going to be a short series but I 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.949
 I think if there are enough crazy because 

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:33.330
 I 've already seen several ways so with the 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:35.110
 which can be done very 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.890
 foreign 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:40.990
 so then I think that they have 

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:43.060
 liked if you like this idea make sure 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.340
 they left like I'll make sure 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:49.570
 look for crazy mods because there's also 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:52.150
 some of explosive tnt missiles but 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:54.340
 super huge and good many things that are 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:57.210
 can do not then good that has 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.550
 been all because they liked it 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:02.520
 because I heard that noise sounded like 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:04.740
 a golem but it's the ladder you do not know 

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.930
 a new sound flowers good because that has 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.449
 been everything that we liked we're going 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:11.139
 to the next 

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:11.139
 and good bye 

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:19.330
 Y 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.330
 good
