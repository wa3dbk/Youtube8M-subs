00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.309
 hello friends how are we on this occasion 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.310
 I bring you the tweet home screen designer 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.869
 and I liked a lot, we are going to 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.000
 can customize our home 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.310
 Schooling our way to our liking 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.050
 and well this guy we can find 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.720
 in the power network and it lasts because it has already 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.070
 left in several videos and well what 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.930
 only we have to do once 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.449
 downloaded as we can see that already 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.100
 modify a little bit me home schooling 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:37.660
 I've been playing with him since I was 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.910
 looking more or less what we can do 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.620
 with him or what we can find with him and 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.750
 well we can see what it puts us here 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.110
 all of our pages on what 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.150
 is the one if you can say that already with 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.190
 the design that we have created and 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.049
 well we can find both in the 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.120
 homeschooling in our our 

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:57.370
 screen the icon or we can also 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.260
 find it in the settings icon ok 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.159
 well let's go in here we have two 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.530
 default 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:05.070
 let's for example apply this tells us 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.710
 how many pages do we want to activate 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.299
 this we are going to put all default of 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.510
 football are all already in default 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:16.689
 we give where I return and we can see that 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.759
 all my pages are already compliant or of 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:21.070
 factory you could say nothing more than we 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.109
 they have added an icon besides this is 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.719
 icon will also be added when 

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:27.969
 let's install this tweet it comes out good as 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:30.159
 it works I think we can do we can 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:31.899
 create as we want our 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.960
 pages then we have to do is give it 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:37.539
 here where it says like and we can create 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.490
 our pages we can remove move or 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:41.320
 withdraw everything we want for example 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.880
 we keep pressed and we open the 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.729
 option to erase or simply 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.770
 we press here on the X is not left 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.829
 but we better keep it pressed 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.899
 where it says to erase and we erase everything that 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:55.270
 we need now for example 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.539
 we can move the icons in our way 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.670
 to our liking as we like in 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.770
 the good thing something that happened to tell me is 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.140
 that depending on the number of icons that 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.700
 you have is the number of icons 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.060
 that you could say that we need 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.430
 put in our home why because if 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.000
 we put less of the icons that we have 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.890
 on each page 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.840
 they are going to pile up but nothing happens that is 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.030
 remove simply by fitting them well or 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.040
 passing the icons to other pages ok 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.070
 let's put here for example 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.530
 icons to see how this is because 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.760
 you could say owl or we are still missing 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.709
 a little update this page 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.319
 we just like that so we can 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:36.319
 check we're going to give you in save 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:40.159
 and here we give in saving 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:43.400
 save and we're going to put that any 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:46.280
 name save ok tells us that it has already been 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.920
 saved our new configuration 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.019
 let's apply it for example let's 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.900
 put on the first page that comes by 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.390
 default in the second that is this and in 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.290
 the third 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.209
 we are going to give it today good since it is this 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.690
 it was fourth I do not have a page so we're going to 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.880
 let's give it the down we go out and 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.550
 we can see that here we have the 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:13.780
 configuration we created us 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:16.780
 but here we have icons piled up 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.600
 see all we need to do is 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.490
 go them from page to page to 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.620
 that we have no problem in 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.600
 cancel so that we do not have any 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.030
 problem when wanting to modify 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.860
 our icons since I can put them 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.170
 both in folders or we can 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.200
 transfer to the next page as what 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.510
 I put here the click is good 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.239
 missing a little bit is still this means 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.760
 deceptive sometimes we do not know what it is 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.620
 that can guide us to say it of 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.370
 somehow but good the truth that to me 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.620
 at least I liked pretty me 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.300
 I've been putting a good configuration 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.610
 depending on the icons you get or 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.830
 you have you can see very very very 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.120
