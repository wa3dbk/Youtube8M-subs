you're<00:02:13.240> going<00:02:13.450> to<00:02:13.570> need<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:13.990> time<00:02:14.620> machine<00:02:14.650> and

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
you're going to need a time machine and

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.140 
you're going to need a time machine and
if<00:02:16.930> you're<00:02:17.170> lucky<00:02:17.320> enough<00:02:17.500> you'll<00:02:18.130> draw<00:02:18.610> one

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
if you're lucky enough you'll draw one

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.240 
if you're lucky enough you'll draw one
of<00:02:19.270> these<00:02:19.510> different<00:02:20.290> versions<00:02:20.920> of<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.070> time

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
of these different versions of the time

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.240 
of these different versions of the time
machine<00:02:21.570> I'll<00:02:22.570> show<00:02:22.870> you<00:02:22.930> how<00:02:23.830> they<00:02:24.070> look

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
machine I'll show you how they look

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.040 
machine I'll show you how they look
because<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.670> artwork<00:02:25.030> on<00:02:25.240> these<00:02:25.450> is<00:02:25.690> just

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
because the artwork on these is just

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.560 
because the artwork on these is just
fantastic<00:02:26.310> so<00:02:27.310> this<00:02:27.940> is<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.150> most<00:02:28.360> powerful

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
fantastic so this is the most powerful

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.310 
fantastic so this is the most powerful
time<00:02:29.020> machine<00:02:29.350> this<00:02:29.470> is<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.740> time<00:02:29.950> train

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
time machine this is the time train

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.570 
time machine this is the time train
basically<00:02:32.320> it's<00:02:32.470> fully<00:02:32.740> equipped<00:02:33.130> which<00:02:33.400> I'll

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
basically it's fully equipped which I'll

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.520 
basically it's fully equipped which I'll
explain<00:02:33.670> what<00:02:34.000> that<00:02:34.030> means<00:02:34.180> later<00:02:34.540> but<00:02:35.290> this

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
explain what that means later but this

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.530 
explain what that means later but this
is<00:02:35.740> the<00:02:35.890> most<00:02:36.070> powerful<00:02:36.250> time<00:02:36.940> machine<00:02:37.270> in<00:02:37.420> the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
is the most powerful time machine in the

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.120 
is the most powerful time machine in the
game<00:02:37.750> this<00:02:37.959> is<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.320> one<00:02:38.500> that<00:02:38.709> you<00:02:38.830> want

change<00:02:42.130> the<00:02:42.280> time<00:02:42.490> line<00:02:42.520> but<00:02:42.940> you're<00:02:43.120> also

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
change the time line but you're also

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.199 
change the time line but you're also
allowed<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:43.780> play<00:02:43.990> another<00:02:44.110> card<00:02:44.350> which<00:02:45.340> in

only one card on your turn and that is

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.600 
only one card on your turn and that is
kind<00:03:02.320> of<00:03:02.350> difficult<00:03:02.500> so<00:03:02.860> this<00:03:03.010> will<00:03:03.280> allow<00:03:03.550> you

kind of difficult so this will allow you
basically<00:03:04.180> a<00:03:04.300> free<00:03:04.480> play<00:03:04.780> and<00:03:05.080> you<00:03:06.040> get<00:03:06.190> to

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
basically a free play and you get to

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.949 
basically a free play and you get to
change<00:03:06.489> the<00:03:06.670> time<00:03:06.880> line<00:03:09.120> this<00:03:10.120> is<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.600> second

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
change the time line this is the second

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.050 
change the time line this is the second
best<00:03:11.140> card<00:03:11.500> in<00:03:11.770> the<00:03:12.340> game<00:03:12.520> and<00:03:12.730> some<00:03:12.910> would

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
best card in the game and some would

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.550 
best card in the game and some would
argue<00:03:13.090> it<00:03:13.600> might<00:03:13.750> be<00:03:13.870> better<00:03:14.019> than<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.320> time

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
argue it might be better than the time

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.080 
argue it might be better than the time
train<00:03:14.890> depending<00:03:15.340> on<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.519> circumstances

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
train depending on the circumstances

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.390 
train depending on the circumstances
this<00:03:16.630> is<00:03:16.840> time<00:03:17.080> car<00:03:17.350> version<00:03:17.530> 3<00:03:17.950> this<00:03:18.130> is<00:03:18.250> what

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
this is time car version 3 this is what

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.310 
this is time car version 3 this is what
we<00:03:18.519> see<00:03:18.730> at<00:03:18.940> the<00:03:19.030> beginning<00:03:19.480> of<00:03:19.630> back<00:03:20.170> to<00:03:20.290> the

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
we see at the beginning of back to the

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.550 
we see at the beginning of back to the
future<00:03:20.410> part<00:03:20.650> two<00:03:20.860> and<00:03:21.310> this<00:03:22.209> car<00:03:22.480> is<00:03:22.780> fully

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
future part two and this car is fully

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.400 
future part two and this car is fully
equipped<00:03:23.970> again<00:03:24.970> basically<00:03:25.660> it<00:03:25.959> doesn't<00:03:26.260> need

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
equipped again basically it doesn't need

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.009 
equipped again basically it doesn't need
anything<00:03:27.220> special<00:03:27.549> to<00:03:27.970> run<00:03:28.209> it<00:03:28.360> you<00:03:28.570> only<00:03:28.780> need

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
anything special to run it you only need

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.130 
anything special to run it you only need
garbage<00:03:29.410> to<00:03:30.130> put<00:03:30.310> mr.<00:03:30.670> fusion<00:03:30.970> as<00:03:31.720> you<00:03:31.900> can<00:03:32.019> see

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
garbage to put mr. fusion as you can see

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.690 
garbage to put mr. fusion as you can see
this<00:03:32.260> is<00:03:32.410> the<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:32.830> one<00:03:32.980> with<00:03:33.100> the<00:03:33.130> hover

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
this is the the one with the hover

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.960 
this is the the one with the hover
circuit<00:03:34.209> hover<00:03:34.570> conversion<00:03:35.230> and<00:03:35.970> everything

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
circuit hover conversion and everything

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.590 
circuit hover conversion and everything
is<00:03:37.120> just<00:03:37.150> a<00:03:37.630> ok<00:03:38.220> and<00:03:39.220> this<00:03:39.519> card<00:03:39.820> allows<00:03:40.060> you<00:03:40.450> to

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
is just a ok and this card allows you to

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.020 
is just a ok and this card allows you to
draw<00:03:40.840> another<00:03:41.140> card<00:03:41.519> after<00:03:42.519> you've<00:03:42.640> played<00:03:42.880> it

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
draw another card after you've played it

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.030 
draw another card after you've played it
so<00:03:43.180> you<00:03:43.239> can<00:03:43.450> change<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:43.780> time<00:03:43.989> line<00:03:44.019> and<00:03:44.440> then

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
so you can change the time line and then

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.360 
so you can change the time line and then
you<00:03:45.280> can<00:03:45.489> draw<00:03:45.910> another<00:03:46.150> card<00:03:46.860> and<00:03:47.860> drawing<00:03:48.220> is

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
you can draw another card and drawing is

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.979 
you can draw another card and drawing is
important<00:03:48.790> too<00:03:48.940> because<00:03:49.120> like<00:03:49.510> playing<00:03:49.870> a

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
important too because like playing a

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.860 
important too because like playing a
card<00:03:50.200> you<00:03:50.470> can<00:03:50.830> only<00:03:50.920> draw<00:03:51.220> once<00:03:51.760> per<00:03:52.030> turn<00:03:52.060> and

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
card you can only draw once per turn and

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.120 
card you can only draw once per turn and
once<00:03:52.989> you<00:03:53.080> have<00:03:53.200> another<00:03:53.380> card<00:03:53.650> that<00:03:53.860> says

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
once you have another card that says

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.550 
once you have another card that says
something<00:03:54.280> else<00:03:54.549> so<00:03:55.450> this<00:03:55.870> card<00:03:56.110> allows<00:03:56.260> you

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
something else so this card allows you

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.229 
something else so this card allows you
to<00:03:56.650> get<00:03:56.830> another<00:03:57.070> card<00:03:57.430> out<00:03:57.670> of<00:03:58.180> the<00:03:58.540> pot<00:04:00.239> this

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
to get another card out of the pot this

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.780 
to get another card out of the pot this
is<00:04:01.299> time<00:04:01.660> car<00:04:01.900> version<00:04:02.110> 1<00:04:02.470> as<00:04:02.709> we<00:04:03.070> see<00:04:03.280> it<00:04:03.430> fresh

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
is time car version 1 as we see it fresh

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.569 
is time car version 1 as we see it fresh
off<00:04:04.000> of<00:04:04.060> the<00:04:04.540> back<00:04:04.660> of<00:04:04.810> the<00:04:04.870> trailer<00:04:05.080> this<00:04:06.040> time

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.229 
off of the back of the trailer this time
car<00:04:06.940> is<00:04:07.590> pretty<00:04:08.590> cool<00:04:08.950> but<00:04:09.220> as<00:04:09.370> you<00:04:09.519> can<00:04:09.610> see<00:04:09.910> it

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
car is pretty cool but as you can see it

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.800 
car is pretty cool but as you can see it
needs<00:04:10.590> plutonium<00:04:11.820> that<00:04:12.820> was<00:04:13.000> Marty<00:04:13.329> some<00:04:13.510> big

change any of the timelines you will

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:25.700 
change any of the timelines you will
need<00:04:23.129> either<00:04:23.490> the<00:04:24.419> pellet<00:04:24.810> of<00:04:24.930> plutonium<00:04:25.560> on

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
need either the pellet of plutonium on

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.950 
need either the pellet of plutonium on
your<00:04:26.039> side<00:04:26.250> of<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:26.460> field<00:04:26.639> on<00:04:27.539> your<00:04:27.750> side<00:04:27.930> of

your side of the field on your side of

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.649 
your side of the field on your side of
the<00:04:28.139> field<00:04:28.680> to<00:04:28.919> play<00:04:29.340> and<00:04:29.520> you<00:04:30.150> can<00:04:30.300> discard

00:04:30.649 --> 00:04:30.659 
the field to play and you can discard

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:32.689 
the field to play and you can discard
this<00:04:30.900> card<00:04:30.960> and<00:04:31.470> then<00:04:31.710> change<00:04:32.069> time<00:04:32.370> when<00:04:32.610> you

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
this card and then change time when you

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:35.990 
this card and then change time when you
discard<00:04:33.180> this<00:04:33.780> end<00:04:34.050> the<00:04:34.110> time<00:04:34.349> card<00:04:35.000> but

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
discard this end the time card but

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.149 
discard this end the time card but
basically<00:04:36.389> it's<00:04:36.599> one<00:04:37.080> pellet<00:04:37.319> one<00:04:37.560> trip<00:04:37.830> so

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:38.159 
basically it's one pellet one trip so

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:40.939 
basically it's one pellet one trip so
once<00:04:38.520> you<00:04:38.639> discard<00:04:39.060> this<00:04:39.240> everything<00:04:40.169> is<00:04:40.680> done

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
once you discard this everything is done

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.640 
once you discard this everything is done
you've<00:04:41.129> only<00:04:41.310> change<00:04:41.789> time<00:04:42.030> once<00:04:42.300> or<00:04:43.169> you

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
you've only change time once or you

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.070 
you've only change time once or you
could<00:04:44.460> have<00:04:44.580> the<00:04:44.789> case<00:04:45.090> of<00:04:45.389> plutonium<00:04:45.990> and

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
could have the case of plutonium and

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.149 
could have the case of plutonium and
this<00:04:46.229> is<00:04:46.379> what<00:04:46.500> you<00:04:46.590> really<00:04:46.740> want<00:04:47.009> this

00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:47.159 
this is what you really want this

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:49.790 
this is what you really want this
combination<00:04:47.879> right<00:04:48.000> here<00:04:48.300> because<00:04:49.050> once<00:04:49.500> you

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
combination right here because once you

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.450 
combination right here because once you
play<00:04:50.720> your<00:04:51.720> time<00:04:52.229> car<00:04:52.530> and<00:04:52.800> change<00:04:53.099> the

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
play your time car and change the

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.020 
play your time car and change the
timeline<00:04:54.139> you<00:04:55.139> can<00:04:55.530> can<00:04:56.310> you<00:04:56.490> can<00:04:56.759> put<00:04:56.909> the

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
timeline you can can you can put the

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.360 
timeline you can can you can put the
time<00:04:57.240> car<00:04:57.509> back<00:04:57.930> into<00:04:58.110> your<00:04:58.349> hand<00:04:58.590> and<00:04:58.770> you<00:04:59.220> can

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
time car back into your hand and you can

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.999 
time car back into your hand and you can
play<00:04:59.580> it<00:04:59.610> again<00:05:00.240> on<00:05:00.449> your<00:05:00.539> next<00:05:00.840> turn<00:05:01.009> because

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:02.009 
play it again on your next turn because

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:04.430 
play it again on your next turn because
you<00:05:02.340> have<00:05:02.370> an<00:05:02.789> entire<00:05:03.090> case<00:05:03.389> of<00:05:03.599> plutonium<00:05:04.289> to

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
you have an entire case of plutonium to

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.279 
you have an entire case of plutonium to
use<00:05:04.590> so<00:05:05.190> that's<00:05:06.120> pretty<00:05:06.360> clever<00:05:06.630> how<00:05:06.900> they<00:05:07.050> use

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
use so that's pretty clever how they use

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:10.550 
use so that's pretty clever how they use
the<00:05:07.530> items<00:05:07.889> and<00:05:08.479> the<00:05:09.479> cars<00:05:09.750> as<00:05:10.050> we<00:05:10.229> see<00:05:10.409> in<00:05:10.530> the

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
the items and the cars as we see in the

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.520 
the items and the cars as we see in the
movies<00:05:10.889> and<00:05:11.819> they<00:05:12.690> have<00:05:12.930> their<00:05:13.139> little

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
movies and they have their little

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.140 
movies and they have their little
weaknesses<00:05:15.289> but<00:05:16.289> this<00:05:17.039> card<00:05:17.340> is<00:05:17.729> still<00:05:18.030> pretty

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
weaknesses but this card is still pretty

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.550 
weaknesses but this card is still pretty
powerful<00:05:18.539> as<00:05:18.780> long<00:05:18.900> as<00:05:19.020> you<00:05:19.080> have<00:05:19.199> that<00:05:19.229> case

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
powerful as long as you have that case

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.890 
powerful as long as you have that case
of<00:05:19.680> plutonium<00:05:20.159> out<00:05:20.310> in<00:05:20.580> front<00:05:20.819> of<00:05:20.909> you<00:05:20.969> I

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
mine for so long and to play this time

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.370 
mine for so long and to play this time
car<00:05:52.680> you<00:05:53.219> need<00:05:53.759> to<00:05:54.029> discard<00:05:54.779> a<00:05:54.900> card<00:05:54.930> from<00:05:55.229> your

car you need to discard a card from your
hand<00:05:55.440> it's<00:05:56.159> not<00:05:56.310> a<00:05:56.370> big<00:05:56.610> deal<00:05:56.639> it's<00:05:57.150> not<00:05:57.240> like

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
hand it's not a big deal it's not like

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.149 
hand it's not a big deal it's not like
you<00:05:57.599> need<00:05:57.779> an<00:05:57.930> item<00:05:58.139> like<00:05:58.500> some<00:05:58.860> of<00:05:58.949> the<00:05:59.009> other

you need an item like some of the other

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.230 
ones so this this one's still pretty
playable<00:06:01.590> and<00:06:01.800> I<00:06:02.130> think<00:06:02.190> that's<00:06:02.550> because<00:06:02.729> in

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
playable and I think that's because in

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.890 
playable and I think that's because in
the<00:06:03.930> movies<00:06:04.229> this<00:06:04.560> car<00:06:04.919> was<00:06:05.370> pretty<00:06:06.029> good<00:06:06.630> I

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
the movies this car was pretty good I

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.740 
the movies this car was pretty good I
mean<00:06:07.130> you<00:06:08.130> know<00:06:08.250> he's<00:06:08.430> had<00:06:08.639> mr.<00:06:08.940> fusion<00:06:09.150> he

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
mean you know he's had mr. fusion he

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.230 
mean you know he's had mr. fusion he
just<00:06:09.990> needed<00:06:10.169> some<00:06:10.500> new<00:06:10.710> time<00:06:11.130> circuits<00:06:11.370> some

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
just needed some new time circuits some

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.899 
just needed some new time circuits some
new<00:06:12.360> tires<00:06:12.539> and<00:06:12.779> this<00:06:13.590> one<00:06:13.770> was<00:06:13.860> good<00:06:14.069> to<00:06:14.159> go<00:06:14.310> it

future part 1 this car requires
lightning<00:06:32.729> to<00:06:33.030> operate<00:06:33.449> so<00:06:33.690> you<00:06:33.750> need<00:06:34.020> to<00:06:34.199> have

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
lightning to operate so you need to have

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.230 
lightning to operate so you need to have

order to make this car work you need to
discard<00:06:41.699> this<00:06:42.000> card<00:06:42.060> and<00:06:43.250> then<00:06:44.250> you<00:06:44.400> can<00:06:44.550> use

is sadly the last DeLorean that we see
in<00:07:03.539> the<00:07:03.720> movie<00:07:04.910> it<00:07:05.910> requires<00:07:06.389> another<00:07:07.380> item<00:07:07.800> to

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:07.979 
in the movie it requires another item to

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.140 
push it which if you know from the
movies<00:07:10.770> and<00:07:10.800> if<00:07:11.070> I<00:07:11.190> had<00:07:11.340> it<00:07:11.490> ready<00:07:11.699> here<00:07:11.970> it

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:12.150 
movies and if I had it ready here it

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:15.350 
movies and if I had it ready here it
requires<00:07:12.870> the<00:07:13.229> overpowered<00:07:14.190> locomotive<00:07:15.120> to

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 
requires the overpowered locomotive to

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.100 
requires the overpowered locomotive to
push<00:07:15.810> the<00:07:16.259> car<00:07:16.470> to<00:07:16.949> 88<00:07:17.250> miles<00:07:17.430> per<00:07:17.639> hour<00:07:18.110> and

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:19.110 
push the car to 88 miles per hour and

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:23.240 
push the car to 88 miles per hour and
again<00:07:19.650> like<00:07:19.979> time<00:07:20.580> car<00:07:20.910> version<00:07:21.180> 2<00:07:22.070> once<00:07:23.070> you

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:23.250 
again like time car version 2 once you

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.860 
again like time car version 2 once you
play<00:07:23.580> it<00:07:23.789> you<00:07:24.060> have<00:07:24.210> to<00:07:24.330> discard<00:07:24.690> the

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:24.870 
play it you have to discard the

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.110 
play it you have to discard the
locomotive<00:07:25.440> and<00:07:25.530> you<00:07:26.070> discard<00:07:26.520> the<00:07:26.940> time

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120 
locomotive and you discard the time

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.640 
locomotive and you discard the time
class<00:07:28.070> so<00:07:29.070> there<00:07:29.520> are<00:07:30.229> different<00:07:31.229> ways<00:07:31.590> to

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:31.650 
class so there are different ways to

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:34.100 
class so there are different ways to
change<00:07:32.130> the<00:07:32.490> timeline<00:07:32.760> and<00:07:33.240> when<00:07:33.870> I<00:07:33.930> say

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:34.110 
change the timeline and when I say

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.580 
change the timeline and when I say
change<00:07:34.349> the<00:07:34.500> timeline<00:07:34.740> I<00:07:35.570> I<00:07:36.570> assume<00:07:37.560> that

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:37.590 
change the timeline I I assume that

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.409 
change the timeline I I assume that
you've<00:07:37.919> watched<00:07:38.159> my<00:07:38.310> other<00:07:38.340> video<00:07:38.760> but<00:07:39.240> if<00:07:39.330> you

00:07:39.409 --> 00:07:39.419 
you've watched my other video but if you

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:42.140 
you've watched my other video but if you
haven't<00:07:40.039> basically<00:07:41.039> timeline<00:07:41.669> cards<00:07:42.060> look

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:42.150 
haven't basically timeline cards look

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:43.370 
haven't basically timeline cards look
like<00:07:42.360> this<00:07:42.570> this<00:07:42.630> is<00:07:42.870> one<00:07:43.169> of<00:07:43.199> the<00:07:43.289> most

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:43.380 
like this this is one of the most

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.350 
like this this is one of the most
powerful<00:07:43.620> timeline<00:07:44.280> cards<00:07:44.669> it<00:07:44.820> changes<00:07:45.210> all

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 
powerful timeline cards it changes all

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.350 
powerful timeline cards it changes all
of<00:07:45.449> these<00:07:45.840> events<00:07:46.110> in<00:07:47.010> the<00:07:47.220> timeline<00:07:47.460> and<00:07:47.880> when

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:48.360 
of these events in the timeline and when
