00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 yes hello people i show you via today 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.240
 can make the same vanilla sugar 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.190
 of course you need sugar and 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.630
 then container or a glass that so good 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.420
 can close 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.510
 I have a jam jar 1 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.990
 anthes taken and then of course for 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.859
 you still need vanilla pods like that 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.109
 First, we take the vanilla bean 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:30.390
 or depending on how intense will be at the 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:36.630
 you want the taste you can 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:39.600
 also take more than one and open the 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:54.390
 Now that we have you with the knife 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:56.760
 here on so sometimes slit that 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.719
 whole open here if it is now I have 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.719
 already cut through 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:20.400
 Now we do not scratch anything here 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:25.680
 vanillemark beautiful from scratching film 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:30.780
 looks somewhat so that the manual 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:37.970
 we like to give this to sugar 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.970
 in many words a lot out 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.970
 now do a sugar and that 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.250
 You can also do vanilla pods 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:59.310
 I was a little now that is even now 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:02:04.619
 the stupidest thing that fits in better 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.080
 then comes everything jens glas we flow 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:11.940
 very well 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:16.680
 then it is shaken so that the 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.300
 also nicely distributed and as you said 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.080
 also can convertible debt even more pure 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.870
 then do the taste is intense and 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:29.810
 depending on how much sugar you have 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:36.900
 you have to, it is not quite perfect 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:40.200
 I'll do that again with each other and that 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.840
 then reasonably good then you do 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.180
 the best for a week or so 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.670
 and again and again 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.180
 shake something in between and then 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.920
 should actually also good at 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.920
 thanks for watching and bye
