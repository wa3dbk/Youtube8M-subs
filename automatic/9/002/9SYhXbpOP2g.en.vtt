00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.070
 very good girls very good guys or 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.470
 Iniesta, what are you waiting for? 

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:11.330
 all very well today I tell you a 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:13.419
 news about curiosity mars and a 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.510
 UFO this video also in a certain way 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:20.330
 I dedicate it to Patricia is a cousin 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.359
 mine and today just coincided with her 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.220
 she did not know that I upload videos to 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:28.699
 youtube until your son good up 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.890
 that my cousin saw it and well already 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.090
 is very fond of this so for 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.820
 I think that this video is going to 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.879
 like it very much it turns out that on day 28 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.820
 April recorded by Curiosity 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:43.170
 accident a sequence of images in 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.199
 which appears 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:51.000
 an unidentified flying object that 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:54.629
 it comes out of it appears flying as if falling 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.570
 dive from the sky of Mars and falls 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.780
 on the surface of this in fact you're 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.640
 images are very similar to the object 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.990
 unidentified flyer recorded in the 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.330
 volcano popocatépetl in the year 2012 that 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.170
 they thus showed an object shaped like 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:16.950
 cigar a form of white stick and a 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.280
 diameter of about 270 meters as I have 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.810
 commented before this UFO was recorded 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.240
 accidentally by the curiosity probe 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:30.539
 on April 28, 2014 and two years 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.539
 before because the same process was repeated 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:37.500
 that same accident that same object in 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:40.980
 mexico in fact you have the images in 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.890
 in the description the description in the 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.950
 screen on the left is the object of 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:52.170
 mars and on the right the object of the 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:54.000
 volcano popocatépetl I good already makes a 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.270
 month out there 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.800
 that I 've already uploaded a video related to a 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.710
 object of a terrestrial object not 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.600
 identified that was detected in on Mars 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.970
 He was also photographed by the 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.190
 curiosity and it was an object that was in 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:16.500
 the surface of Mars and it was like a beam 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:18.420
 of light that came from the earth 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.690
 really on Mars are happening 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.720
 very strange things again I reiterate not 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.420
 I want to be heavy but every time 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.670
 talk about a video in a video that has 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.550
 Something to do with Mars or have something 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.830
 what to do with this kind of thing I'm already 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.720
 tired of saying it you have to look at the 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.100
 movie mission to marte really that 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.190
 It will disappoint us and you will understand 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.190
 many things that we talked about 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.190
 truly 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.970
 the movies are the movies worth 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.040
 but 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.690
 in the movies they also bring a 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.580
 little bit of reality is not the only 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.700
 way of freedom we can say what 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:59.230
 that we think through then through 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.400
 of cinematography so good 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.780
 you have the last opinion I 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:08.569
 I have mine, I think that Mars 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.709
 it is uninhabited but there is life 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.880
 under the earth even 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.260
 superficially there is also life only 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.860
 what 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.620
 or else he does not want to show us well 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.570
 I do not know I really do not know I have my 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.150
 opinion now 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.560
 Now you have to comment to you like this 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.330
 that nothing waits guys that follows 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.760
 interested this news a little kiss to 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.410
