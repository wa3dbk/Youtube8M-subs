 &amp; kate della roscia the door in the app on the new a new model of ferns the 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.760
 dufour 3 3 5 from a boat that never feasts immediately with a big news 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:20.489
 especially look queen covered the cockpit and you may have been a little backward 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:24.849
 this advantage of the internal volumes that is and therefore the posita to withdraw 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.230
 you will be able to theme the fact that the donkey's back is removed and it has been 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.449
 applied this concept opening in this way over internal volumes that 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:36.390
 they are currently increased, and a blanket space has also increased 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.710
 sufficiently free the demo version even unpublished of the 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.129
 fact that an inn was applied a hawthorn is an inside one 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.249
 boat of course a little bit of the style of the boats he designed 

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:53.789
 fern with a good overlap of the genoa a 100 30% almost 128 for the 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.719
 precision is a boat that is very comfortable even inside 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.170
 and in order for interiors to be comfortable, leave only one categorical 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.030
 possibility of layaut 2 cabins and a bathroom in this way the spaces of each 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.810
 single environment are generous therefore very adept benedict 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.869
 in this he goes to the head then take a crew of 4, wanting also 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.920
 if people scrutinizing the square thanks also to the fact that we have a good one 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.020
 availability of space to stow clothes and galley linens 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.110
 self 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.900
 and in a context of closed environments the station fits well the bathroom that 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.010
 takes up all the space available for life in the engine compartment 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.700
 I therefore look forward to the usability of magazines
