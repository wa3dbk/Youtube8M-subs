00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
but they're just not as vivid as we

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.400 
but they're just not as vivid as we
would<00:04:33.460> like<00:04:33.610> them<00:04:33.790> to<00:04:33.970> be<00:04:34.000> but<00:04:34.690> again<00:04:34.810> Vizio

you<00:04:35.800> know<00:04:36.180> 240<00:04:37.180> it<00:04:37.300> hurts<00:04:37.570> smooth<00:04:37.840> motion

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
you know 240 it hurts smooth motion

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.900 
you know 240 it hurts smooth motion
processing<00:04:38.650> works<00:04:38.800> pretty<00:04:38.980> well<00:04:39.100> but<00:04:39.700> if<00:04:39.820> you

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
processing works pretty well but if you

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.970 
processing works pretty well but if you
turned<00:04:40.120> up<00:04:40.300> you<00:04:41.200> will<00:04:41.320> see<00:04:41.350> a<00:04:41.500> lot<00:04:41.680> of<00:04:41.710> video

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
turned up you will see a lot of video

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.380 
turned up you will see a lot of video
processing<00:04:42.460> and<00:04:42.580> artifacting<00:04:43.030> as<00:04:43.120> well<00:04:43.270> but

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
processing and artifacting as well but

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.660 
processing and artifacting as well but
again<00:04:43.450> it's<00:04:43.720> inexpensive<00:04:44.110> and<00:04:44.890> it<00:04:45.370> does<00:04:45.520> a<00:04:45.550> lot

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
again it's inexpensive and it does a lot
