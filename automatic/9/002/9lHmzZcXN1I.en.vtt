 we will do 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:10.440
 at the umbrella a small guide because you 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:13.700
 you can train your aim properly 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.100
 first you will need kontra itself 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.380
 steam and the ability to use the workshop 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.500

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:30.630
 will you have on screen help you this 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:34.020
 do actually for the very beginning we 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.030
 you must go in steam and at the top you 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.750
 see in a dense library shop 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.860
 communities there but we choose community 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.829
 don't click on it 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.039

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:52.020
 and from there opens a window in which 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:54.510

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.120
 say and that is we will have a list of games 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.890
 but I think it's not hard to guess what 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.899
 we will choose counter strike global 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.970
 offensive if 3 pages 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.369

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.140

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.860

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.380
 fast reflex if anyone has not understood 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.750
 help you play a quality map 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.840

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.490
 added it to the workshop here is a map 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.280

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.580
 there are a few cards we click on the cards 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.750
 which is 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.700
 indicated in the screenshot to be satisfied 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.220
 this map of the king we need 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.380
 there was a click on this green plus sign 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.190
 which was in the lower right corner 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:10.220
 from the thumbnail of this card in this way 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:13.990
 we add our map to our list 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.070
 cards from the workshop to the counter 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.930
 to load the card itself 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.790
 directly from counter click 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.860
 play 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:27.020
 single humpback from the workshop 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.380
 further in the search list we write a face 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.310
 press enter displays all cards by 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.459
 list by article 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:40.190
 choose our map and press the button 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:44.000
 the process begins next 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.660
 spending your and him in the game i 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.570
 I recommend doing this to you with 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:54.340
 pistols because on pistols 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:59.000
 he trains very much and he rather 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:02.450
 compression skill shooting skill one by one 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.940
 bullets because heat boss after all 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.360
 You can calmly hold down with written colors 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:11.390
 and maybe he's sharpened by dancing sasha 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:15.140
 Now as for what will not in any way you 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:19.760
 don't take the gun tec-9 because on 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:22.220
 the track is very poor accuracy and too 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.739
 great talent lead us to a person that is not 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:29.390
 will help you as easily as you like 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:31.130
 train your own self 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.519
 I recommend to spend on such a map 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:38.300
 about an hour and a half a day's Well 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:40.600
 either there are 600 700 enemies until you 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.010
 type here 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.410
 for example, there was training for half an hour 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.860
 pistol the rest is collage 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:54.220
 by the wind 4 and Kalash because 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:56.590
 Well, because the principle is probably 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.070
 all except i will tell you now 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:03.220
 Separately, a screenshot will show how actually 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.300
 add this or that gun on 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.120
 this map 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.010
 and now i say goodbye to you all
