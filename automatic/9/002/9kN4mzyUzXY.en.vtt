looking<00:03:20.960> at<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.320> curvature<00:03:21.560> in<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.130> in<00:03:22.340> the

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.460 
looking at the curvature in the in the

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.460 
looking at the curvature in the in the
east-west<00:03:22.760> direction<00:03:23.200> approximately<00:03:24.200> 10

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
east-west direction approximately 10

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.980 
east-west direction approximately 10
degrees<00:03:24.800> off<00:03:25.040> of<00:03:25.690> up<00:03:26.690> the<00:03:26.960> true<00:03:27.340> east-west

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
degrees off of up the true east-west

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:35.290 
degrees off of up the true east-west
there's<00:03:29.990> another<00:03:30.260> mountain<00:03:30.530> peak<00:03:31.150> at<00:03:34.300> azimuth

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
there's another mountain peak at azimuth

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.260 
there's another mountain peak at azimuth
of<00:03:35.450> 82<00:03:35.870> degrees<00:03:36.260> in<00:03:36.560> 46<00:03:37.310> minutes<00:03:37.400> from<00:03:38.000> here

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
of 82 degrees in 46 minutes from here

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.110 
of 82 degrees in 46 minutes from here
it's<00:03:38.450> called<00:03:38.660> oswaldo<00:03:39.670> there's<00:03:40.670> also<00:03:40.940> a

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
it's called oswaldo there's also a

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.660 
it's called oswaldo there's also a
survey<00:03:41.600> station<00:03:42.080> on<00:03:42.200> top<00:03:42.440> of<00:03:42.650> all<00:03:42.800> of<00:03:42.830> us<00:03:43.130> Waldo

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
survey station on top of all of us Waldo

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.780 
survey station on top of all of us Waldo
so<00:03:44.540> we<00:03:44.630> know<00:03:44.780> a<00:03:45.020> precise<00:03:45.620> elevation<00:03:45.920> for<00:03:46.640> that

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
so we know a precise elevation for that

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.410 
so we know a precise elevation for that
peak<00:03:47.060> and<00:03:47.900> it's<00:03:48.280> three<00:03:49.280> thousand<00:03:49.820> and<00:03:49.940> twenty

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
peak and it's three thousand and twenty

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.729 
peak and it's three thousand and twenty
two<00:03:50.690> feet<00:03:51.050> and<00:03:51.400> forty<00:03:53.470> forty-five<00:03:54.470> miles

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
approximately from this point again

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.390 
approximately from this point again
today<00:03:59.510> we<00:03:59.660> have<00:03:59.810> ten<00:04:00.020> miles<00:04:00.260> of<00:04:00.470> visibility<00:04:00.560> we

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
today we have ten miles of visibility we

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.979 
today we have ten miles of visibility we
can't<00:04:01.640> see<00:04:01.790> either<00:04:01.880> one<00:04:02.000> of<00:04:02.150> those<00:04:02.300> mountain

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
can't see either one of those mountain

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.470 
can't see either one of those mountain
peaks<00:04:03.200> out<00:04:03.470> there<00:04:03.680> but<00:04:04.580> the<00:04:04.730> angles<00:04:05.360> that

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
peaks out there but the angles that

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.020 
peaks out there but the angles that
you'll<00:04:05.690> turn<00:04:05.870> to<00:04:06.050> Oswald<00:04:06.650> mountain<00:04:07.070> are<00:04:07.700> going

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
you'll turn to Oswald mountain are going

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.190 
you'll turn to Oswald mountain are going

nine feet of elevation out in that

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.190 
nine feet of elevation out in that
direction<00:04:22.190> due<00:04:22.610> to<00:04:22.730> curvature<00:04:22.990> you're<00:04:23.990> going

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
this this sequence of which I intend to

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.860 
this this sequence of which I intend to
do<00:04:59.759> five<00:05:01.520> the<00:05:02.520> first<00:05:03.150> test<00:05:03.509> that<00:05:03.659> I<00:05:03.719> had

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
do five the first test that I had

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.929 
do five the first test that I had
mentioned<00:05:04.319> is<00:05:05.659> the<00:05:06.659> Anacapa<00:05:07.229> arch<00:05:07.669> which<00:05:08.669> as<00:05:08.819> I

00:05:08.929 --> 00:05:08.939 
mentioned is the Anacapa arch which as I

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:11.719 
mentioned is the Anacapa arch which as I
understand<00:05:09.419> in<00:05:09.569> the<00:05:09.719> in<00:05:09.990> the<00:05:10.310> bay<00:05:11.310> out<00:05:11.580> in<00:05:11.669> the

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:11.729 
understand in the in the bay out in the

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:14.209 
understand in the in the bay out in the
San<00:05:11.909> Francisco<00:05:12.030> area<00:05:12.629> is<00:05:12.990> 40<00:05:13.409> feet<00:05:13.620> high<00:05:13.650> above

00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:14.219

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:17.330 
San Francisco area is 40 feet high above
the<00:05:14.340> sea<00:05:14.550> water<00:05:15.439> my<00:05:16.439> understanding<00:05:16.979> is<00:05:17.069> you

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
the sea water my understanding is you

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.469 
the sea water my understanding is you
can<00:05:17.550> see<00:05:17.759> it<00:05:17.879> from<00:05:18.090> 16<00:05:18.599> mile<00:05:18.840> distance<00:05:19.520> so<00:05:20.520> if

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
can see it from 16 mile distance so if

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.249 
can see it from 16 mile distance so if
you<00:05:21.659> are<00:05:21.780> gonna<00:05:21.900> turn<00:05:22.440> the<00:05:23.009> angle<00:05:23.400> from<00:05:24.259> 16

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:25.259 
you are gonna turn the angle from 16

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:28.610 
you are gonna turn the angle from 16
miles<00:05:25.500> to<00:05:26.430> the<00:05:26.550> top<00:05:26.729> of<00:05:26.909> Anacapa<00:05:27.750> arch<00:05:27.960> which

miles to the top of Anacapa arch which

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.379 
miles to the top of Anacapa arch which
is<00:05:28.770> 40<00:05:29.039> foot<00:05:29.250> high<00:05:29.400> you're<00:05:29.699> gonna<00:05:29.789> read<00:05:30.120> one

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
is 40 foot high you're gonna read one

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:33.800 
is 40 foot high you're gonna read one
minute<00:05:30.690> and<00:05:30.840> 25<00:05:31.289> seconds<00:05:32.150> of<00:05:33.150> an<00:05:33.360> inclined

up the instrument and turn the angles

up the instrument and turn the angles
