been using the P split now for I guess

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.690 
been using the P split now for I guess
around<00:01:29.289> three<00:01:29.530> years<00:01:29.770> and<00:01:30.489> what<00:01:30.670> I

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
around three years and what I

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.300 
around three years and what I
particularly<00:01:31.239> like<00:01:31.569> about<00:01:31.959> it<00:01:32.440> is<00:01:32.649> first<00:01:33.220> of

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
particularly like about it is first of

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.479 
particularly like about it is first of
all<00:01:33.489> its<00:01:33.849> total<00:01:34.509> signal<00:01:34.810> fidelity<00:01:35.229> it<00:01:36.009> puts

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:36.489 
all its total signal fidelity it puts

00:01:36.489 --> 00:01:39.240 
all its total signal fidelity it puts
out<00:01:36.700> a<00:01:36.729> fantastic<00:01:37.569> signal<00:01:38.050> that<00:01:38.560> you<00:01:38.739> can<00:01:38.920> feed

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
out a fantastic signal that you can feed

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.430 
out a fantastic signal that you can feed
straight<00:01:39.640> to<00:01:39.819> the<00:01:39.940> converter<00:01:40.360> and<00:01:40.720> it's

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
straight to the converter and it's

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.520 
straight to the converter and it's
incredibly<00:01:42.220> robust<00:01:42.880> hardware<00:01:43.509> it's<00:01:43.989> simply<00:01:44.500> a

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
incredibly robust hardware it's simply a

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.309 
incredibly robust hardware it's simply a
great<00:01:44.890> piece<00:01:45.310> of<00:01:45.340> technology<00:01:45.810> it's<00:01:46.810> enormous

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.319 
great piece of technology it's enormous

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:49.710 
great piece of technology it's enormous
fun<00:01:47.739> to<00:01:47.950> work<00:01:48.160> with<00:01:48.399> it<00:01:48.550> and<00:01:48.729> it<00:01:49.270> fits<00:01:49.569> just

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
fun to work with it and it fits just

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:57.649 
fun to work with it and it fits just
brilliantly<00:01:50.470> into<00:01:50.979> a<00:01:51.009> system<00:01:51.520> here
