we<00:00:40.950> talk<00:00:41.219> about<00:00:41.520> things<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:41.969> take<00:00:42.170> billions

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
we talk about things that take billions

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.690 
we talk about things that take billions
of<00:00:43.290> years<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.649> happen<00:00:43.980> on<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.280> guide<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.579> space

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
of years to happen on the guide to space

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.420 
of years to happen on the guide to space
so<00:00:45.510> what<00:00:45.570> about<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.780> supernova<00:00:46.170> any<00:00:46.890> guesses<00:00:47.160> on

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
so what about a supernova any guesses on

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.700 
so what about a supernova any guesses on
how<00:00:47.610> fast<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.239> happens<00:00:48.500> well<00:00:49.500> there's

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
how fast that happens well there's

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.290 
how fast that happens well there's
actually<00:00:49.860> several<00:00:50.460> different<00:00:50.910> kinds<00:00:51.239> of

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
actually several different kinds of

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.670 
actually several different kinds of
supernovae<00:00:51.809> out<00:00:51.930> there<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.469> they<00:00:52.590> have

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
supernovae out there and they have

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.439 
supernovae out there and they have
different<00:00:52.920> mechanisms<00:00:53.789> at<00:00:53.910> different

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
different mechanisms at different

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.779 
different mechanisms at different
durations<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.620> I'm<00:00:55.739> going<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.949> focus<00:00:56.160> on<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
durations so I'm going to focus on the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.720 
durations so I'm going to focus on the
core<00:00:57.180> collapse<00:00:57.690> supernovae<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.859> regular

core collapse supernovae the regular

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.139 
core collapse supernovae the regular

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
exhaust the hydrogen fuel in the cores

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.090 
exhaust the hydrogen fuel in the cores
quickly<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:09.270> few<00:01:09.299> short<00:01:09.659> million<00:01:10.049> years<00:01:10.290> but

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
quickly in a few short million years but

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.130 
quickly in a few short million years but
just<00:01:11.159> like<00:01:11.369> our<00:01:11.490> Sun<00:01:11.760> they<00:01:12.270> convert<00:01:12.659> hydrogen

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
just like our Sun they convert hydrogen

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.859 
just like our Sun they convert hydrogen

tremendous<00:01:16.619> amounts<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.040> energy<00:01:17.159> which

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
tremendous amounts of energy which

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.929 
tremendous amounts of energy which

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
to collapse in on itself once the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.490 
to collapse in on itself once the
massive<00:01:23.670> star<00:01:23.939> runs<00:01:23.970> out<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.509> hydrogen<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:25.320> its

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
massive star runs out of hydrogen in its

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.039 
massive star runs out of hydrogen in its

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
core it switches to helium and then

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.560 
core it switches to helium and then

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
reaches iron the problem is that iron

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.160 
reaches iron the problem is that iron
doesn't<00:01:35.970> produce<00:01:36.180> energy<00:01:36.720> through<00:01:37.020> the

doesn't produce energy through the
fusion<00:01:37.500> process<00:01:37.650> so<00:01:38.430> there's<00:01:38.610> nothing

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
fusion process so there's nothing

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.050 
fusion process so there's nothing

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
about 23% the speed of light so it's

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.880 
about 23% the speed of light so it's
