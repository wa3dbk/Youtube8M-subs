00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
body weight is slowly starting to come

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.030 
body weight is slowly starting to come
back<00:01:02.809> to<00:01:03.809> be<00:01:03.989> completely<00:01:04.320> honest<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.800> was<00:01:04.920> just

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040

Lane and I up to my my carbs and my fat

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.440 
Lane and I up to my my carbs and my fat
back<00:01:10.619> up<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:10.950> was<00:01:11.130> just<00:01:11.340> having<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.090> many<00:01:12.210> other

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
back up I was just having so many other

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.030 
back up I was just having so many other
issues<00:01:12.689> going<00:01:12.900> on<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.530> wasn't<00:01:13.770> even

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
issues going on that I wasn't even

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.929 
issues going on that I wasn't even
getting<00:01:14.130> enough<00:01:14.490> food<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.960> going<00:01:16.710> from

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
getting enough food in and so going from

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.960 
getting enough food in and so going from
having<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.479> lower<00:01:18.960> macro<00:01:19.439> account<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.979> having

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
having a lower macro account and having

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.460 
having a lower macro account and having
my<00:01:21.090> metabolisms<00:01:21.720> feet<00:01:21.930> up<00:01:22.079> and<00:01:22.229> dropping

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
my metabolisms feet up and dropping

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.679 
my metabolisms feet up and dropping
weight<00:01:23.159> pretty<00:01:23.490> quickly<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.119> then<00:01:24.240> trying<00:01:24.540> to

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
weight pretty quickly and then trying to

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.480 
weight pretty quickly and then trying to
add<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.990> way<00:01:25.110> back<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.799> just<00:01:25.920> not<00:01:26.100> eating

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
add the way back on and just not eating

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.749 
add the way back on and just not eating
enough<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:27.390> do<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:28.470> think<00:01:29.340> those<00:01:29.460> are<00:01:29.490> some

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
enough to do that I think those are some

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.520 
enough to do that I think those are some
pretty<00:01:29.790> big<00:01:30.149> factors<00:01:30.600> combined<00:01:31.170> with<00:01:31.380> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
pretty big factors combined with the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.200 
pretty big factors combined with the
move<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.979> just<00:01:32.280> different<00:01:32.460> life<00:01:32.759> stresses

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
move and just different life stresses

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.090 
move and just different life stresses
and<00:01:33.329> everything<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.520> I'm<00:01:35.520> still<00:01:35.939> not<00:01:36.210> where<00:01:36.600> I

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
and everything and I'm still not where I

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.060 
and everything and I'm still not where I
would<00:01:38.100> like<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.640> be<00:01:39.560> going<00:01:40.560> into<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.860> meat

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
would like to be going into this meat

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.100 
would like to be going into this meat
i'm<00:01:41.189> still<00:01:41.460> not<00:01:41.610> if<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.000> place<00:01:42.210> where<00:01:42.479> looking

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
i'm still not if the place where looking

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.749 
i'm still not if the place where looking
back<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.649> know<00:01:43.740> 20<00:01:43.979> weeks<00:01:44.219> ago<00:01:44.460> when<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.670> was

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
back you know 20 weeks ago when I was

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.370 
back you know 20 weeks ago when I was
prepping<00:01:45.000> myself<00:01:45.299> for<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.140> would

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
prepping myself for this that I would

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.399 
prepping myself for this that I would
say<00:01:46.619> oh<00:01:46.649> that's<00:01:46.979> exactly<00:01:47.460> where<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.670> need<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.880> be

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
say oh that's exactly where I need to be

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.980 
say oh that's exactly where I need to be
to<00:01:49.409> get<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.649> goals<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.070> have<00:01:50.130> but<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:51.060> think

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
to get the goals that I have but I think

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.520 
to get the goals that I have but I think
I'm<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.259> better<00:01:52.409> place<00:01:52.649> mentally<00:01:52.740> as<00:01:53.579> far<00:01:53.880> as

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
I'm in a better place mentally as far as

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.520 
I'm in a better place mentally as far as
you<00:01:55.530> know<00:01:55.619> just<00:01:56.090> kind<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.180> accepting<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.170> idea

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530

close<00:03:43.030> to<00:03:43.060> me<00:03:43.299> time<00:03:43.569> is<00:03:43.599> to<00:03:43.900> start<00:03:44.109> to<00:03:44.200> look

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
close to me time is to start to look

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.920 
close to me time is to start to look
past<00:03:44.530> that<00:03:45.239> performance<00:03:46.239> and<00:03:46.510> start<00:03:46.720> to<00:03:46.810> look

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
past that performance and start to look

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.210 
past that performance and start to look
at<00:03:47.049> all<00:03:47.109> the<00:03:47.200> things<00:03:47.410> that<00:03:47.500> I<00:03:47.590> want<00:03:47.799> to<00:03:47.859> fix<00:03:48.010> or

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
at all the things that I want to fix or

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.809 
at all the things that I want to fix or
improve<00:03:48.549> and<00:03:49.120> you<00:03:49.989> really<00:03:50.319> just<00:03:50.560> have<00:03:51.519> to<00:03:51.669> work

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
improve and you really just have to work

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.909 
improve and you really just have to work
with<00:03:52.000> the<00:03:52.120> time<00:03:52.299> you<00:03:52.419> have<00:03:52.599> for<00:03:53.049> those<00:03:53.290> for

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
with the time you have for those for

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:55.770 
with the time you have for those for
those<00:03:53.950> moments<00:03:54.250> and<00:03:54.760> say<00:03:55.090> that<00:03:55.299> what<00:03:55.569> will

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
those moments and say that what will

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.270 
those moments and say that what will
come<00:03:56.019> afterwards<00:03:56.349> is<00:03:56.620> something<00:03:56.980> that<00:03:57.099> yeah<00:03:57.250> I

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
come afterwards is something that yeah I

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.830 
come afterwards is something that yeah I
can<00:03:57.489> play<00:03:57.639> a<00:03:57.669> little<00:03:57.910> bit<00:03:58.120> now<00:03:58.239> but<00:03:58.269> I<00:03:58.480> cannot

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
can play a little bit now but I cannot

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.500 
can play a little bit now but I cannot
put<00:03:59.019> my<00:03:59.139> focus<00:03:59.380> past<00:03:59.919> the<00:04:00.639> here<00:04:00.880> and<00:04:01.030> now<00:04:01.090> I

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
put my focus past the here and now I

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.890 
put my focus past the here and now I
have<00:04:02.079> to<00:04:02.579> stay<00:04:03.579> the<00:04:03.639> course<00:04:04.000> at<00:04:04.480> least<00:04:04.720> until

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
have to stay the course at least until

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.420 
have to stay the course at least until
this<00:04:05.200> is<00:04:05.380> through<00:04:05.560> and<00:04:05.709> then<00:04:05.829> I<00:04:05.889> can<00:04:06.190> readjust

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
this is through and then I can readjust

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.819 
this is through and then I can readjust
some<00:04:06.790> things<00:04:07.000> then<00:04:07.180> I<00:04:07.299> can<00:04:07.569> go<00:04:08.230> back<00:04:08.380> and<00:04:08.620> fix

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
some things then I can go back and fix

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:10.360 
some things then I can go back and fix
the<00:04:09.160> the<00:04:09.190> plethora<00:04:09.730> of<00:04:09.819> things<00:04:09.880> that

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
plans that I've made and trying to get

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.240 
plans that I've made and trying to get
through<00:04:20.840> i<00:04:21.019> will<00:04:21.470> say<00:04:21.650> these<00:04:21.829> last<00:04:22.070> two

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
through i will say these last two

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.100 
through i will say these last two
sessions<00:04:22.490> have<00:04:22.910> been<00:04:22.940> really<00:04:23.419> a<00:04:23.600> lot<00:04:23.840> better

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
sessions have been really a lot better

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.689 
sessions have been really a lot better
much<00:04:24.530> improved<00:04:24.919> this<00:04:25.100> the<00:04:25.310> first<00:04:25.520> time

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:25.699 
much improved this the first time

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:28.450 
much improved this the first time
handling<00:04:26.180> 700<00:04:26.990> plus<00:04:27.229> on<00:04:27.440> my<00:04:27.470> bed<00:04:27.710> since<00:04:28.040> april

handling 700 plus on my bed since april

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.670 
handling 700 plus on my bed since april
seconds<00:04:28.970> so<00:04:29.090> it's<00:04:29.240> been<00:04:29.389> a<00:04:29.419> while<00:04:29.720> since<00:04:30.470> i've

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
seconds so it's been a while since i've

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.140 
seconds so it's been a while since i've
messed<00:04:30.919> with<00:04:31.070> this<00:04:31.220> weight<00:04:31.460> since<00:04:31.790> the<00:04:31.970> weight

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
messed with this weight since the weight

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.909 
messed with this weight since the weight
swing<00:04:32.449> has<00:04:32.750> kind<00:04:33.050> of<00:04:33.110> come<00:04:33.290> and<00:04:33.470> gone<00:04:33.620> since

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
swing has kind of come and gone since

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.780 
swing has kind of come and gone since
that<00:04:34.600> funky<00:04:35.600> random<00:04:36.310> week<00:04:37.310> of<00:04:37.550> preparation

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
that funky random week of preparation

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.760 
that funky random week of preparation
that<00:04:38.120> i<00:04:38.210> did<00:04:38.360> for<00:04:38.540> that<00:04:38.630> last<00:04:38.960> meet<00:04:39.260> and<00:04:39.500> just

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
that i did for that last meet and just

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.379 
that i did for that last meet and just
didn't<00:04:40.100> come<00:04:40.400> away<00:04:40.580> with<00:04:40.610> anything<00:04:41.060> so<00:04:41.270> this

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
didn't come away with anything so this

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.320 
didn't come away with anything so this
is<00:04:41.510> not<00:04:41.630> the<00:04:41.810> fastest<00:04:42.380> pool<00:04:42.590> but<00:04:43.460> uh<00:04:43.490> hitting

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
is not the fastest pool but uh hitting

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.060 
is not the fastest pool but uh hitting
the<00:04:44.539> 650<00:04:45.260> 545<00:04:46.130> much<00:04:47.030> improved<00:04:47.539> from<00:04:48.470> last<00:04:48.530> week

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
the 650 545 much improved from last week

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.430 
the 650 545 much improved from last week
as<00:04:49.669> far<00:04:49.940> as<00:04:49.970> the<00:04:50.360> proficiency<00:04:50.990> of<00:04:51.020> the<00:04:51.229> poles

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
as far as the proficiency of the poles

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.159 
as far as the proficiency of the poles
and<00:04:51.770> kind<00:04:52.460> of<00:04:52.520> the<00:04:52.669> technique<00:04:53.090> and<00:04:53.449> just<00:04:54.020> the

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
and kind of the technique and just the

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.230 
and kind of the technique and just the
cleanliness<00:04:54.470> of<00:04:54.590> those<00:04:55.190> those<00:04:55.699> poles<00:04:56.000> was<00:04:56.210> a

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
cleanliness of those those poles was a

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.300 
cleanliness of those those poles was a
lot<00:04:56.449> better<00:04:56.660> and<00:04:56.930> I<00:04:57.320> think<00:04:57.350> that<00:04:57.770> may<00:04:57.979> not<00:04:58.130> have

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
lot better and I think that may not have

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.580 
lot better and I think that may not have
been<00:04:58.340> the<00:04:58.550> fastest<00:04:59.180> 705<00:04:59.750> probably<00:05:00.350> one<00:05:00.440> of<00:05:00.470> the

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
been the fastest 705 probably one of the

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.320 
been the fastest 705 probably one of the
slowest<00:05:01.010> that<00:05:01.130> I've<00:05:01.220> ever<00:05:01.280> done<00:05:01.520> but<00:05:02.210> it

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
slowest that I've ever done but it

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.810 
slowest that I've ever done but it
actually<00:05:02.570> was<00:05:03.050> one<00:05:03.289> of<00:05:03.560> the<00:05:03.860> most<00:05:04.639> technically

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
actually was one of the most technically

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.500 
actually was one of the most technically
consistent<00:05:07.820> throughout<00:05:08.030> I<00:05:08.120> didn't<00:05:08.389> really

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
consistent throughout I didn't really

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.180 
consistent throughout I didn't really
have<00:05:08.630> any<00:05:08.900> breakdowns<00:05:09.289> and<00:05:09.470> positions<00:05:09.860> it<00:05:10.070> was

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
have any breakdowns and positions it was

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.340 
have any breakdowns and positions it was
slow<00:05:10.460> but<00:05:10.490> it<00:05:10.820> moved<00:05:11.419> in<00:05:11.690> its<00:05:11.870> state<00:05:12.080> where<00:05:12.260> it

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
slow but it moved in its state where it

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.890 
slow but it moved in its state where it
needed<00:05:12.500> to<00:05:12.650> the<00:05:12.830> whole<00:05:12.979> time<00:05:13.220> so<00:05:13.810> that's<00:05:14.810> a

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
needed to the whole time so that's a

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.390 
needed to the whole time so that's a
good<00:05:15.020> sign<00:05:15.229> going<00:05:15.289> forward<00:05:15.620> going<00:05:16.220> on<00:05:16.310> my

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
good sign going forward going on my

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.610 
good sign going forward going on my
peaking<00:05:16.729> phase<00:05:16.940> next<00:05:17.330> week<00:05:17.510> basically<00:05:18.470> what<00:05:18.590> I

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
peaking phase next week basically what I

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:19.990 
peaking phase next week basically what I
did<00:05:18.710> this<00:05:18.919> week<00:05:19.099> is<00:05:19.280> just<00:05:19.370> kind<00:05:19.580> of<00:05:19.610> repeated

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
did this week is just kind of repeated

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.810 
did this week is just kind of repeated
last<00:05:20.210> week<00:05:20.450> and<00:05:20.830> tried<00:05:21.830> to<00:05:21.950> make<00:05:21.979> it<00:05:22.280> better<00:05:22.430> so

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
last week and tried to make it better so

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.760 
last week and tried to make it better so
benching<00:05:23.330> is<00:05:23.510> is<00:05:23.750> improving<00:05:24.320> the<00:05:24.410> body<00:05:24.590> but

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
benching is is improving the body but

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.190 
benching is is improving the body but
coming<00:05:24.950> up<00:05:25.130> I<00:05:25.310> think<00:05:25.490> a<00:05:25.580> big<00:05:25.880> factor<00:05:26.240> that<00:05:27.110> I

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
coming up I think a big factor that I

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.940 
coming up I think a big factor that I
was<00:05:27.349> really<00:05:27.530> dealing<00:05:27.830> with<00:05:28.099> was<00:05:28.520> adjusting<00:05:29.210> to

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
was really dealing with was adjusting to

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.560 
was really dealing with was adjusting to
the<00:05:30.950> bench<00:05:31.220> height<00:05:31.460> and<00:05:31.669> it's<00:05:32.000> the<00:05:32.180> same<00:05:32.360> bench

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
the bench height and it's the same bench

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.210 
the bench height and it's the same bench
that<00:05:32.690> I<00:05:32.780> was<00:05:32.900> using<00:05:33.020> before<00:05:33.260> but<00:05:33.710> when<00:05:34.039> I<00:05:34.070> was

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
that I was using before but when I was

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.390 
that I was using before but when I was
back<00:05:34.370> at<00:05:34.520> the<00:05:34.550> other<00:05:34.700> garage<00:05:34.970> I<00:05:35.360> had<00:05:36.070> 25<00:05:37.070> under

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
back at the other garage I had 25 under

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.430 
back at the other garage I had 25 under
the<00:05:37.610> bench<00:05:37.760> and<00:05:38.030> I<00:05:38.690> knew<00:05:38.930> that<00:05:39.110> that<00:05:39.260> was<00:05:39.410> a

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
the bench and I knew that that was a

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.070 
the bench and I knew that that was a
factor<00:05:39.949> but<00:05:40.130> it<00:05:41.060> really<00:05:41.449> changed<00:05:41.900> the<00:05:41.960> way

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
factor but it really changed the way

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.420 
factor but it really changed the way
that<00:05:42.110> i<00:05:42.260> can<00:05:42.320> bring<00:05:42.590> light<00:05:42.800> drive<00:05:43.039> in<00:05:43.220> without

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
that i can bring light drive in without

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.189 
that i can bring light drive in without
lifting<00:05:43.699> my<00:05:43.940> butt<00:05:44.120> so<00:05:44.300> my<00:05:44.419> butt<00:05:44.660> looks<00:05:45.050> like

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 
lifting my butt so my butt looks like

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.379 
lifting my butt so my butt looks like
it's<00:05:45.349> moving<00:05:45.590> for<00:05:46.370> most<00:05:46.610> of<00:05:46.760> these<00:05:46.880> reps<00:05:47.210> the

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.389 
it's moving for most of these reps the

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:48.939 
it's moving for most of these reps the
cheeks<00:05:47.630> are<00:05:47.780> staying<00:05:48.080> on<00:05:48.260> but<00:05:48.650> there's<00:05:48.860> a

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:48.949 
cheeks are staying on but there's a

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:50.110 
cheeks are staying on but there's a
couple<00:05:49.130> of<00:05:49.280> them<00:05:49.400> more<00:05:49.520> I<00:05:49.550> get<00:05:49.699> a<00:05:49.729> little<00:05:49.880> crazy

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
couple of them more I get a little crazy

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.029 
couple of them more I get a little crazy
like<00:05:50.419> that<00:05:50.449> right<00:05:50.840> there<00:05:50.900> probably<00:05:51.650> lifted<00:05:51.979> a

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:52.039 
like that right there probably lifted a

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:55.750 
like that right there probably lifted a
bit<00:05:53.410> but<00:05:54.410> that<00:05:54.440> is<00:05:54.830> something<00:05:55.039> that<00:05:55.340> the

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:55.760 
bit but that is something that the

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.129 
bit but that is something that the
perspective<00:05:56.240> of<00:05:56.300> understanding<00:05:56.960> that<00:05:57.110> oh

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:57.139 
perspective of understanding that oh

00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:59.140 
perspective of understanding that oh
that's<00:05:57.500> one<00:05:57.680> of<00:05:57.770> the<00:05:57.860> reasons<00:05:58.220> that<00:05:58.340> my<00:05:59.000> leg

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
that's one of the reasons that my leg

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.270 
that's one of the reasons that my leg
Drive<00:05:59.389> is<00:05:59.750> not<00:05:59.960> working<00:06:00.470> quite<00:06:00.620> as<00:06:00.800> much<00:06:00.949> you

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 
Drive is not working quite as much you

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.310 
Drive is not working quite as much you
know<00:06:01.310> it's<00:06:01.550> another<00:06:01.760> factor<00:06:02.720> when<00:06:03.050> it<00:06:03.080> comes

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.320 
know it's another factor when it comes

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.469 
know it's another factor when it comes
to<00:06:03.500> the<00:06:03.590> bench<00:06:03.770> also<00:06:04.460> fixed<00:06:05.060> a<00:06:05.120> couple<00:06:05.240> of

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:05.479 
to the bench also fixed a couple of

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:06.939 
to the bench also fixed a couple of
rehab<00:06:05.960> things<00:06:06.260> that<00:06:06.380> I've<00:06:06.470> been<00:06:06.560> doing<00:06:06.919> some

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:06.949 
rehab things that I've been doing some

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:10.240 
rehab things that I've been doing some
more<00:06:07.810> focused<00:06:08.810> mobility<00:06:09.260> work<00:06:09.440> and<00:06:09.770> trying<00:06:10.160> to

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 
more focused mobility work and trying to

you need to also worked a little bit
with<00:06:27.959> some<00:06:27.989> hook<00:06:28.199> grip<00:06:28.319> you<00:06:28.469> guys<00:06:28.619> saw<00:06:28.830> that

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:29.009 
with some hook grip you guys saw that

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:30.649 
with some hook grip you guys saw that
that<00:06:29.519> was<00:06:29.639> just<00:06:29.789> to<00:06:29.879> save<00:06:30.059> my<00:06:30.179> calluses

00:06:30.649 --> 00:06:30.659 
that was just to save my calluses

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:31.909

because I really still don't want to
ever<00:06:32.009> use<00:06:32.129> straps<00:06:32.699> it<00:06:32.879> just<00:06:33.029> bugs<00:06:33.300> the<00:06:33.479> heck
