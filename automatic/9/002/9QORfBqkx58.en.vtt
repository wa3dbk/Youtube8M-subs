00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
self-inflicted a lot of things that

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.750 
self-inflicted a lot of things that
happened<00:00:06.569> to<00:00:06.690> us<00:00:06.720> in<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.020> first<00:00:07.230> period<00:00:07.760> we

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
happened to us in the first period we

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.520 
happened to us in the first period we
turned<00:00:08.970> the<00:00:09.059> puck<00:00:09.210> over<00:00:09.420> you<00:00:10.380> know<00:00:10.500> and

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
turned the puck over you know and

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.129 
turned the puck over you know and
specifically<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.460> second<00:00:11.940> goal<00:00:12.059> we<00:00:13.019> had

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
specifically the second goal we had

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.690 
specifically the second goal we had
opportunities<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.710> drive<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.190> puck<00:00:14.370> towards

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
opportunities to drive the puck towards

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.359 
opportunities to drive the puck towards
the<00:00:14.790> net<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.179> we<00:00:15.480> seem<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.839> be<00:00:16.070> trying<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.250> be

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
the net and we seem to be trying to be

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.040 
the net and we seem to be trying to be
too<00:00:17.550> cute<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.150> played<00:00:19.140> fancy<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:21.050> obviously

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
too cute and played fancy and obviously

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.570 
too cute and played fancy and obviously
that<00:00:22.109> wasn't<00:00:22.410> really<00:00:22.710> what<00:00:22.830> we<00:00:23.070> needed<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.340> do

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
that wasn't really what we needed to do

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.000 
that wasn't really what we needed to do
we<00:00:23.730> needed<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.150> put<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.810> puck<00:00:24.960> in<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.320> find

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
we needed to put the puck in and find

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.349 
we needed to put the puck in and find
ways<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.400> get<00:00:26.519> through<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.789> neutral<00:00:26.939> ison

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
ways to get through the neutral ison

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.830 
ways to get through the neutral ison
established<00:00:27.869> more<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:29.010> grind<00:00:29.220> game<00:00:29.580> of

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
established more of a grind game of

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.959 
established more of a grind game of
offensive<00:00:30.840> zone<00:00:30.869> time<00:00:31.579> and<00:00:32.579> we<00:00:32.669> were<00:00:32.730> able<00:00:32.820> to

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
offensive zone time and we were able to

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.880 
offensive zone time and we were able to
do<00:00:33.090> that<00:00:33.210> in<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.420> second<00:00:33.750> period<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:34.320> we're

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
do that in the second period so we're

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.690 
do that in the second period so we're

you get you know we were receiving the
game<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.840> we<00:00:48.840> didn't<00:00:49.050> react<00:00:49.289> very<00:00:49.320> well<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.800> it

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
20 minutes and then I thought Bernie

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.180 
20 minutes and then I thought Bernie
made<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.870> couple<00:00:55.170> big<00:00:55.289> stuff<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.800> keep<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.070> at

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
made a couple big stuff to keep it at

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.729 
made a couple big stuff to keep it at
two<00:00:57.230> to<00:00:58.230> nothing<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.800> then<00:00:59.789> you<00:01:00.600> know<00:01:00.739> we

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
don't we score three straight and then

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.329 
don't we score three straight and then
we<00:01:03.359> give<00:01:03.660> one<00:01:03.809> up<00:01:03.960> with<00:01:04.170> 24<00:01:04.650> seconds<00:01:05.010> left<00:01:05.100> that

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
we give one up with 24 seconds left that

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.620 
we give one up with 24 seconds left that
hurt<00:01:05.600> right<00:01:06.600> but<00:01:06.840> yeah<00:01:08.180> so<00:01:09.180> that's<00:01:09.360> good<00:01:09.600> but

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
hurt right but yeah so that's good but

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.750 
hurt right but yeah so that's good but
this<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.200> kind<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.619> uneven<00:01:11.520> performance

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
this is the kind of uneven performance

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.410 
this is the kind of uneven performance
of<00:01:12.390> gifts<00:01:12.810> coaches<00:01:13.229> sleepless<00:01:13.650> nights<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:14.420> have

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
of gifts coaches sleepless nights I have

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.789 
of gifts coaches sleepless nights I have
lots<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.810> sleepless<00:01:16.229> nights<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.590> matter

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
lots of sleepless nights and matter

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.310 
lots of sleepless nights and matter
winning<00:01:17.159> or<00:01:17.340> losing<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.990> think<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.110> stress

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
winning or losing I think the stress

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.429 
winning or losing I think the stress
level<00:01:19.380> goes<00:01:19.770> up<00:01:20.040> in<00:01:20.220> games<00:01:20.430> like<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:21.020> the<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
level goes up in games like this the the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.050 
level goes up in games like this the the
positive<00:01:22.920> avada<00:01:23.250> we<00:01:23.430> don't<00:01:23.610> dwell<00:01:23.729> on<00:01:23.850> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
positive avada we don't dwell on the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.450 
positive avada we don't dwell on the
negative<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.869> will<00:01:25.080> touch<00:01:25.619> base<00:01:25.890> with<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.280> but

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
negative it will touch base with it but

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.160 
negative it will touch base with it but
the<00:01:26.610> positive<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.630> we<00:01:27.720> found<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:28.049> way

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
the positive is is that we found a way

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.649 
the positive is is that we found a way
to<00:01:28.229> regroup<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.890> get<00:01:29.040> ourselves<00:01:29.189> back<00:01:29.759> on

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
to regroup and get ourselves back on

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.270 
to regroup and get ourselves back on
track<00:01:30.930> but<00:01:31.110> we<00:01:31.229> have<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.439> play<00:01:31.590> 60<00:01:31.979> minutes

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
track but we have to play 60 minutes

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.940 
track but we have to play 60 minutes
like<00:01:32.909> we<00:01:33.060> played<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.360> last<00:01:33.540> two<00:01:33.689> periods<00:01:33.990> as

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
like we played the last two periods as

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.600 
like we played the last two periods as
close<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.460> as<00:01:35.520> we<00:01:35.790> possibly<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.479> and

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
close to that as we possibly can and

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.100 
close to that as we possibly can and
it's<00:01:38.610> not<00:01:38.729> easy<00:01:38.970> winning<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.450> NHL<00:01:39.930> it

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
it's not easy winning in the NHL it

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.660 
it's not easy winning in the NHL it
proves<00:01:40.350> at<00:01:40.470> night<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:40.799> night<00:01:41.009> out<00:01:41.070> there's<00:01:41.610> a

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
proves at night in night out there's a

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.550 
proves at night in night out there's a
lot<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.820> shootouts<00:01:42.240> taking<00:01:42.600> place<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.079> we're

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
lot of shootouts taking place and we're

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.980 
lot of shootouts taking place and we're
four<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.979> row<00:01:44.130> now<00:01:44.360> anyone<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.720> know<00:01:45.810> and

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
four in a row now anyone you know and

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.480 
four in a row now anyone you know and
they<00:01:46.439> talked<00:01:46.680> about<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.040> little<00:01:47.159> bit<00:01:47.340> this

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
they talked about it a little bit this

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.090 
they talked about it a little bit this
morning<00:01:47.840> so<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:48.869> think<00:01:49.259> we<00:01:49.500> won<00:01:49.710> two<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:49.950> lost

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100
