00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.209 
know it looks simple and I'll have to
admit<00:00:42.230> that<00:00:42.350> it's<00:00:42.469> a<00:00:42.530> little<00:00:42.710> bit<00:00:42.890> more<00:00:43.040> work

than<00:00:43.489> than<00:00:44.000> I<00:00:44.120> certainly<00:00:44.420> thought<00:00:44.690> but<00:00:45.050> I

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
than than I certainly thought but I

than than I certainly thought but I
think<00:00:45.620> I've<00:00:45.710> got<00:00:45.860> it<00:00:45.890> down<00:00:46.010> to<00:00:46.160> a<00:00:47.350> rhythm<00:00:48.350> here

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
think I've got it down to a rhythm here

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
here so I've got four to go next to it I

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.410 
here so I've got four to go next to it I
am<00:01:05.330> starting<00:01:05.780> with<00:01:06.100> eight-foot<00:01:07.100> sheets<00:01:07.460> of<00:01:08.030> 12

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
am starting with eight-foot sheets of 12

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.820 
am starting with eight-foot sheets of 12
inch<00:01:08.690> wide<00:01:08.990> Oh<00:01:09.410> 500<00:01:11.470> lumina<00:01:12.470> that's<00:01:12.680> been

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
inch wide Oh 500 lumina that's been

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.550 
inch wide Oh 500 lumina that's been
powder<00:01:13.100> coat<00:01:13.430> primed<00:01:13.850> on<00:01:14.060> each<00:01:14.240> side<00:01:14.570> the

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
powder coat primed on each side the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.350 
powder coat primed on each side the
powder<00:01:15.799> coat<00:01:16.070> priming<00:01:16.549> is<00:01:16.670> really<00:01:17.000> helpful

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
powder coat priming is really helpful

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.570 
powder coat priming is really helpful
for<00:01:17.390> me<00:01:17.570> because<00:01:18.070> priming<00:01:19.070> in<00:01:19.189> my<00:01:19.340> little

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
for me because priming in my little

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.429 
for me because priming in my little
workshop<00:01:20.299> here<00:01:20.570> would<00:01:20.720> be<00:01:20.869> not<00:01:21.409> only

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
workshop here would be not only

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.260 
workshop here would be not only
difficult<00:01:22.159> but<00:01:22.220> pretty<00:01:22.850> a<00:01:23.180> las<00:01:23.509> very<00:01:24.500> smelly

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
difficult but pretty a las very smelly

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.510 
difficult but pretty a las very smelly
or<00:01:26.270> just<00:01:27.080> more<00:01:27.290> time-intensive<00:01:27.590> if<00:01:28.189> I<00:01:28.280> were<00:01:28.400> to

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
or just more time-intensive if I were to

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.760 
or just more time-intensive if I were to
brush<00:01:28.729> it<00:01:28.909> versus<00:01:29.210> an<00:01:29.299> aerosol<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:29.960> the

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
brush it versus an aerosol and the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.880 
brush it versus an aerosol and the
powder<00:01:31.009> coat<00:01:31.310> primer<00:01:31.580> is<00:01:31.820> a<00:01:31.880> much<00:01:32.090> stronger

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
powder coat primer is a much stronger

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.590 
powder coat primer is a much stronger
coat<00:01:33.890> of<00:01:34.040> paint<00:01:34.250> such<00:01:34.850> that<00:01:35.060> when<00:01:35.150> I<00:01:35.180> bend<00:01:35.509> it

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
coat of paint such that when I bend it

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.569 
coat of paint such that when I bend it
on<00:01:35.750> my<00:01:35.869> break<00:01:36.140> there<00:01:36.380> we're<00:01:36.530> looking<00:01:36.799> at<00:01:36.950> the

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
on my break there we're looking at the

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.020 
on my break there we're looking at the
paint<00:01:38.090> doesn't<00:01:38.329> break<00:01:38.630> off<00:01:38.810> or<00:01:39.079> chip<00:01:39.909> which<00:01:40.909> is

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
paint doesn't break off or chip which is

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.280 
paint doesn't break off or chip which is
which<00:01:41.210> is<00:01:41.240> really<00:01:41.600> important<00:01:41.990> because<00:01:42.079> what

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
which is really important because what

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.200 
which is really important because what
I'm<00:01:42.409> going<00:01:42.470> to<00:01:42.680> do<00:01:42.950> is<00:01:43.159> I'm<00:01:43.610> going<00:01:43.670> to<00:01:43.909> paint

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
I'm going to do is I'm going to paint

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.030 
I'm going to do is I'm going to paint
them<00:01:44.390> this<00:01:44.900> when<00:01:45.229> they're<00:01:45.380> in<00:01:45.470> this<00:01:45.619> shape

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
them this when they're in this shape

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.039 
them this when they're in this shape
before<00:01:46.280> I've<00:01:46.610> actually<00:01:46.880> bend<00:01:47.270> them<00:01:47.479> because

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
before I've actually bend them because

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:49.539 
before I've actually bend them because
it's<00:01:48.170> much<00:01:48.320> easier<00:01:48.350> to<00:01:48.710> paint<00:01:48.979> a<00:01:49.070> flat<00:01:49.280> surface

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
it's much easier to paint a flat surface

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.490 
it's much easier to paint a flat surface
than<00:01:49.909> it<00:01:50.030> is<00:01:50.210> to<00:01:50.360> paint<00:01:50.659> a<00:01:50.810> sort<00:01:51.470> of

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
than it is to paint a sort of

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.859 
than it is to paint a sort of
3-dimensional<00:01:52.189> box<00:01:52.220> so<00:01:52.820> first<00:01:53.630> thing<00:01:53.750> we're

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
3-dimensional box so first thing we're

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.469 
3-dimensional box so first thing we're
going<00:01:53.960> to<00:01:54.020> do<00:01:54.170> here<00:01:54.700> I've<00:01:55.700> already<00:01:56.060> cut<00:01:56.270> the

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
going to do here I've already cut the

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.249 
going to do here I've already cut the
8-foot<00:01:57.320> strips<00:01:57.649> down<00:01:58.000> into<00:01:59.000> these<00:01:59.840> which<00:02:00.140> are

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
8-foot strips down into these which are

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.719

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
different ways I have spent a little bit

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.120 
different ways I have spent a little bit
of<00:02:27.570> time<00:02:27.810> which<00:02:27.990> I<00:02:28.110> discussed<00:02:28.530> in<00:02:28.680> my<00:02:28.800> former

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
of time which I discussed in my former

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.780 
of time which I discussed in my former
video<00:02:29.430> of<00:02:30.050> truing<00:02:31.050> up<00:02:31.200> these<00:02:31.500> two<00:02:31.860> bracket

plates<00:02:33.030> they're<00:02:33.240> just<00:02:33.540> held<00:02:33.810> down<00:02:33.990> by<00:02:34.020> quarter

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
plates they're just held down by quarter

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.940 
plates they're just held down by quarter
by<00:02:34.680> twenty<00:02:34.980> volts<00:02:35.130> so<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:36.690> big<00:02:37.320> strain<00:02:37.590> itself

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
by twenty volts so the big strain itself

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.949 
by twenty volts so the big strain itself
isn't<00:02:38.310> very<00:02:38.520> precise<00:02:39.060> so<00:02:39.300> what<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.450> had<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:39.810> do

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
isn't very precise so what I had to do

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.320 
isn't very precise so what I had to do
was<00:02:40.170> just<00:02:40.800> snug<00:02:41.160> down<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.580> bolt<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:42.090> then<00:02:42.240> I

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
was just snug down the bolt and then I

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.460 
was just snug down the bolt and then I
used<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:43.440> dead<00:02:44.070> blow<00:02:44.340> hammer<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:45.060> I<00:02:45.870> used<00:02:46.200> my

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
used a dead blow hammer and I used my

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.520 
used a dead blow hammer and I used my
calipers<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.640> set<00:02:47.880> them<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.870> precisely<00:02:49.230> where

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
calipers to set them to precisely where

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.990 
calipers to set them to precisely where
I<00:02:49.590> wanted<00:02:49.890> would<00:02:50.070> take<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.250> test<00:02:50.550> cut<00:02:50.820> and

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
I wanted would take a test cut and

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.060 
I wanted would take a test cut and
measure<00:02:51.150> that<00:02:51.390> piece<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.350> make<00:02:52.590> sure<00:02:52.770> it<00:02:52.890> was

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
measure that piece and make sure it was

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.820 
measure that piece and make sure it was
what<00:02:53.280> I<00:02:53.310> wanted<00:02:54.290> got<00:02:55.290> it<00:02:55.380> all<00:02:55.470> threw<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:55.709> up

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
what I wanted got it all threw it up

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.229 
what I wanted got it all threw it up
just<00:02:56.160> put<00:02:56.550> my<00:02:57.120> piece<00:02:57.390> in<00:02:57.570> there<00:02:59.120> pull<00:03:00.120> the

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
just put my piece in there pull the

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:19.580 
just put my piece in there pull the
handle<00:03:00.980> one<00:03:01.980> corner<00:03:02.430> gone<00:03:18.110> and<00:03:19.110> there<00:03:19.500> you

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
handle one corner gone and there you

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.190 
handle one corner gone and there you
have<00:03:19.650> it<00:03:19.910> before<00:03:20.910> I<00:03:21.180> bought<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.570> not<00:03:21.900> sure<00:03:22.080> I'd

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
have it before I bought the not sure I'd

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.199 
have it before I bought the not sure I'd
considered<00:03:22.739> using<00:03:22.920> a<00:03:23.130> bandsaw<00:03:23.610> on<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:23.820> jig<00:03:24.180> to

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
considered using a bandsaw on a jig to

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.090 
considered using a bandsaw on a jig to
cut<00:03:24.600> those<00:03:24.810> out<00:03:25.019> and<00:03:25.320> I<00:03:25.380> can't<00:03:25.650> tell<00:03:25.830> you<00:03:25.950> how

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
cut those out and I can't tell you how

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.820 
cut those out and I can't tell you how
much<00:03:26.250> time<00:03:26.850> this<00:03:27.090> nacho<00:03:27.600> saves<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.380> frankly

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
much time this nacho saves and frankly

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.650 
much time this nacho saves and frankly
how<00:03:28.950> much<00:03:29.100> more<00:03:29.340> of<00:03:29.430> a<00:03:29.519> clean<00:03:29.790> cut<00:03:30.120> and<00:03:30.420> a

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
how much more of a clean cut and a

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.440 
how much more of a clean cut and a
precise<00:03:31.470> cut<00:03:31.739> that<00:03:31.920> it<00:03:32.070> gives<00:03:32.280> so<00:03:32.580> if<00:03:32.880> you<00:03:33.269> need

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
precise cut that it gives so if you need

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.050 
precise cut that it gives so if you need
to<00:03:33.600> cut<00:03:33.810> corners<00:03:34.799> and<00:03:35.010> cut<00:03:35.430> notches<00:03:35.640> out<00:03:35.880> for

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
to cut corners and cut notches out for

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.699 
to cut corners and cut notches out for
boxes<00:03:36.480> there's<00:03:36.720> nothing<00:03:37.019> nothing<00:03:37.530> better

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
boxes there's nothing nothing better

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.650 
boxes there's nothing nothing better
than<00:03:37.860> it<00:03:38.630> here's<00:03:39.630> a<00:03:39.750> test<00:03:41.330> segment<00:03:42.330> that<00:03:42.600> I

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
than it here's a test segment that I

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.240 
than it here's a test segment that I
built<00:03:42.989> and<00:03:43.410> one<00:03:43.530> of<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.709> things<00:03:43.860> I<00:03:43.950> wanted<00:03:44.190> to

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
built and one of the things I wanted to

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.460 
built and one of the things I wanted to
point<00:03:44.340> out<00:03:44.670> was<00:03:44.930> there's<00:03:45.930> a<00:03:46.049> little<00:03:46.320> bit<00:03:46.440> of

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
point out was there's a little bit of

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.620 
point out was there's a little bit of
math<00:03:46.709> behind<00:03:46.950> getting<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:47.610> screw<00:03:48.120> alignment

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
math behind getting the screw alignment

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.690 
math behind getting the screw alignment
correctly<00:03:49.019> because<00:03:49.290> obviously<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:50.340> screws

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
correctly because obviously the screws

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.550 
correctly because obviously the screws
in<00:03:50.910> one<00:03:51.090> box<00:03:51.329> correlate<00:03:52.079> with<00:03:52.200> the<00:03:52.320> screw

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
in one box correlate with the screw

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.319 
in one box correlate with the screw
position<00:03:52.980> in<00:03:53.100> the<00:03:53.190> other<00:03:53.310> box<00:03:53.549> and<00:03:53.820> since<00:03:54.090> this

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
position in the other box and since this

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.170 
position in the other box and since this
is<00:03:55.250> ultimately<00:03:56.250> being<00:03:56.430> done<00:03:56.670> for<00:03:56.850> sort<00:03:57.060> of<00:03:57.090> an

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
is ultimately being done for sort of an

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.210 
is ultimately being done for sort of an
aesthetic<00:03:57.329> look<00:03:57.930> it<00:03:58.440> is<00:03:58.620> important<00:03:59.070> to<00:03:59.100> get

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
aesthetic look it is important to get

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.130 
aesthetic look it is important to get
those<00:03:59.430> just<00:03:59.670> right<00:03:59.910> so<00:04:00.600> the<00:04:00.660> thing<00:04:00.780> I've<00:04:00.930> done

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
those just right so the thing I've done

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.400 
those just right so the thing I've done
here<00:04:01.380> is<00:04:01.530> just<00:04:01.709> built<00:04:01.890> a<00:04:02.010> jig<00:04:02.930> which<00:04:03.930> has<00:04:04.110> all

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
here is just built a jig which has all

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.470 
here is just built a jig which has all
the<00:04:04.739> hole<00:04:05.310> positions<00:04:05.790> on<00:04:05.910> it<00:04:06.090> ignore<00:04:06.360> the

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
the hole positions on it ignore the

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.410 
the hole positions on it ignore the
smaller<00:04:06.780> holes<00:04:07.049> those<00:04:07.320> were<00:04:07.500> a<00:04:08.120> bad<00:04:09.120> batch

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
smaller holes those were a bad batch

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.240 
smaller holes those were a bad batch
added<00:04:09.780> I'm<00:04:09.900> using<00:04:10.049> the<00:04:10.230> larger<00:04:10.560> holes<00:04:10.769> and

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
added I'm using the larger holes and

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.590 
added I'm using the larger holes and
then<00:04:11.370> I<00:04:11.430> just<00:04:11.610> got<00:04:11.760> a<00:04:11.790> sheet<00:04:12.000> of<00:04:12.120> paper<00:04:12.269> here

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
then I just got a sheet of paper here

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.890 
then I just got a sheet of paper here
which<00:04:13.200> is<00:04:13.440> a<00:04:13.470> side<00:04:13.769> profile<00:04:14.250> which<00:04:14.660> notes<00:04:15.660> out

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
which is a side profile which notes out

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.979 
which is a side profile which notes out
to<00:04:16.079> me<00:04:16.229> which<00:04:17.220> piece<00:04:17.430> I'm<00:04:17.609> doing<00:04:17.880> which<00:04:18.180> holds

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
to me which piece I'm doing which holds

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.560 
to me which piece I'm doing which holds
I<00:04:19.169> circle<00:04:19.890> out<00:04:20.010> so<00:04:20.310> so<00:04:20.880> this<00:04:21.060> one's<00:04:21.269> going<00:04:21.479> to

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
I circle out so so this one's going to

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.930 
I circle out so so this one's going to
be<00:04:21.630> what<00:04:22.169> I'm<00:04:22.320> calling<00:04:22.620> box<00:04:23.039> number<00:04:23.430> one<00:04:23.669> which

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
be what I'm calling box number one which

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.180 
be what I'm calling box number one which
is

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
is

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.250 
is
top<00:04:24.460> front<00:04:24.880> box<00:04:25.150> it<00:04:25.660> has<00:04:26.280> marks<00:04:27.280> and<00:04:27.550> these

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
top front box it has marks and these

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.200 
top front box it has marks and these
positions<00:04:29.260> and<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:30.040> side<00:04:30.280> wings<00:04:30.640> this<00:04:31.030> one

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
positions and the side wings this one

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.170 
positions and the side wings this one
will<00:04:31.330> only<00:04:31.480> have<00:04:32.310> the<00:04:33.310> left<00:04:33.490> hand<00:04:33.700> one<00:04:33.880> because

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
will only have the left hand one because

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.550 
will only have the left hand one because
this<00:04:34.330> is<00:04:34.450> going<00:04:34.600> to<00:04:34.720> be<00:04:34.810> my<00:04:34.930> right<00:04:35.140> hand<00:04:35.170> most

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
this is going to be my right hand most

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.290 
this is going to be my right hand most
boxes<00:04:36.160> so<00:04:36.250> it<00:04:36.340> only<00:04:36.460> needs<00:04:36.700> to<00:04:36.820> connect<00:04:37.180> to

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
boxes so it only needs to connect to

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.150 
boxes so it only needs to connect to
another<00:04:37.360> box<00:04:37.690> on<00:04:37.840> the<00:04:37.900> left<00:04:38.110> side<00:04:38.320> so<00:04:38.980> what<00:04:39.130> I

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
another box on the left side so what I

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.660 
another box on the left side so what I
do<00:04:39.310> is<00:04:40.080> I'm<00:04:41.080> just<00:04:41.410> using<00:04:41.590> a<00:04:41.800> sharpie<00:04:42.310> here<00:04:42.580> to

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
do is I'm just using a sharpie here to

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.510 
do is I'm just using a sharpie here to
actually<00:04:45.670> find<00:04:46.180> a<00:04:46.590> center<00:04:47.620> oops<00:04:48.040> actually<00:04:48.460> I

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
actually find a center oops actually I

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:58.250 
actually find a center oops actually I
marked<00:04:48.820> the<00:04:48.940> wrong<00:04:49.120> sorry

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.050 

and<00:04:58.820> cold

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
and cold

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.600 
and cold
remark

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.610 

so<00:05:05.150> now<00:05:05.240> I've<00:05:05.360> got<00:05:05.510> my<00:05:05.540> holes<00:05:05.930> mark<00:05:06.230> I<00:05:06.440> miss

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
so now I've got my holes mark I miss

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.830 
so now I've got my holes mark I miss
marked<00:05:06.920> these<00:05:07.070> ignore<00:05:07.580> those<00:05:07.760> and<00:05:08.030> by

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
marked these ignore those and by

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.210 
marked these ignore those and by
circulating<00:05:09.350> with<00:05:09.530> a<00:05:09.590> sharpie<00:05:09.950> I<00:05:09.980> leave<00:05:10.190> a

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
circulating with a sharpie I leave a

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.550 
circulating with a sharpie I leave a
little<00:05:10.490> dot<00:05:10.700> in<00:05:10.880> the<00:05:10.940> center<00:05:11.270> for<00:05:11.990> this<00:05:12.230> work

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
little dot in the center for this work

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.250 
little dot in the center for this work
that<00:05:12.860> is<00:05:13.190> precise<00:05:13.790> enough<00:05:14.150> I<00:05:14.480> realized<00:05:15.110> that

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
that is precise enough I realized that

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.830 
that is precise enough I realized that
tolerance<00:05:15.620> is<00:05:15.800> very<00:05:15.950> by<00:05:16.310> project<00:05:16.850> and<00:05:17.030> I've

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
tolerance is very by project and I've

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.810 
tolerance is very by project and I've
done<00:05:18.110> some<00:05:18.260> experimenting<00:05:18.920> and<00:05:19.040> this<00:05:19.610> is<00:05:19.790> a

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
done some experimenting and this is a

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.710 
done some experimenting and this is a
quicker<00:05:20.690> way<00:05:20.840> or<00:05:21.260> taking<00:05:21.620> a<00:05:21.680> lot<00:05:21.770> of<00:05:21.890> time<00:05:22.100> and

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
quicker way or taking a lot of time and

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.720 
quicker way or taking a lot of time and
I<00:05:23.720> don't<00:05:24.110> be<00:05:24.590> any<00:05:24.710> more<00:05:24.890> precise<00:05:25.280> than<00:05:25.520> this

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:25.730 
I don't be any more precise than this

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.880 
I don't be any more precise than this
which<00:05:25.970> is<00:05:26.090> still<00:05:26.270> probably<00:05:26.480> within<00:05:27.110> I<00:05:27.380> would

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:27.890 
which is still probably within I would

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.910 
which is still probably within I would
guess<00:05:28.100> 10<00:05:28.250> pow<00:05:29.230> so<00:05:30.230> what<00:05:30.350> I'm<00:05:30.440> doing<00:05:30.470> here<00:05:30.860> is

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:30.920 
guess 10 pow so what I'm doing here is

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.590 
guess 10 pow so what I'm doing here is
just<00:05:31.010> using<00:05:31.400> an<00:05:31.460> automatic<00:05:31.850> center<00:05:32.390> punch

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
just using an automatic center punch

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.230 
just using an automatic center punch
putting<00:05:33.530> it<00:05:33.650> in<00:05:34.010> the<00:05:34.250> center<00:05:34.550> of<00:05:34.580> the<00:05:34.670> dot<00:05:34.910> and

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
putting it in the center of the dot and

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.300 
putting it in the center of the dot and
what<00:05:36.080> that<00:05:36.290> does<00:05:36.530> is<00:05:36.860> my<00:05:38.560> the<00:05:39.560> dimple<00:05:40.010> in<00:05:40.130> the

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
what that does is my the dimple in the

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.930 
what that does is my the dimple in the
sheet<00:05:40.760> aluminum<00:05:41.090> here<00:05:41.570> is<00:05:41.810> enough<00:05:42.170> for<00:05:42.500> by

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
sheet aluminum here is enough for by

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.010 
sheet aluminum here is enough for by
punch<00:05:43.940> press<00:05:44.210> which<00:05:44.450> I'll<00:05:44.570> show<00:05:44.720> you<00:05:44.810> how<00:05:44.960> to

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
punch press which I'll show you how to

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.800 
punch press which I'll show you how to
second<00:05:46.120> okay<00:05:47.120> now<00:05:47.270> I'm<00:05:47.390> going<00:05:47.510> to<00:05:47.600> go<00:05:47.720> ahead

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
second okay now I'm going to go ahead

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.500 
second okay now I'm going to go ahead
and<00:05:47.990> punch<00:05:48.170> out<00:05:48.380> the<00:05:48.650> five<00:05:49.610> holes<00:05:49.940> I<00:05:50.180> need<00:05:50.360> to

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
and punch out the five holes I need to

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.510 
and punch out the five holes I need to
on<00:05:50.690> this<00:05:50.810> sheet<00:05:51.080> the<00:05:51.620> punch<00:05:51.860> press<00:05:52.130> also<00:05:52.490> a

on this sheet the punch press also a

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.790 
on this sheet the punch press also a
huge<00:05:52.820> time-saver<00:05:53.390> much<00:05:54.320> quicker<00:05:54.650> than

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
huge time-saver much quicker than

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.800 
huge time-saver much quicker than
drilling<00:05:55.160> the<00:05:55.370> hole<00:05:55.580> and<00:05:56.150> also<00:05:56.450> drilling

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
drilling the hole and also drilling

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.270 
drilling the hole and also drilling
tends<00:05:57.020> to<00:05:57.170> leave<00:05:57.350> a<00:05:57.380> bit<00:05:57.590> of<00:05:57.620> a<00:05:57.740> burr<00:05:57.950> or<00:05:58.250> a

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
tends to leave a bit of a burr or a

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.050 
tends to leave a bit of a burr or a
rough<00:05:58.490> edge<00:05:58.700> whereas<00:05:59.360> this<00:05:59.630> is<00:06:00.850> nice<00:06:01.850> and

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
rough edge whereas this is nice and

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.580 
rough edge whereas this is nice and
clean<00:06:02.360> as<00:06:02.600> you<00:06:03.260> can<00:06:03.380> see<00:06:03.650> clean<00:06:04.640> and<00:06:04.880> quick<00:06:05.590> the
