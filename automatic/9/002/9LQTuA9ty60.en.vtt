my supply depot score would be perfect
if<00:02:13.930> I<00:02:14.019> never<00:02:14.260> supply<00:02:14.650> blocked<00:02:14.890> by<00:02:15.010> was<00:02:15.129> never

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:19.770 
to heart high up and my spotting drop
skill<00:02:18.819> would<00:02:18.879> be<00:02:19.000> perfect<00:02:19.360> if<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:19.480> always

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
skill would be perfect if I always

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.270 
skill would be perfect if I always
spotted<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.200> drops<00:02:20.409> instantly<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.099> right

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
spotted the drops instantly and right

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.460 
spotted the drops instantly and right
but<00:02:21.459> I'm<00:02:21.549> not<00:02:21.700> doing<00:02:22.000> that<00:02:22.030> so<00:02:22.450> all<00:02:23.170> these

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
but I'm not doing that so all these

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.050 
but I'm not doing that so all these
scores<00:02:23.920> will<00:02:24.129> be<00:02:24.159> slightly<00:02:24.489> less<00:02:24.849> than

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
scores will be slightly less than

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.890 
scores will be slightly less than
perfect<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:25.629> that's<00:02:25.689> generally<00:02:26.379> the<00:02:26.409> idea

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
perfect and that's generally the idea

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.630 
perfect and that's generally the idea
again<00:02:28.900> cloaked<00:02:29.319> units<00:02:29.560> one<00:02:30.340> hundred<00:02:30.609> percent

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
again cloaked units one hundred percent

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.490 
again cloaked units one hundred percent
perfect<00:02:31.180> you<00:02:31.450> spotted<00:02:31.840> him<00:02:31.930> within<00:02:32.170> a<00:02:32.349> certain

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
perfect you spotted him within a certain

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.520 
perfect you spotted him within a certain
amount<00:02:32.709> of<00:02:32.799> time<00:02:33.450> so<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.540> map<00:02:34.689> is<00:02:34.870> SuperDuper

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
amount of time so the map is SuperDuper

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.949 
amount of time so the map is SuperDuper
fun<00:02:35.739> and<00:02:36.060> it's<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.180> really<00:02:37.450> good<00:02:37.599> way<00:02:37.900> to

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
fun and it's a really good way to

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
when you're when you're staring at your

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.059 
when you're when you're staring at your
base<00:03:13.060> so<00:03:13.780> this<00:03:13.989> is<00:03:14.139> a<00:03:14.170> good<00:03:14.379> way<00:03:14.500> to<00:03:14.560> build<00:03:14.799> that

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
base so this is a good way to build that

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.220 
base so this is a good way to build that
skill<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:15.879> get<00:03:16.389> good<00:03:16.569> at<00:03:16.629> keeping<00:03:16.870> up<00:03:17.109> on

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
skill to get good at keeping up on

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.080 
skill to get good at keeping up on
production<00:03:17.680> while<00:03:17.859> moving<00:03:18.160> your<00:03:18.370> army<00:03:18.699> and<00:03:18.730> to

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
production while moving your army and to

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.000 
production while moving your army and to
kind<00:03:19.480> of<00:03:19.510> get<00:03:19.660> an<00:03:19.720> idea<00:03:19.840> for<00:03:20.410> how<00:03:20.440> often<00:03:20.919> you

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
kind of get an idea for how often you

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.420 
kind of get an idea for how often you
need<00:03:21.160> to<00:03:22.560> look<00:03:23.560> back<00:03:23.769> at<00:03:23.889> your<00:03:23.949> base<00:03:24.129> and<00:03:24.340> make

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
need to look back at your base and make

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.129 
need to look back at your base and make
depots<00:03:24.790> and<00:03:24.819> stuff<00:03:25.150> like<00:03:25.269> that<00:03:25.329> so<00:03:25.780> here's<00:03:25.989> the

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
depots and stuff like that so here's the

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:30.059 
depots and stuff like that so here's the
main<00:03:26.290> fight<00:03:26.560> one<00:03:26.739> and<00:03:27.459> uh<00:03:28.500> my<00:03:29.500> Vikings<00:03:29.919> were

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
main fight one and uh my Vikings were

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.099 
main fight one and uh my Vikings were
pretty<00:03:30.280> pointless<00:03:30.579> in<00:03:30.819> this<00:03:30.940> one<00:03:31.109> but

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
pretty pointless in this one but

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:33.869 
pretty pointless in this one but
sometimes<00:03:32.530> there's<00:03:32.739> Colossus<00:03:33.190> and<00:03:33.310> stuff<00:03:33.579> so

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 
sometimes there's Colossus and stuff so

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:38.309 
sometimes there's Colossus and stuff so
you<00:03:34.389> never<00:03:34.510> know<00:03:36.180> anyway<00:03:37.180> this<00:03:37.449> is<00:03:37.569> the<00:03:37.629> map<00:03:37.780> so

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
you never know anyway this is the map so

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:39.689 
you never know anyway this is the map so
the<00:03:38.409> best<00:03:38.560> I've<00:03:38.709> ever<00:03:38.769> done<00:03:39.010> was<00:03:39.280> actually<00:03:39.609> in

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:39.699 
the best I've ever done was actually in

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:41.189 
the best I've ever done was actually in
this<00:03:39.790> video<00:03:40.060> eighty-one<00:03:40.359> percent<00:03:40.389> ah<00:03:40.870> the

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:41.199 
this video eighty-one percent ah the

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:43.259 
this video eighty-one percent ah the
second<00:03:41.590> best<00:03:41.709> I've<00:03:41.859> ever<00:03:41.919> done<00:03:42.159> is<00:03:42.310> 71<00:03:42.909> percent

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
second best I've ever done is 71 percent

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.180 
second best I've ever done is 71 percent
so<00:03:43.419> this<00:03:43.569> was<00:03:43.690> kind<00:03:43.750> of<00:03:43.930> a<00:03:44.019> fluke<00:03:44.290> I<00:03:44.590> was<00:03:44.889> like<00:03:45.069> I

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
so this was kind of a fluke I was like I

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.619 
so this was kind of a fluke I was like I
should<00:03:45.370> I<00:03:45.639> should<00:03:45.699> make<00:03:46.000> a<00:03:46.030> video<00:03:46.209> of<00:03:46.389> this<00:03:46.569> and

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:46.629 
should I should make a video of this and

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:48.180 
should I should make a video of this and
then<00:03:46.870> in<00:03:47.109> the<00:03:47.229> video<00:03:47.470> i<00:03:47.530> made<00:03:47.709> i<00:03:47.889> did<00:03:48.040> really

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
then in the video i made i did really

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.020 
then in the video i made i did really
well<00:03:49.889> i'm<00:03:50.889> not<00:03:51.069> talking<00:03:51.430> when<00:03:51.549> i<00:03:51.579> play<00:03:51.819> by<00:03:51.970> the

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
well i'm not talking when i play by the

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.759 
well i'm not talking when i play by the
way<00:03:52.209> i<00:03:52.239> recorded<00:03:52.750> it<00:03:52.810> first<00:03:53.049> now<00:03:53.319> i'm<00:03:53.409> talking

that'd be great and there are so many
maps<00:04:11.470> that<00:04:11.769> that<00:04:12.069> are<00:04:12.190> good<00:04:12.400> for<00:04:12.659> practicing

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:13.659 
maps that that are good for practicing

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
you move a probe in a circle while you

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.629 
you move a probe in a circle while you
well<00:04:16.959> you<00:04:17.139> Mack<00:04:17.620> her<00:04:17.650> up<00:04:17.919> to<00:04:18.099> a<00:04:18.130> certain<00:04:18.400> size

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
well you Mack her up to a certain size

then<00:04:20.440> push<00:04:20.590> out<00:04:20.799> and<00:04:21.039> that's<00:04:21.669> fine<00:04:22.029> for

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
then push out and that's fine for

then push out and that's fine for
building<00:04:22.779> the<00:04:22.810> skill<00:04:23.110> but<00:04:23.229> it's<00:04:23.380> not<00:04:23.500> very

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
building the skill but it's not very

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.470 
building the skill but it's not very
much<00:04:23.860> fun

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
much fun

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.620

that's you know that's an important
component<00:04:43.620> of<00:04:43.950> a<00:04:44.070> game<00:04:44.400> for<00:04:44.430> me<00:04:44.880> is<00:04:45.090> if<00:04:45.300> the

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
component of a game for me is if the

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.780 
component of a game for me is if the
game<00:04:45.630> isn't<00:04:45.840> fun<00:04:46.110> why<00:04:46.260> would<00:04:46.410> i<00:04:46.440> play<00:04:46.650> it<00:04:46.790> so

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
game isn't fun why would i play it so
