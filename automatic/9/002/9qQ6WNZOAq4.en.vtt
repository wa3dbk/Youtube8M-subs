00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:10.130
 Pioneer's hard disk navigation system has been attached to the new Explorer 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.190
 Let's start the engine 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.190
 Ssu 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:20.200
 In this way, the monitor starts up simultaneously with the engine 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.300
 The genuine monitor is 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.540
 dvd or navigation hits 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.540
 Not reflected 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.570
 Basically cd radio 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.130
 External input 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.130
 Picture usb 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:07.750
 There is something else on the air conditioner display 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.890
 Well then 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.640
 Because there is a monitor, it is wasteful 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:19.750
 Of navigation 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.750
 I put the external video output into pure spirit 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.690
 Here 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.390
 to av input 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.390
 When switching 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.080
 The image of outside navigation is reflected on the genuine monitor 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.200
 With that 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.980
 genuine 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:59.720
 Of the deck 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:59.720
 I can't hear the sound , so it's a waste 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.030
 Here is the switch for work 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.600
 Hmm 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.600
 If you 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.829
 Genuine booth 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.829
 You can also listen to audio 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.870
 Basically almost 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:35.510
 I can do it with the retrofit navigation 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.110
 Well connect usb 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:42.200
 Mitari Toka 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.200
 I think it is convenient if there is a temporary 2 here
