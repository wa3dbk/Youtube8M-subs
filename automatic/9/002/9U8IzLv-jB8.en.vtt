00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 jo internet is here and you are back 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.290
 at the start and welcome back to 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.880
 Battlefield hotline in the commission 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.610
 de-community test in the moment version 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.170
 yes it is possible in the city from there 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.000
 the data to come that means 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.279
 Of course we can get the new ones 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.449
 weapons of the coming criminal activity 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.230
 to watch the ss 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.480
 and today I have the m 11 for you 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.340
 thompson, we already have it 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.740
 already put that thompson 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.120
 in the new dc by peter fiedler with am 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.070
 start is now and how can you do it 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.129
 First time plays as you can see here 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.800
 the classic thompson known from the 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.410
 gangster movie from El Kapern or out 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.140
 the second world war, of course, the sub 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.059
 Machine gun available for the enforcer 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.860
 great as well as many of the other weapons 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.190
 which is new to it we have now 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.199
 here is the m11 old force at the start 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.850
 and we'll just equip them 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.579
 but then we have the 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.590
 limited to an external magazine 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.080
 Here we get the well-known drum 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.770
 have a magazine with this and a script 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.540
 here only the stable grip of us at the 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.909
 accuracies little bit what gives it and 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.680
 Unfortunately we only have kmu here 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.229
 There were five different ones available 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.229
 if you of course the visual def comeau 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.119
 to the slightly bluish and start 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.500
 then just go I am yes 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.670
 on the way on the website of the server 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.470
 relatively empty there are still many 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.720
 have problems to get into the game 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.780
 As you can see I am alone here 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.560
 it 567 on it and we drive now 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.380
 just before 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.180
 to the first flag to have your wall 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.040
 and just the tractor to the 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.810
 thompson tommy gun try 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.939
 and to look like they are so im 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.770
 shot ratio just times like world 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.329
 you have here from this line first 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.470
 like they shoot at the wall from the 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.390
 Just now from the hip around 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.960
 to watch what's going on without any mouse 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.430
 control 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.430
 let's see where the ball go 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.840
 Of course we see with the extended one 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.040
 magazine of a total of 50 shot 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.780
 we already have fire power 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.220
 but of course the flow goes down 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.570
 above and spreads a bit 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.430
 left and right of course that's clear 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.350
 that machine gun that since the spread 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.510
 goes up and also at the before 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.460
 rate of 7 25 shot not even so 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.410
 bad for this enforcer weapon because 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.690
 of course, that's what you're aiming for 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.850
 is also called with Gegensteuerung the mouse 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.830
 down to drive we see the 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.810
 Countermeasures have to be relatively easy 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.670
 be made and the ball come 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.890
 neat ordinary goal 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.570
 So spread is not really high 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.760
 can still counteract this from the hip 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.190
 as you can see here is easy 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.600
 snowed and it stays relatively together 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.130
 at least as far as the ball control is concerned 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.480
 and can probably help but also 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.550
 be properly celebrated and also 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.780
 At this distance the opponents so away 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.330
 without you in the now 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.560
 Visionslos pure must as fire modes 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.330
 On the one hand, of course, it's us 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.190
 Fully automatic mode of classic 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.540
 Mode as well as the single shot mode 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.130
 available with which we simply 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.570
 more targeted shots on longer 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.890
 if we can do that 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.780
 Of course, this is what you want 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.840
 he is fighting for klaus quarter situation 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.810
 designed and therefore easy in the elke 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:09.700
 stand brown style and from the likely 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:12.910
 people use the fire rate of 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.019
 725 is around prominently 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.940
 not so bad as if 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.280
 maschinen the city ​​magazine stops here 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.750
 30 balls which is okay 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.100
 but of course it makes sense 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.110
 magazine extension knows how to do it 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.670
 also the only extension in the frame 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.769
 the accessories is that you can grow 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.880
 and thus 50 shot in the trubel magazine 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.580
 then what else has one 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.209
 makes a good difference 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.519
 getting used to is likely that 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.019
 Well you can visor popping on it 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.730
 Of course the weapon comes with one 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.200
 moderate time and does not have the 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.780
 possibility somehow a different one 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.430
 she erwin cobra or a 4x zoom 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.900
 but I also like it 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.610
 not wrong because it is simply the 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.560
 classic tommy gun is supposed to do that too 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.540
 stay as she is as we know her 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.580
 she was just like that 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.920
 decent feeling but on the buffet too 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:57.580
 bring and that she was already the 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.840
 Greatest m11 in battlefield 3 will be 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.310
 Of course you have to look like yourself 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.990
 In the long term , I believe for many 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.790
 it will be this gangster first 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.370
 Feel very much for the gangster 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.720
 Cluster thus available for the rovers 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.489
 and it will probably be initially 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.260
 also be played pretty strong on 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.480
 However, in the long run, it can be good 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.950
 many players just outside the three 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.840
 hard fans and the ones of course 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.190
 neatly always want to travel something 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.590
 maybe back to the familiar ones 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.240
 Weapons change around here easy 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.830
 to get the best possible potential 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.050
 she is not bad in principle 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.180
 But it will not be until later 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.310
 course of the game or even more 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.320
 have found people in the city and 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.030
 then there has its accounts then has 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.620
 can find out how the weapon 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.940
 beats the moment it is natural 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.070
 still a bit difficult there 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.960
 Judgment to fell because simply plain 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.220
 not enough players are at the start 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.870
 Of course, I would like your opinion 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.220
 to find the weapon you will find it cool 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.570
 that the thompson is at the start 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.580
 maybe you already have it out of the 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.320
 one or another older battlefield 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.000
 Misses write your opinion about it yet 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.470
 times below in the comments and let 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.270
 the thumbs up because when you 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.270
 liked and informed in this 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.810
 your goal was always in the eye of me 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.810
 I'm out for the first time
