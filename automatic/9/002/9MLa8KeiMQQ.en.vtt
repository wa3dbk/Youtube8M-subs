the material from the rough diamonds the
next<00:02:31.579> stage<00:02:31.730> in<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:31.970> process<00:02:32.180> is<00:02:32.630> to<00:02:32.750> make<00:02:32.780> the

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
next stage in the process is to make the

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.590 
next stage in the process is to make the
diamond<00:02:33.230> round<00:02:33.609> this<00:02:34.609> is<00:02:34.670> done<00:02:34.970> using<00:02:35.180> a

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
diamond round this is done using a

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.470 
diamond round this is done using a
routing<00:02:36.410> machine<00:02:36.730> -<00:02:37.730> diamonds<00:02:37.970> are<00:02:38.269> turned

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
routing machine - diamonds are turned

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.180 
routing machine - diamonds are turned
against<00:02:38.840> each<00:02:38.959> other<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.650> make<00:02:39.769> the<00:02:39.799> diamond

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
against each other to make the diamond

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.180 
against each other to make the diamond
round<00:02:40.579> in<00:02:40.850> shape<00:02:41.170> this<00:02:42.170> process<00:02:42.680> leads<00:02:42.920> out<00:02:43.069> a

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
round in shape this process leads out a

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.860 
round in shape this process leads out a
