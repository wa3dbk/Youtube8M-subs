00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.069
 Welcome to the fourth part of 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.379
 tears in heaven by eric clapton makes 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.210
 It's fun to learn to play online guitar 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:14.219
 and that's why the video and thumb are there 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.529
 high because in this video you learn 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.770
 these magical guitar runs that one 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.390
 concept of mine specifically but for tears 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.800
 in heaven yes yes I play times as ryan 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.240
 these little mini tunes runs and there 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.580
 always talk me out quite a lot of 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.710
 how do you do that how does it work? 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.540
 with the magic guitar runs and 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.640
 Today I show you how the whole in 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.710
 Heaven works notes there are 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.110
 always under the video in the infobox 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.970
 just look at it 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.879
 everything is in the sweet little one 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:48.320
 surprise box just look there 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.320
 I have linked the notes now 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.309
 Yes 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.899
 There are exactly two runs both I do 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:01.519
 you once before and then shows in detail 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:07.850
 how it works here fits the first one 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:11.229
 running in now I repeat therefore 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.229
 shows he became 23 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.470
 Here comes the second 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.790
 oh that is still a third run to 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.550
 The end of the song is over as well 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.340
 such a magical run so we 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.430
 said first run is played 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.890
 with forefinger in bari down here in 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.930
 fifth bundesheer with the b and meter 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.390
 high side and it was important that you 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.060
 here with thumb good just about have 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.150
 at the height of the sixth covenant and you 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.240
 at the same time beating the b 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:55.080
 and the high side at the same time and 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.369
 fattening animals called gracenote can 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.810
 you you can make the name forgotten 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.000
 just a very fast corpse 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.380
 on top of the on the seventh 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.790
 bunch and then it goes back 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:10.280
 that is already the first exercise in it 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.660
 fast back up fast for you 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.209
 if you go back a little bit too 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.370
 hard happens then you go directly 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:22.880
 without a slide is just right back 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:24.260
 directly back and then we need 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.450
 However, this technique again with 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:31.550
 others sound with the fifth bunch here 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:33.230
 with the fourth bunch on the b side and 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.480
 It 's exactly the same technique exactly 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.300
 the same way we use 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.580
 here show middle finger for the 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.730
 Simultaneous side train club and 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:48.140
 then back fourth fifth, just two 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.900
 volumes continued to slide forward 12 and that 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.849
 whole relatively fast 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.090
 and there is stable again 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:58.220
 Asked on the back of the middle of the neck 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.750
 with the thumb slightly angled please 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.549
 not overstretches or something 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.549
 that's what makes it unnecessarily difficult 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.970
 and then when you arrived down here 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.740
 are you take your ring finger to 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.560
 just have free and puts that on the 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.660
 sixth place b-side push 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.090
 once all this is up to you 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.860
 this here automatically with it 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.080
 That's the last two sounds of 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:29.760
 first run after the first run yet 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:32.629
 then in the whole slowly then ringfinger 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.629
 and then the middle finger 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.879
 then we come to run number two 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.519
 Here I play with my index finger 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:43.830
 a so-called barra 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:46.849
 the g up to the side so over the 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.110
 lower three sides the distance sides 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.630
 and now I'm sitting with the thumb and 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:55.709
 middle finger at the same time the ge and the 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.680
 Before page and then slips easily 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.340
 without technology just straight ahead 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.930
 straight ahead 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.840
 and now comes with special technology 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.180
 Hemmer and many of you can do that 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.370
 not at first I know I'll give you trouble 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.099
 currently it is also really clean 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.650
 At the same time learn the ring finger here 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:15.420
 to hammer on the note cis hammer on it 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.039
 and up here on the note aaa the 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.039
 middle finger counting on that so 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.229
 but relatively fast are important 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:29.770
 that is even as if you were 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:31.840
 the suffering would be so with a hammer 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.610
 then you take these two easy 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.759
 down and play again 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.280
 and the whole back to 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:41.800
 walk without technology very easy and then 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.169
 At the end, here comes the note 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.000
 there and the high side you still too 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.340
 both as stylish as we are right now 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.220
 have made and we will this 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.710
 both races are always alternating 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.699
 to ask where they are in demand 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.699
 namely this run here 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.820
 wherever we go to the fis minor 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.820
 switch 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.590
 and now even a little bit of time 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.620
 you can also play alone took 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.960
 F sharp minor and this beautiful run with 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.120
 Pure is what a passionate one 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.260
 guitarists who really want more 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.660
 not just chords chords 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:27.110
 want this is clearly once again the 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.110
 second run 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.350
 So nice slow game again 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:45.100
 now the first in the tops is like that 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.480
 what as phil in first for example that 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.880
 is a very popular name i 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.050
 find if there are such beautiful melodies 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.210
 it is a bit more than just 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.350
 a film is not just a small one 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.930
 gap fillers but really one 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.370
 magical running okay and as well 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.290
 At the end I have her bonus 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.360
 promised this conclusion 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:03.270
 show that I'm really cool too 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.350
 completely through the eagle 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.000
 teacher side as a fundamental tone here with the 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.260
 thumb and take the other three 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.690
 finger show with ring around here below 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:17.370
 once so by the addition of the a major altogether 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:18.960
 normal standard now comes the small one 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.940
 magic trick we slip with the 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.220
 ring finger here on the note d 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.680
 Yes, pluck it once and then again 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:30.810
 Extra hit yes and then goes here 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:34.680
 back to the topic on such a small thriller 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:38.110
 So make a little thriller inside 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:42.130
 and teachers teach b-side then 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:45.970
 middle finger on the note ag page and 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:49.570
 then slide up on the notes and 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:51.360
 then hit the note here and the 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.620
 last both here so nice together 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.150
 if I die away the theory behind it 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.190
 really interested and you say 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.540
 magic guitar runs is what i am 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.430
 now really want to master hole 

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:03.360
 this little mini crash course magical 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:06.490
 Guitar runs war is just there 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.750
 really a nice gift too 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:10.360
 really great investment 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.800
 I wish you a lot of fun hau 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.180
 purely in the next video we see ourselves 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.640
 Once again we will do the chorus 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:17.530
 the right course of tears in heaven 

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:21.040
 you can then also to afterwards 

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:21.790
 then clickable I experience wishes 

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.650
 very much fun 

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:25.650
 until then result
