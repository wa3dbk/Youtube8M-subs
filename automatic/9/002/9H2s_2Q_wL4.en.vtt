00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.640

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
it's not so short all nice Northern

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:24.370 
it's not so short all nice Northern
filet<00:02:13.040> is<00:02:13.190> from<00:02:13.400> up<00:02:13.550> north<00:02:23.080> alright<00:02:24.080> now<00:02:24.290> we're

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
filet is from up north alright now we're

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.600 
filet is from up north alright now we're
gonna<00:02:24.440> cover<00:02:24.709> it<00:02:24.860> and<00:02:24.950> let<00:02:25.010> that<00:02:25.190> cook<00:02:25.370> for<00:02:25.430> a

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
gonna cover it and let that cook for a

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.790 
gonna cover it and let that cook for a
while<00:02:28.959> okay<00:02:29.959> so<00:02:30.050> we<00:02:30.200> let<00:02:30.320> it<00:02:30.410> cook<00:02:30.560> like<00:02:30.770> that

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
while okay so we let it cook like that

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.830 
while okay so we let it cook like that
so<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.280> moisture<00:02:31.640> comes<00:02:31.880> out<00:02:32.270> of<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.600> fish

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
so the moisture comes out of the fish

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.740 
so the moisture comes out of the fish
and<00:02:33.110> mixes<00:02:33.440> in<00:02:33.560> with<00:02:33.709> that<00:02:33.830> butter<00:02:34.100> stuff<00:02:34.750> and

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
and mixes in with that butter stuff and

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.430 
and mixes in with that butter stuff and
this<00:02:36.319> is<00:02:36.500> a<00:02:37.330> fish<00:02:38.330> is<00:02:38.480> pretty<00:02:38.720> much<00:02:38.959> done<00:02:39.290> as

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
this is a fish is pretty much done as

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.740 
this is a fish is pretty much done as
far<00:02:39.650> as<00:02:39.680> cooking<00:02:39.980> goes<00:02:40.280> I'm<00:02:41.209> gonna<00:02:41.360> take<00:02:41.600> and

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
far as cooking goes I'm gonna take and

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.800 
far as cooking goes I'm gonna take and
flip<00:02:41.900> all<00:02:42.140> this<00:02:42.290> over<00:02:42.680> once<00:02:46.450> I've<00:02:47.450> had<00:02:47.630> this

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
flip all this over once I've had this

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.930 
flip all this over once I've had this
cooking<00:02:48.050> just<00:02:48.290> on<00:02:48.470> medium<00:02:48.890> heat<00:02:49.100> maybe<00:02:49.610> a<00:02:49.730> you

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
cooking just on medium heat maybe a you

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.699 
cooking just on medium heat maybe a you
know<00:02:50.060> well<00:02:50.390> I<00:02:50.420> guess<00:02:50.630> it's<00:02:50.810> up<00:02:50.870> to<00:02:50.930> about<00:02:51.170> 6<00:02:51.470> or

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
know well I guess it's up to about 6 or

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.600 
know well I guess it's up to about 6 or
like<00:02:51.980> medium<00:02:52.400> high<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:53.800> he<00:02:54.800> soaked<00:02:55.160> his<00:02:55.310> fish

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
like medium high and he soaked his fish

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.800 
like medium high and he soaked his fish
overnight<00:02:56.000> in<00:02:56.090> water<00:02:56.300> and<00:02:56.450> he<00:02:56.540> had<00:02:56.630> a<00:02:56.660> good

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
overnight in water and he had a good

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.449 
overnight in water and he had a good
reason<00:02:56.959> for<00:02:57.110> it<00:02:57.350> I<00:02:57.440> didn't<00:02:57.680> do<00:02:57.800> that<00:02:57.950> I<00:02:58.010> took<00:02:58.220> it

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
reason for it I didn't do that I took it

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.640 
reason for it I didn't do that I took it
out<00:02:58.519> and<00:02:58.730> thought<00:02:58.940> it<00:02:59.090> out<00:02:59.239> and<00:02:59.570> now<00:03:00.260> today<00:03:00.560> it

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
out and thought it out and now today it

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.009 
out and thought it out and now today it
was<00:03:00.800> thawed<00:03:01.010> so<00:03:01.310> I<00:03:01.340> just<00:03:01.610> cooked<00:03:01.880> it<00:03:02.000> but<00:03:02.660> after

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
was thawed so I just cooked it but after

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.630 
was thawed so I just cooked it but after
we've<00:03:03.170> cooked<00:03:03.560> it<00:03:03.680> with<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:04.040> cover<00:03:04.190> on<00:03:04.310> like

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.130 
we've cooked it with the cover on like
this<00:03:04.850> so<00:03:05.030> that<00:03:05.060> all<00:03:05.209> the<00:03:05.420> water<00:03:05.600> has<00:03:05.870> come<00:03:06.019> out

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
this so that all the water has come out

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.390 
this so that all the water has come out
of<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.320> fish<00:03:06.500> and<00:03:06.680> mixed<00:03:06.920> in<00:03:07.010> with<00:03:07.130> the<00:03:07.280> butter

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400

more of the margarine in there I don't
know<00:03:23.420> that<00:03:23.600> it<00:03:23.660> needs<00:03:23.750> it<00:03:23.989> but<00:03:24.170> he<00:03:24.769> did<00:03:24.950> in<00:03:25.040> his

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
know that it needs it but he did in his

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.410 
know that it needs it but he did in his
video<00:03:25.459> so<00:03:25.519> I'm<00:03:25.850> gonna<00:03:25.970> throw<00:03:26.120> a<00:03:26.209> little<00:03:26.299> bit

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
video so I'm gonna throw a little bit

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.319 
video so I'm gonna throw a little bit
more<00:03:26.630> in<00:03:26.780> there<00:03:27.160> let<00:03:28.160> that<00:03:28.340> melt<00:03:28.640> and<00:03:29.030> at<00:03:29.209> this

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
more in there let that melt and at this

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.650 
more in there let that melt and at this
point<00:03:29.600> he<00:03:29.810> turns<00:03:30.079> the<00:03:30.230> heat<00:03:30.410> up<00:03:30.560> to<00:03:30.829> high<00:03:31.660> like

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
point he turns the heat up to high like

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.449 
point he turns the heat up to high like
you<00:03:32.840> know<00:03:32.959> it<00:03:33.380> just<00:03:33.440> keeps<00:03:33.680> it<00:03:33.860> on<00:03:33.950> high<00:03:34.130> until

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
you know it just keeps it on high until

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:40.570 
you know it just keeps it on high until
like<00:03:34.579> we<00:03:34.730> said<00:03:34.940> it<00:03:35.060> boils<00:03:35.540> everything<00:03:35.900> out

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.620 

all<00:03:41.580> right<00:03:41.760> when<00:03:41.910> that's<00:03:42.090> cooking<00:03:42.450> down

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
all right when that's cooking down

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.660 
all right when that's cooking down
because<00:03:43.200> now<00:03:43.350> is<00:03:43.560> when<00:03:43.740> he<00:03:43.860> added<00:03:44.100> this<00:03:44.220> places

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
because now is when he added this places

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:55.860 
because now is when he added this places
in<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:44.970> this<00:03:45.060> is<00:03:45.209> a<00:03:45.240> garlic<00:03:46.230> and<00:03:46.470> herb

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.190 

and<00:03:56.440> then<00:03:56.650> he<00:03:56.920> put<00:03:57.190> on<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:58.150> Cajun<00:03:58.690> seasoning

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
and then he put on the Cajun seasoning

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.070 
and then he put on the Cajun seasoning
and<00:03:59.800> now<00:04:00.010> I<00:04:00.370> don't<00:04:00.970> do<00:04:01.120> a<00:04:01.150> whole<00:04:01.239> lot<00:04:01.540> of<00:04:01.599> Cajun

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
and now I don't do a whole lot of Cajun

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.589 
and now I don't do a whole lot of Cajun
stuff<00:04:02.349> and<00:04:02.560> I<00:04:02.769> don't<00:04:03.280> like<00:04:03.550> really<00:04:03.940> hot<00:04:04.269> food

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500
