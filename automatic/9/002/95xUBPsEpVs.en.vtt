 buttocks and increases vision depends 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:10.280
 both from the form of sin and from the figure 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:12.560
 for example, a lead of one centimeter 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.430
 performed for a figure with convex 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.350
 buttocks for tight pants in this 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.330
 case length middle cut rear

 arrows run within one and a half 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.299

 but the lead two centimeters 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.729
 already performed for wider trousers and 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.400
 for figures with narrow buttocks 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.360
 in this case, the average cut is maximal 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.680
 vertically 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.810
 they are half arms short allowing 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:53.210
 just get out here from these creases under

 expression in order to the arrow 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:09.080
 it was necessary to press out exactly 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.180
 in the case when the pattern on the fabric is not 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.660
 pronounced as for example in these 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.390
 trousers 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.170
 sometime it will be better to make arrows 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:21.650
 because the eye does not seem to catch it 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:25.700
 displacement but landing pants on the figure 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:28.670
