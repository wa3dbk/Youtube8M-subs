00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.460
 what kind of weapon you will not meet in games 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.020
 not so much that they stand out 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.120
 they say all and sundry 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.980
 what have become truly iconic 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.620
 some may surprise us with their 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.170
 unusual this time we remembered about 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.789
 most unusual and ridiculous weapons 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.460
 who have ever met in games 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.710
 the world of fallout 3 is huge wasteland but 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.199
 even after a nuclear explosion can be found 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.570
 many nishtyak that another could 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.270
 seem trash and the ability to craft 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.770
 weapons at all allow to put almost 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.320
 all for recycling 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.300
 if you find a vacuum compressor for 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.420
 fanning leaves and fire nozzle 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.600
 hose then you can collect rocket lancher 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.360
 you can shoot almost anything out of it 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:51.000
 bottles buckets knives and better forks 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.309
 on the one hand it's even cool but how 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.420
 this could have come to mind 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:59.250
 developers remain a mystery at the start 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.980
 playstation 3 many tried 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.460
 use its capabilities to the maximum 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.750
 one of these games was heven messor 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.020
 developers are so carried away that 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.210
 made guided arrows to maneuver 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.820
 could be due to the gyro gamepad 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.189
 time slowed down and the arrow flew there 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.590
 where do you send it and I have of course 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.290
 no degree in physics but it seems to me 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.900
 arrows can't do this either 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.310
 cannonballs could be controlled here 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.229
 this technology in bloodborne can 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.930
 meet a lot of strange weapons 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.030
 difficult to explain but 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.930
 most of them are great for 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.280
 killings and destruction for example there is a sword 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.649
 transformed into young but the most 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.210
 unusual of all this is huge 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.790
 wooden wheel 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.070
 she looks so bulky ridiculous 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.450
 that in another setting would only cause 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:57.250
 laughter and here it is a very powerful weapon 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.410
 why not fight the crowds of demons 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.990
 playing guitar in the third devil may edge 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.120
 have a boss battle beating nylon you 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.780
 get a weapon that looks like 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.460
 guitar just play a couple of riffs on 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:15.850
 spewing lightning guitar and demons 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:17.920
 dying apparently they like pops series 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.410
 ratchet and klank is widely known for its 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.840
 weapons that turn the enemies of animals and 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.030
 perhaps the most ridiculous and absurd of them 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.890
 is spinach from the name is understandable 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.350
 that he transforms your enemies 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.870
 helpless sheep and if to pump 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.180
 black spinach's mouth these lambs are still 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.190
 will explode and it is a pity that you have to 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.820
 get through the game floor before you start 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.100
 have fun waiting for something adequate 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.340
 from playing in the south park universe is difficult 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.950
 so the presence in the game for nintendo 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.710
 64 launcher shooting cows completely 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.990
 fits if you hit the enemy 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.630
 so arovana go to his head for 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.180
 one hole soon the poor fellow will die 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.700
 And if you miss the mark, the beef will break on 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.290
 pieces 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.239
 music is capable of much 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.459
 disk features so why not 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.680
 hang air disco ball turn on 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.290
 music and dance instead 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.390
 fight that is what allows the group 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.880
 throne in one of the games of the ratchet and kank series 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.010
 while your enemies will be funny dancing 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.870
 depending on the style of music and getting 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.390
 pleasure you can safely 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.670
 kill them even dubstep gun is in 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.370
 severely undoubtedly cool but gravitron 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.470
 heartily 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.570
 in the tenth part of the file fantasy is 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.910
 invented sport near ball 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.489
 resemble a combination of regular football with 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.040
 American instead of water field here 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.980
 scope but so that you understand the general 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.989
 picture because one of the characters 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.480
 uses the ball to bliss bola as a weapon 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.550
 I certainly understand that if you fall 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.070
 basketball on the head then nothing 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.230
 Enjoyable does not happen even the game is 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.020
 such where you need to hit the ball in person 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.900
 from the opposing team 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.030
 she was called bouncers or pioneer ball but 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.460
 hands bucky the ball turns into 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.610
 deadly accurate and not obeying 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.620
 laws of gravity weapons instead 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.570
 to swing a sword about flying 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.710
 the enemy is better thrown at him 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:16.290
 rubber ball with a fiery effect like 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.989
 what do you think is the most suitable weapon 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:22.740
 for the guard accompanying the hole itself in 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:25.200
 her pilgrimage sword is not childish 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.810
 toys are pretty funny to see the moon 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.310
 standing opposite goblins or stone 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.350
 giants with a toy in their hands 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.510
 and when they start to fool around 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.210
 the enemy and stuck it all becomes 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.370
 no funnier yet they are not 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.830
 cause a lot of damage itâ€™s better to pump 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:45.300
 abilities of black magic and use 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:47.850
 they red faction series never 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.310
 was famous for the original sense of humor but 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.560
 once the developers convince us that 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:56.090
 it will turn out if to combine a unicorn 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.710
 rainbow and flatulence correct death ray 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:01.530
 erupting from a screaming ass 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:04.110
 Unicorn apparently he is not very 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.360
 nice but not least get on the 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.210
 who will get this beam of light 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:14.610
 you can get mister dodets in secret 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:16.590
 place or buy passing game well, but on 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.410
 This is all the guys thanks for all
