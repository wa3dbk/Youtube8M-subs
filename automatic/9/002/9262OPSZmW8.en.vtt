what<00:01:53.399> programming<00:01:53.759> language<00:01:54.119> should<00:01:54.240> i<00:01:54.329> learn

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
what programming language should i learn

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.690 
what programming language should i learn
maybe<00:01:55.140> i<00:01:55.259> have<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.439> learn<00:01:55.530> c++<00:01:56.219> from<00:01:56.369> scratch

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
maybe i have to learn c++ from scratch

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.910 
maybe i have to learn c++ from scratch
or<00:01:56.939> c<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.509> now<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.750> can<00:01:58.079> go<00:01:58.200> in<00:01:58.350> there<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.560> can

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
or c and now you can go in there you can

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.950 
or c and now you can go in there you can
start<00:01:59.700> up<00:01:59.820> with<00:01:59.939> unity<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.390> do<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.659> little<00:02:00.810> bit

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
start up with unity and do a little bit

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.990 
start up with unity and do a little bit
of<00:02:00.990> editor<00:02:01.290> script<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.770> suddenly<00:02:02.100> hey<00:02:02.490> you

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
of editor script and suddenly hey you

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.580 
of editor script and suddenly hey you
have<00:02:03.119> something<00:02:03.420> on<00:02:03.479> screen<00:02:03.840> it's<00:02:04.350> much

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
have something on screen it's much

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.889 
have something on screen it's much
easier<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:05.009> get<00:02:05.189> started<00:02:05.430> but<00:02:05.729> also<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.780> this

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
easier to get started but also and this

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:07.880 
easier to get started but also and this
is<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.170> thing<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.500> think<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.829> really

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
is the thing that I think is really

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.740 
is the thing that I think is really

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
ideas and we can funder ideas

ideas and we can funder ideas

button which i think is really fantastic
when<00:02:23.209> I<00:02:23.239> started<00:02:23.629> it<00:02:23.780> was<00:02:23.810> a<00:02:23.900> little<00:02:24.170> bit

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
when I started it was a little bit

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.250 
when I started it was a little bit
different<00:02:24.620> I<00:02:24.939> think<00:02:25.939> it's<00:02:26.060> super<00:02:26.900> compelling

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
different I think it's super compelling

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.470 
different I think it's super compelling
to<00:02:28.040> think<00:02:28.609> about<00:02:28.849> what<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.120> world<00:02:29.299> would<00:02:29.359> be

like if everybody could take their

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.220 
like if everybody could take their

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
creative and interesting fantastical

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.839 
creative and interesting fantastical
ideas<00:02:33.560> and<00:02:33.799> turn<00:02:34.129> them<00:02:34.189> into<00:02:34.400> something<00:02:34.609> to

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
ideas and turn them into something to

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.160 
ideas and turn them into something to
share<00:02:35.030> with<00:02:35.090> someone<00:02:35.359> else<00:02:35.629> right<00:02:35.989> I<00:02:36.019> mean

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
our vision is what makes us understand

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.309 
our vision is what makes us understand
one<00:02:40.430> another<00:02:40.639> more<00:02:40.909> and<00:02:40.970> also<00:02:41.450> it<00:02:42.109> really

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
one another more and also it really

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.899 
one another more and also it really
broadens<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.799> landscape<00:02:43.219> of<00:02:43.250> what<00:02:43.549> games<00:02:43.760> can

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909 
broadens the landscape of what games can

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.030 
broadens the landscape of what games can
be<00:02:44.060> about<00:02:44.359> you<00:02:44.659> know<00:02:44.780> if<00:02:45.109> you<00:02:45.260> imagine<00:02:45.439> what

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
be about you know if you imagine what

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.949 
be about you know if you imagine what
the<00:02:46.189> world<00:02:46.280> would<00:02:46.370> be<00:02:46.489> like<00:02:46.519> if<00:02:46.959> everyone's

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
the world would be like if everyone's

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.949 
the world would be like if everyone's
interior<00:02:48.620> sort<00:02:49.040> of<00:02:49.189> was<00:02:49.730> was<00:02:50.180> shareable<00:02:50.780> and

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
interior sort of was was shareable and

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.210 
interior sort of was was shareable and
something<00:02:51.200> that<00:02:51.290> other<00:02:51.409> people<00:02:51.470> could<00:02:51.829> see<00:02:52.069> it

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
something that other people could see it

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.500 
something that other people could see it
would<00:02:52.310> probably<00:02:52.519> be<00:02:52.790> a<00:02:52.819> more<00:02:53.030> peaceful<00:02:53.239> and

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
would probably be a more peaceful and

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.599 
would probably be a more peaceful and
whole<00:02:53.720> place<00:02:53.959> so<00:02:54.409> I<00:02:54.680> really<00:02:55.010> like<00:02:55.159> the<00:02:55.280> idea<00:02:55.340> of

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
whole place so I really like the idea of

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:56.949 
whole place so I really like the idea of
people<00:02:55.909> being<00:02:56.120> able<00:02:56.359> to<00:02:56.450> find<00:02:56.659> that<00:02:56.810> voice

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
people being able to find that voice

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.539 
people being able to find that voice
especially<00:02:57.409> young<00:02:57.799> people<00:02:57.829> because<00:02:58.370> young

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
especially young people because young

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.759 
especially young people because young
