00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:16.689
 the people here i am again Epic's brand as it is today 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:21.380
 I want to make a small video answer to the video of Multi App Store he 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.550
 has a video 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.019
 good with the percent with his top 3 box Duplo 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.810
 I've got my Top 5 right now 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.810
 So offer a parking meter 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.780
 and it is not 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.990
 to me 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.990
 Eick Red Snoek is easy 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.690
 they will be eliminated at PartyPoker and 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.690
 Uli bleed 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.010
 The whole thing is just a tiny animation 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:02.990
 that's why 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.550
 only fifth place 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.490
 but I find this snow globo 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.490
 I'm actually cool 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.850
 the reader in fourth place is the PlayStation bot logo 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.890
 that's pretty cool too bad that and Bud and Lubos only ever with percent 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.549
 So now also luck 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.639
 can be played so the whole thing jerky a little 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.030
 but the idea itself and the animation looks like the whole thing 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.620
 very nice to look at 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.430
 the same thing looks and then 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.030
 he seems this 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.050
 Kuhn PlayStation logo with the broken corner 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.270
 in third place this is for me 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.460
 gt5 Kudlow roughly 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.320
 maybe now what can say why third place well i'm pretty 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.320
 big fan of Gran Turismo 5 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.159
 Lessing Kant it is, however, that 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:10.519
 and now that would see daily 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.609
 there is women but whoever works like me 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:16.309
 it's a pity, but it does 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:19.729
 SID cool on the net 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:23.099
 so come right now 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.129
 or COBIT introduction and 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.369
 and that gt5 blog 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:31.449
 a bit blur Fenton from Strauss though 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:34.419
 that increases significantly 

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:37.419
 a certain effect 

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:41.039
 in second place first two is so dense 

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:42.259
 the cash flow 

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:44.029
 MCO Globo from 

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:45.859
 continue 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.609
 So it's the seventh game portal and 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:51.809
 Davut made the mission if that explains why 

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:56.259
 because we are still 2 1 center or so 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:59.939
 for that see my motivation start logo from 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.939
 APA 

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:06.759
 also has unis go 

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:11.589
 Prop Hegeler left gross 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.329
 that's why for me 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.349
 is the second place 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.089
 why last 

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:19.329
 this 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.059
 Circle is still there 

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:23.039
 I do not know 

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:24.889
 percent 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:26.789
 otherwise that is 

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:28.419
 really cool 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:31.130
 and first place for me one of the funniest 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.379
 Blues is the working band 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:39.219
 that's really cool what's done there or always animationally 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:45.499
 I think I say he can now train to about 6,000 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.049
 that's pretty much the coolest thing I've seen so far 

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:01.019
 b 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.019
 and you're also pretty funny 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:09.649
 Yes, unfortunately 

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:12.389
 but the flank ball seconds so Obama 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.219
 Nevertheless 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:16.049
 Test Tikal 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.049
 really cool right guy 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:24.159
 and I guess that should have been 1 Clyde video answer 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:28.199
 I thank you for watching as always leave a comment and after 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.099
 maybe give me a thumbs up and me at the unit 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:31.650
 Until next time
