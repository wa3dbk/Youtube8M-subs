 Finale brings after death he showed in memory of his mother 

00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:10.239

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:15.039
 I think he is a brave man way led his mother and he stood 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:15.490
 very close 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.800
 all and the last few days were not easy for him it was a serious one 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.800
 Decision but he played well and I'm happy about that 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.159

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.220
 today it is certainly not definitively regulated he has decided to 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.040
 play something very brave 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.660
 he complained to Scheer that was very good for him that he turned the penalty kick 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.680
 Oliver Gaedeke has loud "People got to be loved pro that certainly has power 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.010
 Lebedev is outdated group 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.860
 and it was also a great honor for him and his mother Red 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.010
 Anyone who wants finds at Conti inflated in front of the NABU levels in the Gelderner 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.860
 Wanted to hear Poland 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.880
 Despite the tragedy game plan will continue to be great football he 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.390
 finished the season with 20 goals "tail light" encounters for his 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.070
 tireless efforts he is voted Guide Mediated Player of the Year 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.450
 despite the defeat in the final of the Champions League 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.880
 he still trusts his team 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.920
 werder-trainer in terms of the team I am very confident we have one 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.630
 Great preparation it's good to come out of England and be a good man 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.810
 to focus on the team to get fit 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.500
 we want to continue to increase compared to the last two seasons 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.789
 worldwide, we want to become champions and win the Champions League 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.450
 one admires 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.750
 Regrettably, warned for coach his friendship with 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.150
 Abramovich is not out to hold them in the executive chair 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.430
 despite leading Chelsea into the Champions League final and the club 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.110
 Vice-champion will be warned after only 8 months by the former 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.890
 Portuguese coach now is replaced the love Scodari 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.310
 is contracted, it is now up to Scolari the contract with the 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.909
 Midfielder to extend 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:13.909
 Despite some speculation Gunnar is convinced that he is at Chelsea 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:15.079
 will stay 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:16.189
 actually 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:18.819
 Frank Lampard 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.559
 I met Frank Lampard yesterday 

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:22.840
 said under him 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.120
 that I'm very moderate Neumarkt as a player and as a human being 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.539
 Khalil g 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:34.799
 and in Stader you wonder if he will stay out at Chelsea 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.339
 To the relief of the fans of Chelsea, Skoda is driving right off 

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:43.180
 Lambert signs a new five-year contract with the Blues 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.639
 this 40 million pound contract 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.639
 makes him the highest paid player in the Premier League 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:50.499
 Viletta 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:53.819
 The last few months have been a difficult part of my life and that 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.189
 Negotiations with Chelsea and have been stuck for quite a while 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:00.839
 I had to spend some time to get a head free 

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:04.959
 Anyone who understands what El Sheikh knows can happen 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.849
 I spent a lot of time with my family and thought about what 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.849
 I would like to do a vinyl on loud 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.259
 v the duration and the world 

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:18.629
 a yes and now I come back from the preparation and had some 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:22.019
 Talk back in recent weeks through a special page from China 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:22.839
 are 

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:26.499
 Enke one I'm very glad that we were agreed we had talk up 

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:30.179
 Now here are seven fantastic years and now have the option of another five 

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:32.619
 Years to play here 

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:36.459
 in the main I will finish my career here also in five 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.019
 or more years you will see it would be possible to wait Morawa 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.810
 The map-pack the free spins but also Scolari does not stay long at the FC 

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:47.809
 Chelsea he will be fired before the end of the season 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:52.669
 after a brief transition period with generous who with the Chelsea FC 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:56.769
 Winning 50 CAD, Carlo Ancelotti will be introduced in 2009 as the new coach 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:04.519
 Farmer until 2010 the most successful scorer of Chelsea FC and with 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:09.540
 a total of 143 hits with the offensive midfielder also in the future one 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.029
 important role for the potential success after Lempertz already play 

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:16.299
 has been playing for the Blue for almost ten years 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.239
 his 500's of Premier League use are getting closer 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.460
 if you count all competitions you are already at 453 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.870
 as a country doctor In 1997, West Ham United began to make a name for itself 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.300
 in Landshut 21 coach Peter counter becomes aware of him 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:44.879
 On 13 November 1996, the 19-year-old makes his international debut with the 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:47.879
 u21 national team against Greece 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.570
 his first game in the national team he makes in 1999 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:55.800
 a friendly against Belgium 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.009
 Nevertheless, he will not be for the European Championship 2000 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:02.219
 and the world championship 2002 back lake stinging 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:07.549
 Lampert must wait until the 2004 European Championship Vizada an international 

00:05:07.549 --> 00:05:09.309
 Competition can arise 

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:13.109
 the waiting time was worth it shoots three goals and is from the UCI 

00:05:13.109 --> 00:05:16.109
 Ride selected among the best players of the tournament 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.020
 Later this year he will be named "England's Player of the Year" by the fans 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.669
 chosen 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:27.499
 the disappointment to have missed the 2002 World Cup is still deep 

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:32.509
 but his great performance at the European Championships in 2004 and more 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:35.830
 International games guarantee their use at the World Cup 

00:05:35.829 --> 00:05:38.829
 2006 in Germany 

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:44.729
 he loads high expectations on him and he plays every game through unlike 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:48.819
 European Championship 2004, however, did not make it even a ball in the 

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:50.729
 hostile network 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:53.729
 and England eliminated Portugal in the quarter-finals 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.370
 after the offensive midfielder poster us resigned before the tournament 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.499
 So District Council fill this gap, but he does not succeed 

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:09.719
 England's early departure may be partly Cristiano Ronaldo in his 

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:13.639
 Participation in Unis red card will be charged but many fans are looking for 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:16.639
 the fault also at Lampert therefore did not hit the gate 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:21.960
 although he takes a lot of criticism for his performance at the World Cup 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.440
 he soon had to play for his fiftieth slam of games 

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:28.439
 Croatia 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.120
 it's really great there is an atmosphere under it either 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.960
 Moritz can be struggling with himself or you can act as an individual and as a 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.189
 Let team upset it percent 

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:41.819
 a move in there is nothing better than facing a hostile audience 

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:45.370
 play against the crowd to perform well 

00:06:45.369 --> 00:06:48.669
 Hiking guide promptly 

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:52.300
 After the blamable World Cup, changed focus on the 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.699
 Qualification for the European Championship 2008 he wants to 

00:06:55.699 --> 00:06:58.409
 look ahead 

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:03.119
 as always when you play bad you started to become known jokes 

00:07:03.119 --> 00:07:07.689
 it is so good if you come from a positive environment like it 

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:11.080
 just have Chelsea and tried this confidence in the 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.389
 To bring in the team 

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:17.539
 You have to pay attention to who plays well in the Premier League 

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:20.539
 the choice of games plays a big role 

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:29.710
 shaking off a losing streak is sometimes harder than you 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:30.389
 thinks 

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:33.680
 In March 2007, he is attacked by a dead man 

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.990
 it's disappointing you're celebrating a victory and then something like that happens 

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.470
 that's a shock i think if i sleep over it a couple of nights and 

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:47.490
 I can not forget all the headlines. "I hope so 

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:53.020
 something did not happen again after the children's qualification for 

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.310
 missed the European Championship in 2008 

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.569
 Focuses on the 2010 World Cup 

00:07:58.569 --> 00:08:02.029
 by a 5 2 1 against Croatia qualifies in Landquart 

00:08:02.779 --> 00:08:05.249
 since the beginning of his career, the Pope had
