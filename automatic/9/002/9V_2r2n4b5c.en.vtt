hello everyone this video is going to be

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.690 
hello everyone this video is going to be
taking<00:00:01.800> a<00:00:01.829> look<00:00:01.979> at<00:00:02.070> exactly<00:00:02.429> what

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
taking a look at exactly what

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.940 
taking a look at exactly what
creationism<00:00:03.330> says<00:00:03.600> and<00:00:03.959> predictions<00:00:04.770> can<00:00:04.890> be

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
creationism says and predictions can be

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.980 
creationism says and predictions can be
made<00:00:05.069> from<00:00:05.370> it<00:00:05.490> as<00:00:05.640> a<00:00:05.670> scientific<00:00:06.089> theory<00:00:06.420> now

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
made from it as a scientific theory now

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.930 
made from it as a scientific theory now
we'll<00:00:07.140> also<00:00:07.259> be<00:00:07.500> examining<00:00:08.040> evolution<00:00:08.730> the

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
we'll also be examining evolution the

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.749 
we'll also be examining evolution the
evidence<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:09.660> exactly<00:00:10.380> which<00:00:10.769> side<00:00:11.370> in<00:00:11.639> which

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
evidence and exactly which side in which

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.190 
evidence and exactly which side in which
theory<00:00:12.179> that<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.509> evidence<00:00:12.780> should<00:00:12.990> side

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
theory that the evidence should side

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.900 
theory that the evidence should side
with<00:00:13.230> at<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.040> end<00:00:14.130> we'll<00:00:14.280> also<00:00:14.370> be<00:00:14.580> discussing

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
with at the end we'll also be discussing

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.180 
with at the end we'll also be discussing
exactly<00:00:15.540> why<00:00:15.719> creationism<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.529> no<00:00:16.740> longer<00:00:16.980> a

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
exactly why creationism is no longer a

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.730 
exactly why creationism is no longer a
scientific<00:00:17.789> theory<00:00:18.000> given<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.810> evidence<00:00:18.960> now

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
scientific theory given the evidence now

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.019 
scientific theory given the evidence now
I<00:00:19.770> stumbled<00:00:20.130> upon<00:00:20.220> images<00:00:20.670> like<00:00:20.820> these

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
I stumbled upon images like these

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.109 
I stumbled upon images like these
several<00:00:21.869> weeks<00:00:22.109> ago<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.650> they're<00:00:23.519> very<00:00:23.880> very

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
several weeks ago and they're very very

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.670 
several weeks ago and they're very very
useful<00:00:24.330> in<00:00:24.570> this<00:00:24.720> discussion<00:00:25.230> as<00:00:25.350> they<00:00:25.500> will

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
useful in this discussion as they will

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.279 
useful in this discussion as they will
clearly<00:00:26.580> outline<00:00:27.000> exactly<00:00:27.539> what<00:00:27.750> creationism

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
clearly outline exactly what creationism

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.560 
clearly outline exactly what creationism
and<00:00:28.410> evolution<00:00:28.529> both<00:00:29.099> say<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.640> from<00:00:30.420> these

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
and evolution both say and from these

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.170 
and evolution both say and from these
images<00:00:30.720> we<00:00:31.140> can<00:00:31.320> draw<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:32.040> make<00:00:32.610> predictions

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
images we can draw and make predictions

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.510 
images we can draw and make predictions
about<00:00:33.450> what<00:00:34.440> would<00:00:34.590> be<00:00:34.620> true<00:00:34.950> if<00:00:35.219> either

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
about what would be true if either

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.180 
about what would be true if either
theory<00:00:35.940> were<00:00:36.120> correct<00:00:36.540> now<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.010> tree

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
theory were correct now this is the tree

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.889 
theory were correct now this is the tree
of<00:00:38.309> life<00:00:38.460> according<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.090> evolution<00:00:39.600> as<00:00:39.750> you

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
of life according to evolution as you

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.360 
of life according to evolution as you
can<00:00:40.020> see<00:00:40.200> we<00:00:40.320> start<00:00:40.530> off<00:00:40.620> with<00:00:40.800> all<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.219> basic

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
can see we start off with all the basic

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.130 
can see we start off with all the basic
animals<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.210> then<00:00:42.300> there's<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.540> main<00:00:42.809> major

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
animals and then there's a main major

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.779 
animals and then there's a main major
division<00:00:43.649> between<00:00:43.800> invertebrates<00:00:44.520> and

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
division between invertebrates and

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.180 
division between invertebrates and
vertebrates<00:00:45.350> we<00:00:46.350> all<00:00:46.469> have<00:00:46.649> vertebrates<00:00:47.010> so

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
vertebrates we all have vertebrates so

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.490 
vertebrates we all have vertebrates so
we're<00:00:47.399> vertebrates<00:00:47.930> moving<00:00:48.930> along<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.410> the

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
we're vertebrates moving along to the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.170 
we're vertebrates moving along to the
right<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.860> can<00:00:50.010> see<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.579> fish<00:00:51.030> are

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
right you can see that the fish are

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.630 
right you can see that the fish are
divided<00:00:51.539> into<00:00:52.010> those<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.160> have<00:00:53.280> cartilage

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
divided into those that have cartilage

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.040 
divided into those that have cartilage
those<00:00:53.969> which<00:00:54.120> are<00:00:54.239> jawless<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.809> those<00:00:54.899> which

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
those which are jawless and those which

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.840 
those which are jawless and those which
are<00:00:55.199> bony<00:00:55.410> bony<00:00:55.860> being<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.340> middle<00:00:56.579> from

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
are bony bony being in the middle from

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.920 
are bony bony being in the middle from
there<00:00:57.090> amphibians<00:00:57.660> arise<00:00:58.430> reptiles<00:00:59.930> mammals

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
there amphibians arise reptiles mammals

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.310 
there amphibians arise reptiles mammals
and<00:01:01.289> birds<00:01:01.350> all<00:01:02.039> arise<00:01:02.280> from<00:01:02.489> reptiles<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.320> so

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
and birds all arise from reptiles and so

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.950 
and birds all arise from reptiles and so
on<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:04.830> forth<00:01:05.100> from<00:01:05.309> there<00:01:05.570> now<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:06.810> is

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
on and so forth from there now this is

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.929 
on and so forth from there now this is
the<00:01:07.110> image<00:01:07.290> dealing<00:01:07.799> with<00:01:07.979> creationism<00:01:08.790> and

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
the image dealing with creationism and

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.539 
the image dealing with creationism and
exactly<00:01:09.299> what<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.750> present<00:01:10.439> now<00:01:11.159> as<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.400> can

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
exactly what it present now as you can

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.350 
exactly what it present now as you can
see<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.210> creationist<00:01:12.810> concept<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:14.360> theory

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
see the creationist concept and theory

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.240 
see the creationist concept and theory
has<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.689> very<00:01:15.930> different<00:01:16.259> outline<00:01:16.890> and

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
has a very different outline and

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.399 
has a very different outline and
explanation<00:01:18.150> for<00:01:18.330> exactly<00:01:18.600> how<00:01:18.810> life<00:01:19.049> arose

explanation for exactly how life arose
you<00:01:19.770> can<00:01:20.340> see<00:01:20.610> all<00:01:21.200> kinds<00:01:22.200> arriving<00:01:22.799> at<00:01:22.979> the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
you can see all kinds arriving at the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.270 
you can see all kinds arriving at the
same<00:01:23.310> time<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.880> cats<00:01:24.180> lizards<00:01:24.659> snakes

there are different types of

there are different types of

I'm being very generous here and giving

I'm being very generous here and giving
them<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.799> several<00:01:47.310> species<00:01:47.520> can<00:01:47.939> arise<00:01:48.450> from

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
them that several species can arise from

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.170 
them that several species can arise from
that<00:01:49.079> from<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.350> major<00:01:49.530> types<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.729> now<00:01:50.850> let's

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
that from the major types so now let's

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.289 
that from the major types so now let's
actually<00:01:51.329> test<00:01:51.810> these<00:01:52.579> theories<00:01:53.579> they<00:01:54.090> both

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
actually test these theories they both

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.389 
actually test these theories they both
offer<00:01:54.509> completely<00:01:55.409> different<00:01:55.829> alternatives

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
offer completely different alternatives

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.980

for how the universe in the world would
look<00:01:58.140> if<00:01:58.320> each<00:01:58.439> were<00:01:58.619> true<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.549> let's<00:01:59.729> take<00:01:59.850> a

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
look if each were true so let's take a

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.639

so let's actually examine this what do

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.560 
so let's actually examine this what do
we<00:04:22.409> find<00:04:22.650> well<00:04:23.430> when<00:04:23.849> we<00:04:23.940> take<00:04:24.120> a<00:04:24.180> look<00:04:24.270> at

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
we find well when we take a look at

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.220 
we find well when we take a look at
we're<00:04:25.050> going

we're going

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.810 
we're going
such<00:04:25.560> as<00:04:25.680> the<00:04:25.800> chicken<00:04:26.070> we<00:04:26.220> find<00:04:26.460> that<00:04:26.610> yes

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
such as the chicken we find that yes

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.060 
such as the chicken we find that yes
they<00:04:27.360> do<00:04:27.420> indeed<00:04:28.020> have<00:04:28.290> genes<00:04:28.710> for<00:04:28.950> making

teeth whales also have genes for making

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.250 
teeth whales also have genes for making

skeletal muscle control now this is what

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.130 
skeletal muscle control now this is what
we<00:04:40.920> would<00:04:41.130> expect<00:04:41.220> to<00:04:41.520> find<00:04:41.610> under<00:04:42.330> evolution

we would expect to find under evolution
if<00:04:43.320> evolution<00:04:43.620> were<00:04:43.860> true<00:04:44.070> however

creationism<00:04:45.840> completely<00:04:46.620> flies<00:04:46.800> in<00:04:47.070> the<00:04:47.160> face

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
creationism completely flies in the face

creationism completely flies in the face
of<00:04:47.340> this<00:04:47.670> if<00:04:47.880> everything<00:04:48.390> is<00:04:48.510> created<00:04:48.750> in

the best most logical explanation is

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:56.630 
the best most logical explanation is
that<00:04:55.290> it<00:04:55.470> was<00:04:55.500> simply<00:04:55.860> carried<00:04:56.190> over<00:04:56.310> from

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
that it was simply carried over from

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.820 
that it was simply carried over from
more<00:04:56.940> primitive<00:04:57.330> organisms<00:04:57.510> that<00:04:58.500> have

more primitive organisms that have

evolved up into the their present form

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.590 
evolved up into the their present form
that<00:05:01.140> we<00:05:01.230> find<00:05:01.440> them<00:05:01.590> now<00:05:02.060> once<00:05:03.060> again<00:05:03.210> this<00:05:03.450> is

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
that we find them now once again this is

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.240 
that we find them now once again this is
another<00:05:03.750> prediction<00:05:04.260> that<00:05:04.470> evolution<00:05:05.040> made

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.350 
true well if creationism were true we
would<00:05:22.560> expect<00:05:22.830> to<00:05:22.920> find<00:05:23.010> massive<00:05:23.550> gaps<00:05:24.030> and

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
would expect to find massive gaps and

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.020 
would expect to find massive gaps and

that is the lizards when you are

dinosaurs when you stack them up with
birds<00:05:32.520> you<00:05:32.790> should<00:05:33.000> find<00:05:33.270> a<00:05:33.540> massive

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050

birds you should find a massive

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.810 
discontinuity there be it in the the DNA

a<00:05:38.850> seamless<00:05:39.330> transition<00:05:40.340> we<00:05:41.340> should<00:05:41.520> find

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:41.730 
a seamless transition we should find

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.880 
a seamless transition we should find
major<00:05:41.910> stumbling<00:05:42.450> blocks<00:05:42.720> if<00:05:43.020> evolution<00:05:43.590> were

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
major stumbling blocks if evolution were

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.860 
major stumbling blocks if evolution were
true<00:05:44.160> we<00:05:44.670> shouldn't<00:05:45.000> really<00:05:45.150> find<00:05:45.510> those<00:05:45.660> we

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
true we shouldn't really find those we

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.300 
true we shouldn't really find those we
would<00:05:46.020> have<00:05:46.140> of<00:05:46.320> course<00:05:46.470> expect<00:05:46.860> variation

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
would have of course expect variation

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.830 
would have of course expect variation
because<00:05:47.550> they're<00:05:47.790> different<00:05:47.970> organisms

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
because they're different organisms

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.600 
because they're different organisms
however<00:05:49.380> the<00:05:49.560> variation<00:05:50.370> should<00:05:50.400> be

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
however the variation should be

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.060 
however the variation should be
relatively<00:05:51.090> little<00:05:51.420> as<00:05:51.570> it<00:05:52.170> is<00:05:52.290> transforming

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
relatively little as it is transforming

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.430 
relatively little as it is transforming
from<00:05:53.370> one<00:05:53.580> into<00:05:53.970> another<00:05:54.050> now<00:05:55.050> keep<00:05:55.290> in<00:05:55.410> mind

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
from one into another now keep in mind

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.730 
from one into another now keep in mind
that<00:05:55.860> this<00:05:55.980> is<00:05:56.040> also<00:05:56.520> a<00:05:56.970> major<00:05:57.780> logical<00:05:58.470> point

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
that this is also a major logical point

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.340 
that this is also a major logical point
in<00:05:58.920> the<00:05:58.980> sense<00:05:59.190> of<00:05:59.340> if<00:05:59.520> there<00:06:00.030> are<00:06:00.300> no<00:06:00.900> major

in the sense of if there are no major
gaps<00:06:01.860> well<00:06:02.610> then<00:06:02.730> the<00:06:02.820> most<00:06:02.970> logical

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:04.670 
gaps well then the most logical

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.830 
gaps well then the most logical
construction<00:06:05.670> of<00:06:05.790> this<00:06:05.970> is<00:06:06.150> to<00:06:06.510> make<00:06:06.540> them

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 
construction of this is to make them

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.050 
construction of this is to make them
without<00:06:07.110> gaps<00:06:07.620> if<00:06:08.010> you're<00:06:08.430> artificially

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
without gaps if you're artificially

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.270 
without gaps if you're artificially
creating<00:06:09.630> gaps<00:06:09.840> if<00:06:10.260> you<00:06:10.440> have<00:06:10.620> to<00:06:10.800> do<00:06:10.950> that<00:06:11.100> to

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
creating gaps if you have to do that to

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.680 
creating gaps if you have to do that to
make<00:06:11.370> your<00:06:11.520> theory<00:06:11.880> work<00:06:12.060> then<00:06:12.570> it's

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690 
make your theory work then it's

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.960 
make your theory work then it's
obviously<00:06:13.080> not<00:06:13.290> going<00:06:13.500> to<00:06:13.590> work<00:06:13.860> and<00:06:14.160> it's<00:06:14.880> not

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970 
obviously not going to work and it's not

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.820 
obviously not going to work and it's not
the<00:06:15.180> best<00:06:15.210> explanation<00:06:15.960> so<00:06:16.470> let's<00:06:16.650> take<00:06:16.800> a

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
the best explanation so let's take a

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.040 
the best explanation so let's take a
look<00:06:17.010> at<00:06:17.070> phylogenetic<00:06:17.610> analysis<00:06:18.180> and<00:06:18.420> see<00:06:18.960> if

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
look at phylogenetic analysis and see if

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.740 
look at phylogenetic analysis and see if
there<00:06:19.200> truly<00:06:19.320> are<00:06:19.650> gaps<00:06:19.890> between<00:06:20.190> those<00:06:20.750> so

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750 
there truly are gaps between those so

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.630 
there truly are gaps between those so
when<00:06:22.110> we<00:06:22.230> actually<00:06:22.350> take<00:06:22.710> a<00:06:22.770> look<00:06:22.860> at<00:06:23.160> the<00:06:23.280> the

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:23.640 
when we actually take a look at the the

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.310 
when we actually take a look at the the
genomes<00:06:24.150> of<00:06:24.270> these<00:06:24.420> organelles<00:06:24.750> we<00:06:25.050> find

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
genomes of these organelles we find

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.140 
genomes of these organelles we find
unequivocally<00:06:26.040> that<00:06:26.070> there<00:06:26.700> really<00:06:26.850> aren't

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
unequivocally that there really aren't

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.970 
unequivocally that there really aren't
that<00:06:27.240> many<00:06:27.390> massive<00:06:28.050> gaps<00:06:28.290> in-between<00:06:28.530> the

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:28.980 
that many massive gaps in-between the

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.920 
that many massive gaps in-between the
transitions<00:06:29.550> that<00:06:29.760> evolution<00:06:30.210> would<00:06:30.360> predict

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
transitions that evolution would predict

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.000 
transitions that evolution would predict
um<00:06:31.640> this<00:06:32.640> completely<00:06:33.150> supports<00:06:33.630> evolution

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.010 
um this completely supports evolution

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.350 
um this completely supports evolution
and<00:06:35.010> just<00:06:35.340> I'm<00:06:35.550> actually<00:06:35.730> taking<00:06:36.090> a<00:06:36.150> look<00:06:36.300> at

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
and just I'm actually taking a look at

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.580 
and just I'm actually taking a look at
the<00:06:36.420> page<00:06:36.600> right<00:06:36.810> now<00:06:36.840> this<00:06:37.170> just<00:06:37.350> came<00:06:37.470> out

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
the page right now this just came out

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:38.740 
the page right now this just came out
the<00:06:37.710> other<00:06:37.740> week<00:06:37.980> they

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:38.750 
the other week they

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.780 
the other week they
some<00:06:39.260> information<00:06:39.500> from<00:06:39.980> the<00:06:40.160> Tyrannosaurus

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:40.790 
some information from the Tyrannosaurus

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.460 
some information from the Tyrannosaurus
Rex<00:06:41.000> and<00:06:41.210> they<00:06:41.270> find<00:06:41.510> that<00:06:41.600> it<00:06:41.780> is<00:06:41.870> more<00:06:42.080> common

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:42.470 
Rex and they find that it is more common

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.800 
Rex and they find that it is more common
or<00:06:42.890> has<00:06:43.040> more<00:06:43.250> in<00:06:43.340> common<00:06:43.370> with<00:06:43.700> like<00:06:44.360> chickens

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:44.810 
or has more in common with like chickens

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.180 
or has more in common with like chickens
and<00:06:44.900> things<00:06:45.050> like<00:06:45.230> that<00:06:45.470> than<00:06:45.650> it<00:06:45.740> does<00:06:45.890> living

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:46.190 
and things like that than it does living

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.510 
and things like that than it does living
lizards<00:06:46.640> I'm<00:06:46.970> posting<00:06:47.840> the<00:06:47.960> link<00:06:48.110> right<00:06:48.260> now

now<00:06:49.520> this<00:06:49.670> completely<00:06:50.060> supports<00:06:50.510> evolution

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.080 
now this completely supports evolution

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.490 
now this completely supports evolution
as<00:06:51.790> creationism<00:06:52.790> forces<00:06:53.660> you<00:06:53.870> to<00:06:54.260> create

it work with evolution those things are

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:00.660 
it work with evolution those things are

explainable because they're non-existent
we<00:07:01.670> can<00:07:01.850> clearly<00:07:02.090> see<00:07:02.450> the<00:07:03.020> transition<00:07:03.650> from

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:03.830 
we can clearly see the transition from

that intelligent design has been

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:22.370 
falsified as a scientific theory if it

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.070 
falsified as a scientific theory if it
were<00:07:22.520> any<00:07:22.760> other<00:07:23.060> theory<00:07:23.480> people<00:07:23.630> would<00:07:23.900> take

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:26.150 
a look at that and say oh well you know

a look at that and say oh well you know
we<00:07:26.300> think<00:07:26.480> this<00:07:26.720> but<00:07:27.050> all<00:07:27.169> the<00:07:27.290> evidence

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:27.410 
we think this but all the evidence

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.340 
we think this but all the evidence
contradicts<00:07:28.220> it<00:07:28.430> so<00:07:29.000> we're<00:07:29.450> wrong<00:07:29.630> now<00:07:30.169> what

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:30.350 
contradicts it so we're wrong now what

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:31.780 
contradicts it so we're wrong now what
can<00:07:30.470> we<00:07:30.590> do<00:07:30.710> what<00:07:30.860> can<00:07:30.890> we<00:07:31.040> learn<00:07:31.160> from<00:07:31.220> it<00:07:31.550> what

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:31.790 
can we do what can we learn from it what

can we do what can we learn from it what
is<00:07:31.910> the<00:07:32.120> right<00:07:32.270> answer<00:07:32.680> that<00:07:33.680> is<00:07:33.800> what<00:07:33.950> would

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:34.010 
is the right answer that is what would

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:35.290 
is the right answer that is what would
happen<00:07:34.070> if<00:07:34.370> intelligent<00:07:34.820> design<00:07:35.090> were<00:07:35.240> a

happen if intelligent design were a

happen if intelligent design were a

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:37.580 
scientific theory however because it is

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.700 
scientific theory however because it is
not<00:07:37.820> when<00:07:38.120> confronted<00:07:38.570> with<00:07:38.600> these<00:07:38.870> data<00:07:39.169> they

not when confronted with these data they

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.620 
not when confronted with these data they

simply have no reply or they shrug and

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:44.080 
simply have no reply or they shrug and
say<00:07:41.690> well<00:07:42.020> that's<00:07:42.230> the<00:07:42.470> way<00:07:42.620> Jesus<00:07:43.070> did<00:07:43.100> it<00:07:43.400> now

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:44.090
