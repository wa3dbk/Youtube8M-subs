00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.010
 this high voltage generator is there 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.290
 a 5 volt relay will arrive a 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.390
 integrated in 78 05 regulator of 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:25.369
 voltage an electrolytic capacitor 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:28.279
 220 micro do it at 16 times then if yes 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.939
 tin wire will come a car coil 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:34.370
 with its relative links is 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.260
 a pond now and finally it will serve 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.380
 also last thing 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.930
 a source of power enough 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.600
 your circuit will work so there will be 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.300
 a stable is created by the capacitor 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:51.200
 da integrate and the relay that will go to 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.870
 to pilot the portrait of the primary of the 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.060
 Bovine of ignition this for induction 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:00.490
 that the era of electric shocks between 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:06.189
 this thread is central and positive 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:06.189
 will be about 6 thousand 5 thousand volts we will see later 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.780
 when you see it 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.780
 a regulator 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.240
 we see 12 volts the stable should 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:52.569
 work 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.569
 let's see more or less 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:03.580
 we remember the most from this caporosso 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:03.580
 at least at the table and feels that part 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.580
 at 5 times this is needed to lower 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.620
 the tension 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.800
 at this point we must attack one 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.290
 black thread to this pidino here 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.610
 what when in stand by the 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.610
 circuit with this black 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.400
 another thread to this part 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:41.859
 then to have two children in the same film 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.379
 at the same point link we can 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:48.159
 examining the coil in the meantime is a ruin 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:53.290
 of 12 volt ignition cars with the 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:56.349
 common between the positive and that is to the can a 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.930
 thread that the thread of the tension step 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:02.290
 positive step is a given 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.480
 transformer and attention because it comes 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.730
 taken from this connector here that 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.319
 I did it 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.659
 easy 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.389
 when you have two ends of the reel it arrives 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:15.609
 a voltage of 12 volts between this and 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:17.109
 this is a differential of one 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:19.090
 potential difference that triggers 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.210
 a spark that can match 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.699
 even on 5000 3000 volts 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.430
 now we can connect the whole thing first 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:30.099
 what would i say to attack to connect 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.009
 the positive that is the positive of the relay 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:36.940
 with the positive of our bovine lo 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:38.789
 we choose and we give one welded to this 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.960
 point we connect negative of the coil 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:43.240
 with this thread we had some 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.009
 previously done with the 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.960
 link attention year a 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:50.460
 connect it with the power supply 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.599
 of the integrated we see a thread 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.190
 let's remember together 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:55.930
 move on to fix the various components on the 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.940
 our tablets first we put 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:02.789
 the reel according to her washers we go to 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.789
 fasten on the board and pull 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.909
 we tighten with life 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:16.860
 and we do the same job is found 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:20.279
 with hot glue or with the 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:25.369
 warm start that we are on the wood 

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:25.369
 integrated and integrated remolo 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.159
 what are true stops 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:48.400
 at this point it could also be fixed 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:50.470
 some threads that should not not 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:56.710
 they have to touch each other like this 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:59.070
 food to ruin and finally red from 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.070
 urine 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.830
 door 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:20.120
 we are here I have already put some tube 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:22.990
 stop any people to avoid contact 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.990
 short circuits 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:38.539
 in this way we will feed from here and 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.629
 we will take will put the tension 

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:45.289
 positive water or at the entrance of the 

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:48.169
 our integrated one thing you 

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:52.610
 advice is to fix a diode is 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:54.319
 indirectly polarized on the garments 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.900
 of the primary of the cow because 

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:59.360
 could it be that there is 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.669
 a current of return when the house 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:06.979
 the coil is loaded and after 

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:09.130
 then quickly download yours 

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:11.659
 line you will have to put it towards positive 

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:15.280
 this is a small trick that 

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:15.280
 the power supply could save you
