00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.580
 I spoke to rodrigo puntocom civil claims and 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.070
 today I want to focus a little bit here 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.000
 talk on the issue of mass gain 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.220
 muscular 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.109
 I want to show the essential foundations that 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.359
 everyone should know is everybody 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.130
 is interested in a training focused on 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.840
 big but we got clear and trophy 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.849
 muscular right 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.130
 those that are responsible for the 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.620
 of mass of some people and 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.270
 also by stagnation the famous plateau 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.489
 that the people to reach by not 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.780
 respect these same 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.660
 people end up getting lost a little 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.079
 in the details and of the training techniques 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.360
 supplement etc for and end up forgetting 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.149
 of the fundamental foundations that 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.070
 end up really impacting on the outcome 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.610
 when you train to gain mass 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.710
 muscular 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.270
 so let's go there is no if quick video 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.370
 advance in the simple way what really 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.109
 that everyone should know about 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.840
 the gain of muscle mass to really 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:09.600
 get impressive results ok 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.490
 come on come on I'll use this picture is 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.439
 extremely professional, right? 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.460
 writing is totally professional for 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.560
 do not get along 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.820
 there is knowledge here then there 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.610
 first I want to talk about the problem of 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.170
 which the problem is in this environment 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.270
 gain muscle mass as well as 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.689
 weight loss also the problem 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.810
 mainly comes from industry media 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.600
 and related etc internet etc 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.460
 is our around in itself is this industry 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.310
 one of the largest industries in the 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.340
 world the great mass of the industry 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.290
 muscle and also take cognizance of the 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.390
 particular muscle mass gain 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.000
 is dominated by the industries that manufacture 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.740
 supplements to food and 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.030
 and supplements of all kinds 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.710
 for large muscle mass 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.860
 then this industry just kind of 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.210
 dominating all the media in this sense and 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.009
 When we are worried, it is 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.610
 interested in gaining muscle mass that 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.439
 we make ends up grandson trying to find 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.170
 information within our reach 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.690
 namely internet television and magazines 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.489
 That's where the confusion starts there. 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.000
 the confusion begins 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.580
 we see 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.320
 of different techniques promises methods 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.180
 and ends up not getting results that the 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.660
 we want is getting frustrated 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.980
 and also to those who do not continue searching 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.740
 of what we really want or the 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.390
 good shape then another besides that 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.590
 confusion is enough to stop 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.330
 with anyone's dream 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.980
 the other question is the genetics he needs 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.410
 understand that each person has a 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.630
 different genetics and have people 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.150
 think it 's just you see body builders 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.610
 dell bodybuilders in life 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.440
 Borges denies life so these people have 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.489
 a very large genetic prone 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.860
 muscle mass 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.570
 this number of people is very small 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.140
 compared to the total number of 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.880
 people 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.250
 so we end up deluding ourselves by finding 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.170
 that accompanying the training a person 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.489
 snow there the personal and 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.050
 Muscles sold workouts I think 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.370
 bought 30 that the person stays the same 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.350
 it will not look the same 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.900
 the genetic factor then our goal 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.360
 here is the best you can be in. 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.550
 of your genetic abilities ok everything 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.200
 world is able to evolve much in the 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.060
 of large muscle mass 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.790
 within the genetic capabilities of each 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.250
 Ok then this is the sense to understand the 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.810
 genetics of each person 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.220
 the two women, for example only 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.690
 women are very concerned about the 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.430
 I will gain a lot of muscle mass alone. 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.130
 take and protein for example I do not 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.910
 I want to win a lot, but such women 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:33.489
 because of the hormones they will not stay 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.489
 muscles naturally which is a lot 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.320
 difficult for women to gain muscle mass and 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.610
 way calls attention because of the 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.380
 hormonal factors 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.959
 of course there are some exceptions in the 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.950
 world but do not worry about 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.360
 This understood. 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.579
 if you are woman do not worry you 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:52.420
 can train heavy in the gym that you 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:55.150
 will not see too many muscles which 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.989
 you do not like to have for example in 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.090
 followed 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.620
 good all this ends up generating a great 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.310
 confusion no one knows more than 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.799
 to believe 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.049
 so what I call where there is light in 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:08.019
 end of the tunnel in this case would be the science 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:09.549
 science is still bringing us the 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.470
 knowledge and quality results 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.510
 so that's what I prefer to focus on 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.519
 whenever I go to study anything 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.430
 in the area of ​​large muscle mass or 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:20.950
 and even here there is a lot of 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.060
 Doubtful thing then it's kind of difficult 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.710
 really this quality information 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.479
 but I think the best chance we can 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.570
 find something worth even are 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.130
 scientific articles 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.650
 scientific results are published 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.480
 internationally and here is the focus 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.490
 to my knowledge and now let's continue 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:40.760
 so that our idea is that our 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:42.550
 how beauty shows that the equation of 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.890
 muscle mass in the most 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.750
 easy and simple that is what 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.920
 the staff does not pay attention that ends 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.440
 distracted by the techniques 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.580
 best detail skills and type of 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.110
 training etc 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.070
 but that's all you need to give 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.740
 attention to achieve results 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.870
 really efficient and this is what all 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.210
 world succeeds to macular muscle 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.130
 You know then let's go to the first one 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.790
 curiosity in the case of mass gain 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.980
 muscular 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.320
 contrary to what one imagines the body 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.200
 Do not build more fluffy muscle is the 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.180
 body increases the existing fibers it 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.400
 increases the existing queues in diameter 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.630
 then this is a fiber with win 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.030
 the correct exercise in comparison 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.710
 correct the body makes the forward 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.040
 of these fibers then increases giving volume 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:27.170
 your songs there is only one curiosity 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:31.010
 What if you 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:33.860
 essential the body so the body and the 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.660
 is recovery is the following equation 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.330
 through correct exercise in the gym 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:43.040
 at home you generate an anabolic signal 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:47.630
 sent to the body is that signal then 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:48.590
 and the trigger is the anabolic process the 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.470
 day growth of muscle mass 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.780
 during the recovery period which is 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.090
 extremely important because then 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.040
 this is the basic equation 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:02.180
 if you do not have an analog signal 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.950
 correctly there will be no process 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.740
 anabolic heating muscle 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.150
 if you do not recover enough 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.450
 you talk about the growth of 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:13.850
 muscle mass is weak does not exist or 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:16.580
 even you loss of muscle mass 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.920
 why look and also because it seems is 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:22.070
 super common people think a lot 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:24.140
 in this basic question is English has a 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:27.320
 time bringing Portuguese would be the 

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:29.090
 narrow therapeutic window that forms 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.380
 easy as that would be followed analogy 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.910
 aspirin 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.500
 Do you have a headache? 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.480
 aspirin viewer pass 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.700
 now if you have a headache you 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.540
 I think I should take two aspirins 

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.710
 the headache goes faster 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.540
 but in fact this is not what happens 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.220
 No way to hurt 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.780
 and that is exactly what happens here 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.150
 people also think that 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:50.610
 training a lot here 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:53.400
 eventually increasing the chance of 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.720
 gain muscle mass or and have it go 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.130
 talk later 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.070
 but if you do not allow the glass without 

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:00.840
 cooperate the way he or she needs 

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:02.460
 you will not get any results 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.970
 regardless of the effort you'll have 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.500
 on here 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.450
 in fact you will start to walk backwards 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.730
 meaning big muscle mass 

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.860
 Okay, let's go ahead either. 

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:16.500
 show the main variables to be 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:18.000
 of muscle gain that is good 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.890
 coming back here then I'm going to say that 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.540
 three main variables for any 

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:23.790
 have to gain variable muscle mass 

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.380
 of any workout but said a 

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:27.690
 Quick word about the muscular children 

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.370
 is a subject that could take place 

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:31.530
 much more in the body 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:34.620
 basically two types of fibers eh 

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:37.230
 the long and the short as they say so 

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.640
 the short ones are those that give the bad 

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.200
 result of muscle mass gains are 

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.480
 those that really develops more 

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:44.100
 grows ta and long 

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.590
 on the contrary do not develop 

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:50.120
