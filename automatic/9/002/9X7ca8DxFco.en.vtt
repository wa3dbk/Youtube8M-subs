 especially when children play and romp 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.730
 Glass surfaces can break quickly 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:35.790
 on the one hand, beauty care 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.650
 Crashing glass surfaces be dangerous 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.840
 on the other hand, however , are usually distributed 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.670
 many small pieces of glass on a large scale 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.220
 and stay almost invisible

 for example, the carpet back and 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.079
 so can lead to deep cut down

 shatterproof foil from re she is for

 Glass cleaner a kitchen roll one

 spray bottle with water and detergent 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.539
 as well as a ruler a pen and sticky tape 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.170
 a cutter knife and a wheel are the 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:28.929
 Anti-shatter foil when transferring 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.170
 the size of the glass plate or the 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:33.369
 windows on the protective film and 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.830
 cut them with the enclosed one 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.770
 katar so that a small edge 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.209
 survives 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.929
 remove before sticking with 

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:45.610
 Glass cleaner thoroughly dust and dirt

 and take the kitchen paper with you 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.069
 moisture completely on around the 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.780
 protective film on the bottom of the 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:55.119
 shatterproof foil to solve 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.729
 glue two adhesive strips to one 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.899
 corner and pull back 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:03.000
 apart 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:04.929
 they dissolve the protective film off carefully 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.660
 mix the water in the 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:09.670

 a liter will take you about eight 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:16.239
 drip wet with it both the

 foil as well as the glass element 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.340
 so you succeed in a bubble-free assembly 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.770
 and you can do the film if necessary 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.480
 move something

 glass pane on

 and moisten the outside 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:34.889
 so the slides easily over the rules 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.049
 foil and you can change the moisture 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:40.819
 press out of the middle to the edge 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:43.290
 and smooth the foil without bubbles 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.120
 then they cut the protruding ones 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.519
 edges with the help of the hail as 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.799
 spacers and kata reader from 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.829
 do not pay attention to the seals 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.939
 to damage

 remove with the kitchen roll the 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:58.409
 remaining moisture at the edges 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.329
 until the film is completely through 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.310
 is dried and the full later 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.560
 Function can be achieved depending on 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.480
 weather can take up to 14 days 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.669
 at this time the film should not 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.620
 will be charged or cleaned now 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:15.660
 the disc smashed or goes on 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.070
 play to break 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.140
 keeps the protective film all splitter 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.270
 together so that the disc is not out 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.510
 the frame falls or the later 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.740
 distribute on the floor 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.530
 that does not just offer protection 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.900
 cut wounds but even stops 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.330
 windows burglars longer because they 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.460
 hard to penetrate is the 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.820
 transparent protective film can but still 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.950
 more 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.410
 it does not restrict the view and 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.900
 completed an additional 95 percent 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.970
 dangerous uv rays and may even 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.810
 for the rear side windows in the car 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.810
 be used
