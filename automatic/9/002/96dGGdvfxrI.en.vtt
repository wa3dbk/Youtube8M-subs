this<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.430> by<00:00:32.489> far<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.700> largest<00:00:33.059> option<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.809> has

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
this is by far the largest option it has

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.710

a<00:00:34.050> sort<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.590> tunic<00:00:34.890> length<00:00:35.070> um<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:36.000> don't

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
a sort of tunic length um I don't

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.420

actually<00:00:36.900> mind<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.560> length<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.130> the<00:00:38.280> width

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
actually mind the length and the width

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.920 
actually mind the length and the width
of<00:00:38.580> men's<00:00:38.850> jerseys<00:00:39.270> I'm<00:00:39.480> just<00:00:39.660> not<00:00:39.810> crazy

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
of men's jerseys I'm just not crazy

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.500 
of men's jerseys I'm just not crazy
about<00:00:40.490> the<00:00:41.490> width<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.850> sleeve<00:00:42.120> which<00:00:42.390> I

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
about the width of the sleeve which I

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.450 
about the width of the sleeve which I
think<00:00:42.750> gives<00:00:42.900> you<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> little<00:00:43.380> bit<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.620> bagley

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
think gives you a little bit of bagley

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.400 
think gives you a little bit of bagley
feel<00:00:44.700> but<00:00:44.940> some<00:00:45.420> folks<00:00:45.660> really<00:00:45.810> enjoy<00:00:46.200> this

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
feel but some folks really enjoy this

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.370 
feel but some folks really enjoy this
sort<00:00:46.560> of<00:00:46.680> authentic<00:00:47.160> large<00:00:47.460> fit<00:00:48.079> NFL<00:00:49.079> Jersey

sort of authentic large fit NFL Jersey

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.170 
sort of authentic large fit NFL Jersey
so<00:00:49.590> commence<00:00:49.950> small<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.370> definitely<00:00:50.880> an

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
so commence small is definitely an

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.630 
so commence small is definitely an
option<00:00:51.390> for<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:52.160> okay<00:00:53.160> here<00:00:53.340> we<00:00:53.460> have<00:00:53.490> the

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
option for that okay here we have the

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.220 
option for that okay here we have the
women's<00:00:53.970> Jersey<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.450> is<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.690> size<00:00:54.900> small

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
women's Jersey this is the size small

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.770 
women's Jersey this is the size small
and<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.220> can<00:00:56.370> see<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.820> fits<00:00:57.000> quite<00:00:57.180> slim

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
and you can see that it fits quite slim

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.240 
and you can see that it fits quite slim
on<00:00:58.079> its<00:00:58.320> left<00:00:58.500> shoulder<00:00:58.590> from<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.010> monks

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
on its left shoulder from the monks

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.160 
on its left shoulder from the monks
Jersey<00:00:59.579> obviously<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.450> think<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.020> major

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
Jersey obviously I think the major

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.290 
Jersey obviously I think the major
benefit<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.950> the<00:01:02.130> women's<00:01:02.460> jerseys<00:01:02.880> are<00:01:03.090> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
benefit of the women's jerseys are the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.240 
benefit of the women's jerseys are the
sleeves<00:01:03.570> personally<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.559> think<00:01:04.649> that<00:01:04.920> they

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
sleeves personally I think that they

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.550 
sleeves personally I think that they
lose<00:01:05.670> all<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.090> baggy<00:01:06.329> sleeve<00:01:06.720> feel<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.439> can

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
lose all that baggy sleeve feel that can

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.320 
lose all that baggy sleeve feel that can
be<00:01:07.650> sort<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:07.920> distracting<00:01:08.490> on<00:01:08.700> some<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.240> the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
be sort of distracting on some of the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.050 
be sort of distracting on some of the
other<00:01:09.450> Jersey<00:01:09.900> but<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.830> do<00:01:11.159> have<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.430> very<00:01:11.670> slim

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
other Jersey but you do have a very slim

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.180 
other Jersey but you do have a very slim
fitting<00:01:12.390> look<00:01:12.720> I'm<00:01:13.260> not<00:01:13.470> personally<00:01:13.740> sure

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
fitting look I'm not personally sure

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.160 
fitting look I'm not personally sure
that<00:01:14.370> I<00:01:14.430> love<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:14.820> look<00:01:15.120> for<00:01:15.360> jerseys<00:01:15.750> just

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
that I love this look for jerseys just

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.810 
that I love this look for jerseys just
because<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.530> feel<00:01:16.740> like<00:01:16.800> it<00:01:17.310> doesn't<00:01:17.460> look<00:01:17.700> a

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
because I feel like it doesn't look a

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.280 
because I feel like it doesn't look a
lot<00:01:17.970> like<00:01:18.120> a<00:01:18.240> Jersey<00:01:18.570> feels<00:01:18.930> more<00:01:19.080> like<00:01:19.200> a

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
lot like a Jersey feels more like a

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.930 
lot like a Jersey feels more like a
t-shirt<00:01:19.470> but<00:01:20.280> it's<00:01:20.430> definitely<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.909> most

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
t-shirt but it's definitely the most

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.480 
t-shirt but it's definitely the most
flattering<00:01:21.450> option<00:01:21.930> for<00:01:22.080> your<00:01:22.170> shape<00:01:22.440> so<00:01:22.830> it's

flattering option for your shape so it's

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.490 
flattering option for your shape so it's
sort<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:24.000> personal<00:01:24.540> preference<00:01:24.750> but<00:01:25.200> this

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
sort of a personal preference but this

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.510

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.020 
sleeves I personally love this one for
my<00:02:13.320> winter<00:02:13.620> games<00:02:13.920> because<00:02:14.460> you<00:02:14.610> can<00:02:14.760> layer<00:02:14.910> a

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
my winter games because you can layer a

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.060 
my winter games because you can layer a
ton<00:02:15.330> under<00:02:15.660> it<00:02:15.780> so<00:02:16.410> if<00:02:16.620> you're<00:02:16.710> going<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.920> an

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
ton under it so if you're going to an

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.560 
ton under it so if you're going to an
outdoor<00:02:17.250> game<00:02:17.580> in<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.820> middle<00:02:18.030> of<00:02:18.090> December<00:02:18.540> I

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
outdoor game in the middle of December I

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.120 
outdoor game in the middle of December I
think<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:19.110> this<00:02:19.260> is<00:02:19.410> going<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.680> be<00:02:19.800> your<00:02:19.950> best

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
think that this is going to be your best

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.730 
think that this is going to be your best
bet<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:21.210> kids<00:02:21.450> jerseys<00:02:21.810> do<00:02:22.020> come<00:02:22.320> as<00:02:22.530> high<00:02:22.680> as

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
bet the kids jerseys do come as high as

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.850 
bet the kids jerseys do come as high as
an<00:02:22.950> extra-large<00:02:24.020> so<00:02:25.020> you<00:02:25.110> can<00:02:25.350> go<00:02:25.470> up<00:02:25.620> another

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
an extra-large so you can go up another

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.500 
an extra-large so you can go up another
size<00:02:26.130> if<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.460> really<00:02:26.760> want<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.060> layer<00:02:27.210> a<00:02:27.360> lot

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
size if you really want to layer a lot

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.940 
size if you really want to layer a lot
under<00:02:27.720> it<00:02:27.960> but<00:02:28.200> I<00:02:28.230> think<00:02:28.320> that<00:02:28.560> this<00:02:28.740> is<00:02:28.920> a

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
under it but I think that this is a

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.950 
under it but I think that this is a
great<00:02:29.220> Jersey<00:02:29.610> for<00:02:30.300> if<00:02:30.420> you're<00:02:30.600> going<00:02:30.630> to<00:02:30.870> up

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
great Jersey for if you're going to up

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.350 
great Jersey for if you're going to up
working
