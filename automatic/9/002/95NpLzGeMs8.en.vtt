more<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.909> basic<00:01:45.720> corsage<00:01:46.110> would<00:01:46.380> start<00:01:46.590> at<00:01:46.680> 20

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
more a basic corsage would start at 20

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.160 
more a basic corsage would start at 20
on<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.280> basic<00:01:47.640> band<00:01:47.880> but<00:01:48.329> these<00:01:48.630> would<00:01:48.899> run

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
on the basic band but these would run

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.810 
on the basic band but these would run
you<00:01:49.560> know<00:01:49.680> 25<00:01:50.220> 30<00:01:50.250> 35<00:01:51.890> so<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.920> little<00:01:53.280> more<00:01:53.520> but<00:01:53.790> I
