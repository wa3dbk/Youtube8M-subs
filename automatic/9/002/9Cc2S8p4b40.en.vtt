lungs<00:01:12.420> which<00:01:12.780> they<00:01:12.960> do<00:01:13.020> because<00:01:13.619> if<00:01:13.770> it's<00:01:13.890> over

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
lungs which they do because if it's over

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.300 
lungs which they do because if it's over
strenuous<00:01:14.909> it'll<00:01:15.780> make<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.259> lungs<00:01:16.500> weak<00:01:16.890> and

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
strenuous it'll make the lungs weak and

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.340 
strenuous it'll make the lungs weak and
unless<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:18.030> give<00:01:18.360> them<00:01:18.540> something<00:01:18.810> mineral

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
unless you give them something mineral

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.010

to<00:01:22.080> strengthen<00:01:22.290> those<00:01:22.560> lungs<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:24.140> gave<00:01:25.140> the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
to strengthen those lungs so I gave the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.530 
to strengthen those lungs so I gave the
horse<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.740> homeopathics<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.850> think<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.479> a

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
horse the homeopathics I think of a

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.950 
horse the homeopathics I think of a
spongy<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.350> gave<00:01:29.310> him<00:01:29.610> two<00:01:30.090> tablespoons<00:01:30.750> of

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
spongy I I gave him two tablespoons of

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.870 
spongy I I gave him two tablespoons of
cayenne<00:01:31.290> pepper<00:01:31.650> which<00:01:31.799> stops<00:01:32.159> bleeding<00:01:32.520> and

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
cayenne pepper which stops bleeding and

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.100 
cayenne pepper which stops bleeding and
the<00:01:33.119> horse<00:01:33.329> swallowed<00:01:33.810> it

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
the horse swallowed it

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.580 
the horse swallowed it
I<00:01:34.140> also<00:01:35.009> gave<00:01:35.430> him<00:01:35.490> some<00:01:36.090> ester<00:01:36.479> C<00:01:36.750> which<00:01:37.439> he

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
I also gave him some ester C which he

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.130 
I also gave him some ester C which he
gave<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.950> horse<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:39.420> tried<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.840> get<00:01:39.930> him<00:01:40.049> to

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
gave the horse and I tried to get him to

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.319 
gave the horse and I tried to get him to
cut<00:01:40.350> back<00:01:40.560> just<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:40.950> whole<00:01:41.189> oats<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:42.119> get

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
cut back just the whole oats and get

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.010 
cut back just the whole oats and get
half<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.840> no<00:01:43.619> beet<00:01:43.860> pulp<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.399> no<00:01:44.810> corn<00:01:45.810> oil

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
half the no beet pulp and no corn oil

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.539 
half the no beet pulp and no corn oil
because<00:01:46.320> corn<00:01:46.649> oil<00:01:46.979> will<00:01:47.100> block<00:01:47.340> the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
because corn oil will block the

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.230 
because corn oil will block the
absorption<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:48.210> vitamin<00:01:48.630> D<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.229> vitamin<00:01:49.290> K

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
absorption of vitamin D and vitamin K

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.460 
absorption of vitamin D and vitamin K
especially<00:01:51.240> if<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.450> give<00:01:51.600> up<00:01:51.720> half<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.170> cup<00:01:52.350> a

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
especially if you give up half a cup a

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.499 
especially if you give up half a cup a
day<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:53.100> corn<00:01:53.430> oil<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.850> will<00:01:54.000> block<00:01:54.329> the

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
day of corn oil it will block the

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.630 
day of corn oil it will block the
absorption<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:55.649> therefore<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.250> will<00:01:56.369> create

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
absorption so therefore you will create

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.359 
absorption so therefore you will create
a<00:01:56.939> bleeder<00:01:57.299> because<00:01:57.780> vitamin<00:01:57.990> K<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.680> necessary

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
a bleeder because vitamin K is necessary

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.080
