00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.990
 3d printing is one of the most 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.030
 innovative technological 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.840
 developments at the moment is sudden 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.540
 anything possible 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.029
 the printing of food organs and 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.010
 objects but whatever is possible 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.029
 persons in miniature format 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.710
 roll printing 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.420
 and I will try that with the heading your 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.970
 3d puzzle printing email me again 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.750
 shapes from what is 3d printer now 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.279
 actually 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.840
 3d printing is a collective name for 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.540
 different production techniques with 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.040
 each other where you go through with 3d printing 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.379
 stack on top of each other with layers 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.030
 product or model you get back in 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.860
 conventional methods 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.170
 you have that you say when machining 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.539
 techniques so take away material if you 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.219
 a block of iron had limburg ate in then 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.890
 you get machining there 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.910
 bring you later thrown away yes one 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.649
 new I am very curious 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.280
 can take a look at how this process works 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.020
 in his work 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.020
 then they will come very well 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.540
 but here it all happens the 3d 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.600
 how nice is not to print yours 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.760
 3d printing make that suggestion leukemia 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.220
 well then we will scan your jesse okay 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.160
 that they knew that we can do is allowed 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.160
 okay let him get started and geral 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.160
 to sit 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.370
 and from which material does the image turn you 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.680
 made here is printed with with 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.360
 composite had been extended by a powder 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.490
 is becoming 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.800
 actor substances are added and then 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.479
 in this bed it becomes layer by layer 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.880
 built up 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.490
 and how long does it take anything without making 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.390
 Well it's about in this format 3 to 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.950
 7 hours so that goes yes there was a lot of time 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.090
 costs and then after another piece of names 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.400
 to work 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.780
 well i always have it but i think 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.950
 that people just go to another item too 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.310
 and then you see it 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.310
 end result 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.650
 Yes 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.590
 the moment is finally there my 3d 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.430
 particles off so a show is minimal 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.459
 own 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.790
 well planned is to be tomorrow 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:32.900
 then after-treated rianne 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.890
 this is between and why do people want 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.849
 have this now 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.650
 it is, of course, a stay 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.290
 memory and of course it's fun 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.099
 for later it were mostly emotional 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.630
 also 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.980
 grandpa and grandma for the little kids who 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.470
 they might not be able to see every day 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.340
 but you can look into such a world 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:52.340
 so these are the kids education 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.340
 father's day
