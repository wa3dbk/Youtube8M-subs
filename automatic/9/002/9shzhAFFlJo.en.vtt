00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.750
 we are very clear that there were many things 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.230
 positive in the in the game of the day 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.120
 Saturday 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.789
 that is not our roof that 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.740
 undoubtedly we are going to have to continue 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:17.640
 aspiring and looking for more things than 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.470
 that we are pretending but that 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.720
 We know that the end of the tournament in May 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.090
 It's not in January 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.340
 we start with the possibilities that is 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.529
 the start a tournament of a team that 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.750
 is built from the back to the front 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.510
 11 undoubtedly it will be very 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:39.269
 like or it will still be the same 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.269
 We have today and tomorrow 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:46.050
 modifications still we are not going to tell 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.890
 one hundred percent with jaime what if 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:53.519
 adapts is integrated to training 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.350
 normal but from today and the case of 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:57.269
 benedetto who is suspended with the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.030
 we have all thank God 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.859
 but that also has to be when talking 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.100
 of a player you also have to consider 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.689
 those who entered and how they did it and I 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.850
 Corona was a very important player 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.679
 for us the game and how it 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.330
 profile is going to be a very important goal 

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:14.789
 of the semester 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.580
 Greg Arza fulfilled fully entered 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:19.590
 the second time also of the party 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.830
 of America and was one of the causes 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.899
 fundamental to change the party 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.360
 it was also a visitor's party there 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:29.700
 special considerations and then I 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.670
 I do not have spoiled children I'm a man 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.630
 fair with the players and the one who wins 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.340
 the position as a gentleman is granted 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:42.039
 but there is nothing in particular 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.649
 or against someone but a decision 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:47.829
 totally and they are working 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:51.310
 all for being and after putting the 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:53.200
 difficult task to choose one and I think that in 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.110
 defense we choose correctly because it 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.810
 came 0 and that player did not commit 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.240
 No error that influenced against 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.430
 we, on the contrary, were very 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.770
 solvent in his work 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.770
 to a career of whoever comes first 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.740
 and it was the first games ahead 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.170
 but who can reach a happy 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.090
 term in May that we are 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.070
 working for that we are aiming the 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.960
 concachampion too and that does not want 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.210
 say that we are not going to point the 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.950
 championship we have an obligation that 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.740
 that's what those who are going to 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.260
 say this tournament if the other one we're not 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:34.489
 aiming to be able to fight the two tournaments 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:37.879
 the team our first dates have 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.860
 have to be especially cautious because a 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:42.950
 football that gets more excited about the bill 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.079
 loses a demonstration is the first 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.709
 day there are results that do not 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:49.670
 they expected 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:52.340
 I saw the arguments of the 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.500
 specialists that you want chivas not to 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.500
 I was going to score what 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:03.080
 that you are so attached to score 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.030
 and so I can say others more than 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.580
 however the results did not give us 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.140
 that and has a reason to be nobody is going to 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.319
 to say who is more or less is not my 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.329
 should that what I can talk about is that 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.700
 there are some demands that are caused in 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:19.819
 the localÃ­a that if it is not administered well 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.739
 instead of favoring to harm 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.290
 it has always been a strong team 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.549
 Local and that 's not going to stop being so are 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.329
 us what we should arrive is 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:31.099
 quiet loose and with it 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.859
 conviction of always wanting to win 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:35.810
 local we must improve what has been done 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.849
 of visitor 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.260
 they have played us a long time and 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.209
 let's work to win a match 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.980
 of visitor we are in the obligation of 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.019
 get more points from visitors 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.519
 and people have the assurance that this 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.250
 it's going to be a team like it's been shown 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.590
 in the preseason did not lose in the 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.209
 start of the tournament did not lose a team 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.129
 with character a team that deals with 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.080
 play well the ball a team that has 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:00.750
 experienced players who have 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.910
 vision but you know that your growth 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.269
 is gradual and that has no 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.459
 I despair that football is for vigo no 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:11.360
 for fool and they are going to represent 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.360
 worthy to this meeting
