00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.790 

I<00:00:00.120> was<00:00:00.810> just<00:00:00.900> putting<00:00:01.079> about<00:00:01.230> this<00:00:01.530> computer

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
I was just putting about this computer

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.660 
I was just putting about this computer
fund<00:00:02.220> and<00:00:03.259> these<00:00:04.259> funds<00:00:04.589> you<00:00:05.040> tend<00:00:05.580> to<00:00:05.609> think

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
fund and these funds you tend to think

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.220 
fund and these funds you tend to think
of<00:00:05.910> them<00:00:06.000> as<00:00:06.060> just<00:00:06.180> blowing<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.690> straight<00:00:07.020> path

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
of them as just blowing a straight path

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.589 
of them as just blowing a straight path
of<00:00:07.440> ear<00:00:07.620> but<00:00:08.220> in<00:00:08.370> reality<00:00:08.519> it<00:00:09.000> comes<00:00:09.240> out<00:00:09.420> as<00:00:09.510> a

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
of ear but in reality it comes out as a

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.360 
of ear but in reality it comes out as a
spiral<00:00:10.019> vortex<00:00:10.500> of<00:00:10.650> air<00:00:10.800> because<00:00:11.010> of<00:00:11.099> the

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
spiral vortex of air because of the

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.640 
spiral vortex of air because of the
stirring<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.150> blades<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:12.809> this<00:00:13.349> is<00:00:13.469> why

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
stirring of the blades and this is why

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.169 
stirring of the blades and this is why
are<00:00:13.710> in<00:00:13.830> things<00:00:14.070> like<00:00:14.160> silk<00:00:14.549> flames<00:00:14.849> they<00:00:15.030> need

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
are in things like silk flames they need

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.870 
are in things like silk flames they need
baffles<00:00:15.660> in<00:00:15.900> front<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.470> little<00:00:16.859> flat<00:00:17.550> plays

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
baffles in front of it little flat plays

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.330 
baffles in front of it little flat plays
to<00:00:18.720> actually<00:00:19.140> change<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.830> direction<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.250> the

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
to actually change the direction of the

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.620 
to actually change the direction of the
ear<00:00:20.490> appears<00:00:20.970> it's<00:00:21.180> straight<00:00:21.420> because

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
ear appears it's straight because

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.410 
ear appears it's straight because
otherwise<00:00:21.869> with<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.920> silk<00:00:23.189> flames<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.820> the

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
otherwise with the silk flames the the

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.420 
otherwise with the silk flames the the
the<00:00:25.170> silk<00:00:25.380> frames<00:00:25.590> in<00:00:25.740> effect<00:00:26.010> where<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> piece

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
the silk frames in effect where a piece

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.130 
the silk frames in effect where a piece
of<00:00:26.550> silk<00:00:26.820> gets<00:00:27.029> blown<00:00:27.240> about<00:00:27.390> by<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.689> find<00:00:27.990> it

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
of silk gets blown about by the find it

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.040 
of silk gets blown about by the find it
looks<00:00:28.289> like<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> flame<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.300> and<00:00:30.300> those<00:00:30.539> effects

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
looks like a flame and and those effects

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.380 
looks like a flame and and those effects
if<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.710> don't<00:00:32.040> use<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.369> baffles<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:33.059> spoke

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
if you don't use the baffles that spoke

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.690 
if you don't use the baffles that spoke
the<00:00:33.840> silk<00:00:34.110> will<00:00:34.290> just<00:00:34.469> twist<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.160> dust<00:00:35.309> spiral

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
the silk will just twist and dust spiral

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.450 
the silk will just twist and dust spiral
and<00:00:35.910> got<00:00:36.750> me<00:00:36.870> thinking<00:00:37.230> about<00:00:37.290> our<00:00:37.710> other<00:00:38.010> uses

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
and got me thinking about our other uses

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.520 
and got me thinking about our other uses
for<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.719> here's<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.110> couple<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.350> boxes

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
for that so here's a couple of boxes

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.160 
for that so here's a couple of boxes
just<00:00:40.950> random<00:00:41.460> relay<00:00:42.149> boxes<00:00:42.629> Christmas<00:00:43.020> light

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
boxes see we do call them fear lights in

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.750 
boxes see we do call them fear lights in
the<00:00:46.110> UK<00:00:46.969> and<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.899> I'll<00:00:49.110> put<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.500> on<00:00:49.800> there<00:00:50.520> and

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
this on interesting with this phone

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.410 
this on interesting with this phone
starts<00:01:01.890> reliably<00:01:02.430> at<00:01:02.670> just<00:01:02.940> under<00:01:03.030> three

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
starts reliably at just under three

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.760 
starts reliably at just under three
volts<00:01:03.750> which<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.049> pretty<00:01:04.199> good<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:05.360> here's<00:01:06.360> a

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
volts which is pretty good and here's a

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.710 
volts which is pretty good and here's a
candle<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.670> if<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:08.850> put<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.090> candle<00:01:09.420> on<00:01:09.510> top

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
candle and if you put the candle on top

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.320 
candle and if you put the candle on top
of<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.260> I'll<00:01:10.380> turn<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.680> off<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.799> wee<00:01:10.920> bit<00:01:11.330> I'm

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
of it and I'll turn it off a wee bit I'm

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.760 
of it and I'll turn it off a wee bit I'm
not<00:01:12.510> sure<00:01:12.689> if<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.080> point<00:01:13.320> there's

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
not sure if this is the point there's

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.080 
not sure if this is the point there's
suddenly<00:01:13.979> all<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.280> audio<00:01:14.549> will<00:01:14.729> go<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.909> bit

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
suddenly all the audio will go a bit

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.340 
suddenly all the audio will go a bit
weird<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.479> make<00:01:15.659> footage<00:01:15.960> directly

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
weird just to make footage directly

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.370 
weird just to make footage directly
above<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:17.130> made<00:01:17.400> but<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.479> flame<00:01:18.750> actually

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
above it it made but the flame actually

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.899 
above it it made but the flame actually
shows<00:01:20.310> us<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.790> spiral<00:01:21.330> effect<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.780> actually

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
shows us of spiral effect to actually

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.420 
shows us of spiral effect to actually
set<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.939> spin<00:01:24.330> round<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.020> degree<00:01:25.250> but<00:01:26.250> there's

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
set a spin round to a degree but there's

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.160 
set a spin round to a degree but there's
a<00:01:26.490> sort<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.759> random<00:01:27.299> element<00:01:27.600> as<00:01:27.720> well<00:01:27.900> and

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
a sort of random element as well and

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.399 
a sort of random element as well and
when<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:28.920> lift<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.189> up<00:01:29.369> on<00:01:29.810> to<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.840> higher

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
when you lift it up on to a higher

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.109 
when you lift it up on to a higher
platform<00:01:31.770> like<00:01:32.250> see<00:01:32.490> for<00:01:32.670> instance<00:01:32.970> this

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
platform like see for instance this

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.999 
platform like see for instance this
little<00:01:33.180> container<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:34.110> said<00:01:34.350> bring<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.680> candle

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
little container you said bring a candle

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.910 
little container you said bring a candle
even<00:01:35.189> closer<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.640> iPod<00:01:36.500> even<00:01:37.500> quite<00:01:37.890> a

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
even closer to the iPod even quite a

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.770 
even closer to the iPod even quite a
distance<00:01:38.310> in<00:01:38.460> front<00:01:38.640> it's<00:01:38.939> still<00:01:39.180> affected<00:01:39.659> by

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
distance in front it's still affected by

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:47.420 
distance in front it's still affected by
this<00:01:39.840> vortex<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:45.439> it<00:01:46.439> made<00:01:46.950> me<00:01:47.070> think<00:01:47.280> that

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
this vortex and it made me think that

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.100 
this vortex and it made me think that
there<00:01:47.729> must<00:01:47.880> be<00:01:48.000> other<00:01:48.149> uses<00:01:48.450> for<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.780> and

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
there must be other uses for that and

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.490 
there must be other uses for that and
one<00:01:49.770> thing<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.040> came<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.399> mind<00:01:50.549> was<00:01:51.500> these

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
one thing that came to mind was these

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.679 
one thing that came to mind was these
air<00:01:52.829> freshener<00:01:53.340> bottles<00:01:53.670> because<00:01:53.880> if<00:01:54.390> it's<00:01:54.600> a

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
air freshener bottles because if it's a

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.719 
air freshener bottles because if it's a
vortex<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.729> the<00:01:57.799> ear<00:01:58.799> will<00:01:59.040> actually<00:01:59.399> swirl

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
vortex and the ear will actually swirl

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.800 
vortex and the ear will actually swirl
in<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.450> spiral<00:02:00.930> manner<00:02:01.259> then<00:02:02.130> theoretically

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
in in a spiral manner then theoretically

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.139 
in in a spiral manner then theoretically
Roma<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.020> right<00:02:04.320> now<00:02:04.530> I'm<00:02:05.189> getting<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.820> strong

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
Roma and right now I'm getting a strong

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.059 
Roma and right now I'm getting a strong
aroma<00:02:06.390> off<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.170> really<00:02:07.380> does<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.920> air

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
aroma off that it really does it the air

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.619 
aroma off that it really does it the air
isn't<00:02:08.220> just<00:02:08.459> blowing<00:02:08.729> past<00:02:08.940> outside<00:02:09.209> it's

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
isn't just blowing past outside it's

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.450 
isn't just blowing past outside it's
swirling<00:02:09.869> around<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.379> wick<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.860> it's

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
swirling around that wick and it's

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.070 
swirling around that wick and it's
turning<00:02:11.700> their<00:02:11.850> room<00:02:12.000> into<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.360> room<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:12.900> it

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
turning their room into the room and it

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.060 
turning their room into the room and it
made<00:02:13.230> me<00:02:13.320> think<00:02:13.470> that'd<00:02:13.650> be<00:02:13.800> quite<00:02:13.890> an

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
made me think that'd be quite an

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.660 
made me think that'd be quite an
interesting<00:02:14.130> we<00:02:14.820> to<00:02:15.470> maybe<00:02:16.470> have<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.890> Roma

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
interesting we to maybe have a Roma

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.050 
interesting we to maybe have a Roma
diffusion<00:02:18.540> or<00:02:18.780> oil<00:02:19.260> diffusion<00:02:19.860> because<00:02:20.790> I

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
diffusion or oil diffusion because I

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.790 
diffusion or oil diffusion because I
noticed<00:02:21.630> also<00:02:21.810> it<00:02:22.050> doesn't<00:02:22.260> even<00:02:22.440> have<00:02:22.680> to

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
noticed also it doesn't even have to

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.800 
noticed also it doesn't even have to
have<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:22.920> wick<00:02:23.100> if<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.490> use<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.030> bottle<00:02:24.570> of

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
have the wick if you use a bottle of

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.540 
have the wick if you use a bottle of
essential<00:02:25.530> oil<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:25.830> you<00:02:25.980> just<00:02:26.100> leave<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.430> lid

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
essential oil and you just leave the lid

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.730 
essential oil and you just leave the lid
unscrewed<00:02:27.120> there's<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:27.330> wee<00:02:27.450> bit<00:02:27.600> on<00:02:27.810> top<00:02:28.080> and

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
unscrewed there's a wee bit on top and

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.100 
unscrewed there's a wee bit on top and
it<00:02:29.250> will<00:02:29.340> actually<00:02:29.520> carry<00:02:30.030> that<00:02:30.360> aroma<00:02:30.720> off

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
it will actually carry that aroma off

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.780 
it will actually carry that aroma off
that<00:02:31.380> so<00:02:31.920> that's<00:02:32.040> just<00:02:32.160> an<00:02:32.310> interesting

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
that so that's just an interesting

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.850 
that so that's just an interesting
concept<00:02:33.270> as<00:02:33.840> opposed<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.380> heated<00:02:34.650> ones

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
concept as opposed to the heated ones

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.640 
concept as opposed to the heated ones
because<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.570> aroma<00:02:36.990> comes<00:02:37.260> off<00:02:37.440> this<00:02:37.620> a

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
because and the aroma comes off this a

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.800 
because and the aroma comes off this a
lot<00:02:37.860> faster<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:38.550> comes<00:02:39.060> off<00:02:39.240> instantly

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
lot faster it comes off instantly

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.810 
lot faster it comes off instantly
there's<00:02:39.990> no<00:02:40.050> sort<00:02:40.350> of<00:02:40.380> warmup<00:02:41.190> time<00:02:41.220> I'll<00:02:41.640> turn

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
there's no sort of warmup time I'll turn

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.040 
there's no sort of warmup time I'll turn
that<00:02:41.940> off<00:02:42.060> in<00:02:42.240> case<00:02:42.390> it's<00:02:42.630> making<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.930> lot<00:02:42.990> of

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
that off in case it's making a lot of

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.380 
that off in case it's making a lot of
noise<00:02:43.260> in<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.530> fund<00:02:43.770> and<00:02:44.010> that<00:02:44.190> make<00:02:44.430> fun<00:02:44.640> they

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
noise in the fund and that make fun they

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.930 
noise in the fund and that make fun they
have<00:02:45.540> yeah<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.650> spiral<00:02:47.130> vortex<00:02:47.550> it's<00:02:47.790> got

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
have yeah the the spiral vortex it's got

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.870 
have yeah the the spiral vortex it's got
other<00:02:48.120> em<00:02:48.390> it's<00:02:48.900> got<00:02:49.080> other<00:02:49.890> uses<00:02:50.520> it's<00:02:50.700> quite

other em it's got other uses it's quite

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.350
