this<00:00:01.290> little<00:00:01.560> demonstration<00:00:01.829> I'm<00:00:02.310> going<00:00:02.340> to

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
this little demonstration I'm going to

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.220 
this little demonstration I'm going to
show<00:00:02.610> you<00:00:02.639> how<00:00:02.939> to<00:00:03.000> reduce<00:00:03.210> the<00:00:03.629> polygon

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
show you how to reduce the polygon

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.190 
show you how to reduce the polygon
counts<00:00:04.710> we're<00:00:05.490> gonna<00:00:05.580> using<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.480> delete

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
counts we're gonna using the delete

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.410 
counts we're gonna using the delete
loops<00:00:07.560> here<00:00:07.849> and<00:00:09.800> here<00:00:10.800> is<00:00:11.040> active<00:00:11.550> points<00:00:11.969> I'm

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
loops here and here is active points I'm

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.759 
loops here and here is active points I'm
just<00:00:12.660> going<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:12.960> give<00:00:13.170> you<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.320> round<00:00:13.590> off

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
just going to give you a round off

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.650 
just going to give you a round off
number<00:00:14.130> here<00:00:14.309> it's<00:00:14.429> at<00:00:14.580> fifty<00:00:14.880> seven<00:00:15.179> thousand

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
number here it's at fifty seven thousand

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.800 
number here it's at fifty seven thousand
and<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:15.960> want<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.230> reduce<00:00:16.529> this<00:00:17.539> another<00:00:18.539> thing

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
and I want to reduce this another thing

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.029 
and I want to reduce this another thing
is<00:00:19.789> let's<00:00:20.789> pretend<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.420> come<00:00:21.570> from<00:00:21.720> another

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039 
is let's pretend is to come from another

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.099 
is let's pretend is to come from another
imported<00:00:23.039> package<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.820> let's<00:00:24.510> say<00:00:24.720> the

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
imported package and let's say the

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.740 
imported package and let's say the
reconstruct<00:00:25.920> subdivision<00:00:26.430> didn't<00:00:26.640> work<00:00:26.760> or

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
reconstruct subdivision didn't work or

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.800 
reconstruct subdivision didn't work or
maybe<00:00:28.019> say<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:29.099> didn't<00:00:29.429> want<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.810> rekey

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
maybe say I didn't want to rekey

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.810 
maybe say I didn't want to rekey
Ramesh's<00:00:31.410> because<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:31.830> already<00:00:32.250> have<00:00:32.520> edge

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
Ramesh's because I already have edge

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.450 
Ramesh's because I already have edge
flow<00:00:33.469> where<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:34.500> want<00:00:34.770> him<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.040> don't<00:00:35.070> want<00:00:35.399> to

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
flow where I want him I don't want to

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.799 
flow where I want him I don't want to
have<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.760> redo<00:00:36.180> them<00:00:36.360> all

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
have to redo them all

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.920 
have to redo them all
so<00:00:37.290> all<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.469> want<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.920> do<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.399> reduce<00:00:39.390> polygon

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
so all I want to do is reduce polygon

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.380 
so all I want to do is reduce polygon
counts<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:41.010> we're<00:00:41.579> just<00:00:41.610> going<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:41.940> mimic<00:00:42.239> this

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
counts so we're just going to mimic this

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.940 
counts so we're just going to mimic this
like<00:00:42.660> an<00:00:42.809> imported<00:00:43.290> one<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.649> we're<00:00:43.770> just<00:00:43.800> gonna

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
like an imported one so we're just gonna

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.160 
like an imported one so we're just gonna
make<00:00:44.250> plug<00:00:44.879> mystery<00:00:45.270> D<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.660> it's<00:00:45.750> gonna<00:00:45.960> kill

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
make plug mystery D and it's gonna kill

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.209 
make plug mystery D and it's gonna kill
subdivisions<00:00:46.770> levels<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.399> make<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.940> polymesh3d

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
subdivisions levels so make a polymesh3d

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.150 
subdivisions levels so make a polymesh3d
and<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.700> course<00:00:51.000> we're<00:00:51.329> at<00:00:51.449> 57,000<00:00:52.379> points

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
and of course we're at 57,000 points

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.090 
and of course we're at 57,000 points
here<00:00:53.809> alright<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.199> next<00:00:55.230> step<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.860> we're

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
here alright the next step is we're

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.049 
here alright the next step is we're
gonna<00:00:56.190> need<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.489> have<00:00:56.610> some<00:00:56.850> kind<00:00:56.969> of

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
gonna need to have some kind of

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.330 
gonna need to have some kind of
subdivision<00:00:57.600> levels<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.260> we<00:00:58.289> can<00:00:58.680> activate

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
subdivision levels so we can activate

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.160 
subdivision levels so we can activate
the<00:00:59.520> free<00:00:59.730> subdivision<00:01:00.300> level<00:01:00.570> I'm<00:01:00.960> going<00:01:01.109> to

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
the free subdivision level I'm going to

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.599 
the free subdivision level I'm going to
turn<00:01:01.289> off<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.559> smooth<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.160> we<00:01:02.190> can<00:01:02.460> maintain

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
turn off the smooth so we can maintain

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.570 
turn off the smooth so we can maintain
our<00:01:03.000> overall<00:01:03.600> detail<00:01:04.280> and<00:01:05.280> we're<00:01:05.489> gonna

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
our overall detail and we're gonna

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
our overall detail and we're gonna
divide<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.210> then<00:01:07.110> we<00:01:08.010> can<00:01:08.250> freeze<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:08.760> this

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
divide this then we can freeze this this

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.600 
divide this then we can freeze this this
will<00:01:09.840> allow<00:01:10.049> us<00:01:10.080> reproject<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.070> back<00:01:11.369> later

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
will allow us reproject it back later

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.830 
will allow us reproject it back later
when<00:01:12.030> we<00:01:12.150> unfreeze<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:13.729> areas<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:14.909> we<00:01:15.659> need

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
when we unfreeze this areas that we need

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.140 
when we unfreeze this areas that we need
to<00:01:15.930> do<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.920> make<00:01:17.250> sure<00:01:17.280> when<00:01:17.700> we<00:01:17.820> delete<00:01:18.090> a

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
to do is to make sure when we delete a

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.780 
to do is to make sure when we delete a
loop<00:01:18.390> we<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:18.930> protect<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.650> alright<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:20.759> I

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
loop we just protect it alright so I

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.380 
loop we just protect it alright so I
don't<00:01:21.240> want<00:01:21.450> any<00:01:21.840> loops<00:01:22.850> deleted<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:24.000> this

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
don't want any loops deleted in this

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.340 
don't want any loops deleted in this
area<00:01:24.810> here

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:36.640

around the ears and nothing the one of

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.580 
around the ears and nothing the one of
the<00:01:36.740> important<00:01:37.160> things<00:01:37.370> is<00:01:38.080> down<00:01:39.080> here<00:01:39.380> at<00:01:39.470> the

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
the important things is down here at the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.380 
the important things is down here at the
bottom<00:01:40.010> here<00:01:40.280> where<00:01:40.580> it's<00:01:40.670> opened<00:01:41.150> and<00:01:41.240> home

bottom here where it's opened and home
right<00:01:41.600> here<00:01:41.810> we<00:01:42.590> want<00:01:42.770> to<00:01:42.830> protect<00:01:42.980> that

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
right here we want to protect that

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.740 
right here we want to protect that
because<00:01:43.580> I'm<00:01:43.640> going<00:01:43.730> to<00:01:43.790> use<00:01:43.910> some<00:01:44.060> polish<00:01:44.510> and

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
because I'm going to use some polish and

because I'm going to use some polish and
if<00:01:45.110> I<00:01:45.350> don't<00:01:45.740> protect<00:01:46.130> it<00:01:46.310> it's<00:01:46.460> going<00:01:46.610> to

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
if I don't protect it it's going to

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.510 
if I don't protect it it's going to
shrink<00:01:46.970> it<00:01:47.090> up<00:01:47.240> and<00:01:48.110> it<00:01:48.800> might<00:01:48.980> not<00:01:49.010> project

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
shrink it up and it might not project

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.760 
shrink it up and it might not project
right<00:01:49.670> I'm<00:01:49.850> gonna<00:01:50.000> let<00:01:50.780> a<00:01:50.810> mass<00:01:51.050> one<00:01:51.350> control

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
right I'm gonna let a mass one control

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.580 
right I'm gonna let a mass one control
click<00:01:55.240> then<00:01:56.240> our<00:01:56.360> next<00:01:56.600> step<00:01:56.750> is<00:01:57.110> we're<00:01:57.530> gonna

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
click then our next step is we're gonna

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.260 
click then our next step is we're gonna
come<00:01:57.920> down<00:01:58.100> here<00:01:58.460> and<00:01:58.640> we're<00:01:58.820> going<00:01:58.850> to<00:01:59.000> delete

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
come down here and we're going to delete

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.150 
come down here and we're going to delete
loops<00:01:59.570> got<00:01:59.930> the<00:02:00.050> angle<00:02:00.440> slider<00:02:00.710> some<00:02:01.010> other

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
loops got the angle slider some other

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.490 
loops got the angle slider some other
things<00:02:01.820> you<00:02:01.910> can<00:02:02.000> mess<00:02:02.180> with<00:02:02.210> well<00:02:03.080> I'm<00:02:03.350> gonna

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.530 
things you can mess with well I'm gonna
crank<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:03.830> angle<00:02:04.160> up<00:02:04.310> all<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:04.850> way<00:02:04.940> up<00:02:04.970> and

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
crank the angle up all the way up and

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.109 
crank the angle up all the way up and
remember<00:02:06.080> at<00:02:06.220> 57,000<00:02:07.220> then<00:02:07.700> I'm<00:02:07.910> going<00:02:08.090> to

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
remember at 57,000 then I'm going to

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.420 
remember at 57,000 then I'm going to
delete<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.660> loop

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.270 

and<00:02:11.579> it<00:02:12.510> knocked<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:12.930> down<00:02:12.989> over<00:02:13.260> 7,000<00:02:14.099> you

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
and it knocked it down over 7,000 you

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.979 
and it knocked it down over 7,000 you
can<00:02:14.459> mess<00:02:14.640> with<00:02:14.670> this<00:02:14.939> and<00:02:15.209> do<00:02:15.629> whatever<00:02:15.780> you

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
can mess with this and do whatever you

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.720 
can mess with this and do whatever you
want<00:02:18.079> now<00:02:19.079> as<00:02:19.409> you<00:02:19.590> can<00:02:19.709> see<00:02:19.769> here<00:02:20.310> down<00:02:20.519> to<00:02:20.579> the

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
want now as you can see here down to the

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.039 
want now as you can see here down to the
neck<00:02:20.909> area<00:02:20.939> where<00:02:21.299> just<00:02:21.450> leaves<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.810> lot<00:02:22.019> of

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
neck area where just leaves a lot of

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.410 
neck area where just leaves a lot of
loops<00:02:22.290> well<00:02:22.650> that's<00:02:23.099> good<00:02:23.459> but<00:02:23.849> I'm<00:02:24.090> not<00:02:24.150> going

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
loops well that's good but I'm not going

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.729 
loops well that's good but I'm not going
to<00:02:24.450> be<00:02:24.569> able<00:02:24.629> to<00:02:24.719> put<00:02:24.870> any<00:02:25.019> more<00:02:25.170> detail<00:02:25.530> back

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
to be able to put any more detail back

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.559 
to be able to put any more detail back
massara<00:02:26.159> because<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:26.760> polygons<00:02:27.239> are<00:02:27.390> not

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
massara because the polygons are not

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.339 
massara because the polygons are not
evenly<00:02:27.900> distributed<00:02:28.500> square<00:02:29.000> so<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.540> fix<00:02:30.750> that

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
evenly distributed square so to fix that

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.520 
evenly distributed square so to fix that
we're<00:02:32.250> gonna<00:02:32.340> go<00:02:32.549> down<00:02:32.939> here<00:02:32.969> deformation<00:02:33.959> and

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
we're gonna go down here deformation and

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.899 
we're gonna go down here deformation and
we<00:02:34.829> can<00:02:34.950> mess<00:02:35.099> with<00:02:35.159> some<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.459> these<00:02:35.519> sliders

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
we can mess with some of these sliders

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.000 
we can mess with some of these sliders
you<00:02:36.420> can<00:02:37.049> experiment<00:02:37.319> with<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:37.680> but<00:02:37.829> I'm<00:02:37.920> just

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
you can experiment with it but I'm just

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.319 
you can experiment with it but I'm just
going<00:02:38.159> to<00:02:38.280> use<00:02:38.370> a<00:02:38.400> Polish<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:38.790> couple<00:02:39.090> of<00:02:39.150> times

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
going to use a Polish a couple of times

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.289 
going to use a Polish a couple of times
and<00:02:40.400> give<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.459> second<00:02:41.760> and<00:02:41.879> you<00:02:41.939> can<00:02:41.969> see<00:02:42.090> it

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
and give a second and you can see it

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.229 
and give a second and you can see it
kind<00:02:42.629> of<00:02:42.719> bunch<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:43.019> up<00:02:43.730> I'm<00:02:44.730> going<00:02:44.849> to<00:02:44.939> control

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
kind of bunch it up I'm going to control

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.599 
kind of bunch it up I'm going to control
Z<00:02:45.269> this<00:02:45.599> back<00:02:45.989> a<00:02:46.019> couple<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:46.349> times<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:47.099> you

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
Z this back a couple of times and you

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:51.490 
Z this back a couple of times and you
can<00:02:47.730> see<00:02:47.939> right<00:02:48.120> here<00:02:48.359> in<00:02:48.450> this<00:02:48.540> header<00:02:48.750> area

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.349 

where<00:02:52.500> we're<00:02:52.680> getting<00:02:52.829> this<00:02:53.209> bunched<00:02:54.209> up

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
where we're getting this bunched up

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.509 
where we're getting this bunched up
these<00:02:55.139> two<00:02:55.500> edges<00:02:55.859> that<00:02:55.889> are<00:02:56.040> getting<00:02:56.370> bunched

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
these two edges that are getting bunched

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.659 
these two edges that are getting bunched
up<00:02:56.760> together<00:02:56.879> here<00:02:58.010> all<00:02:59.010> right<00:02:59.159> that's<00:02:59.459> what

00:02:59.659 --> 00:02:59.669 
up together here all right that's what

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:02.059 
up together here all right that's what
happens<00:02:59.700> when<00:03:00.299> I<00:03:00.329> polished<00:03:01.109> it<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.560> using<00:03:02.040> the

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
happens when I polished it and using the

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.270 
happens when I polished it and using the
delete<00:03:02.700> loop<00:03:03.260> this<00:03:04.260> will<00:03:04.469> be<00:03:04.560> all<00:03:04.680> fixed<00:03:05.099> and

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
delete loop this will be all fixed and

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.979 
delete loop this will be all fixed and
you<00:03:05.370> can<00:03:05.400> see<00:03:05.639> around<00:03:05.879> the<00:03:06.150> face<00:03:06.389> area<00:03:06.629> they

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
you can see around the face area they

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.780 
you can see around the face area they
got<00:03:07.139> two<00:03:07.439> edges<00:03:07.709> of<00:03:07.829> real<00:03:07.980> close<00:03:08.189> and<00:03:08.549> I<00:03:08.639> want

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
got two edges of real close and I want

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.990 
got two edges of real close and I want
to<00:03:08.939> come<00:03:09.060> even<00:03:09.359> them<00:03:09.510> out<00:03:09.859> so<00:03:10.859> my<00:03:11.310> next<00:03:11.519> step<00:03:11.639> is

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
to come even them out so my next step is

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.119 
to come even them out so my next step is
to<00:03:12.299> come<00:03:12.450> down<00:03:12.629> or<00:03:13.019> up<00:03:13.290> here<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.739> unfreeze

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
to come down or up here and unfreeze

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.640 
to come down or up here and unfreeze
this<00:03:14.370> now<00:03:15.120> when<00:03:15.510> I<00:03:15.540> unfreeze<00:03:15.959> this<00:03:16.169> there

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
this now when I unfreeze this there

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.809 
this now when I unfreeze this there
might<00:03:16.889> be<00:03:16.919> a<00:03:17.069> problem<00:03:17.280> I'm<00:03:17.519> going<00:03:17.609> to<00:03:17.699> show<00:03:17.760> you

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
might be a problem I'm going to show you

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.069 
might be a problem I'm going to show you
how<00:03:17.909> to<00:03:17.970> fix<00:03:18.150> that<00:03:18.269> so<00:03:18.540> we're<00:03:18.659> going<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:18.840> freeze

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
how to fix that so we're going to freeze

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:23.449 
how to fix that so we're going to freeze
it<00:03:21.139> and<00:03:22.139> you<00:03:22.199> can<00:03:22.829> see<00:03:22.979> where<00:03:23.190> it's<00:03:23.310> not

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
it and you can see where it's not

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.129 
it and you can see where it's not
projected<00:03:24.000> when<00:03:24.120> I<00:03:24.150> unfreeze<00:03:24.599> it<00:03:24.810> so<00:03:24.989> we're

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
projected when I unfreeze it so we're

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:28.969 
projected when I unfreeze it so we're
control<00:03:25.530> Z<00:03:25.769> this<00:03:26.419> go<00:03:27.419> to<00:03:27.479> sub<00:03:27.750> tool<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.650> we<00:03:28.829> got

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:28.979 
control Z this go to sub tool and we got

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:30.530 
control Z this go to sub tool and we got
the<00:03:29.129> distant<00:03:29.549> slider<00:03:29.790> we're<00:03:30.060> gonna<00:03:30.150> crank<00:03:30.449> it

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
the distant slider we're gonna crank it

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.089 
the distant slider we're gonna crank it
up<00:03:30.629> a<00:03:30.720> little<00:03:30.900> bit<00:03:31.079> not<00:03:31.290> full<00:03:31.530> blast

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
up a little bit not full blast

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:33.830 
up a little bit not full blast
you<00:03:32.280> got<00:03:32.430> to<00:03:32.519> experiment<00:03:32.849> with<00:03:33.060> this<00:03:33.209> so<00:03:33.569> we're

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
you got to experiment with this so we're

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.530 
you got to experiment with this so we're
gonna<00:03:33.900> ball<00:03:34.139> right<00:03:34.290> here<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:36.150> we're<00:03:36.479> gonna

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
gonna ball right here and we're gonna

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.300 
gonna ball right here and we're gonna
unfreeze<00:03:36.900> this<00:03:37.199> and<00:03:37.409> make<00:03:37.560> sure<00:03:37.590> it<00:03:37.859> projects

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
unfreeze this and make sure it projects

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.119 
unfreeze this and make sure it projects
back<00:03:38.459> right<00:03:41.810> okay<00:03:42.810> everything<00:03:43.620> looks<00:03:43.919> good

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
back right okay everything looks good

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.110 
back right okay everything looks good
the<00:03:44.430> bottom<00:03:44.729> didn't<00:03:45.000> shrink<00:03:45.180> up<00:03:45.449> and<00:03:47.120> I'm

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
the bottom didn't shrink up and I'm

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.909 
the bottom didn't shrink up and I'm

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:58.420 
up in the face area we got these edges I
will<00:03:55.409> turn<00:03:55.769> the<00:03:56.340> subdivision<00:03:56.879> down<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.180> one

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
will turn the subdivision down to one

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.300 
will turn the subdivision down to one
and<00:03:58.579> up<00:03:59.510> by<00:03:59.720> the<00:03:59.750> face<00:04:00.019> right<00:04:00.260> here<00:04:00.530> and<00:04:00.739> back

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
and up by the face right here and back

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.979 
and up by the face right here and back
by<00:04:01.549> the<00:04:01.610> back<00:04:01.849> of<00:04:01.879> the<00:04:02.030> hip<00:04:02.180> they're<00:04:02.689> bunched

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
by the back of the hip they're bunched

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.289 
by the back of the hip they're bunched
up<00:04:03.140> so<00:04:03.379> I'll<00:04:04.220> fix<00:04:04.459> that<00:04:04.670> we're<00:04:04.909> gonna<00:04:05.000> press

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
up so I'll fix that we're gonna press

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.009 
up so I'll fix that we're gonna press
the<00:04:05.480> cage<00:04:06.159> and<00:04:07.159> turn<00:04:08.060> the<00:04:08.180> cage<00:04:08.329> back<00:04:08.540> off

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
the cage and turn the cage back off

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.460 
the cage and turn the cage back off
and<00:04:10.010> the<00:04:11.000> magic<00:04:11.329> is<00:04:11.480> we're<00:04:11.750> gonna<00:04:11.870> turn<00:04:12.260> it<00:04:12.379> up

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
and the magic is we're gonna turn it up

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.779 
and the magic is we're gonna turn it up
to<00:04:12.530> number<00:04:12.769> two<00:04:12.950> and<00:04:13.510> now<00:04:14.510> they<00:04:14.750> just<00:04:14.959> appeared

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:15.789 
to number two and now they just appeared

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:18.460 
to number two and now they just appeared
disappeared<00:04:16.789> and<00:04:17.479> move<00:04:17.780> it<00:04:17.870> back<00:04:18.019> down<00:04:18.049> to<00:04:18.320> one

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
disappeared and move it back down to one

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:25.029 
disappeared and move it back down to one
now<00:04:18.949> they're<00:04:19.190> not<00:04:19.340> bunched<00:04:19.669> up<00:04:19.789> anymore<00:04:24.039> so

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
now they're not bunched up anymore so

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:27.909 
now they're not bunched up anymore so
Polly<00:04:25.490> frames<00:04:25.910> and<00:04:26.410> that's<00:04:27.410> how<00:04:27.560> you<00:04:27.620> can

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
Polly frames and that's how you can

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.529 
Polly frames and that's how you can
reduce<00:04:28.220> the<00:04:28.490> polygon<00:04:29.060> counts<00:04:29.449> so<00:04:31.180> we<00:04:32.180> is<00:04:32.330> that

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539 
reduce the polygon counts so we is that

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:35.650 
reduce the polygon counts so we is that
we<00:04:33.169> knocked<00:04:33.410> off<00:04:33.590> almost<00:04:34.030> 7,000<00:04:35.030> polygons

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
we knocked off almost 7,000 polygons

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.450 
we knocked off almost 7,000 polygons
from<00:04:35.840> the<00:04:35.990> original<00:04:36.380> one<00:04:39.280> there's<00:04:40.280> the

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
from the original one there's the

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.020 
from the original one there's the
original<00:04:40.520> one<00:04:41.260> 57,000<00:04:42.260> and<00:04:42.590> the<00:04:43.400> new<00:04:43.550> one<00:04:43.699> here

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
original one 57,000 and the new one here

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.120 
original one 57,000 and the new one here
a<00:04:44.180> little<00:04:45.020> different<00:04:45.590> right<00:04:45.740> here<00:04:45.979> in<00:04:46.039> the

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
a little different right here in the

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.430 
a little different right here in the
neck<00:04:46.340> area<00:04:46.370> when<00:04:46.820> I<00:04:46.850> change<00:04:47.210> it<00:04:47.389> but<00:04:47.570> it<00:04:48.229> did

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
neck area when I change it but it did

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.490 
neck area when I change it but it did
reduce<00:04:48.800> a<00:04:48.949> lot<00:04:49.039> of<00:04:49.100> polygons<00:04:49.520> i<00:04:50.320> pause<00:04:51.320> the

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
reduce a lot of polygons i pause the

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.620 
reduce a lot of polygons i pause the
video<00:04:51.800> and<00:04:52.099> I'm<00:04:52.370> doing<00:04:52.550> a<00:04:52.639> little<00:04:52.849> recap<00:04:53.270> here

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
video and I'm doing a little recap here

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.879 
video and I'm doing a little recap here
I'm<00:04:53.780> gonna<00:04:53.960> do<00:04:54.050> something<00:04:54.380> a<00:04:54.440> little<00:04:54.650> bit

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
I'm gonna do something a little bit

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.820 
I'm gonna do something a little bit
different<00:04:55.250> so<00:04:55.960> this<00:04:56.960> time<00:04:57.169> I'm<00:04:57.440> just<00:04:57.590> gonna

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
different so this time I'm just gonna

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.650 
different so this time I'm just gonna
protect<00:04:58.759> her<00:04:58.910> that<00:04:59.060> I<00:04:59.210> know<00:04:59.389> it's<00:04:59.509> gonna

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
protect her that I know it's gonna

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.749 
protect her that I know it's gonna
shrink<00:04:59.990> up<00:05:00.349> so<00:05:00.740> that's<00:05:00.949> gonna<00:05:01.099> be<00:05:01.160> this<00:05:01.400> bottom

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759 
shrink up so that's gonna be this bottom

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:03.850 
shrink up so that's gonna be this bottom
half<00:05:01.910> before<00:05:02.240> I<00:05:02.419> do<00:05:02.479> that<00:05:02.810> we're<00:05:03.080> gonna<00:05:03.199> turn

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
half before I do that we're gonna turn

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.640 
half before I do that we're gonna turn
off<00:05:03.979> the<00:05:04.010> smooth<00:05:04.310> divide<00:05:05.060> it<00:05:05.300> then<00:05:05.930> freeze<00:05:06.440> it

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
off the smooth divide it then freeze it

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.980 
off the smooth divide it then freeze it
and<00:05:07.400> I'm<00:05:07.580> just<00:05:07.940> gonna<00:05:08.120> protect<00:05:08.630> this<00:05:08.780> area

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
and I'm just gonna protect this area

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.730 
and I'm just gonna protect this area
here<00:05:09.560> and<00:05:09.880> I'm<00:05:10.880> gonna<00:05:11.000> blur<00:05:11.270> it<00:05:11.470> then<00:05:12.470> I'm

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
here and I'm gonna blur it then I'm

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.620 
here and I'm gonna blur it then I'm
gonna<00:05:12.860> come<00:05:13.099> down<00:05:13.130> here<00:05:13.820> to<00:05:14.030> the<00:05:14.120> delete<00:05:14.389> loop

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
gonna come down here to the delete loop

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.089 
gonna come down here to the delete loop
and<00:05:14.870> I'm<00:05:14.960> not<00:05:15.139> gonna<00:05:15.260> crank<00:05:15.590> it<00:05:15.740> up<00:05:15.889> I<00:05:16.039> don't

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
and I'm not gonna crank it up I don't

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:18.879 
and I'm not gonna crank it up I don't
want<00:05:16.310> a<00:05:16.370> bunch<00:05:16.490> of<00:05:16.760> loops<00:05:17.330> deleted<00:05:17.889> another

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889 
want a bunch of loops deleted another

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:22.659 
want a bunch of loops deleted another
thing<00:05:19.039> is<00:05:20.860> depending<00:05:21.860> not<00:05:21.979> much<00:05:22.130> masky<00:05:22.610> on

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
thing is depending not much masky on

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:24.430 
thing is depending not much masky on
there<00:05:22.880> it<00:05:23.240> depends<00:05:23.539> how<00:05:23.659> many<00:05:23.720> loops<00:05:24.080> it's

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
there it depends how many loops it's

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.960 
there it depends how many loops it's
going<00:05:24.650> to<00:05:24.710> delete<00:05:24.949> so<00:05:25.280> I'm<00:05:25.430> not<00:05:25.580> gonna<00:05:25.729> crack

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
going to delete so I'm not gonna crack

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.790 
going to delete so I'm not gonna crack
it<00:05:26.120> up<00:05:26.240> I'm<00:05:26.419> just<00:05:26.449> gonna<00:05:26.690> press<00:05:27.260> delete<00:05:27.620> loop

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
it up I'm just gonna press delete loop

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.399 
it up I'm just gonna press delete loop
and<00:05:28.039> before<00:05:28.190> I<00:05:28.220> do<00:05:28.430> that<00:05:28.460> we're<00:05:28.760> at<00:05:28.849> 57,000<00:05:29.840> and

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:30.409 
and before I do that we're at 57,000 and

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:34.180 
and before I do that we're at 57,000 and
we're<00:05:31.370> delete<00:05:31.639> loops<00:05:31.880> now<00:05:32.539> I'm<00:05:32.720> at<00:05:33.190> 16,000

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
we're delete loops now I'm at 16,000

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.390 
we're delete loops now I'm at 16,000
okay<00:05:35.030> and<00:05:35.330> still<00:05:36.139> get<00:05:36.260> a<00:05:36.289> little<00:05:36.500> bit<00:05:36.650> of<00:05:36.889> a<00:05:36.919> lot

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
okay and still get a little bit of a lot

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.250 
okay and still get a little bit of a lot
of<00:05:37.490> polygons<00:05:37.880> in<00:05:38.030> this<00:05:38.150> area<00:05:38.389> but<00:05:38.990> it<00:05:39.110> did

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
of polygons in this area but it did

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.540 
of polygons in this area but it did
remove<00:05:39.650> quite<00:05:39.919> a<00:05:39.949> bit<00:05:40.270> and<00:05:42.310> we're<00:05:43.310> gonna<00:05:43.400> go

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
remove quite a bit and we're gonna go

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.460 
remove quite a bit and we're gonna go
this<00:05:43.699> polish<00:05:44.120> be<00:05:44.419> very<00:05:44.659> careful<00:05:45.110> not<00:05:45.229> to<00:05:45.289> do

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470 
this polish be very careful not to do

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:46.890 
this polish be very careful not to do
too<00:05:45.620> much

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
too much

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.240 
too much
and<00:05:48.180> another<00:05:49.180> thing<00:05:49.420> is<00:05:49.660> I<00:05:49.900> already<00:05:49.990> know<00:05:50.290> to

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
and another thing is I already know to

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.970 
and another thing is I already know to
kick<00:05:51.460> up<00:05:51.640> the<00:05:51.760> distance<00:05:52.180> slider<00:05:52.420> here<00:05:52.900> so<00:05:53.860> I'm

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:53.980 
kick up the distance slider here so I'm

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.740 
kick up the distance slider here so I'm
just<00:05:54.160> gonna<00:05:54.280> jump<00:05:54.370> up<00:05:54.760> here<00:05:55.000> to<00:05:55.570> make<00:05:55.720> sure

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
just gonna jump up here to make sure

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.380 
just gonna jump up here to make sure
projects<00:05:56.620> back<00:05:56.830> right<00:05:57.150> then<00:05:58.150> I'm<00:05:58.270> gonna

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.390 
projects back right then I'm gonna

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
projects back right then I'm gonna
unfreeze<00:05:58.780> this<00:05:59.080> here<00:06:03.390> and<00:06:04.390> I'm<00:06:05.020> gonna<00:06:05.200> bring

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.410 
unfreeze this here and I'm gonna bring

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.960 
unfreeze this here and I'm gonna bring
it<00:06:05.560> to<00:06:06.490> the<00:06:06.610> mass<00:06:06.850> and<00:06:07.210> if<00:06:07.600> we<00:06:07.690> look<00:06:07.870> by<00:06:08.080> the<00:06:08.970> sum

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:09.970 
it to the mass and if we look by the sum

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.030 
it to the mass and if we look by the sum
of<00:06:10.000> these<00:06:10.270> edges<00:06:10.660> how<00:06:10.810> they<00:06:10.990> are<00:06:11.170> all<00:06:11.680> bunched

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:12.040 
of these edges how they are all bunched

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.770 
of these edges how they are all bunched
up<00:06:12.280> with<00:06:12.640> a<00:06:12.700> saber<00:06:12.940> war<00:06:13.120> from<00:06:13.240> the<00:06:13.270> mouth<00:06:13.480> set

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780 
up with a saber war from the mouth set

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.300 
up with a saber war from the mouth set
and<00:06:14.080> it<00:06:14.350> goes<00:06:14.470> to<00:06:14.620> all<00:06:14.770> the<00:06:14.860> way<00:06:14.950> up<00:06:15.100> by<00:06:15.250> the

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 
and it goes to all the way up by the

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.900 
and it goes to all the way up by the
ears<00:06:15.550> I<00:06:15.760> got<00:06:15.910> two<00:06:16.150> sets<00:06:16.360> of<00:06:16.510> these<00:06:16.690> will<00:06:17.590> help

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:17.910 
ears I got two sets of these will help

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.460 
ears I got two sets of these will help
I'm<00:06:18.910> going<00:06:19.060> to<00:06:19.150> move<00:06:19.270> it<00:06:19.360> down<00:06:19.540> here<00:06:19.570> and

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470 
I'm going to move it down here and

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:21.750 
I'm going to move it down here and
sometimes<00:06:20.860> you<00:06:20.980> can<00:06:21.100> just<00:06:21.250> move<00:06:21.370> the<00:06:21.490> slider

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760 
sometimes you can just move the slider

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.340 
sometimes you can just move the slider
and<00:06:21.910> I'll<00:06:22.030> fix<00:06:22.240> it<00:06:22.330> well<00:06:22.510> it<00:06:22.810> didn't<00:06:23.050> fix<00:06:23.200> it

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:23.350 
and I'll fix it well it didn't fix it

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:24.540 
and I'll fix it well it didn't fix it
this<00:06:23.410> time<00:06:23.650> so<00:06:23.800> I'm<00:06:23.860> gonna<00:06:23.980> turn<00:06:24.250> it<00:06:24.370> back<00:06:24.400> to

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.550 
this time so I'm gonna turn it back to

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.850 
this time so I'm gonna turn it back to
one<00:06:24.790> I'm<00:06:25.210> gonna<00:06:25.330> press<00:06:25.510> the<00:06:25.630> cage<00:06:25.810> turn<00:06:26.710> the

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
one I'm gonna press the cage turn the

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.130 
one I'm gonna press the cage turn the
cage<00:06:27.010> back<00:06:27.280> off<00:06:27.690> then<00:06:28.690> I'm<00:06:28.810> gonna<00:06:28.900> move<00:06:29.050> the

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.140 
cage back off then I'm gonna move the

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.200 
cage back off then I'm gonna move the
slider<00:06:29.410> to<00:06:29.500> two<00:06:29.860> then<00:06:30.520> back<00:06:30.760> to<00:06:30.910> one<00:06:31.030> to

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
slider to two then back to one to

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.240 
slider to two then back to one to
double-check<00:06:31.510> that<00:06:31.720> and<00:06:32.290> you<00:06:32.830> can<00:06:32.950> see<00:06:33.100> it's

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.250 
double-check that and you can see it's

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:34.950 
double-check that and you can see it's
no<00:06:33.520> longer<00:06:33.580> bunched<00:06:34.150> up<00:06:34.300> going<00:06:34.570> up<00:06:34.630> towards

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 
no longer bunched up going up towards

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.320 
no longer bunched up going up towards
the<00:06:35.080> ear<00:06:36.990> and<00:06:37.990> we<00:06:38.710> reduced<00:06:39.190> this<00:06:39.340> a<00:06:39.550> lot<00:06:39.910> you

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
the ear and we reduced this a lot you

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.250 
the ear and we reduced this a lot you
know<00:06:40.660> from<00:06:40.870> 57,000<00:06:41.800> down<00:06:41.980> to<00:06:42.960> 16,000<00:06:43.960> are<00:06:44.080> a

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:44.260 
know from 57,000 down to 16,000 are a

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.340 
know from 57,000 down to 16,000 are a
little<00:06:44.890> higher<00:06:45.100> than<00:06:45.340> 16,000<00:06:46.150> but<00:06:46.300> uh<00:06:46.350> reduced

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:47.350 
little higher than 16,000 but uh reduced

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.340 
little higher than 16,000 but uh reduced
polygons<00:06:47.800> quite<00:06:48.100> a<00:06:48.130> bit
