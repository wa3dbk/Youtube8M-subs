00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
suggested then the backup shouldn't take

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.180 
suggested then the backup shouldn't take
hardly<00:02:44.840> any<00:02:45.050> time<00:02:45.230> at<00:02:45.290> all<00:02:45.560> I<00:02:45.830> mean<00:02:45.860> it<00:02:46.070> should

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
hardly any time at all I mean it should

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.580 
hardly any time at all I mean it should
be<00:02:46.280> almost<00:02:46.610> instantly<00:02:47.239> alright<00:02:48.080> so<00:02:48.260> once<00:02:48.440> we

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
be almost instantly alright so once we

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.320 
be almost instantly alright so once we
do<00:02:48.739> that<00:02:48.769> you<00:02:48.950> can<00:02:49.070> see<00:02:49.310> today<00:02:49.640> 11:01<00:02:50.300> p.m.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
backed up to this computer so we can

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.170 
backed up to this computer so we can
just<00:02:53.360> minimize<00:02:53.540> that<00:02:54.019> now<00:02:54.610> we'll<00:02:55.610> come<00:02:55.970> back

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
just minimize that now we'll come back

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.210 
just minimize that now we'll come back
to<00:02:56.330> that<00:02:56.360> a<00:02:56.540> little<00:02:56.720> bit<00:02:56.840> later<00:02:57.110> now<00:02:57.920> you<00:02:57.950> want

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
in my post so the first step will

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.720 
in my post so the first step will
actually<00:03:20.030> step<00:03:20.209> number<00:03:20.390> five<00:03:21.220> is<00:03:22.220> to<00:03:22.459> navigate

could see it's restoring and this should

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.020 
could see it's restoring and this should
go<00:05:38.050> really<00:05:38.530> really<00:05:38.650> fast<00:05:38.920> because<00:05:39.370> really<00:05:39.580> all

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
go really really fast because really all

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.400 
go really really fast because really all
you<00:05:40.690> did<00:05:40.900> was<00:05:40.930> change<00:05:41.170> like<00:05:41.740> two<00:05:41.920> files<00:05:43.410> so

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.410 
you did was change like two files so

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.430 
you did was change like two files so
yeah<00:05:44.920> so<00:05:45.280> we're<00:05:45.430> done<00:05:45.610> with<00:05:45.670> our<00:05:45.940> computer

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
yeah so we're done with our computer

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.930 
yeah so we're done with our computer
we'll<00:05:47.440> just<00:05:47.620> wait<00:05:47.770> for<00:05:47.800> the<00:05:48.160> restore<00:05:48.820> to

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
we'll just wait for the restore to

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.240 
we'll just wait for the restore to
complete<00:05:49.360> it's<00:05:49.930> basically<00:05:50.470> restarting<00:05:51.220> your

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
complete it's basically restarting your

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.490 
complete it's basically restarting your
phone

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.380 

and<00:05:55.040> like<00:05:55.220> I<00:05:55.310> said<00:05:55.370> it's<00:05:55.610> just<00:05:55.670> so<00:05:56.000> easy<00:05:56.030> and

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
and like I said it's just so easy and

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.620 
and like I said it's just so easy and
it's<00:05:56.630> even<00:05:57.020> easier<00:05:57.140> like<00:05:57.740> if<00:05:58.010> you<00:05:58.730> perform<00:05:59.510> a

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
it's even easier like if you perform a

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.780 
it's even easier like if you perform a
clean<00:05:59.870> install<00:06:00.530> on<00:06:00.800> your<00:06:01.370> phone

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:01.790 
clean install on your phone

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.150 
clean install on your phone
I<00:06:01.820> just<00:06:02.690> can't<00:06:02.870> recommend<00:06:03.020> then<00:06:03.380> enough<00:06:03.980> if

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
I just can't recommend then enough if

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.320 
I just can't recommend then enough if
you<00:06:04.280> want<00:06:04.460> to<00:06:04.520> get<00:06:04.640> through<00:06:04.760> this<00:06:04.880> as<00:06:05.090> quickly

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
you want to get through this as quickly

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.940 
you want to get through this as quickly
as<00:06:05.510> possible<00:06:05.570> obviously<00:06:06.080> like<00:06:06.560> if<00:06:06.680> you<00:06:06.770> need

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:06.950 
as possible obviously like if you need

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.530 
as possible obviously like if you need
your<00:06:07.100> data<00:06:07.340> and<00:06:07.580> stuff<00:06:07.760> I<00:06:07.910> understand<00:06:08.360> that

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:08.540 
your data and stuff I understand that

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.430 
your data and stuff I understand that
but<00:06:08.750> if<00:06:09.650> you<00:06:09.800> can<00:06:10.100> if<00:06:10.910> you're<00:06:11.030> using<00:06:11.210> this

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 
but if you can if you're using this

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.620 
but if you can if you're using this
after<00:06:12.440> you're<00:06:12.650> just<00:06:12.800> testing<00:06:13.010> it<00:06:13.310> out<00:06:13.480> if<00:06:14.480> you

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630 
after you're just testing it out if you

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.230 
after you're just testing it out if you
a<00:06:14.690> clean<00:06:15.020> install<00:06:15.860> then<00:06:16.250> this<00:06:16.460> goes<00:06:16.700> super

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
a clean install then this goes super

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:26.200 
a clean install then this goes super
super<00:06:17.870> fast<00:06:23.770> so<00:06:24.770> once<00:06:25.010> we<00:06:25.190> come<00:06:25.430> back<00:06:25.640> up<00:06:25.910> in

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.210 
super fast so once we come back up in

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.740 
super fast so once we come back up in
theory<00:06:26.690> we<00:06:27.290> should<00:06:27.320> see<00:06:27.860> the<00:06:28.760> new<00:06:29.150> activity

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 
theory we should see the new activity

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.140 
theory we should see the new activity
app<00:06:29.900> unlocked<00:06:30.500> and<00:06:30.740> ready<00:06:30.860> to<00:06:31.130> at<00:06:31.640> least<00:06:31.970> ready

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150 
app unlocked and ready to at least ready

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.000 
app unlocked and ready to at least ready
to<00:06:32.330> explore<00:06:32.750> it<00:06:32.960> can't<00:06:33.140> actually<00:06:33.290> use<00:06:33.680> it<00:06:33.860> now

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.010 
to explore it can't actually use it now

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.960 
to explore it can't actually use it now
because<00:06:34.040> there's<00:06:34.520> no<00:06:34.640> Apple<00:06:34.970> watch<00:06:35.090> yet<00:06:36.970> all
