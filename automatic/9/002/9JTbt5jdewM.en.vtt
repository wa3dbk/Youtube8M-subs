is<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.439> template<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.189> embroidery<00:00:20.760> design

what brand will let you print the screen
you'll<00:00:28.619> go<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.830> file<00:00:29.279> print<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.720> will

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
you'll go to file print and it will

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.540 
you'll go to file print and it will
print<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.199> embroidery<00:00:31.619> design<00:00:31.949> in<00:00:32.160> actual

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
print the embroidery design in actual

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.450 
print the embroidery design in actual
size<00:00:33.320> there's<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.410> crosshair<00:00:34.980> here<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.340> that's

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
size there's a crosshair here and that's

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.060 
size there's a crosshair here and that's
an<00:00:35.610> important<00:00:36.120> feature<00:00:36.649> often<00:00:37.649> there's<00:00:37.920> an

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
an important feature often there's an

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.549 
an important feature often there's an
arrow<00:00:38.489> pointing<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.809> top<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.440> the

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
arrow pointing to the top of the

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.889 
arrow pointing to the top of the
embroidery<00:00:41.040> design<00:00:41.370> there<00:00:42.059> isn't<00:00:42.360> one<00:00:42.540> here

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
embroidery design there isn't one here

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.090 
embroidery design there isn't one here
but<00:00:43.170> we<00:00:43.350> can<00:00:43.530> most<00:00:43.860> certainly<00:00:43.980> add<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:45.000> with<00:00:45.239> a

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
but we can most certainly add it with a

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.970 
but we can most certainly add it with a
marker<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.309> darken<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.180> can<00:00:48.390> see<00:00:48.629> then

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
marker and darken it so you can see then

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.200 
marker and darken it so you can see then
but<00:00:49.980> let's<00:00:50.190> talk<00:00:50.340> about<00:00:50.399> what<00:00:50.789> kind<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.000> paper

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
but let's talk about what kind of paper

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.350 
but let's talk about what kind of paper
to<00:00:51.390> use<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.199> standard<00:00:52.680> copy<00:00:52.920> paper

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
to use this is standard copy paper

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.110 
to use this is standard copy paper
readily<00:00:54.360> available<00:00:55.010> inexpensive<00:00:56.010> but<00:00:57.000> you

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
readily available inexpensive but you

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.900 
readily available inexpensive but you
can't<00:00:57.360> see<00:00:57.570> through<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.840> very<00:00:58.079> well<00:00:58.760> so<00:00:59.760> the

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
can't see through it very well so the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.470 
can't see through it very well so the
other<00:01:00.059> option<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:01.140> go<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:02.480> scrap

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
other option is to go to the scrap

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.050 
other option is to go to the scrap
booking<00:01:03.719> section<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.350> by<00:01:04.470> vellum<00:01:04.920> nice<00:01:05.790> it's

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
booking section and by vellum nice it's

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.000 
booking section and by vellum nice it's
very<00:01:06.210> strong<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:07.080> this<00:01:07.320> would<00:01:07.530> last<00:01:07.680> for<00:01:07.979> a

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
very strong so this would last for a

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.980 
very strong so this would last for a
very<00:01:08.070> long<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.729> someone<00:01:09.180> transparent<00:01:09.840> but

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
very long and someone transparent but

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.899 
very long and someone transparent but
then<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.229> most<00:01:10.380> economical<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.549> can<00:01:11.700> see

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
then the most economical and you can see

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.520 
then the most economical and you can see
through<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.210> at<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.450> same<00:01:12.540> time<00:01:13.020> as<00:01:13.080> your

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
through it at the same time as your

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.190 
through it at the same time as your
technique<00:01:14.040> it's<00:01:14.280> tracing<00:01:14.970> paper<00:01:15.150> now<00:01:15.869> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
technique it's tracing paper now the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.719 
technique it's tracing paper now the
beauty<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.590> tracing<00:01:16.950> paper<00:01:17.070> like<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.549> said

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
beauty of tracing paper like you said

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.080 
beauty of tracing paper like you said
it's<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.030> translucent<00:01:18.540> but<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.500> also<00:01:20.090> kind

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
it's so translucent but it's also kind

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.520 
it's so translucent but it's also kind
of<00:01:21.180> because<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:21.810> translucent<00:01:22.170> it's

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
of because it is so translucent it's

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.050 
of because it is so translucent it's
very<00:01:22.710> thin<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.310> has<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.460> tendency<00:01:23.700> to

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
very thin and it has a tendency to

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.719 
very thin and it has a tendency to
crinkle<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:25.229> maybe<00:01:25.380> get<00:01:25.619> eaten<00:01:25.920> up<00:01:26.280> by<00:01:26.580> your

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
crinkle and maybe get eaten up by your

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.510 
crinkle and maybe get eaten up by your
printer<00:01:27.119> we<00:01:27.600> don't<00:01:28.080> want<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.409> have<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.710> so

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
printer we don't want to have that so

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.060 
printer we don't want to have that so
you've<00:01:29.790> taped<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.900> piece<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.439> copy<00:01:31.950> paper

first now you know chances are you'll

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.230 
first now you know chances are you'll
feed<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:43.979> through<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.549> will<00:01:44.729> print<00:01:44.939> on<00:01:45.149> the

feed it through and it will print on the
copy<00:01:45.479> paper<00:01:45.869> side<00:01:46.409> but<00:01:47.220> you'll<00:01:47.640> learn<00:01:47.880> which

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
copy paper side but you'll learn which

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.090 
copy paper side but you'll learn which
way<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.509> up<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:49.110> then<00:01:49.380> you'll<00:01:49.649> be<00:01:49.770> able<00:01:49.890> to

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
way is up and then you'll be able to

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.609 
way is up and then you'll be able to
insert<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.490> properly<00:01:50.970> now<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.689> tissue<00:01:52.320> paper

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
insert it properly now the tissue paper

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.410 
insert it properly now the tissue paper
isn't<00:01:52.860> going<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.159> be<00:01:53.250> pre-cut<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.030> you'll<00:01:54.210> cut

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
isn't going to be pre-cut so you'll cut

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.600 
isn't going to be pre-cut so you'll cut
it<00:01:54.540> eight<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> half<00:01:54.840> by<00:01:54.960> eleven<00:01:55.470> right<00:01:55.890> so

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
it eight and a half by eleven right so

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.670 
it eight and a half by eleven right so
what<00:01:56.880> three<00:01:57.270> great<00:01:57.570> ways<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:58.049> working<00:01:58.200> with<00:01:58.530> it

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
what three great ways of working with it

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.469 
what three great ways of working with it
and<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:58.950> showed<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.520> paper<00:01:59.729> doll<00:02:00.000> method<00:02:00.390> is

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
and you showed the paper doll method is

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.420 
and you showed the paper doll method is
you<00:02:00.630> talked<00:02:01.259> about<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.680> can<00:02:01.829> cut<00:02:02.070> these<00:02:02.219> out

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
you talked about you can cut these out

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.670 
you talked about you can cut these out
to<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.670> smaller<00:02:03.030> size<00:02:03.360> there's<00:02:04.170> also<00:02:04.350> some

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
to a smaller size there's also some

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.530 
to a smaller size there's also some
pretty<00:02:04.890> important<00:02:05.759> information<00:02:06.329> that's

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
pretty important information that's

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.570 
pretty important information that's
printed<00:02:06.899> on<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.439> template<00:02:07.860> there<00:02:08.369> will<00:02:08.550> be

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
printed on the template there will be

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.380 
printed on the template there will be
the

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
the

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.510 
the
number<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:10.020> stitches<00:02:10.229> in<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.710> design<00:02:11.039> how

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
number of stitches in the design how

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.640 
number of stitches in the design how
many<00:02:11.730> color<00:02:12.000> changes<00:02:12.569> there<00:02:12.750> are<00:02:12.900> maybe<00:02:13.530> the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
many color changes there are maybe the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.190 
many color changes there are maybe the
actual<00:02:14.190> size<00:02:14.540> often<00:02:15.540> this<00:02:15.630> is<00:02:15.780> good<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:16.050> keep

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
actual size often this is good to keep

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.520 
actual size often this is good to keep
in<00:02:16.350> a<00:02:16.440> binder<00:02:16.860> for<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:17.130> reference
