00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:31.730
 punctures 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:33.530
 less peasants for the marinade I have 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.350
 spices for chicken that I am today 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.440
 bought from friends from the east three canteens 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.940
 spoons of salt 1 tablespoon of sugar and 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.670
 also wine from our marinade 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.750
 It turned out such a mixture like posts 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.030
 I have wine 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.730
 sweet apricot can also 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.140
 use soy sauce instead of wine 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.090
 marinade, I use sweet wine for a reason 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.310
 and sugar is for the fact that the chicken 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.810
 acquired caramel flavor and beautiful 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.090
 Colour 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.090
 mix salt spices and minutes 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:18.019
 by the way the smell of wine is beautiful clean 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.019
 apricot 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.180
 delicious she is old to him already more than three 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.880
 four years old but in but just on 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.800
 withstand whom exactly is this spice 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.800
 mixture i'm thoroughly in massaging a chicken 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.640
 cool but not cold place to pieces 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.640
 to 23 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.590
 the ball is ready to charge the smokehouse 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.300
 I will smoke over his chips so that she will not 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.900
 bitter oak chips need to be good 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:08.100
 soak 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:10.080
 and ignite before smoking prefer 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.150
 I have alder chips that is extractive 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.730
 well crafted too well fit 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:19.190
 to smoke and will be in a great heat and therefore 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.190
 I have large chips that did not immediately burn 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.010
 on the bottom of the poison of the poison sit foil that 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.930
 then it was easier to wash the crust lies 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.520
 written in this position because she 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.520
 optimal for hot smoked 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:17.569
 It was interesting to know what temperature 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:32.750
 in the middle of the captain is not so visible 118 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:35.479
 degrees chicken in smokehouse rule 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:38.779
 exactly one hour after 20 minutes to communicate 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:41.539
 I washed the cover from the soot itself bird 

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:44.300
 baked us and about smoked ready 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:46.689
 has a beautiful caramel color like me 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.689
 and wanted 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.430
 the chicken has cooled just 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.680
 amazing aroma of spices 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.480
 smell sweet hunts it wants 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.670
