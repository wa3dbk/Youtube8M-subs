00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
2 foot by missile yeah

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.930 
2 foot by missile yeah
and<00:02:25.620> it's<00:02:25.800> got<00:02:25.980> these<00:02:26.130> big<00:02:26.310> machine<00:02:26.730> guns

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
and it's got these big machine guns

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.440 
and it's got these big machine guns
though<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.150> do<00:02:27.300> like<00:02:27.720> that<00:02:28.340> you<00:02:29.340> get<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.060> see<00:02:30.300> the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
though I do like that you get to see the

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.630 
though I do like that you get to see the
machine<00:02:30.600> guns<00:02:31.050> firing<00:02:31.350> anything<00:02:31.950> so<00:02:32.520> that's

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
machine guns firing anything so that's

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.110 
machine guns firing anything so that's
pretty<00:02:32.880> cool<00:02:33.060> um<00:02:33.420> yeah<00:02:34.320> and<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:35.640> main<00:02:35.820> feature

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
pretty cool um yeah and the main feature

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
pretty cool um yeah and the main feature
is<00:02:36.980> when<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.100> push<00:02:38.340> this<00:02:38.580> cockpit<00:02:38.910> down<00:02:39.300> its

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
is when you push this cockpit down its

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.050 
is when you push this cockpit down its
wings<00:02:40.380> blow<00:02:40.680> off<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.190> then<00:02:41.490> it<00:02:41.610> falls<00:02:41.940> down

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
wings blow off and then it falls down

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.270 
wings blow off and then it falls down
but<00:02:42.480> it's<00:02:42.930> cooler<00:02:43.200> just<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.650> like<00:02:43.800> blow<00:02:44.010> one

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
but it's cooler just to like blow one

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.940 
but it's cooler just to like blow one
off<00:02:44.510> but<00:02:45.510> that's<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:46.020> really<00:02:46.380> cool<00:02:46.620> feature

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
off but that's a really cool feature

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.820 
off but that's a really cool feature
it's<00:02:47.580> like<00:02:47.820> an<00:02:47.970> easy<00:02:48.240> wing<00:02:48.630> takeoff<00:02:49.140> instead

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
it's like an easy wing takeoff instead

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.530 
it's like an easy wing takeoff instead
of<00:02:49.950> having<00:02:50.190> direct<00:02:50.550> route<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.910> set<00:02:51.120> apart<00:02:51.390> to

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
of having direct route the set apart to

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.300 
of having direct route the set apart to
get<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.810> wing<00:02:51.990> out<00:02:52.170> like<00:02:52.890> you<00:02:53.010> would<00:02:53.070> have<00:02:53.190> to

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
get the wing out like you would have to

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.420 
get the wing out like you would have to
do<00:02:53.430> with<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:53.640> other<00:02:53.790> planes<00:02:54.350> so<00:02:55.350> yeah<00:02:55.590> but

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
do with the other planes so yeah but

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.390 
do with the other planes so yeah but
it's<00:02:56.580> just<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:57.150> little<00:02:57.810> like<00:02:58.320> different<00:02:59.010> slope

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
it's just a little like different slope

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.640 
it's just a little like different slope
to<00:02:59.580> breaks<00:02:59.790> push<00:03:00.090> those<00:03:00.300> things<00:03:00.600> out<00:03:00.810> but<00:03:01.500> it's

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
to breaks push those things out but it's

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.750 
to breaks push those things out but it's
definitely<00:03:02.100> a<00:03:02.130> very<00:03:02.220> cool<00:03:03.170> plane<00:03:04.340> now<00:03:05.340> get<00:03:05.610> on

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
definitely a very cool plane now get on

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.270 
definitely a very cool plane now get on
to<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.030> biplane<00:03:06.540> first<00:03:07.530> of<00:03:07.680> all<00:03:07.800> it's<00:03:08.160> got

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
to the biplane first of all it's got

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.710 
to the biplane first of all it's got
this<00:03:08.430> little<00:03:08.580> compartment<00:03:09.030> back<00:03:09.330> here<00:03:09.600> where

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
this little compartment back here where

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.420 
this little compartment back here where
you<00:03:09.780> can<00:03:09.870> put<00:03:10.020> like<00:03:10.260> in<00:03:10.500> these<00:03:10.650> pistols<00:03:11.130> and

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
you can put like in these pistols and

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
suitcase it's got this propeller works a

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.600 
suitcase it's got this propeller works a
lot<00:03:18.720> better<00:03:18.780> than<00:03:19.200> that<00:03:19.230> one<00:03:19.560> because<00:03:19.980> I<00:03:20.280> had

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
lot better than that one because I had

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.280 
lot better than that one because I had
to<00:03:20.700> loosen<00:03:21.060> this<00:03:21.180> one<00:03:21.239> because<00:03:21.780> it's<00:03:21.959> got<00:03:22.110> this

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
to loosen this one because it's got this

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.890 
to loosen this one because it's got this
knob<00:03:22.620> thing<00:03:22.980> on<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.280> front<00:03:23.519> right<00:03:23.670> there<00:03:23.900> so

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
knob thing on the front right there so

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.259 
knob thing on the front right there so
you<00:03:25.440> have<00:03:25.470> to<00:03:25.799> push<00:03:26.010> that<00:03:26.190> down<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.459> there's<00:03:27.180> a

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
you have to push that down and there's a

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.570 
you have to push that down and there's a
lot<00:03:27.420> of<00:03:27.570> stickers<00:03:27.840> on<00:03:28.110> this<00:03:28.380> one<00:03:28.620> I<00:03:28.950> think

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
lot of stickers on this one I think

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.550 
lot of stickers on this one I think
there's<00:03:29.790> there's<00:03:30.720> also<00:03:30.930> a<00:03:31.110> lot<00:03:31.230> of<00:03:31.260> stickers

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
there's there's also a lot of stickers

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.350 
there's there's also a lot of stickers
on<00:03:31.830> this<00:03:31.950> one<00:03:32.160> but<00:03:32.370> I'm<00:03:32.790> not<00:03:32.970> really<00:03:33.120> that

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
on this one but I'm not really that

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.949 
on this one but I'm not really that
heart<00:03:33.630> of<00:03:33.780> stickers<00:03:34.170> to<00:03:34.320> put<00:03:34.470> on<00:03:35.090> so<00:03:36.090> but<00:03:36.810> you

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
heart of stickers to put on so but you

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.699 
heart of stickers to put on so but you
get<00:03:37.790> this<00:03:38.790> biplane<00:03:39.330> it's<00:03:39.690> it's<00:03:40.230> a<00:03:40.350> lot<00:03:40.530> better

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
get this biplane it's it's a lot better

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.130 
get this biplane it's it's a lot better
proportionally<00:03:41.670> made<00:03:41.850> I<00:03:41.880> think<00:03:42.269> like<00:03:42.900> this

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
proportionally made I think like this

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.890 
proportionally made I think like this
back<00:03:43.410> part<00:03:43.709> isn't<00:03:44.370> really<00:03:44.850> it's<00:03:45.540> a<00:03:45.720> lot

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
back part isn't really it's a lot

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.470 
back part isn't really it's a lot
smaller<00:03:46.620> on<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.040> German<00:03:47.880> plane<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.299> back

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
smaller on the German plane the back

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.390 
smaller on the German plane the back
part<00:03:48.810> is<00:03:48.959> really<00:03:49.140> kind<00:03:49.470> of<00:03:49.590> like<00:03:49.650> big<00:03:50.130> and

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
part is really kind of like big and

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.960 
part is really kind of like big and
chubby<00:03:50.940> sort<00:03:51.360> of<00:03:51.480> but<00:03:52.320> you<00:03:52.410> get<00:03:52.730> Indy

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
chubby sort of but you get Indy

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.340 
chubby sort of but you get Indy
flying<00:03:54.330> it<00:03:54.630> and<00:03:55.670> you<00:03:56.670> have<00:03:56.850> this<00:03:57.330> like<00:03:57.570> detail

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
flying it and you have this like detail

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.259 
flying it and you have this like detail
of<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.739> old<00:03:58.920> world<00:03:59.130> 1<00:03:59.549> biplanes<00:04:00.060> and

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
of the old world 1 biplanes and

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.900 
of the old world 1 biplanes and
everything<00:04:00.600> and<00:04:01.350> then<00:04:01.470> you<00:04:01.560> have<00:04:01.769> dr.<00:04:02.580> Jones

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
everything and then you have dr. Jones

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.340 
everything and then you have dr. Jones
sitting<00:04:03.299> in<00:04:03.420> this<00:04:03.510> little<00:04:03.570> gunner<00:04:04.110> position

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
sitting in this little gunner position

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.949 
sitting in this little gunner position
now<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.310> gun<00:04:05.790> I<00:04:06.000> don't<00:04:06.360> understand<00:04:06.870> the

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
now the gun I don't understand the
