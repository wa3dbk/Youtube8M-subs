00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
those kill streaks are just not going to

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.349 
those kill streaks are just not going to
do<00:01:35.740> anything<00:01:36.069> because<00:01:36.520> they're<00:01:36.670> really<00:01:37.149> weak

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:37.359 
do anything because they're really weak

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:38.819 
do anything because they're really weak
as<00:01:37.539> opposed<00:01:37.840> with<00:01:37.990> all<00:01:38.109> the<00:01:38.259> colleges<00:01:38.619> we've

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
as opposed with all the colleges we've

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:40.649 
as opposed with all the colleges we've
seen<00:01:39.009> previously<00:01:39.159> the<00:01:39.999> killstreaks<00:01:40.420> in<00:01:40.539> this

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
seen previously the killstreaks in this

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:42.270 
seen previously the killstreaks in this
game<00:01:40.840> really<00:01:41.049> just<00:01:41.350> don't<00:01:41.499> do<00:01:41.710> anything<00:01:41.740> and

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
game really just don't do anything and

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.639 
game really just don't do anything and
that's<00:01:42.429> why<00:01:42.579> it's<00:01:42.759> much<00:01:42.999> more<00:01:43.240> logical<00:01:43.990> to<00:01:44.469> run

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
that's why it's much more logical to run

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:46.410 
that's why it's much more logical to run
kill<00:01:44.889> streaks<00:01:45.159> that<00:01:45.310> will<00:01:45.460> help<00:01:45.639> you<00:01:45.999> when<00:01:46.270> you

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
kill streaks that will help you when you

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.179 
kill streaks that will help you when you
can<00:01:46.539> still<00:01:46.749> be<00:01:46.840> mobile<00:01:47.229> another<00:01:47.920> thing<00:01:48.069> about

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
can still be mobile another thing about

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.039 
can still be mobile another thing about
the<00:01:48.340> killstreaks<00:01:48.729> is<00:01:48.880> there's<00:01:49.090> no<00:01:49.389> real<00:01:49.719> kill

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
the killstreaks is there's no real kill

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:51.389 
the killstreaks is there's no real kill
streak<00:01:50.289> that<00:01:50.409> you<00:01:50.560> can<00:01:50.710> call<00:01:50.979> in<00:01:51.159> like<00:01:51.249> the

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
streak that you can call in like the

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.520 
streak that you can call in like the
pave<00:01:51.609> low<00:01:51.819> to<00:01:52.299> just<00:01:52.509> follow<00:01:52.749> you<00:01:52.990> around<00:01:53.259> and

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
pave low to just follow you around and

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.080 
pave low to just follow you around and
get<00:01:53.679> a<00:01:53.710> lot<00:01:54.069> of<00:01:54.100> kills<00:01:54.429> I<00:01:54.549> mean<00:01:54.670> I<00:01:54.759> know<00:01:54.819> there's

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
get a lot of kills I mean I know there's

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.690 
get a lot of kills I mean I know there's
the<00:01:55.859> warbird<00:01:56.859> i<00:01:57.039> think<00:01:57.219> it<00:01:57.340> is<00:01:57.399> and<00:01:57.609> you<00:01:57.670> can

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
the warbird i think it is and you can

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.219 
the warbird i think it is and you can
get<00:01:57.909> it<00:01:57.969> to<00:01:58.060> follow<00:01:58.270> you<00:01:58.389> around<00:01:58.569> or<00:01:58.780> act<00:01:58.990> kind

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
get it to follow you around or act kind

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.440 
get it to follow you around or act kind
of<00:01:59.319> like<00:01:59.409> an<00:01:59.499> attack<00:01:59.740> helicopter<00:01:59.920> but<00:02:00.880> it's<00:02:00.909> in

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
of like an attack helicopter but it's in

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.239 
of like an attack helicopter but it's in
no<00:02:01.659> way<00:02:01.810> shape<00:02:01.990> or<00:02:02.109> form<00:02:02.170> as<00:02:02.469> good<00:02:02.679> as<00:02:02.859> even

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:03.249 
no way shape or form as good as even

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:04.739 
no way shape or form as good as even
like<00:02:03.369> the<00:02:03.490> attack<00:02:03.729> helicopter<00:02:04.299> from<00:02:04.420> modern

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:04.749 
like the attack helicopter from modern

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:06.510 
like the attack helicopter from modern
warfare<00:02:04.869> 2<00:02:05.109> in<00:02:05.259> modern<00:02:05.469> warfare<00:02:05.590> 3<00:02:05.770> it's

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
warfare 2 in modern warfare 3 it's

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.150 
warfare 2 in modern warfare 3 it's
definitely<00:02:06.789> like<00:02:07.359> something<00:02:08.319> that<00:02:08.350> you<00:02:08.649> get<00:02:09.130> a

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
definitely like something that you get a

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.300 
definitely like something that you get a
killer<00:02:09.580> to<00:02:10.090> maybe<00:02:10.539> with<00:02:11.260> every<00:02:11.590> time<00:02:11.800> so<00:02:12.069> i

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
killer to maybe with every time so i

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.220 
killer to maybe with every time so i
definitely<00:02:12.880> do<00:02:13.209> not<00:02:13.360> recommend<00:02:13.720> running<00:02:13.959> that

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
definitely do not recommend running that

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.780 
definitely do not recommend running that
if<00:02:14.350> you're<00:02:14.500> going<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:14.709> go<00:02:14.860> for<00:02:15.069> DNA<00:02:15.370> bombs<00:02:15.580> you

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
if you're going to go for DNA bombs you

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.460 
if you're going to go for DNA bombs you
need<00:02:16.060> to<00:02:16.209> be<00:02:16.330> running<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.690> system<00:02:16.900> hack<00:02:17.260> and

need to be running the system hack and

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
the game it's amazing to think that just

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.449 
the game it's amazing to think that just
two<00:02:37.780> weeks<00:02:37.930> ago<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.470> game<00:02:38.680> came<00:02:38.980> out<00:02:39.160> and

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
two weeks ago the game came out and

people were thinking oh lord DNA bombs
are<00:02:41.739> going<00:02:41.770> to<00:02:41.920> be<00:02:42.069> super<00:02:42.340> hard<00:02:42.700> to<00:02:43.000> get<00:02:43.209> and

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420

these<00:02:45.670> insane<00:02:46.030> gameplays<00:02:46.480> I<00:02:46.630> commentated

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
these insane gameplays I commentated

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.890 
these insane gameplays I commentated
previously<00:02:47.709> on<00:02:47.830> doom<00:02:48.069> over<00:02:48.400> a<00:02:48.580> double<00:02:49.300> DNA<00:02:49.660> and

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
previously on doom over a double DNA and

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.150 
previously on doom over a double DNA and
that's<00:02:50.050> not<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.290> only<00:02:50.349> one<00:02:50.769> other<00:02:50.890> members<00:02:51.130> of

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
that's not the only one other members of

that's not the only one other members of
God<00:02:51.400> we<00:02:51.580> got<00:02:51.790> note<00:02:52.030> I<00:02:52.150> think<00:02:52.180> like<00:02:52.690> six<00:02:53.019> or

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
God we got note I think like six or

God we got note I think like six or
seven<00:02:53.500> maybe<00:02:53.800> even<00:02:53.980> eight<00:02:54.250> double<00:02:54.700> DNA's<00:02:55.030> I'm

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
seven maybe even eight double DNA's I'm

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.570 
seven maybe even eight double DNA's I'm
not<00:02:55.300> too<00:02:55.480> sure<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:56.440> exact<00:02:56.860> number<00:02:57.190> but<00:02:57.340> I<00:02:57.400> mean

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
not too sure the exact number but I mean

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.400

futuristic stuff is going to be really
tough<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:07.959> maneuver<00:03:08.560> in<00:03:08.590> control<00:03:09.100> and<00:03:09.340> you<00:03:09.819> can

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
tough to maneuver in control and you can

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.420 
tough to maneuver in control and you can
already<00:03:10.120> see<00:03:10.450> that<00:03:10.660> people<00:03:11.170> are<00:03:11.440> pumping<00:03:12.340> out

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
already see that people are pumping out

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.650 
already see that people are pumping out
gameplays<00:03:12.970> like<00:03:13.150> they<00:03:13.269> would<00:03:13.390> on<00:03:13.450> a<00:03:13.569> normal

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
gameplays like they would on a normal

gameplays like they would on a normal
cod<00:03:14.110> and<00:03:14.470> that's<00:03:14.799> something<00:03:15.040> that<00:03:15.190> I<00:03:15.370> think

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
cod and that's something that I think

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.640 
cod and that's something that I think
has<00:03:15.790> been<00:03:16.120> kind<00:03:16.390> of<00:03:16.450> blown<00:03:16.870> up<00:03:17.080> over<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.349> years

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
has been kind of blown up over the years

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.860 
has been kind of blown up over the years
people<00:03:18.190> have<00:03:18.400> gotten<00:03:18.790> better<00:03:18.940> at<00:03:19.180> called<00:03:19.420> duty

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
people have gotten better at called duty

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.660 
people have gotten better at called duty
especially<00:03:20.620> since<00:03:20.799> modern<00:03:20.980> warfare<00:03:21.220> 3<00:03:21.370> I

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
especially since modern warfare 3 I

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.520 
especially since modern warfare 3 I
think<00:03:22.030> and<00:03:22.599> that's<00:03:22.720> really<00:03:23.049> when<00:03:23.200> you<00:03:23.349> tube

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
think and that's really when you tube

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.110 
think and that's really when you tube
blew<00:03:23.799> up<00:03:23.980> i<00:03:24.099> think<00:03:24.310> is<00:03:24.400> when<00:03:24.519> modern<00:03:24.910> warfare<00:03:25.030> 3

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
blew up i think is when modern warfare 3

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.180 
blew up i think is when modern warfare 3
introduced<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:25.780> moab<00:03:26.080> the<00:03:26.530> first<00:03:26.799> kill

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
introduced the moab the first kill

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.490 
introduced the moab the first kill
streak<00:03:27.519> that<00:03:27.750> technically<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:28.930> nuke<00:03:29.080> 4<00:03:29.110> model

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
streak that technically the nuke 4 model

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.620 
streak that technically the nuke 4 model
142<00:03:29.769> was<00:03:30.069> but<00:03:30.670> I<00:03:30.700> mean<00:03:30.790> people<00:03:31.239> never<00:03:31.510> even

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
142 was but I mean people never even

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.470 
142 was but I mean people never even
fathom<00:03:32.109> getting<00:03:32.829> to<00:03:33.250> nukes<00:03:33.790> in<00:03:33.940> the<00:03:34.030> game<00:03:34.239> I

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
fathom getting to nukes in the game I

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.910 
fathom getting to nukes in the game I
think<00:03:34.959> it<00:03:35.049> happened<00:03:35.350> once<00:03:35.530> or<00:03:35.620> twice<00:03:35.799> during

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
think it happened once or twice during

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.920 
think it happened once or twice during
modern<00:03:36.430> warfare<00:03:36.579> 2<00:03:36.910> but<00:03:37.450> when<00:03:37.570> modern<00:03:37.810> warfare

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930

going to have gotten used to this and

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:14.670 
going to have gotten used to this and
it's<00:05:13.570> just<00:05:13.660> going<00:05:13.840> to<00:05:13.900> be<00:05:13.990> a<00:05:14.080> completely

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
it's just going to be a completely

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.650 
it's just going to be a completely

once<00:05:16.990> was<00:05:17.259> and<00:05:17.530> in<00:05:17.949> my<00:05:18.070> opinion<00:05:18.190> a<00:05:18.580> regression

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
once was and in my opinion a regression

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.670 
once was and in my opinion a regression
of<00:05:19.240> call<00:05:19.449> of<00:05:19.570> duty<00:05:19.810> so<00:05:19.960> they<00:05:20.080> definitely<00:05:20.410> need

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
of call of duty so they definitely need

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.279 
of call of duty so they definitely need
to<00:05:20.800> stay<00:05:21.039> on<00:05:21.250> task<00:05:22.000> put<00:05:22.539> the<00:05:22.690> thing<00:05:22.870> back<00:05:22.900> in

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
to stay on task put the thing back in

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:24.689 
to stay on task put the thing back in
the<00:05:23.380> game<00:05:23.530> in<00:05:23.770> some<00:05:24.250> way<00:05:24.370> shape<00:05:24.520> or<00:05:24.639> form

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:24.699 
the game in some way shape or form

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:26.129 
the game in some way shape or form
doesn't<00:05:25.030> have<00:05:25.180> to<00:05:25.270> be<00:05:25.360> an<00:05:25.449> exosuit<00:05:25.960> or

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
doesn't have to be an exosuit or

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:27.330 
doesn't have to be an exosuit or
something<00:05:26.410> that<00:05:26.500> does<00:05:26.620> the<00:05:26.770> same<00:05:26.979> thing

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
something that does the same thing

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.800 
something that does the same thing
because<00:05:28.000> a<00:05:28.030> lot<00:05:28.270> of<00:05:28.300> people<00:05:28.389> have<00:05:28.660> already

comments section do you think the

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.520 
comments section do you think the
exosuit<00:05:34.270> should<00:05:34.539> return<00:05:34.840> a<00:05:34.900> call<00:05:35.169> of<00:05:35.320> duty

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
exosuit should return a call of duty

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
2015 in checks next game do you think

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.170 
2015 in checks next game do you think
that<00:05:37.900> there<00:05:38.050> should<00:05:38.080> be<00:05:38.320> a<00:05:38.500> secret<00:05:39.130> 30<00:05:39.639> 25

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
that there should be a secret 30 25

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.180 
that there should be a secret 30 25
killstreak<00:05:40.479> that<00:05:41.020> is<00:05:41.289> kind<00:05:41.620> of<00:05:41.680> like<00:05:41.740> a<00:05:41.800> DNA

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
killstreak that is kind of like a DNA

violin<00:05:42.580> the<00:05:42.639> next<00:05:42.849> call<00:05:43.030> duty<00:05:43.210> I<00:05:43.360> certainly

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
violin the next call duty I certainly

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.719 
violin the next call duty I certainly
think<00:05:44.080> there<00:05:44.259> should<00:05:44.500> be<00:05:44.530> simply<00:05:45.340> because<00:05:45.580> so

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
think there should be simply because so
