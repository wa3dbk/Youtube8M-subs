00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
Minecraft is obviously really hard

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000 
Minecraft is obviously really hard
because<00:00:42.300> it's<00:00:42.750> all<00:00:42.930> made<00:00:43.170> out<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.350> cubes<00:00:43.829> and

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
because it's all made out of cubes and

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.180 
because it's all made out of cubes and
stuff<00:00:44.570> I've<00:00:45.570> been<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:46.050> cheated<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.890> little<00:00:47.039> bit

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
stuff I've been I cheated a little bit

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.420 
stuff I've been I cheated a little bit
and<00:00:47.399> looked<00:00:47.579> at<00:00:47.730> kind<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.090> reference<00:00:48.329> for<00:00:48.840> a

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
and looked at kind of a reference for a

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.580 
and looked at kind of a reference for a
pixelated<00:00:50.430> minecraft<00:00:51.059> circle<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:52.289> that

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
pixelated minecraft circle and that

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.490 
pixelated minecraft circle and that

thought that would give it like a nice

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.230 
thought that would give it like a nice
touch<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.770> make<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.250> ground<00:01:26.670> isn't<00:01:26.970> so

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
touch and make it so the ground isn't so

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.690 
touch and make it so the ground isn't so
plain<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.900> right<00:01:28.590> here<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.100> little

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
plain and right here is a little

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.999 
plain and right here is a little
spectating<00:01:30.630> area<00:01:31.049> for<00:01:31.259> people<00:01:31.590> i<00:01:31.680> didn't

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
spectating area for people i didn't

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.120 
spectating area for people i didn't
really<00:01:32.159> feel<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:33.150> need<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.420> make<00:01:33.600> some

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
really feel the need to make some

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.890 
really feel the need to make some
grandstands<00:01:35.130> or<00:01:35.280> anything<00:01:35.700> because<00:01:36.030> i<00:01:36.270> really

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
grandstands or anything because i really

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.490 
grandstands or anything because i really
find<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.259> necessary<00:01:38.250> because<00:01:38.930> all<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.259> is

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
find that necessary because all it is is

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.550 
find that necessary because all it is is
just<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.100> minor<00:01:41.369> pvp<00:01:42.090> arena<00:01:42.329> but<00:01:42.990> i<00:01:43.110> do<00:01:43.170> battle

this little water stream going down

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.930 
this little water stream going down
because<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:13.740> felt<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.130> little<00:02:14.250> plane<00:02:14.670> in

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
because it felt a little plane in

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.180 
because it felt a little plane in
between<00:02:15.390> so<00:02:16.110> I<00:02:16.140> did<00:02:16.320> this<00:02:16.440> little<00:02:16.590> water<00:02:16.890> trim

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
between so I did this little water trim

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.890 
between so I did this little water trim
going<00:02:17.460> down<00:02:17.640> some<00:02:17.940> half<00:02:18.180> slabs<00:02:18.540> here<00:02:18.810> I'm

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
going down some half slabs here I'm

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.360 
going down some half slabs here I'm
flowers<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:20.600> got<00:02:21.600> a<00:02:21.870> gravel<00:02:22.380> path<00:02:22.770> way<00:02:23.100> going

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
flowers and got a gravel path way going

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.800 
flowers and got a gravel path way going
up<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:24.210> that<00:02:24.450> side<00:02:24.870> as<00:02:25.260> well<00:02:25.650> as<00:02:25.830> right<00:02:26.040> here

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
up to that side as well as right here

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.750 
up to that side as well as right here
what<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:27.840> do<00:02:27.930> not<00:02:28.350> do<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.620> gravel<00:02:29.010> pathway<00:02:29.490> for

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
what I do not do a gravel pathway for

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.100 
what I do not do a gravel pathway for
yet<00:02:30.150> is<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:31.940> stairs<00:02:32.940> up<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.570> spectating

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
yet is the stairs up to the spectating

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.420 
yet is the stairs up to the spectating
area<00:02:34.440> right<00:02:34.650> here<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:36.590> this<00:02:37.590> fight<00:02:37.920> an<00:02:38.100> area

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
area right here and this fight an area

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.730 
area right here and this fight an area
back<00:02:38.640> here<00:02:38.670> because<00:02:39.660> I<00:02:39.990> want<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.260> wait<00:02:40.410> till<00:02:40.620> I

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
back here because I want to wait till I

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.240 
back here because I want to wait till I
get<00:02:41.430> more<00:02:41.610> builds<00:02:42.200> on<00:02:43.200> both<00:02:43.620> of<00:02:43.830> these<00:02:43.950> sides

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
get more builds on both of these sides

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.240 
get more builds on both of these sides
just<00:02:44.670> so<00:02:45.510> it's<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.810> little<00:02:45.990> bit<00:02:46.140> easier<00:02:46.740> to<00:02:46.800> work

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
just so it's a little bit easier to work

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.890 
just so it's a little bit easier to work
with<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:49.100> so<00:02:50.100> I<00:02:50.130> don't<00:02:50.490> have<00:02:50.700> just<00:02:51.120> like<00:02:51.720> I

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
with and so I don't have just like I

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.120 
with and so I don't have just like I
don't<00:02:52.110> know<00:02:52.260> where<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.470> put<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.950> gravel

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
don't know where I put the gravel

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.590 
don't know where I put the gravel
pathways<00:02:53.820> just<00:02:54.360> from<00:02:54.630> coming<00:02:55.350> over<00:02:55.560> here<00:02:56.600> see

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
pathways just from coming over here see

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.400 
pathways just from coming over here see
I<00:02:57.630> don't<00:02:58.380> have<00:02:58.590> those<00:02:58.920> yet<00:02:59.370> but<00:03:00.240> as<00:03:01.110> you<00:03:01.290> can

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
I don't have those yet but as you can

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.280 
I don't have those yet but as you can
see<00:03:01.620> same<00:03:01.950> on<00:03:02.130> both<00:03:02.160> sides<00:03:02.790> as<00:03:03.690> far<00:03:04.080> as<00:03:04.110> the

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
see same on both sides as far as the

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.970 
see same on both sides as far as the
stairs<00:03:04.650> in<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.130> water<00:03:05.400> stream<00:03:05.820> goes<00:03:06.090> got

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
stairs in the water stream goes got

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.900 
stairs in the water stream goes got
watering<00:03:07.980> flowers<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.850> stairs<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:10.670> let's<00:03:11.670> do

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
watering flowers and stairs and let's do

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.970 
watering flowers and stairs and let's do
a<00:03:11.940> little<00:03:12.090> fly<00:03:12.720> around<00:03:12.900> right<00:03:13.320> here<00:03:13.350> so<00:03:13.890> you

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
a little fly around right here so you

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.610 
a little fly around right here so you
get<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.220> better<00:03:15.090> view<00:03:15.690> of<00:03:15.900> it<00:03:17.780> and<00:03:18.780> we<00:03:19.290> got<00:03:19.470> some

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
get a better view of it and we got some

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.080 
get a better view of it and we got some
fencing<00:03:20.310> so<00:03:20.610> no<00:03:20.790> spectators<00:03:21.510> jump<00:03:22.230> in<00:03:22.880> and<00:03:23.880> get

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
fencing so no spectators jump in and get

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.900 
fencing so no spectators jump in and get
themselves<00:03:24.360> killed<00:03:25.340> and<00:03:27.380> yeah<00:03:28.380> so<00:03:29.190> once<00:03:29.730> again

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
themselves killed and yeah so once again

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.560 
themselves killed and yeah so once again
I<00:03:30.420> really<00:03:30.930> like<00:03:31.080> how<00:03:31.350> these<00:03:32.540> little<00:03:33.540> things

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
I really like how these little things

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.690 
I really like how these little things
turn<00:03:34.110> out<00:03:34.260> right<00:03:34.440> here<00:03:34.800> actually<00:03:35.010> this<00:03:35.370> acts

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
turn out right here actually this acts

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.449 
turn out right here actually this acts
so<00:03:36.330> I<00:03:36.360> might<00:03:37.080> revise<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:37.739> a<00:03:37.800> little<00:03:38.010> bit<00:03:38.310> I

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
so I might revise it a little bit I

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.360 
so I might revise it a little bit I
don't<00:03:38.640> think<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.150> axe<00:03:39.360> is<00:03:39.630> perfect<00:03:40.230> I<00:03:40.530> think<00:03:41.310> I

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
don't think the axe is perfect I think I

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.250 
don't think the axe is perfect I think I
may<00:03:41.580> have<00:03:41.610> messed<00:03:41.970> up<00:03:42.239> over<00:03:42.420> here<00:03:42.900> a<00:03:42.959> little

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
may have messed up over here a little

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.759 
may have messed up over here a little
bit<00:03:43.820> that's<00:03:44.820> all<00:03:45.000> right<00:03:45.209> there's<00:03:45.959> always<00:03:46.440> room

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
bit that's all right there's always room

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.770 
bit that's all right there's always room
to<00:03:47.959> prove<00:03:48.959> upon<00:03:49.260> that<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:50.060> kind<00:03:51.060> of<00:03:51.209> think<00:03:51.600> did

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
to prove upon that and kind of think did

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.560 
to prove upon that and kind of think did
I<00:03:51.900> edit<00:03:52.410> anything<00:03:52.709> else<00:03:53.160> I<00:03:53.519> don't<00:03:53.910> think<00:03:54.239> I<00:03:54.360> did

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
I edit anything else I don't think I did

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.289 
I edit anything else I don't think I did
anything<00:03:54.600> else<00:03:55.230> over<00:03:55.680> here<00:03:55.709> at<00:03:56.370> for<00:03:56.640> vaca<00:03:56.970> I

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
anything else over here at for vaca I

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.660 
anything else over here at for vaca I
think<00:03:57.540> that's<00:03:57.780> all<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.110> same<00:03:58.410> scene<00:03:59.370> with<00:03:59.519> the

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
think that's all the same scene with the

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.620 
think that's all the same scene with the
skies<00:04:00.209> would<00:04:00.750> lab<00:04:01.049> and<00:04:01.350> over<00:04:01.650> there<00:04:02.630> that

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
skies would lab and over there that

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.520 
skies would lab and over there that
little<00:04:03.930> red<00:04:04.230> tower<00:04:04.530> thing<00:04:04.980> that's<00:04:05.820> a<00:04:06.000> secret

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
little red tower thing that's a secret

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.960 
little red tower thing that's a secret
that's<00:04:07.530> for<00:04:08.100> something<00:04:08.519> in<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:08.640> future

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
that's for something in the future

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.630 
that's for something in the future
you'll<00:04:09.480> you'll<00:04:10.470> see<00:04:10.769> that<00:04:10.950> when<00:04:11.130> we<00:04:11.250> come<00:04:11.489> to

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
you'll you'll see that when we come to

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.150 
you'll you'll see that when we come to
it<00:04:11.670> it<00:04:12.000> shouldn't<00:04:12.390> be<00:04:12.540> too<00:04:12.780> far<00:04:12.810> away

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
it it shouldn't be too far away

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.270 
it it shouldn't be too far away
just<00:04:15.150> something<00:04:15.450> I<00:04:15.570> started<00:04:15.870> working<00:04:16.200> on<00:04:16.380> yeah

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
just something I started working on yeah

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.449 
just something I started working on yeah
but<00:04:17.880> yeah<00:04:18.120> hopefully<00:04:18.470> I<00:04:19.470> can<00:04:19.530> get<00:04:20.220> some<00:04:20.430> more

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
but yeah hopefully I can get some more

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.600 
but yeah hopefully I can get some more
builds<00:04:21.090> like<00:04:21.300> right<00:04:21.540> here<00:04:22.230> and<00:04:22.580> here<00:04:23.580> and

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
builds like right here and here and

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.440 
builds like right here and here and
stuff<00:04:24.710> so<00:04:25.710> I<00:04:25.740> can<00:04:25.830> expand<00:04:26.490> this<00:04:26.610> road<00:04:26.940> out<00:04:27.150> more

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
stuff so I can expand this road out more

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.660 
stuff so I can expand this road out more
so<00:04:27.690> it's<00:04:27.810> not<00:04:27.960> just<00:04:28.020> cut<00:04:28.560> off<00:04:28.740> right<00:04:29.100> in<00:04:29.250> there

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
so it's not just cut off right in there
