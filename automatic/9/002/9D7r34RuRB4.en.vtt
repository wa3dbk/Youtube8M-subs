 whether on the beach in the country or in the sun 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.200
 especially in the 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.279
 can seriously damage the body. 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.849
 situation that is not different with 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.430
 eyes 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:24.259
 they are always ready and the 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.309
 sunglasses are essential for 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:26.779
 protect the 

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:29.119
 First, the most important is to know 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.910
 that you will use only use to drive 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.100
 for you to go to the beach for you to do 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.230
 stay straight with him in his 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.020
 sensitivity you have 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.490
 second ocs that covers your entire eye 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.580
 Do you buy a pair of glasses? 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.380
 lower is not being covered 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.600
 being you are having an exposure to 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.030
 another violet that is not harmful to eyes 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.550
 it is because of this fault but only 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.500
 darkened in itself does not help in 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.060
 further injure the eyes 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.010
 this because with the illusion that the 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.560
 environment is darker the pupil if 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.820
 open to let more uses enter and without 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.739
 protection against ov 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.760
 harmful rays also take advantage of 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:10.430
 break beyond the iris open more you are 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.360
 has less 1 - defenses and is not 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.850
 defending 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.710
 that's the chance of a burn 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.960
 greater than you are not using the 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.630
 oxy is more dangerous you wear a glasses 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.400
 unprotected low-quality 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.640
 You 're out of breath, you're protecting yourself. 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.740
 going to the shade looking up and the 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.500
 major problems caused over the 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.900
 in the retina is the case of the 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.760
 macular degeneration disease that results 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.650
 loss of vision in the center of the field 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.870
 visual 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.030
 the rays v can also favor 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.720
 other diseases such as cataracts 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.490
 example 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.520
 so the sooner we start the 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.470
 protect us better 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.690
 a child who has one goes to the sun 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.150
 using a protector much larger than a 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.560
 adult skin more sensitive eye 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.900
 also more sensitive than the dark glasses 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.740
 so a children's sunglasses always 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:03.170
 darker always more closed options 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.120
 of lens colors are not lacking in the market 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.490
 but did you know that each one has a use 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.950
 gray colored lenses are 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.700
 ideal for driving since they enhance color 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.290
 asphalt on the beach or in the pool or 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.260
 deviate accentuate the water colors of the 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.390
 sea and for all occasions lenses 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.490
 both are the most indicated 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.709
 there are yellow lenses that I am also 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.990
 uses but yellow must use during the day 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.750
 is a lens that you should use during 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.180
 to increase the contrast and this 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.100
 yes the colored lenses there are orange 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.800

 eyes and do not forget if you go 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.910
 to practice physical activities using 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.400
