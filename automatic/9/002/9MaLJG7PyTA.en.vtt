biggest<00:03:52.950> problem<00:03:53.190> though<00:03:53.340> is<00:03:54.209> space<00:03:54.570> here<00:03:55.140> in

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
biggest problem though is space here in

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.660 
biggest problem though is space here in
the<00:03:55.380> back<00:03:55.590> I<00:03:55.620> mean<00:03:55.950> when<00:03:56.160> you<00:03:56.250> first<00:03:56.400> look<00:03:56.610> at

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
the back I mean when you first look at

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:57.830 
the back I mean when you first look at
the<00:03:56.760> exits<00:03:57.060> you<00:03:57.180> think<00:03:57.390> it's<00:03:57.510> going<00:03:57.660> to<00:03:57.750> be

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
the exits you think it's going to be

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.270 
the exits you think it's going to be
fine<00:03:58.080> there's<00:03:58.350> good<00:03:58.709> knee<00:03:58.950> room

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
fine there's good knee room

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.820 
fine there's good knee room
the<00:04:00.239> floors<00:04:00.540> almost<00:04:00.870> completely<00:04:01.260> flat<00:04:01.620> so<00:04:01.799> you

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
the floors almost completely flat so you

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.770 
the floors almost completely flat so you
think<00:04:02.190> that<00:04:02.280> someone<00:04:02.610> could<00:04:02.640> sit<00:04:03.000> here<00:04:03.030> in<00:04:03.690> the

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
think that someone could sit here in the

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.710 
think that someone could sit here in the
middle<00:04:04.049> seat<00:04:04.489> until<00:04:05.489> you<00:04:05.670> actually<00:04:06.060> try<00:04:06.450> it

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
middle seat until you actually try it

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.150 
middle seat until you actually try it
out<00:04:06.870> for<00:04:07.019> yourself<00:04:07.350> and<00:04:07.590> you<00:04:07.650> see<00:04:07.860> that

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
out for yourself and you see that

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.430 
out for yourself and you see that
sloping<00:04:08.640> roofline<00:04:08.910> means<00:04:09.269> there's<00:04:10.230> no

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
sloping roofline means there's no

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.960 
sloping roofline means there's no
Headroom<00:04:10.680> at<00:04:10.980> all<00:04:11.130> I<00:04:11.160> mean<00:04:11.340> look<00:04:11.489> you<00:04:11.579> can't

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
Headroom at all I mean look you can't

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.180 
Headroom at all I mean look you can't

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
make any adult sit like this it would be

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.789 
make any adult sit like this it would be
torture<00:04:14.670> and<00:04:15.090> even<00:04:15.450> in<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.630> outer<00:04:15.840> most<00:04:16.470> seats

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
torture and even in the outer most seats

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.370 
torture and even in the outer most seats
it's<00:04:17.070> hardly<00:04:17.609> any<00:04:17.850> better<00:04:18.150> which<00:04:19.019> means<00:04:19.200> you

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
it's hardly any better which means you

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.900 
it's hardly any better which means you
either<00:04:19.530> have<00:04:19.709> to<00:04:19.799> travel<00:04:20.010> slouched<00:04:20.700> which

with the seats down the x6 isn't the

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.050 
with the seats down the x6 isn't the

at people with an active lifestyle but

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.680 
at people with an active lifestyle but
let's<00:04:54.500> face<00:04:54.680> it<00:04:54.740> the<00:04:55.340> reason<00:04:55.520> here<00:04:55.790> by<00:04:55.940> x6<00:04:56.450> is

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
let's face it the reason here by x6 is

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.440 
let's face it the reason here by x6 is
simply<00:04:57.380> for<00:04:57.980> the<00:04:58.070> way<00:04:58.190> looks<00:04:58.640> and<00:04:59.000> really

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
simply for the way looks and really

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.520 
simply for the way looks and really
there's<00:05:00.410> nothing<00:05:00.530> else<00:05:00.800> quite<00:05:01.010> like<00:05:01.070> it
