00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.420 
and tris didn't really get along in this
book<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.470> last<00:01:34.710> part<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.070> second

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
book which I appreciate it it's really

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.350 
book which I appreciate it it's really
real<00:01:37.229> it's<00:01:37.530> not<00:01:37.619> like<00:01:37.950> oh<00:01:38.100> let's<00:01:38.369> be<00:01:38.640> friends

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
real it's not like oh let's be friends

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.520 
real it's not like oh let's be friends
forever<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.900> everything's<00:01:40.229> going<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.409> be

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
forever and everything's going to be

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.889 
forever and everything's going to be
easy<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.340> on<00:01:41.549> relationships<00:01:42.509> aren't<00:01:42.659> easy

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
easy and so on relationships aren't easy

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.600 
easy and so on relationships aren't easy
if<00:01:43.259> you're<00:01:43.500> in<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.680> relationship<00:01:43.799> or<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.340> have

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
if you're in a relationship or you have

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.730 
if you're in a relationship or you have
been<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:44.909> relationship<00:01:45.420> or<00:01:45.630> even

think the reason is because in Hunger
Games<00:02:03.240> prim<00:02:04.110> die<00:02:04.320> which<00:02:04.590> was<00:02:04.740> like<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.890> big

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
went over to Google and googled an

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.080 
went over to Google and googled an
alternate<00:02:37.450> ND<00:02:37.690> cuz<00:02:37.840> i<00:02:37.990> could<00:02:38.290> not<00:02:38.550> stomach<00:02:39.550> the

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
alternate ND cuz i could not stomach the

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.980 
alternate ND cuz i could not stomach the
fact<00:02:40.330> that<00:02:40.450> she<00:02:40.540> dies<00:02:40.930> when<00:02:42.030> she<00:02:43.030> done<00:02:43.330> so<00:02:43.750> much

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
fact that she dies when she done so much

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.199 
fact that she dies when she done so much
to<00:02:44.410> make<00:02:44.440> things<00:02:44.800> better<00:02:45.010> for<00:02:45.220> her<00:02:45.610> society

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
to make things better for her society

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.150 
to make things better for her society
and<00:02:46.420> I<00:02:46.480> guess<00:02:46.690> it's<00:02:46.720> like<00:02:46.959> she<00:02:47.560> died<00:02:47.800> with

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
and I guess it's like she died with

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.160 
and I guess it's like she died with
honor<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:48.640> this<00:02:48.910> and<00:02:49.090> that<00:02:49.120> but<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.720> me<00:02:49.930> it's

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
honor and this and that but to me it's

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.920 
honor and this and that but to me it's
like<00:02:50.350> I<00:02:50.880> wanted<00:02:51.880> her<00:02:51.970> to<00:02:52.000> live<00:02:52.300> and<00:02:52.510> I<00:02:52.570> wanted

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
the pro or the epilogue to be like

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.270 
the pro or the epilogue to be like
