 to photograph the Milky Way but one 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:11.170
 storm rolled through this creating 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.800
 a pretty dramatic image like the 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.800

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:02.860
 then we have a photo a photo that gives 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.530
 Quite a lot to think about a woman 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.160

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.560

 some places are quite poor and 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.569
 they have to collect water from the rivers to 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.689

 of a long and cold day of work 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:39.069

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.510
