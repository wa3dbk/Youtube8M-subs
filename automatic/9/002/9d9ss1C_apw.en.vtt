00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:35.380

40 46 46 minutes I guess 45 46 doesn't
never<00:06:35.500> matter<00:06:35.740> but<00:06:36.550> yeah<00:06:37.180> it's<00:06:37.800> might<00:06:38.800> be<00:06:38.979> a

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:39.009 
never matter but yeah it's might be a

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:42.620 
never matter but yeah it's might be a
bit<00:06:39.190> too<00:06:39.220> expensive<00:06:40.000> for<00:06:40.150> that<00:06:40.419> but<00:06:41.009> anyway

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:42.630 
bit too expensive for that but anyway

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:47.699 
bit too expensive for that but anyway
it's<00:06:43.630> it's<00:06:43.930> it's<00:06:44.530> probably<00:06:45.039> a<00:06:45.160> nice<00:06:45.370> city
