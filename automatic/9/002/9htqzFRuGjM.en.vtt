gum trees in mountain gum stringy barks
of<00:04:32.610> course<00:04:32.880> this<00:04:33.060> is<00:04:33.270> trees<00:04:33.630> in<00:04:33.870> Australia<00:04:34.850> but

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
of course this is trees in Australia but

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.110 
of course this is trees in Australia but
you<00:04:36.000> can<00:04:36.150> find<00:04:36.390> the<00:04:36.570> same<00:04:36.810> overseas<00:04:37.440> in<00:04:37.740> Europe

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
you can find the same overseas in Europe

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:45.710 
you can find the same overseas in Europe
and<00:04:39.120> in<00:04:39.990> America<00:04:42.320> the<00:04:44.210> wood<00:04:45.210> destroying

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
and in America the wood destroying

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
and in America the wood destroying
fungus<00:04:46.880> is<00:04:47.880> pretty<00:04:48.300> much<00:04:48.510> worldwide<00:04:48.810> I<00:04:49.470> think

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
fungus is pretty much worldwide I think

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.860 
fungus is pretty much worldwide I think
and<00:04:49.950> that's<00:04:50.040> what<00:04:50.340> causes<00:04:50.640> dry<00:04:51.210> rot

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
and that's what causes dry rot

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:59.230 
and that's what causes dry rot
worldwide<00:04:52.740> and<00:04:53.310> therefore<00:04:54.000> you<00:04:54.570> can<00:04:54.750> find

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.740 

it's<00:05:00.240> one<00:05:00.480> of<00:05:00.630> the<00:05:01.940> one<00:05:02.940> of<00:05:02.970> the<00:05:03.090> Tinder's<00:05:03.570> that

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
it's one of the one of the Tinder's that

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
it's one of the one of the Tinder's that
you<00:05:03.900> can<00:05:04.140> find<00:05:04.560> pretty<00:05:05.190> much<00:05:05.340> every<00:05:05.970> week<00:05:15.740> so<00:05:16.740> I

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
you can find pretty much every week so I

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.940 
you can find pretty much every week so I
guess<00:05:17.160> is<00:05:17.340> a<00:05:17.370> honey<00:05:17.700> color<00:05:18.470> if<00:05:19.470> you<00:05:19.650> break<00:05:19.920> it

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
guess is a honey color if you break it

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.870 
guess is a honey color if you break it
off<00:05:20.310> it's<00:05:21.350> it's<00:05:22.350> whiter<00:05:22.740> some<00:05:23.460> of<00:05:23.580> it<00:05:23.700> is<00:05:23.850> very

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
off it's it's whiter some of it is very

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.140 
off it's it's whiter some of it is very
white<00:05:24.600> and<00:05:25.070> you<00:05:26.070> can<00:05:26.130> see<00:05:26.310> it<00:05:26.640> from<00:05:26.790> a<00:05:26.940> distance

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
white and you can see it from a distance

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.110 
white and you can see it from a distance
and<00:05:27.660> the<00:05:27.720> base<00:05:27.900> of<00:05:28.140> a<00:05:28.230> fallen<00:05:28.680> tree<00:05:28.710> if<00:05:29.700> you<00:05:29.850> see

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
and the base of a fallen tree if you see

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.470 
and the base of a fallen tree if you see
white<00:05:30.510> anywhere<00:05:31.020> around<00:05:31.440> in<00:05:31.620> the<00:05:31.710> woods<00:05:32.480> go

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480 
white anywhere around in the woods go

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.600 
white anywhere around in the woods go
check<00:05:33.750> it<00:05:33.900> out<00:05:34.080> because<00:05:34.410> it's<00:05:34.590> possibly<00:05:35.370> one

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
check it out because it's possibly one

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.290 
check it out because it's possibly one
of<00:05:35.640> these

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.340 

I've<00:05:39.200> read<00:05:39.500> that<00:05:39.680> it<00:05:39.830> can<00:05:40.070> be<00:05:40.310> a<00:05:41.270> darker<00:05:41.990> brown

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:42.350 
I've read that it can be a darker brown

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.110 
I've read that it can be a darker brown
and<00:05:43.310> this<00:05:43.460> is<00:05:43.610> quite<00:05:43.910> a<00:05:43.940> quite<00:05:44.720> a<00:05:44.750> turn<00:05:45.140> color

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.580 
to black I've never seen any black but I
would<00:05:51.230> imagine<00:05:51.320> that<00:05:51.770> different<00:05:52.490> trees

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
would imagine that different trees

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.830 
would imagine that different trees
having<00:05:54.590> different<00:05:54.980> Tanning's<00:05:55.490> in<00:05:55.910> the<00:05:56.600> bark

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
having different Tanning's in the bark

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:06.010 
having different Tanning's in the bark
etc<00:05:57.620> could<00:05:57.980> in<00:05:58.910> fact<00:05:59.060> change<00:05:59.630> the<00:05:59.840> color<00:06:01.750> so<00:06:05.020> so

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
etc could in fact change the color so so

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.580 
etc could in fact change the color so so
