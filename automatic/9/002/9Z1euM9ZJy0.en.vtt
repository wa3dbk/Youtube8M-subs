00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.459 
I was just kind of defining that and
then<00:02:28.060> this<00:02:28.239> concealer<00:02:28.780> is<00:02:28.900> just<00:02:29.079> going<00:02:29.349> to

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:29.469 
then this concealer is just going to

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:31.050 
then this concealer is just going to
sharpen<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.040> brows<00:02:30.219> and<00:02:30.459> give<00:02:30.579> them<00:02:30.700> a<00:02:30.790> neater

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060

it's only like one shade lighter than my
skin<00:02:35.680> tone<00:02:36.159> so<00:02:36.370> it<00:02:36.400> really<00:02:36.730> just<00:02:36.819> brightens<00:02:37.390> up

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
skin tone so it really just brightens up
