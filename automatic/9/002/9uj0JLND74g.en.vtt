though<00:06:14.789> in<00:06:15.389> two<00:06:15.630> weeks<00:06:22.039> oh<00:06:25.669> very<00:06:26.669> simple<00:06:27.509> I

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720 
though in two weeks oh very simple I

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.050 
though in two weeks oh very simple I
wish<00:06:30.720> um<00:06:31.139> but<00:06:32.010> that<00:06:32.250> hadn't<00:06:32.610> fallen<00:06:32.789> out

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
wish um but that hadn't fallen out

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:39.010 
wish um but that hadn't fallen out
though<00:06:33.330> I<00:06:33.360> wish<00:06:33.780> they<00:06:34.020> were<00:06:34.080> both<00:06:34.729> in<00:06:35.729> the<00:06:35.789> same

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.020 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:48.670 

spot<00:06:40.020> and<00:06:40.949> why<00:06:41.190> can't<00:06:41.580> I<00:06:41.820> find

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:48.680 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.800 

I'm<00:06:49.460> concerned<00:06:50.120> because<00:06:51.430> this<00:06:52.430> ear<00:06:52.810> kept

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:53.810 
I'm concerned because this ear kept

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:57.129 
I'm concerned because this ear kept
falling<00:06:54.350> out<00:06:54.620> when<00:06:55.130> it<00:06:55.280> had<00:06:55.400> this<00:06:55.580> size<00:06:56.139> that

00:06:57.129 --> 00:06:57.139 
falling out when it had this size that

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:01.029 
falling out when it had this size that
it's<00:06:57.560> gonna<00:06:58.009> fall<00:06:58.940> out<00:06:59.000> again<00:06:59.320> if<00:07:00.320> it<00:07:00.560> starts

00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:01.039 
it's gonna fall out again if it starts

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:10.180 
it's gonna fall out again if it starts
just<00:07:05.590> falling<00:07:06.590> out<00:07:06.800> again<00:07:08.530> look<00:07:09.530> if<00:07:09.770> I<00:07:09.949> see<00:07:10.160> it

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:10.190 
just falling out again look if I see it

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.920 
just falling out again look if I see it
full<00:07:10.490> out<00:07:10.550> like<00:07:10.940> obviously<00:07:11.449> it<00:07:11.600> can<00:07:11.780> go

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:11.930 
full out like obviously it can go

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.990 
full out like obviously it can go
through<00:07:12.169> so<00:07:12.410> maybe<00:07:12.680> I<00:07:12.860> should<00:07:13.250> try<00:07:13.400> Nate<00:07:13.759> I

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.000 
through so maybe I should try Nate I

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.650 
through so maybe I should try Nate I
don't<00:07:14.690> know<00:07:14.810> I<00:07:15.080> don't<00:07:15.620> play<00:07:16.120> hurt<00:07:17.120> so<00:07:17.419> I<00:07:17.449> don't

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:17.660 
don't know I don't play hurt so I don't

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:23.410 
don't know I don't play hurt so I don't
think<00:07:17.870> I<00:07:17.960> showed<00:07:18.169> that<00:07:18.470> time<00:07:20.410> back
