and this project will be to map a four

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.369 
and this project will be to map a four
five<00:03:44.319> kilometer<00:03:45.099> area<00:03:45.489> of<00:03:45.849> this<00:03:46.000> detail

five kilometer area of this detail
around<00:03:47.379> the<00:03:48.099> base<00:03:48.280> camp<00:03:48.670> you<00:03:49.450> know<00:03:49.599> would

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
around the base camp you know would

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.009 
around the base camp you know would
probably<00:03:50.379> take<00:03:50.560> it<00:03:51.150> once<00:03:52.150> we<00:03:52.329> get<00:03:52.450> the<00:03:52.629> section

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
probably take it once we get the section

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.660 
probably take it once we get the section
worked<00:03:53.230> out<00:03:53.439> which<00:03:53.590> we've<00:03:53.799> done<00:03:54.189> a<00:03:54.219> lot<00:03:54.310> this

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
worked out which we've done a lot this

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.110 
worked out which we've done a lot this
season<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:56.590> map<00:03:56.799> through<00:03:57.069> the<00:03:57.159> region<00:03:57.549> it'll

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
season to map through the region it'll

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.270 
season to map through the region it'll
take<00:03:58.150> you<00:03:59.139> know<00:03:59.230> probably<00:03:59.530> several<00:03:59.919> seasons

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
take you know probably several seasons

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.429 
take you know probably several seasons
of<00:04:00.849> oh<00:04:01.329> you<00:04:01.689> know<00:04:01.750> week<00:04:01.930> or<00:04:02.109> two<00:04:02.260> at<00:04:02.379> a<00:04:02.409> time

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:02.439 
of oh you know week or two at a time

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:07.080 
of oh you know week or two at a time
coming<00:04:03.280> up<00:04:03.400> here<00:04:03.639> to<00:04:04.599> do<00:04:04.750> it<00:04:04.930> and<00:04:05.849> so<00:04:06.849> it's<00:04:06.970> an

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
coming up here to do it and so it's an

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.720 
coming up here to do it and so it's an
ongoing<00:04:07.269> project<00:04:09.540> besides<00:04:11.310> mapping<00:04:12.310> like<00:04:12.700> I

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
ongoing project besides mapping like I

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.159 
ongoing project besides mapping like I
said<00:04:12.969> I've<00:04:13.060> been<00:04:13.090> pointing<00:04:13.419> out<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:13.659> fossils

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:14.169 
said I've been pointing out the fossils

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:17.310 
said I've been pointing out the fossils
and<00:04:14.319> things<00:04:14.469> we're<00:04:14.650> also<00:04:15.419> finding<00:04:16.419> fossils

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
and things we're also finding fossils

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.860 
and things we're also finding fossils
for<00:04:17.919> we're<00:04:18.669> planning<00:04:19.030> to<00:04:19.090> develop<00:04:19.479> a<00:04:19.690> little

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
for we're planning to develop a little

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.230 
for we're planning to develop a little
museum<00:04:20.500> so<00:04:20.769> when<00:04:20.919> people<00:04:21.099> come<00:04:21.459> to<00:04:21.489> this<00:04:21.759> can

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
museum so when people come to this can

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.170 
museum so when people come to this can
be<00:04:22.449> base<00:04:22.690> camp<00:04:23.050> they<00:04:23.979> can<00:04:24.190> walk<00:04:24.400> into<00:04:24.699> the<00:04:24.940> core

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
be base camp they can walk into the core

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.460 
be base camp they can walk into the core
wherever<00:04:25.720> they're<00:04:25.960> going<00:04:25.990> to<00:04:26.169> put<00:04:26.320> the

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
wherever they're going to put the

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.890 
wherever they're going to put the
cabinet<00:04:27.160> and<00:04:27.280> they<00:04:27.460> can<00:04:27.639> look<00:04:27.849> in<00:04:28.150> readily

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
cabinet and they can look in readily

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.540 
cabinet and they can look in readily
identify<00:04:29.440> what<00:04:29.770> they're<00:04:29.949> seeing<00:04:30.190> out<00:04:30.400> in<00:04:30.490> the

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
identify what they're seeing out in the

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.149 
identify what they're seeing out in the
field<00:04:31.470> so<00:04:32.470> we're<00:04:32.590> going<00:04:32.710> to<00:04:32.770> put<00:04:32.860> a<00:04:32.919> good

00:04:33.149 --> 00:04:33.159 
field so we're going to put a good

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:35.339 
field so we're going to put a good
examples<00:04:33.760> of<00:04:33.909> fossils<00:04:34.419> like<00:04:34.449> I'm<00:04:34.780> taking<00:04:35.139> some

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:35.349 
examples of fossils like I'm taking some

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:37.290 
examples of fossils like I'm taking some
back<00:04:35.530> to<00:04:35.770> cut<00:04:36.039> them<00:04:36.190> in<00:04:36.340> half<00:04:36.370> and<00:04:36.849> polish<00:04:37.180> them

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
back to cut them in half and polish them

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.580 
back to cut them in half and polish them
so<00:04:37.449> you<00:04:37.539> can<00:04:37.630> really<00:04:37.870> see<00:04:38.229> what<00:04:38.440> they<00:04:38.560> look

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
so you can really see what they look

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:44.219 
so you can really see what they look
like<00:04:39.120> better<00:04:40.889> the<00:04:41.889> in<00:04:42.849> the<00:04:43.510> third<00:04:43.900> thing<00:04:44.169> that

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
like better the in the third thing that

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.620 
like better the in the third thing that
we're<00:04:44.500> doing<00:04:44.530> is<00:04:44.919> we're<00:04:45.070> locating<00:04:45.729> places

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
we're doing is we're locating places

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.430 
we're doing is we're locating places
like<00:04:46.840> this<00:04:47.169> where<00:04:48.449> we<00:04:49.449> can<00:04:49.659> bring<00:04:49.960> people<00:04:50.229> out

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
like this where we can bring people out

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.189 
like this where we can bring people out
we're<00:04:50.620> going<00:04:50.740> to<00:04:50.800> develop<00:04:51.099> a<00:04:51.340> fuel<00:04:52.199> guidebook

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
we're going to develop a fuel guidebook

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:56.219 
we're going to develop a fuel guidebook
so<00:04:53.949> people<00:04:54.159> come<00:04:54.460> in<00:04:54.610> here<00:04:54.639> can<00:04:55.030> take<00:04:55.240> ATVs<00:04:55.900> and

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
so people come in here can take ATVs and

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.050 
so people come in here can take ATVs and
come<00:04:56.530> out<00:04:56.740> and<00:04:56.919> go<00:04:57.039> to<00:04:57.099> the<00:04:57.400> different<00:04:57.759> stops

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
come out and go to the different stops

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.480 
come out and go to the different stops
and<00:04:58.770> get<00:04:59.770> a<00:04:59.800> good<00:05:00.009> cross<00:05:00.340> sectional<00:05:00.849> view<00:05:00.909> of

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
and get a good cross sectional view of

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.800 
and get a good cross sectional view of
things<00:05:03.490> like<00:05:03.820> this<00:05:04.060> would<00:05:04.240> be<00:05:04.270> an<00:05:04.479> excellent

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
things like this would be an excellent

stop one we picked to show muscle you
know<00:05:07.930> we<00:05:08.199> don't<00:05:08.349> collect<00:05:08.800> these<00:05:09.099> we<00:05:09.400> leave

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
know we don't collect these we leave

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.790 
know we don't collect these we leave
them<00:05:09.820> and<00:05:09.970> for<00:05:10.599> people<00:05:10.930> to<00:05:11.020> see<00:05:11.229> in<00:05:11.530> the

them and for people to see in the
outcrop<00:05:12.220> you<00:05:12.490> know<00:05:12.639> they're<00:05:12.970> sticking<00:05:13.360> out

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:13.449 
outcrop you know they're sticking out

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:15.450 
outcrop you know they're sticking out
all<00:05:13.509> over<00:05:13.750> here<00:05:14.050> this<00:05:14.139> is<00:05:14.320> a<00:05:14.349> really<00:05:15.310> good

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
all over here this is a really good

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.430 
all over here this is a really good
possible<00:05:15.940> at<00:05:16.030> this<00:05:16.150> point<00:05:16.259> there's<00:05:17.259> other

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
possible at this point there's other

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.750 
possible at this point there's other
large<00:05:17.949> coral<00:05:18.400> heads<00:05:18.639> around

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
large coral heads around

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.620 
large coral heads around
here<00:05:20.210> in<00:05:20.480> the<00:05:21.020> same<00:05:21.290> locality<00:05:22.120> off<00:05:23.120> to<00:05:23.540> our

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
here in the same locality off to our

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.780 
here in the same locality off to our
West<00:05:25.060> this<00:05:26.060> outcrop<00:05:26.900> to<00:05:27.110> the<00:05:27.200> left<00:05:27.440> there

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
West this outcrop to the left there

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.410 
West this outcrop to the left there
there<00:05:28.790> is<00:05:28.940> actually<00:05:29.360> a<00:05:29.420> hydrothermal<00:05:30.050> vent

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:31.420 
there is actually a hydrothermal vent

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.330 
there is actually a hydrothermal vent
there<00:05:32.420> and<00:05:32.870> it's<00:05:33.200> altered<00:05:33.650> the<00:05:33.770> Roth's<00:05:34.010> and

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
there and it's altered the Roth's and

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.590 
there and it's altered the Roth's and
they<00:05:34.460> could<00:05:34.640> you<00:05:34.910> know<00:05:34.970> that<00:05:35.030> would<00:05:35.300> be<00:05:35.420> like

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
they could you know that would be like

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.290 
they could you know that would be like
this<00:05:35.840> might<00:05:36.020> be<00:05:36.200> stopped<00:05:36.470> one<00:05:37.000> that<00:05:38.000> would<00:05:38.150> be

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
this might be stopped one that would be

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.490 
this might be stopped one that would be
stopped<00:05:38.600> two<00:05:38.780> and<00:05:38.900> they<00:05:38.960> should<00:05:39.140> go<00:05:39.260> over<00:05:39.380> and

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
stopped two and they should go over and

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.660 
stopped two and they should go over and
see<00:05:39.620> that<00:05:39.800> in<00:05:40.010> right<00:05:40.160> next<00:05:40.340> to<00:05:40.580> the

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:40.670 
see that in right next to the

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.050 
see that in right next to the
hydrothermal<00:05:41.120> vent<00:05:41.540> is<00:05:41.750> fault<00:05:42.680> breccia<00:05:43.060> where

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
hydrothermal vent is fault breccia where

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.830 
hydrothermal vent is fault breccia where
the<00:05:44.360> rocks<00:05:44.630> had<00:05:44.870> moved<00:05:44.900> and<00:05:46.570> broken<00:05:47.570> up<00:05:47.690> the

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
the rocks had moved and broken up the

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.290 
the rocks had moved and broken up the
pieces<00:05:48.050> and<00:05:48.590> it's<00:05:49.400> produced<00:05:49.790> what<00:05:50.000> we<00:05:50.090> call<00:05:50.270> a

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
pieces and it's produced what we call a

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.170 
pieces and it's produced what we call a
fault<00:05:50.630> breccia<00:05:50.870> and<00:05:51.560> this<00:05:52.490> is<00:05:52.670> also<00:05:52.910> the

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
fault breccia and this is also the

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.900 
fault breccia and this is also the
avenue<00:05:53.810> which<00:05:54.050> the<00:05:54.320> hot<00:05:54.830> water<00:05:55.370> you<00:05:55.820> know

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
avenue which the hot water you know

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.670 
avenue which the hot water you know
we're<00:05:56.600> heated<00:05:56.870> up<00:05:57.020> and<00:05:57.170> brought<00:05:57.380> to<00:05:57.440> the

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
we're heated up and brought to the

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.280 
we're heated up and brought to the
surface<00:05:57.830> doll<00:05:58.310> to<00:05:58.550> the<00:05:58.670> rock<00:05:58.850> so<00:05:59.810> that<00:05:59.990> kind<00:06:00.230> of

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:00.290 
surface doll to the rock so that kind of

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.480 
surface doll to the rock so that kind of
thing<00:06:00.440> so<00:06:00.620> we<00:06:00.740> have<00:06:00.890> right<00:06:01.130> here<00:06:01.160> in<00:06:01.400> this

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
thing so we have right here in this

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.820 
thing so we have right here in this
infinity<00:06:02.120> to<00:06:02.330> really<00:06:02.720> excellent<00:06:03.080> stops<00:06:03.530> to

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
infinity to really excellent stops to

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.270 
infinity to really excellent stops to
see<00:06:04.040> some<00:06:04.250> very<00:06:05.560> important<00:06:06.560> features<00:06:06.890> that<00:06:07.130> we

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
see some very important features that we

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.360 
see some very important features that we
find<00:06:07.550> here<00:06:07.760> at<00:06:07.880> hmv
