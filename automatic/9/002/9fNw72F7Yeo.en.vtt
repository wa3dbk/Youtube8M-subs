 -Express, I'm Isabel. -Audio, I'm Alexi. 

00:00:04.156 --> 00:00:07.466
 We'll show you what's in our bag with equipment. 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:16.822
 We use a Nikon 7200 camera because it is very light, 

00:00:16.857 --> 00:00:19.984
 and we travel a lot while we work. 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:23.130
 There is a 24 megapixel camera, 

00:00:23.165 --> 00:00:25.724
 so the details get enough depth. 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.772
 We can print large posters of excellent quality. 

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:32.768
 ISO is extremely high, which is very important to us, 

00:00:32.803 --> 00:00:34.905
 because we are experimenting with the shutter speed. 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.483
 It has a focus on a professional camera. 

00:00:39.178 --> 00:00:40.820
 The combination is really good, 

00:00:40.855 --> 00:00:43.901
 easy to carry and easy to maintain on the road, 

00:00:43.936 --> 00:00:46.069
 providing the required quality. 

00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:50.112
 For this series "Blossom" we use an increase. 

00:00:50.147 --> 00:00:54.313
 As the smoke moves fast, it is good to have an increase, 

00:00:54.348 --> 00:00:57.579
 covering the situation from many different angles, 

00:00:57.614 --> 00:01:00.148
 to get closer and further away. 

00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:04.927
 This is a 70-300mm lens. 

00:01:06.847 --> 00:01:12.451
 Then it is 10-24 mm, which is good for natural landscapes, 

00:01:12.486 --> 00:01:16.444
 because exciting and great shots are coming 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.976
 and gives the picture dynamics. 

00:01:21.048 --> 00:01:27.549
 The 35 mm f / 1.8 lens is excellent in terms of incoming light 

00:01:27.584 --> 00:01:32.061
 and also because the diaphragm is really wide, 

00:01:32.096 --> 00:01:35.159
 so the background is finally soft. 

00:01:35.194 --> 00:01:39.950
 We do not use wide-angle lenses to capture architecture 

00:01:39.985 --> 00:01:41.622
 due to too much distortion. 

00:01:41.657 --> 00:01:44.913
 So for this scene we will use a more closed lens. 

00:01:47.513 --> 00:01:51.412
 Be in two different locations with different lenses 

00:01:51.447 --> 00:01:56.341
 helps capture all possible forms of smoke. 

00:01:56.376 --> 00:01:58.568
 Then we merge the photos 

00:01:58.603 --> 00:02:01.768
 and review them to choose our favorites. 

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:06.931
 Of course, we always carry the smoke. 

00:02:06.966 --> 00:02:09.554
 We have different kinds of smoke. 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:12.574
 There are ones that explode quickly 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:14.205
 and throw a little smoke. 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.528
 Others smoke just a minute and do not smoke much. 

00:02:19.563 --> 00:02:25.217
 The largest is two minutes and really fills the place with smoke, 

00:02:25.252 --> 00:02:27.715
 especially when we use a few. 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.033
 This is our bag of equipment, 

00:02:29.068 --> 00:02:31.558
 we used this to create the Blossom series.
