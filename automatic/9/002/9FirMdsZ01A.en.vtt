all<00:00:00.960> right<00:00:01.230> after<00:00:01.620> a<00:00:01.650> good<00:00:02.310> bit<00:00:02.550> of<00:00:02.580> effort<00:00:03.060> and

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
all right after a good bit of effort and

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.839 
all right after a good bit of effort and
scraping<00:00:03.899> I've<00:00:04.770> got<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.420> hole<00:00:06.420> filled<00:00:07.610> and<00:00:08.610> it

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
scraping I've got the hole filled and it

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.570 
scraping I've got the hole filled and it
straights<00:00:09.269> pretty<00:00:09.660> smooth

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:10.580 
straights pretty smooth

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.539 
straights pretty smooth
however<00:00:11.580> it's<00:00:11.759> not<00:00:12.000> perfect<00:00:12.920> it's<00:00:13.920> still<00:00:14.190> a

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
however it's not perfect it's still a

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.359 
however it's not perfect it's still a
little<00:00:15.150> bit<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:16.049> depression<00:00:16.560> right<00:00:16.890> around

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
little bit of a depression right around

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.220 
little bit of a depression right around
the<00:00:17.580> edge<00:00:17.730> for<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.150> most<00:00:18.330> part<00:00:18.630> it's<00:00:18.750> flat<00:00:19.020> but

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
the edge for the most part it's flat but

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.210 
the edge for the most part it's flat but
it's<00:00:19.350> not<00:00:19.410> perfect

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
it's not perfect

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.029 
it's not perfect
so<00:00:20.730> what<00:00:20.850> I'm<00:00:20.939> going<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.119> do<00:00:21.330> is<00:00:21.650> apply<00:00:22.650> another

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
so what I'm going to do is apply another

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.769 
so what I'm going to do is apply another
really<00:00:23.340> thin<00:00:23.640> layer<00:00:23.960> how<00:00:24.960> super<00:00:25.470> low<00:00:26.779> again

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
really thin layer how super low again

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.509 
really thin layer how super low again
use<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.050> accelerator<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:28.980> we<00:00:29.220> happen<00:00:29.490> to

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
use that accelerator that we happen to

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.580 
use that accelerator that we happen to
have<00:00:29.670> access<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.420> wait<00:00:30.660> for<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.109> set<00:00:31.349> up<00:00:31.470> you

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
have access to wait for it to set up you

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.530 
have access to wait for it to set up you
can<00:00:31.710> actually<00:00:31.890> see<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.460> literally<00:00:32.969> hardened

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
can actually see it literally hardened

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.090 
can actually see it literally hardened
before<00:00:34.440> your<00:00:34.649> eyes<00:00:36.380> and<00:00:37.380> we're<00:00:37.710> real<00:00:37.860> close

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
before your eyes and we're real close

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.430 
before your eyes and we're real close
now<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:39.079> of<00:00:40.219> completely<00:00:41.219> filled<00:00:41.550> hole<00:00:42.440> and

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
now to a of completely filled hole and

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.560 
now to a of completely filled hole and
again<00:00:46.879> scraping<00:00:49.579> that<00:00:50.579> kind<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.210> newing

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
again scraping that kind of newing

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:59.990 
again scraping that kind of newing
sailed<00:00:52.079> in<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.920> three<00:00:53.250> directions<00:00:56.000> angles<00:00:59.000> not

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
sailed in to three directions angles not

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.319 
sailed in to three directions angles not
doing<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:00.809> not<00:01:01.530> coming<00:01:01.949> at<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.160> from<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:03.000> steep

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
doing this not coming at it from a steep

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.660 
doing this not coming at it from a steep
angle<00:01:03.539> but<00:01:03.870> holding<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.409> blade<00:01:04.680> horizontal

angle but holding the blade horizontal
perpendicular<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:07.350> should<00:01:08.159> say<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
perpendicular I should say so the

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.230 
perpendicular I should say so the
surface<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.080> granite<00:01:10.439> now<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.860> not

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
surface of the granite now this is not

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.609 
surface of the granite now this is not
the<00:01:12.240> way<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.860> fix<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:14.040> chip<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.460> marble<00:01:15.619> marbles

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
the way to fix a chip and marble marbles

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.410 
the way to fix a chip and marble marbles
much<00:01:16.799> softer<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.640> razor<00:01:17.850> blade<00:01:18.210> may

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
much softer and the razor blade may

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.770 
much softer and the razor blade may
actually<00:01:19.369> do<00:01:20.369> more<00:01:20.549> damage<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:21.060> surface<00:01:21.600> this

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
actually do more damage to surface this

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.620 
actually do more damage to surface this
stone<00:01:22.140> than<00:01:22.640> with<00:01:23.640> granite<00:01:24.090> with<00:01:24.299> granite

there's<00:01:24.750> no<00:01:24.960> fear<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.430> can<00:01:26.580> actually

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
there's no fear and you can actually

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.399 
there's no fear and you can actually
hear<00:01:29.450> their<00:01:30.450> super<00:01:30.720> glue<00:01:30.840> being<00:01:31.049> pulled<00:01:31.290> away

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
hear their super glue being pulled away

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.149 
hear their super glue being pulled away
to<00:01:32.570> a<00:01:33.570> less<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.020> less<00:01:34.170> extent<00:01:34.710> as<00:01:34.829> we<00:01:34.979> make

to a less and less extent as we make

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.390 
to a less and less extent as we make
progress<00:01:35.540> completely<00:01:36.540> filling<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.400> the

progress completely filling this the
razor<00:01:38.909> blades<00:01:39.240> literally<00:01:39.689> wear<00:01:39.900> out<00:01:40.110> against

razor blades literally wear out against
the<00:01:40.979> granite<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.579> get<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.150> fresh<00:01:42.479> razor<00:01:42.810> blade

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
the granite so get the fresh razor blade

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.850 
the granite so get the fresh razor blade
once<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.530> while<00:01:44.509> can<00:01:45.509> help<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.899> get<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.170> nicer

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
once a while can help you get a nicer

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:58.380 
once a while can help you get a nicer
finish

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.980 

smooth<00:01:59.390> Feld<00:02:00.009> not<00:02:01.009> polished<00:02:01.759> but<00:02:02.659> certainly

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
smooth Feld not polished but certainly

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.969 
smooth Feld not polished but certainly
smooth<00:02:03.500> and<00:02:03.860> filled<00:02:04.430> the<00:02:05.030> hole<00:02:05.299> now<00:02:05.630> there's<00:02:05.869> a

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
smooth and filled the hole now there's a

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.150 
smooth and filled the hole now there's a
spot<00:02:06.979> over<00:02:07.220> here<00:02:07.340> I<00:02:07.549> didn't<00:02:07.790> see<00:02:07.850> before<00:02:09.160> I'm

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
spot over here I didn't see before I'm

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.160 
spot over here I didn't see before I'm
gonna<00:02:10.599> take<00:02:11.599> a<00:02:11.630> third<00:02:13.599> attempt<00:02:14.599> at<00:02:14.690> filling

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
gonna take a third attempt at filling

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.520 
gonna take a third attempt at filling
trying<00:02:15.500> to<00:02:15.590> get<00:02:15.769> it<00:02:15.890> completely<00:02:16.459> flat<00:02:17.530> then

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
trying to get it completely flat then

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.290 
trying to get it completely flat then
again<00:02:18.860> you<00:02:19.069> would<00:02:19.190> have<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.370> wait<00:02:19.670> for<00:02:19.700> each

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
again you would have to wait for each

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.780 
again you would have to wait for each
subsequent<00:02:20.780> layer<00:02:21.110> of<00:02:21.410> superglue<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:21.980> cure<00:02:22.489> in

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
subsequent layer of superglue to cure in

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.870 
subsequent layer of superglue to cure in
between<00:02:23.239> scrapes<00:02:23.690> but<00:02:24.220> it's<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.340> same<00:02:25.550> exact

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
between scrapes but it's the same exact

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.550 
between scrapes but it's the same exact
process<00:02:25.970> over<00:02:26.750> over<00:02:26.989> again<00:02:27.170> until<00:02:27.319> you're

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
process over over again until you're

00:02:27.560 --> 00:03:15.060 
process over over again until you're
completely<00:02:27.680> filled<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:28.400> completely<00:02:28.760> flat

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.990 

again<00:03:16.070> a<00:03:16.100> fresh<00:03:16.459> razor<00:03:16.760> blade<00:03:17.120> and<00:03:18.820> you<00:03:19.820> can

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
again a fresh razor blade and you can

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.670 
again a fresh razor blade and you can
really<00:03:20.150> feel<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.780> high<00:03:20.959> spot<00:03:21.410> with<00:03:21.620> the

really feel the high spot with the

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.590 
really feel the high spot with the
blades<00:03:22.010> might<00:03:22.489> not<00:03:22.640> be<00:03:22.790> able<00:03:22.910> to<00:03:23.120> see<00:03:23.420> it<00:03:23.570> so

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
blades might not be able to see it so

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.789 
blades might not be able to see it so
well<00:03:24.079> you<00:03:24.560> know<00:03:25.370> you<00:03:26.030> can<00:03:26.209> feel<00:03:26.650> when<00:03:27.650> you've

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
well you know you can feel when you've

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.390 
well you know you can feel when you've
got<00:03:28.069> this<00:03:29.350> on<00:03:30.350> pointing<00:03:30.829> with<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.010> entire

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400
