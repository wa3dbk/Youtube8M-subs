00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
screws are and I'm going to do that by

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.300 
screws are and I'm going to do that by
demonstrating<00:03:34.450> right<00:03:35.200> here<00:03:35.380> I'm<00:03:35.590> I'm<00:03:36.160> going

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
to draw a line right here so that you

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.470 
to draw a line right here so that you
can<00:03:37.990> see<00:03:38.230> where<00:03:38.470> the<00:03:38.590> rail<00:03:38.830> meets<00:03:39.670> the<00:03:40.000> bracket

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
can see where the rail meets the bracket

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.150 
can see where the rail meets the bracket
and<00:03:40.660> then<00:03:41.260> what<00:03:41.470> I'm<00:03:41.560> going<00:03:41.709> to<00:03:41.800> do<00:03:41.920> is<00:03:42.040> I'm

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
and then what I'm going to do is I'm

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.730 
and then what I'm going to do is I'm
just<00:03:42.190> going<00:03:42.459> to<00:03:42.720> flex<00:03:43.720> this<00:03:43.990> post<00:03:44.320> a<00:03:44.530> little

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
just going to flex this post a little

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.580 
just going to flex this post a little
bit<00:03:44.890> and<00:03:45.130> you<00:03:45.970> can<00:03:46.000> see<00:03:46.330> how<00:03:46.540> the<00:03:46.620> rail<00:03:47.620> moves

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
bit and you can see how the rail moves

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.900 
bit and you can see how the rail moves
in<00:03:50.590> and<00:03:50.860> out<00:03:50.920> of<00:03:51.069> the<00:03:51.130> bracket<00:03:51.520> when<00:03:51.640> I<00:03:51.670> put

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
in and out of the bracket when I put

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.030 
in and out of the bracket when I put
pressure<00:03:52.090> on<00:03:52.360> it

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
pressure on it

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.130 
pressure on it
and<00:03:54.040> what<00:03:54.250> we're<00:03:54.400> going<00:03:54.489> to<00:03:54.550> do<00:03:54.730> is<00:03:54.989> use<00:03:55.989> our

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
and what we're going to do is use our

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.990 
and what we're going to do is use our
lock<00:03:56.380> screws<00:03:57.270> with<00:03:58.270> our<00:03:58.420> snap<00:03:58.660> caps<00:03:59.880> now<00:04:00.880> we're

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
lock screws with our snap caps now we're

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.860 
lock screws with our snap caps now we're
going<00:04:01.090> to<00:04:01.150> put<00:04:02.110> our<00:04:02.230> lock<00:04:02.410> screws<00:04:02.769> in<00:04:03.870> these

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
going to put our lock screws in these

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.270 
going to put our lock screws in these
are<00:04:05.019> self<00:04:05.290> cutting<00:04:05.680> so<00:04:05.860> they<00:04:05.980> go<00:04:06.100> right

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
are self cutting so they go right

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.850 
are self cutting so they go right
through<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:06.730> aluminum<00:04:07.209> insert<00:04:07.680> so<00:04:08.680> there's

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
through the aluminum insert so there's
