00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.589 
pretty much how it works is you put the
screen<00:01:31.399> shooter<00:01:31.640> on<00:01:31.759> first<00:01:32.030> and<00:01:32.209> then<00:01:32.330> you<00:01:32.420> put

00:01:32.589 --> 00:01:32.599 
screen shooter on first and then you put

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:34.449 
screen shooter on first and then you put
the<00:01:32.720> stick<00:01:32.959> boy<00:01:33.170> skin<00:01:33.440> on<00:01:33.649> top<00:01:33.920> of<00:01:34.099> that<00:01:34.190> so<00:01:34.369> you

00:01:34.449 --> 00:01:34.459 
the stick boy skin on top of that so you

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:35.800 
the stick boy skin on top of that so you
can<00:01:34.580> definitely<00:01:34.940> have<00:01:35.090> full<00:01:35.569> front

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
can definitely have full front

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.510 
can definitely have full front
protection<00:01:36.229> with<00:01:36.349> the<00:01:36.440> screen<00:01:36.709> protector<00:01:36.830> but

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
protection with the screen protector but

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.859 
protection with the screen protector but
as<00:01:37.789> you<00:01:37.910> can<00:01:38.030> see<00:01:38.240> here<00:01:38.360> this<00:01:38.450> is<00:01:38.509> the<00:01:38.660> full

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
as you can see here this is the full

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.900

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:56.050 
particular color here I think a look a
lot<00:02:54.650> more<00:02:54.799> sharper<00:02:55.189> on<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.459> white<00:02:55.640> I've<00:02:55.790> only

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
lot more sharper on the white I've only

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.879 
lot more sharper on the white I've only

because it has you know a similar

00:02:57.889 --> 00:02:59.979 
because it has you know a similar
lighter<00:02:58.670> metal<00:02:59.060> color<00:02:59.239> to<00:02:59.510> it<00:02:59.629> rather<00:02:59.870> than

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
lighter metal color to it rather than

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.199
