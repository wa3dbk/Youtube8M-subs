work<00:00:42.930> work<00:00:43.290> will<00:00:43.530> begin<00:00:43.800> with<00:00:44.780> video<00:00:45.780> quality

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
work work will begin with video quality

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.979 
work work will begin with video quality
is<00:00:46.500> set<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.039> high<00:00:47.160> speed<00:00:47.550> which<00:00:48.420> means<00:00:48.719> it's

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
is set to high speed which means it's

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.830 
is set to high speed which means it's
going<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.170> be<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.260> lower<00:00:49.530> quality<00:00:49.800> minute<00:00:50.399> video

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
going to be a lower quality minute video

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.520 
going to be a lower quality minute video
I've<00:00:51.840> tried<00:00:52.079> medium<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.829> high<00:00:52.949> quality

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
I've tried medium and high quality

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.920 
I've tried medium and high quality
honestly<00:00:55.530> they<00:00:56.309> don't<00:00:56.489> play<00:00:56.699> worth<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.480> day<00:00:57.629> no

honestly they don't play worth a day no
high<00:00:58.170> speed<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.430> turn<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.940> quality<00:01:00.390> up

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
high speed so you turn the quality up

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.370 
high speed so you turn the quality up

site<00:03:40.760> these<00:03:41.760> are<00:03:41.910> not<00:03:41.940> which<00:03:42.780> what<00:03:43.050> I<00:03:43.080> would

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
site these are not which what I would

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.030 
site these are not which what I would
consider<00:03:43.440> really<00:03:43.770> high<00:03:44.190> quality<00:03:44.420> HD<00:03:45.420> movies

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
consider really high quality HD movies

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.550 
consider really high quality HD movies
they<00:03:47.040> look<00:03:47.870> they<00:03:48.870> can<00:03:49.019> look<00:03:49.170> good<00:03:49.410> on<00:03:49.530> a

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
they look they can look good on a

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.440 
they look they can look good on a
smaller<00:03:49.920> screen<00:03:50.190> but<00:03:50.670> when<00:03:51.000> you<00:03:51.120> put<00:03:51.150> them<00:03:51.390> on

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
smaller screen but when you put them on

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.210 
smaller screen but when you put them on
anything<00:03:51.690> large<00:03:52.050> and<00:03:52.230> like<00:03:52.319> a<00:03:52.380> 13<00:03:52.800> inch<00:03:52.980> screen

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
anything large and like a 13 inch screen

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.520 
anything large and like a 13 inch screen
you<00:03:53.849> can<00:03:53.970> tell<00:03:54.209> they're<00:03:54.390> a<00:03:54.420> lower<00:03:54.660> bitrate<00:03:54.989> so

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
you can tell they're a lower bitrate so

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.229 
you can tell they're a lower bitrate so
you<00:03:58.530> would<00:03:58.650> expect<00:03:58.920> them<00:03:59.130> to<00:03:59.700> play<00:03:59.940> really

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
you would expect them to play really

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.800 
you would expect them to play really
well<00:04:00.680> but<00:04:01.680> that's<00:04:01.920> not<00:04:02.040> the<00:04:02.190> case<00:04:02.630> so<00:04:03.630> now

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.750 
support why they would put that I
wouldn't<00:06:15.650> think<00:06:15.740> of<00:06:15.860> any<00:06:16.040> other<00:06:16.190> reason<00:06:16.220> other

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:16.760 
wouldn't think of any other reason other

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.760 
wouldn't think of any other reason other
than<00:06:17.330> saying<00:06:17.540> that<00:06:17.660> supports<00:06:18.139> the<00:06:18.290> hardware

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
than saying that supports the hardware

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.010 
than saying that supports the hardware
and<00:06:19.010> since<00:06:19.760> this<00:06:19.850> is<00:06:20.000> a<00:06:20.030> video<00:06:20.360> player<00:06:20.690> you

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
and since this is a video player you

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.590 
and since this is a video player you
would<00:06:21.139> assume<00:06:21.440> that<00:06:21.740> it<00:06:21.860> would<00:06:22.490> use<00:06:23.419> the

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:23.600 
would assume that it would use the

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.830 
would assume that it would use the
hardware<00:06:24.080> to<00:06:24.320> accelerate<00:06:24.919> video<00:06:25.280> playback

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
hardware to accelerate video playback

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.570 
hardware to accelerate video playback
but<00:06:26.840> if<00:06:27.290> it's<00:06:27.500> doing<00:06:27.800> it's<00:06:28.100> doing<00:06:28.160> a<00:06:28.400> horrible

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:28.580 
but if it's doing it's doing a horrible

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.870 
but if it's doing it's doing a horrible
job<00:06:28.790> of<00:06:29.000> it<00:06:30.310> and<00:06:31.310> again<00:06:31.580> these<00:06:32.210> videos<00:06:32.630> are

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 
job of it and again these videos are

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.340 
job of it and again these videos are
pretty<00:06:34.880> they're<00:06:35.270> pretty<00:06:35.300> low<00:06:35.630> quality<00:06:35.900> in<00:06:36.200> my

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:36.350 
pretty they're pretty low quality in my

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:41.740 
pretty they're pretty low quality in my
opinion<00:06:38.229> on<00:06:39.229> the<00:06:39.560> low<00:06:39.740> setting<00:06:40.360> at<00:06:41.360> least<00:06:41.600> on

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:41.750 
opinion on the low setting at least on

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.920 
opinion on the low setting at least on
this<00:06:41.900> player<00:06:42.260> I<00:06:42.940> would<00:06:43.940> not<00:06:44.120> watch<00:06:44.389> a<00:06:44.510> video<00:06:44.780> at

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:44.930 
this player I would not watch a video at

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.020 
this player I would not watch a video at
that<00:06:45.139> quality<00:06:45.650> if<00:06:46.310> I<00:06:46.460> was<00:06:46.550> going<00:06:46.669> to<00:06:46.760> watch<00:06:46.880> it

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.030 
that quality if I was going to watch it

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.159 
that quality if I was going to watch it
that<00:06:47.180> quality<00:06:47.570> I'll<00:06:47.690> go<00:06:47.810> ahead<00:06:47.900> and<00:06:47.990> download

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:48.169 
that quality I'll go ahead and download

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:49.780 
that quality I'll go ahead and download
the<00:06:48.560> standard<00:06:48.979> definition<00:06:49.490> because<00:06:49.669> it's

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:49.790 
the standard definition because it's

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.940 
the standard definition because it's
basically<00:06:50.030> what<00:06:50.389> it<00:06:50.419> looks<00:06:50.660> like<00:06:50.889> now<00:06:51.889> the

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:53.690 
videos on that side I'm not saying

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:55.120 
videos on that side I'm not saying
they're<00:06:53.870> standard<00:06:54.200> definition<00:06:54.770> I'm<00:06:54.889> saying

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.130 
they're standard definition I'm saying

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.379 
they're standard definition I'm saying
the<00:06:55.370> low<00:06:56.240> quality<00:06:56.600> setting<00:06:57.169> on<00:06:57.350> this<00:06:57.530> player

00:06:58.379 --> 00:06:58.389 
the low quality setting on this player

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:00.909 
the low quality setting on this player
really<00:06:59.389> terms<00:06:59.660> of<00:06:59.930> quality<00:07:00.110> down<00:07:00.530> really<00:07:00.830> low

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:00.919 
really terms of quality down really low

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:03.370 
really terms of quality down really low
and<00:07:01.370> you<00:07:01.880> can<00:07:02.030> see<00:07:02.210> it<00:07:02.360> still<00:07:02.660> did<00:07:02.840> not<00:07:02.870> play<00:07:03.199> it

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:03.380 
and you can see it still did not play it

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.659 
and you can see it still did not play it
