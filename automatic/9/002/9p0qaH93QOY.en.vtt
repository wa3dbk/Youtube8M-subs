so<00:00:07.170> our<00:00:07.290> maintenance<00:00:07.529> Monday<00:00:07.919> series<00:00:08.189> is

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
so our maintenance Monday series is

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.160 
so our maintenance Monday series is
designed<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.210> be<00:00:09.330> about<00:00:09.510> things<00:00:09.719> you<00:00:09.900> can<00:00:10.050> do

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
designed to be about things you can do

designed to be about things you can do
for<00:00:10.320> your<00:00:10.410> truck<00:00:10.650> to<00:00:10.860> either<00:00:11.099> increase<00:00:11.550> the

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:11.719 
for your truck to either increase the

something you need to be aware of so it

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.150 
something you need to be aware of so it
doesn't<00:00:24.750> happen<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:25.109> you<00:00:25.289> because<00:00:25.710> we<00:00:25.949> see<00:00:26.130> it

I got a 2011 LML here it's got 50,000

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.630 
I got a 2011 LML here it's got 50,000
miles<00:00:32.099> on<00:00:32.279> its<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.489> fleet<00:00:32.730> truck<00:00:33.030> driven<00:00:33.690> by

whoever right gets driven all over the
region<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.950> gets<00:00:40.950> fuel<00:00:41.250> from<00:00:41.700> God<00:00:42.300> knows

region and gets fuel from God knows
where<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.489> unfortunately<00:00:44.489> that's<00:00:44.670> why<00:00:44.910> it's

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
where and unfortunately that's why it's

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.900 
where and unfortunately that's why it's
here<00:00:45.530> came<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.770> us<00:00:46.920> with<00:00:47.100> low<00:00:47.309> rail<00:00:47.550> pressure

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
here came to us with low rail pressure

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.970 
here came to us with low rail pressure
could<00:00:48.780> hardly<00:00:49.020> rev<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.379> up<00:00:49.440> an<00:00:49.559> idle<00:00:49.860> without

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
could hardly rev it up an idle without

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.970 
could hardly rev it up an idle without
it<00:00:50.219> going<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.610> limb<00:00:50.760> mode<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.570> throwing

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
it going in the limb mode and throwing

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.689 
it going in the limb mode and throwing
dtc<00:00:52.980> codes<00:00:53.250> for<00:00:53.520> low<00:00:53.579> pressure<00:00:55.340> we<00:00:56.340> talked<00:00:56.610> to

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
dtc codes for low pressure we talked to

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.580 
dtc codes for low pressure we talked to
the<00:00:56.789> owner<00:00:56.820> he<00:00:57.390> told<00:00:57.629> us<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:58.410> probably

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
the owner he told us that it probably

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.650 
the owner he told us that it probably
got<00:00:58.859> some<00:00:59.039> water<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.579> fuel<00:00:59.850> he<00:01:00.390> drained

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
got some water in the fuel he drained

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.569 
got some water in the fuel he drained
the<00:01:00.719> fuel<00:01:00.960> system<00:01:01.199> thought<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:01.949> might<00:01:02.100> fix<00:01:02.340> it

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
the fuel system thought it might fix it

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.380 
the fuel system thought it might fix it
it<00:01:03.359> didn't<00:01:03.979> unfortunately<00:01:04.979> once<00:01:05.909> we<00:01:06.060> started

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
it didn't unfortunately once we started

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.149 
it didn't unfortunately once we started
taking<00:01:06.540> lines<00:01:06.900> off<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.530> checking<00:01:07.950> out<00:01:08.010> the

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
taking lines off and checking out the

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.300 
taking lines off and checking out the
pump<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.549> injectors<00:01:09.619> just<00:01:10.619> just<00:01:11.010> taking<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
pump and injectors just just taking the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.710 
pump and injectors just just taking the
lines<00:01:11.460> off<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.760> looking<00:01:11.970> inside<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.510> them<00:01:12.600> we

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
lines off and looking inside of them we

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.820 
lines off and looking inside of them we
started<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.080> see<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.260> lot<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.470> things<00:01:13.710> that

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
started to see a lot of things that

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.460 
started to see a lot of things that
really<00:01:14.070> shouldn't<00:01:14.369> be<00:01:14.490> there<00:01:15.110> you<00:01:16.110> can<00:01:16.140> take<00:01:16.409> a

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
really shouldn't be there you can take a

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.670 
really shouldn't be there you can take a
look<00:01:16.680> at<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.689> inside<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.900> injector<00:01:19.380> here

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
look at the inside of the injector here

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.109 
look at the inside of the injector here
and<00:01:19.860> just<00:01:20.759> see<00:01:21.030> how<00:01:21.860> brown<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:24.320> pitted<00:01:25.320> and

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
and just see how brown and pitted and

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.890 
and just see how brown and pitted and
you<00:01:27.119> know<00:01:27.210> full<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.780> debris<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.320> junk<00:01:29.900> once

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
you know full of debris and junk once

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.560 
you know full of debris and junk once
that<00:01:31.200> water<00:01:31.740> rust<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.820> surface<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.450> get

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
that water rust the surface and you get

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.560 
that water rust the surface and you get
that<00:01:33.750> corrosion<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.500> get<00:01:34.650> debris<00:01:35.570> those

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
that corrosion and you get debris those

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.480 
that corrosion and you get debris those
surfaces<00:01:37.140> aren't<00:01:37.350> allowed<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.560> seal<00:01:37.860> anymore

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
surfaces aren't allowed to seal anymore

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.740 
surfaces aren't allowed to seal anymore
and<00:01:38.790> when<00:01:38.939> you're<00:01:39.060> running<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.360> system<00:01:39.659> at

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
and when you're running a system at

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.550 
and when you're running a system at
30,000<00:01:40.500> psi<00:01:40.680> any<00:01:41.840> mating<00:01:42.840> surface<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.409> isn't

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.420 
sealing anymore any machine' surface
like<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.439> going<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.710> leak<00:01:46.890> fuel<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.340> it's

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
like that is going to leak fuel and it's

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.969 
like that is going to leak fuel and it's
going<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.579> come<00:01:47.790> out<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.030> returns<00:01:48.470> and<00:01:49.470> when

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
going to come out the returns and when

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.889 
going to come out the returns and when
that<00:01:50.130> fuel<00:01:50.399> goes<00:01:50.549> out<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.759> returns<00:01:51.090> it's<00:01:51.720> not

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
that fuel goes out the returns it's not

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.660 
that fuel goes out the returns it's not
going<00:01:52.170> into<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.439> engine<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:52.890> that's<00:01:53.520> when

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
going into the engine and that's when

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.899 
going into the engine and that's when
you<00:01:53.759> get<00:01:53.880> low<00:01:54.030> fuel<00:01:54.299> pressure<00:01:55.759> what<00:01:56.759> this

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
you get low fuel pressure what this

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.510 
you get low fuel pressure what this
means<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.500> we<00:01:58.500> got<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.740> drop<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.310> tank

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
means is that we got to drop the tank

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.700 
means is that we got to drop the tank
flush<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.149> whole<00:02:00.270> tank<00:02:00.540> we<00:02:01.320> looked<00:02:01.530> at<00:02:01.619> the

flush the whole tank we looked at the

in<00:02:03.869> them<00:02:03.990> they<00:02:04.140> look<00:02:04.320> like<00:02:04.500> hell<00:02:04.710> we<00:02:05.340> got<00:02:05.430> to

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
in them they look like hell we got to

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.479 
in them they look like hell we got to
replace<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.420> low<00:02:06.540> side<00:02:06.750> fuel<00:02:07.079> lines<00:02:07.489> replace

the cp4 pump

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.530 
the cp4 pump
I'm<00:02:10.379> sure<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.129> bores<00:02:11.400> in<00:02:11.610> this<00:02:11.730> pump<00:02:12.000> have

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
I'm sure the bores in this pump have

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.820 
I'm sure the bores in this pump have
been<00:02:12.720> destroyed

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
been destroyed

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.530 
been destroyed
and<00:02:13.920> it's<00:02:14.310> probably<00:02:14.490> pushed<00:02:14.880> a<00:02:15.030> lot<00:02:15.150> of<00:02:15.300> debris

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
and it's probably pushed a lot of debris

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.840 
and it's probably pushed a lot of debris

you<00:02:18.750> know<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.110> injection<00:02:19.920> lines<00:02:20.160> we<00:02:20.430> don't

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
you know the injection lines we don't

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.890 
you know the injection lines we don't
know<00:02:20.670> what's<00:02:20.850> inside<00:02:21.180> them<00:02:21.420> so<00:02:21.630> we<00:02:21.690> have<00:02:21.780> to

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
know what's inside them so we have to

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.180 
know what's inside them so we have to
replace<00:02:21.990> those<00:02:22.440> as<00:02:22.680> well
