00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.240 
you know that the bacon you're buying is
gluten-free<00:02:19.750> because<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.620> tricky<00:02:20.950> thing

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
gluten-free because the tricky thing

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.610 
gluten-free because the tricky thing
about<00:02:21.280> bacon<00:02:21.910> is<00:02:22.030> that<00:02:22.240> a<00:02:22.450> lot<00:02:23.050> of<00:02:23.110> it<00:02:23.350> says

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
about bacon is that a lot of it says

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.610 
about bacon is that a lot of it says
hardwood<00:02:24.490> smoked<00:02:24.910> or<00:02:25.300> you<00:02:25.840> know<00:02:25.960> applewood

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
hardwood smoked or you know applewood

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.520 
hardwood smoked or you know applewood
smoked<00:02:26.980> or<00:02:27.280> any<00:02:27.580> of<00:02:27.760> those<00:02:27.880> kind<00:02:28.210> of<00:02:28.240> words<00:02:28.530> the

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
smoked or any of those kind of words the

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.230 
smoked or any of those kind of words the
thing<00:02:29.740> is<00:02:29.770> you<00:02:30.280> can't<00:02:30.550> trust<00:02:30.850> that<00:02:31.060> it's

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
thing is you can't trust that it's

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.390 
thing is you can't trust that it's
actually<00:02:31.480> smoked<00:02:32.290> and<00:02:32.710> that<00:02:32.980> they<00:02:33.160> haven't

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
actually smoked and that they haven't

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.690 
actually smoked and that they haven't
just<00:02:33.730> added<00:02:34.120> smoke<00:02:34.390> flavoring<00:02:34.900> a<00:02:35.110> lot<00:02:35.350> of

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
just added smoke flavoring a lot of

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.640 
just added smoke flavoring a lot of
labeling<00:02:36.700> is<00:02:36.970> kind<00:02:37.540> of<00:02:37.660> tricky<00:02:37.840> for<00:02:38.320> bacon<00:02:38.650> so

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
labeling is kind of tricky for bacon so

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.850 
labeling is kind of tricky for bacon so
my<00:02:41.650> best<00:02:42.190> advice<00:02:42.630> would<00:02:43.630> be<00:02:43.690> to<00:02:43.870> know<00:02:44.380> where

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
my best advice would be to know where

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.560 
my best advice would be to know where
you're<00:02:45.040> getting<00:02:45.190> it<00:02:45.430> from<00:02:45.670> go<00:02:46.180> ahead<00:02:46.330> and<00:02:46.450> wash

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
you're getting it from go ahead and wash

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.930 
you're getting it from go ahead and wash
your<00:02:46.840> hands<00:02:47.260> after<00:02:47.410> touching<00:02:47.740> the<00:02:48.190> bacon<00:02:48.520> so

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
your hands after touching the bacon so

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.630 
your hands after touching the bacon so
use<00:02:49.480> hot<00:02:49.810> water<00:02:50.020> and<00:02:50.320> soap<00:02:50.590> every<00:02:50.890> time<00:02:51.459> you

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
use hot water and soap every time you

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.240 
use hot water and soap every time you
touch<00:02:51.820> meat<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:53.440> want<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:53.680> make<00:02:53.800> sure<00:02:53.830> you<00:02:54.130> get

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
touch meat you want to make sure you get

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.920 
touch meat you want to make sure you get
that<00:02:54.490> stuff<00:02:54.760> off<00:02:54.910> of<00:02:55.150> your<00:02:55.209> hands<00:02:55.450> before<00:02:55.750> you

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
that stuff off of your hands before you

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.260 
that stuff off of your hands before you
touch<00:02:56.020> anything<00:02:56.470> else<00:02:56.820> now<00:02:57.820> we're<00:02:57.970> just<00:02:58.180> gonna

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
touch anything else now we're just gonna

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.910
