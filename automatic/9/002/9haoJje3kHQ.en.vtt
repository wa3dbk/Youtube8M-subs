00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.460
 haitham today I came here like you 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.820
 can see that in the video description for 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.000
 talk about my cameras that I use and 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.740
 The editors then start talking 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.390
 We talked about the camera that is here in the 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.220
 my lap that is here does not have 13 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.210
 I think most women use 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:27.420
 This camera is recording. I use it for 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.710
 one reason is I have avarice letters from 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.769
 16 giga 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.930
 Only it records health according to the US. 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.940
 I know why this happens but I do not 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.710
 I can record more than eight seconds with 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.770
 mine owns 13 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.350
 so she just to take pictures all 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.579
 the photos you see there on the blog 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.860
 a lot of the day 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.100
 I always had with this camera taste 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.980
 much of it and it's very hard to believe 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.160
 a photo I do not know there a mistake in the photo I 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.989
 I think this has never happened because 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.739
 camera has a very high quality when 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.340
 your hd 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.890
 11 so there is the yes editor picture to 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.400
 I only look at or darken the photo at 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.560
 Sometimes I take a picture and it's too loud. 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.220
 It's very clear I know or some 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.170
 team today is that I use is the photo 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.689
 photofiltre studio I do not know if I am 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.290
 talking right but it's a story that I 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:26.640
 I have been for a very very long time. 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.680
 in fake time then the gravity of the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.369
 Do you miss any name? Yes, you know that. 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.590
 whole thing and use the editor so kiss the 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.500
 I never gave up and until today 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.180
 uses on the mainly clear of 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.729
 daring the photo is not because the 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.409
 photoshop I can not move you have more 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.270
 To play is really very difficult for me. 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.970
 and I do not think there's any need either 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.009
 now also has a blog that also 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.860
 likes to take pictures for what days and not 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.979
 has is a professional camera a semi 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.320
 normal camera like anyone else it 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.469
 want to give an honor that will stay in the photo 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:05.120
 It's good to have a cool photo attitude to give. 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:07.010
 that known 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.369
 also lack legal always have a publisher 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:13.520
 of photos ah and I still use lens that I 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.590
 I have in the camera either 18 mm 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.290
 but I want to switch mainly power 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.750
 take photos at night because otherwise 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.810
 camera limping too close and dark 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.760
 with this camera is not subjective so I 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.340
 I want to buy an objective lens 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.270
 A little clearer you take nice pictures. 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.540
 in the evening 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.910
 Now let's talk about this camera as it already 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.920
 I told you my 13 I did not 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.960
 I can record more than eight seconds 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.210
 I do not know what happens I never so 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.360
 16 call so I can not get 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.280
 this camera and record another one I'll see 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.480
 if I can record a little showing 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.430
 the camera for you 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:56.180
 finally the camera of the years that I always 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:58.850
 I used the lumix from panasonic to dmc fz35 and 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.050
 She does not have any objective to change the lens. 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.810
 none 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:06.650
 she fixed it is an unprofessional one 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.570
 serious hd to my 13 tie in fury is the 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.880
 that has a small difference it has 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.950
 auto focus is very good taste very 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.900
 of this camera and of convincing it 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.000
 because I have always liked photography 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.120
 so when I was younger video goes 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.400
 give me a semi-professional camera 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.290
 so that's why I've always used it 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.380
 this camera does not attack 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:32.410
 now in relation to the video editor I 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:35.270
 I started with the publisher that was video asks 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.520
 We're having a lot of trouble. 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.330
 do not remember that in the video the videos 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.330
 were in the final 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.860
 I do not know if the problem was the editor or 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.790
 youtube because on my computer at the time 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.160
 to install 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.590
 then she took it when she went to the 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.080
 youtube that gave me trouble so me 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.040
 I think it's an editor problem 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.709
 with youtube 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.950
 but ultimately did not believe and users of 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:05.930
 nymex is a long time but a year to 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:08.030
 less than suzane old pro 11 my 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.700
 11 that I use I have to update the 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.590
 new version but it 's a wonderful show I 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.630
 I like editors very much 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.730
 so enough for me is not enough 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.510
 I intend to change us so fast only 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.240
 update that there folks 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.860
 I want to have resolved your doubts. 

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.020
 because many girls asked that 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.460
 camera used to record is the same as 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.950
 I used to take pictures 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.780
 I hope to have solved the editors I will 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.640
 let their name go down here there 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.080
 on the blog too right in case you 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.240
 Wanna this? 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.900
 I hope you enjoyed it if you heal and even 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.900
 the next video
