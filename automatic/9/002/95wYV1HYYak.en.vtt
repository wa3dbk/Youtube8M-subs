 turn the video you see well that 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:03.079
 it's not a bet when I'm in 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.029
 in the menu of the ps4 so to challenge his 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.799
 ps button you go in the part you 

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:09.110
 made cross to join the session 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.970
 you click on a moon actually join 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.890
 transfer is the most 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.990
 important is that you strafe the 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.150
 Example cross button and increase it 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.070
 bowed right excuse me as soon as 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.930
 you pressed a prophet button 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.920
 that the right arrow some of these 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.630
 notes this alert message 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.300
 once you but that message 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.440
 green is that the glitch frolics products 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.220
 work well you have it well 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.020
 successful if it's worth it but not for 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.120
 start once it's done you 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.950
 have it tender the 10 seconds and I 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.030
 say about ten seconds the video 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.100
 I waited fifteen seconds 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.300
 so take as much as you want if you 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.220
 do not wait ten seconds it'll be 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.880
 missed so I was driving a take yet 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.890
 by the way not that I have a small 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.670
 dedication acquired she who helped me to 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.540
 do these little jewels 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.070
 so there on the other hand the only problem 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.170
 it's going to be quite a long time 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:01.550
 loading to leave the activity 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.080

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.090

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.820

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.440
 if it makes you that like me that you 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.310
 made bugger blow a little teleport 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.340
 from one end to the other 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.080
 the void has worked well 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.220

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.450

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.160
 descended place in front of the fear of the garage 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.569
