hey<00:00:04.650> there<00:00:04.859> i'm<00:00:05.250> dr.<00:00:05.759> kay<00:00:05.910> and<00:00:06.180> in<00:00:06.569> today's

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
hey there i'm dr. kay and in today's

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.110 
hey there i'm dr. kay and in today's
episode<00:00:07.020> we're<00:00:07.680> gonna<00:00:07.859> learn<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.639> rules<00:00:08.910> of

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
episode we're gonna learn the rules of

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.700 
episode we're gonna learn the rules of
angles<00:00:10.010> so<00:00:11.010> let's<00:00:11.400> draw<00:00:11.610> some<00:00:11.790> angles<00:00:12.710> we'll

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
angles so let's draw some angles we'll

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.990 
angles so let's draw some angles we'll
start<00:00:14.130> with<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.730> 90<00:00:15.210> degree<00:00:15.509> angle<00:00:16.490> 90<00:00:17.490> degree

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
start with a 90 degree angle 90 degree

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.370 
start with a 90 degree angle 90 degree
angle<00:00:18.449> looks<00:00:19.199> like<00:00:19.410> this<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:20.930> we<00:00:21.930> can<00:00:22.080> denote

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
angle looks like this and we can denote

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.349 
angle looks like this and we can denote
it<00:00:22.529> with<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.769> little<00:00:23.010> square<00:00:23.430> box<00:00:23.460> inside<00:00:24.150> the

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
it with a little square box inside the

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.109 
it with a little square box inside the
angle<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:25.560> it's<00:00:25.800> 90<00:00:26.130> degrees<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.730> this<00:00:26.970> is

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
angle so it's 90 degrees and this is

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.620 
angle so it's 90 degrees and this is
called<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.599> right<00:00:27.840> angle<00:00:28.699> now<00:00:29.699> if<00:00:30.000> we<00:00:30.179> have<00:00:30.390> an

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
called a right angle now if we have an

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.280 
called a right angle now if we have an
angle<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.349> has<00:00:32.130> smaller<00:00:33.059> than<00:00:33.570> 90<00:00:33.960> degrees

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
angle that has smaller than 90 degrees

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.920 
angle that has smaller than 90 degrees
inside<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:35.670> looks<00:00:35.940> something<00:00:36.210> like<00:00:36.360> this

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
inside it looks something like this

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.319 
inside it looks something like this
and<00:00:37.730> this<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.879> called<00:00:39.030> an<00:00:39.360> acute<00:00:39.750> angle<00:00:41.329> cute

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
and this is called an acute angle cute

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:42.880 
and this is called an acute angle cute
huh

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
huh

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.220 
huh
okay<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.460> let's<00:00:45.000> say<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.539> have<00:00:45.719> an<00:00:45.870> angle

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
okay so let's say that you have an angle

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.410 
okay so let's say that you have an angle
that's<00:00:46.410> bigger<00:00:46.770> than<00:00:47.010> 90<00:00:47.309> degrees<00:00:47.610> it's<00:00:48.270> gonna

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
that's bigger than 90 degrees it's gonna

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.720 
that's bigger than 90 degrees it's gonna
look<00:00:48.660> something<00:00:48.899> like<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.829> this<00:00:50.670> is

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
look something like that and this is

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:58.369 
look something like that and this is
called<00:00:51.120> an<00:00:51.360> obtuse<00:00:51.719> angle<00:00:56.660> now<00:00:57.660> we're<00:00:58.260> going

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
called an obtuse angle now we're going

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.840 
called an obtuse angle now we're going
to<00:00:58.440> talk<00:00:58.620> about<00:00:58.649> complementary<00:00:59.640> and

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
to talk about complementary and

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.310 
to talk about complementary and
supplementary<00:00:59.879> angles<00:01:00.840> if<00:01:02.059> you<00:01:03.059> have<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.570> 90

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
supplementary angles if you have a 90

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.270 
supplementary angles if you have a 90
degree<00:01:04.589> angle<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:06.000> split<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.689> half<00:01:07.280> let's

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
degree angle that is split in half let's

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.780 
degree angle that is split in half let's
say<00:01:08.549> one<00:01:09.540> side<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:10.049> 58<00:01:10.710> degrees<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.640> other

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
say one side is 58 degrees the other

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.850 
say one side is 58 degrees the other
side<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.330> 32<00:01:13.189> degrees<00:01:14.189> but<00:01:14.850> they<00:01:15.000> add<00:01:15.150> up<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.360> 90

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
side is 32 degrees but they add up to 90

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.380 
side is 32 degrees but they add up to 90
these<00:01:16.860> two<00:01:17.100> angles<00:01:17.250> right<00:01:17.640> here<00:01:17.909> are<00:01:18.090> called

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
these two angles right here are called

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.999 
these two angles right here are called
complementary<00:01:18.990> angles<00:01:20.210> and<00:01:21.680> if<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.860> have<00:01:22.979> a

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
complementary angles and if you have a

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.300 
complementary angles and if you have a
situation<00:01:23.220> where<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.909> have<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.600> line<00:01:25.280> which<00:01:26.280> is

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
situation where you have a line which is

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.950 
situation where you have a line which is
180<00:01:27.299> degrees

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
180 degrees

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.740 
180 degrees
that's<00:01:28.380> made<00:01:28.590> up<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.799> two<00:01:28.979> angles<00:01:29.570> this<00:01:30.570> is

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
that's made up of two angles this is

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.859 
that's made up of two angles this is
called<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.140> supplementary<00:01:31.770> angle<00:01:35.450> okay<00:01:36.479> well

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
called a supplementary angle okay well

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.899 
called a supplementary angle okay well
let's<00:01:37.170> get<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.409> little<00:01:37.530> bit<00:01:37.680> more<00:01:38.130> intimate<00:01:38.700> and

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
let's get a little bit more intimate and

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.190 
let's get a little bit more intimate and
we're<00:01:39.270> gonna<00:01:39.420> check<00:01:39.600> up<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.869> talk<00:01:40.049> about

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
we're gonna check up to talk about

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.270 
we're gonna check up to talk about
interior<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.310> exterior<00:01:41.549> angles<00:01:43.280> interior

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
interior and exterior angles interior

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.030 
interior and exterior angles interior
and<00:01:44.549> exterior<00:01:44.790> angles<00:01:45.630> come<00:01:46.409> up<00:01:46.560> when<00:01:46.890> you

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
and exterior angles come up when you

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.960 
and exterior angles come up when you
have<00:01:47.310> two<00:01:48.119> parallel<00:01:48.689> lines<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:49.970> are

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
have two parallel lines that are

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.389 
have two parallel lines that are
intersected<00:01:51.899> by<00:01:51.930> another<00:01:52.560> line<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:52.920> slices

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
intersected by another line that slices

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.560 
intersected by another line that slices
through<00:01:53.579> both<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:53.970> them<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:55.610> this<00:01:56.610> case<00:01:56.909> the

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
through both of them in this case the

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.160 
through both of them in this case the
rules<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.960> geometry<00:01:58.140> tell<00:01:58.740> us<00:01:59.000> that<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.930> lines

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
rules of geometry tell us that the lines

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.020 
rules of geometry tell us that the lines
are<00:02:01.640> 180<00:02:02.640> degrees<00:02:02.759> in<00:02:03.450> all<00:02:04.079> cases<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:05.030> when

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
are 180 degrees in all cases and when

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.580 
are 180 degrees in all cases and when
they're<00:02:06.180> split<00:02:06.570> like<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.350> two

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
they're split like that and the two

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.089 
they're split like that and the two
lines<00:02:07.799> are<00:02:07.979> parallel<00:02:08.190> we<00:02:09.149> know<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:10.099> these

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
lines are parallel we know that these

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.870 
lines are parallel we know that these
angles<00:02:11.580> right<00:02:11.760> here<00:02:12.060> are

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
angles right here are

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.620 
angles right here are
well<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:13.300> so<00:02:14.140> are<00:02:14.410> these<00:02:15.040> angles<00:02:15.520> they<00:02:16.450> all

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
well and so are these angles they all

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.170 
well and so are these angles they all
have<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.930> same<00:02:17.170> measure<00:02:17.380> let's<00:02:18.010> say<00:02:18.310> that

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
have the same measure let's say that

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.480 
have the same measure let's say that
measure<00:02:19.390> can<00:02:19.720> be<00:02:20.130> 32<00:02:21.130> degrees<00:02:23.070> and<00:02:24.070> the

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
measure can be 32 degrees and the

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.020 
measure can be 32 degrees and the
opposite<00:02:25.180> angles<00:02:25.920> all<00:02:26.920> of<00:02:27.160> these<00:02:27.310> right<00:02:27.580> here

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
opposite angles all of these right here

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.310 
opposite angles all of these right here
right<00:02:28.630> here<00:02:29.070> here<00:02:30.070> and<00:02:30.280> here<00:02:30.900> would<00:02:31.900> have<00:02:32.110> to

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
right here here and here would have to

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.090 
right here here and here would have to
add<00:02:32.470> up<00:02:32.500> with<00:02:32.890> 32<00:02:33.280> degrees<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:34.090> equal<00:02:34.540> 180<00:02:35.170> so

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
add up with 32 degrees to equal 180 so

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:42.450 
add up with 32 degrees to equal 180 so
they<00:02:36.700> would<00:02:36.940> all<00:02:37.150> be<00:02:37.590> 158<00:02:38.590> degrees<00:02:41.280> there<00:02:42.280> you

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
they would all be 158 degrees there you
