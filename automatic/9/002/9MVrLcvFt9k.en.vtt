on it see how shaman's blue normally got
a<00:03:09.170> few<00:03:09.650> white<00:03:09.800> kernels<00:03:10.220> and<00:03:10.430> some<00:03:11.380> purple<00:03:12.380> blue

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
a few white kernels and some purple blue

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.810 
a few white kernels and some purple blue
and<00:03:13.510> that's<00:03:14.510> kind<00:03:14.720> of<00:03:14.750> weird<00:03:14.900> huh<00:03:15.410> see<00:03:16.370> it's

and that's kind of weird huh see it's

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.699 
and that's kind of weird huh see it's
when<00:03:17.000> you<00:03:17.060> grow<00:03:17.209> corn<00:03:17.510> get<00:03:18.049> enough<00:03:18.290> seats<00:03:18.530> that

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
when you grow corn get enough seats that

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.199 
when you grow corn get enough seats that
you<00:03:18.799> can<00:03:18.920> only<00:03:19.040> see<00:03:19.130> say<00:03:19.549> some<00:03:19.760> don't<00:03:20.030> always

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
you can only see say some don't always

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.229 
you can only see say some don't always
plant<00:03:20.570> all<00:03:20.750> of<00:03:20.780> your<00:03:20.959> seed<00:03:21.140> stuff<00:03:21.380> with<00:03:21.560> corn

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
plant all of your seed stuff with corn

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.460 
plant all of your seed stuff with corn
because<00:03:23.239> you<00:03:23.780> never<00:03:23.900> know<00:03:24.110> you<00:03:24.170> might<00:03:24.410> have

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
because you never know you might have

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.050 
because you never know you might have
some<00:03:24.709> neighbor<00:03:25.130> across<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.459> street<00:03:25.610> growing

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
some neighbor across the street growing

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.319 
some neighbor across the street growing
GMO<00:03:27.019> corn<00:03:27.500> and<00:03:27.769> if<00:03:28.340> you<00:03:28.459> can<00:03:28.640> see<00:03:28.850> here

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
GMO corn and if you can see here

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.500 
GMO corn and if you can see here
GMO<00:03:30.019> is<00:03:30.290> normally<00:03:30.950> filled<00:03:31.640> corn<00:03:32.000> okay<00:03:32.360> we're

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
GMO is normally filled corn okay we're

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.640 
GMO is normally filled corn okay we're
talking<00:03:32.570> about<00:03:32.720> field<00:03:32.959> corn<00:03:33.170> is<00:03:33.320> normally

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
talking about field corn is normally

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.650 
talking about field corn is normally
yellow<00:03:33.920> and<00:03:34.130> you<00:03:34.700> can<00:03:34.850> actually<00:03:35.030> see<00:03:35.480> the

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
yellow and you can actually see the

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.740 
yellow and you can actually see the
genetics<00:03:36.110> that<00:03:36.489> happen<00:03:37.489> in<00:03:37.670> this<00:03:38.060> planting<00:03:38.600> in

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
genetics that happen in this planting in

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.259 
genetics that happen in this planting in
the<00:03:38.810> corn<00:03:39.459> so<00:03:40.459> for<00:03:40.670> example<00:03:40.970> I<00:03:41.000> mean<00:03:41.150> I've

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
the corn so for example I mean I've

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:42.640 
the corn so for example I mean I've
planted<00:03:41.510> this<00:03:41.750> corn<00:03:42.049> this<00:03:42.230> year<00:03:42.380> and<00:03:42.500> it<00:03:42.560> was

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
planted this corn this year and it was

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.979 
planted this corn this year and it was
all<00:03:42.769> shot<00:03:43.010> in<00:03:43.190> the<00:03:43.250> blue<00:03:43.459> but<00:03:44.239> these<00:03:44.420> tassels

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
all shot in the blue but these tassels

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.720 
all shot in the blue but these tassels
were<00:03:45.110> pollinated<00:03:45.739> by<00:03:45.769> a<00:03:45.920> different<00:03:46.579> type<00:03:46.700> of

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
were pollinated by a different type of

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.229 
were pollinated by a different type of
corn<00:03:47.120> so<00:03:47.930> you<00:03:48.170> can<00:03:48.320> actually<00:03:48.650> see<00:03:48.860> the<00:03:48.980> color

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
corn so you can actually see the color

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.930 
corn so you can actually see the color
directly<00:03:50.239> in<00:03:50.690> this<00:03:51.010> now<00:03:52.010> what<00:03:52.250> that<00:03:52.280> means<00:03:52.400> is

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
directly in this now what that means is

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.270 
directly in this now what that means is
you<00:03:53.299> can<00:03:53.450> actually<00:03:53.630> take<00:03:54.350> certain<00:03:54.739> kernels

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
you can actually take certain kernels

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.699 
you can actually take certain kernels
and<00:03:55.910> only<00:03:56.150> plant<00:03:56.420> colors<00:03:56.870> of<00:03:57.079> certain<00:03:57.350> kernels

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
and only plant colors of certain kernels

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.610 
and only plant colors of certain kernels
like<00:03:58.340> let's<00:03:58.579> say<00:03:58.670> these<00:03:58.790> white<00:03:59.000> ones<00:03:59.530> see<00:04:00.530> all

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
like let's say these white ones see all

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.410 
like let's say these white ones see all
the<00:04:00.680> white<00:04:00.829> kernels<00:04:01.220> in<00:04:01.310> here<00:04:01.519> I<00:04:01.670> can<00:04:02.180> plant

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
the white kernels in here I can plant

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.860 
the white kernels in here I can plant
just<00:04:02.720> white<00:04:03.049> kernels<00:04:03.730> next<00:04:04.730> year<00:04:05.000> and<00:04:05.180> maybe

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
just white kernels next year and maybe

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.789 
just white kernels next year and maybe
have<00:04:06.820> shamans<00:04:07.820> white<00:04:08.120> plot<00:04:09.019> pop<00:04:09.560> popcorn

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
have shamans white plot pop popcorn

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.310 
have shamans white plot pop popcorn
shamans<00:04:10.700> white<00:04:10.880> popcorn<00:04:11.120> where<00:04:12.049> it's<00:04:12.170> all

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
shamans white popcorn where it's all

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.560 
shamans white popcorn where it's all
white<00:04:12.620> with<00:04:12.890> a<00:04:12.950> few<00:04:13.220> blue<00:04:13.489> kernels<00:04:13.880> because<00:04:14.480> of

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
white with a few blue kernels because of

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.099 
white with a few blue kernels because of
the<00:04:14.630> genetics<00:04:15.100> so<00:04:16.660> yeah<00:04:17.660> you<00:04:17.720> would<00:04:17.900> see

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
the genetics so yeah you would see

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.979 
the genetics so yeah you would see
yellow<00:04:18.530> kernels<00:04:19.030> if<00:04:20.030> it<00:04:20.390> was<00:04:20.479> pollinated<00:04:20.959> by

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
yellow kernels if it was pollinated by

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.159 
yellow kernels if it was pollinated by
field<00:04:21.289> corner

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
field corner

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.649 
field corner

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
about growing plants and you know the

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.929 
about growing plants and you know the
little<00:04:46.469> bit<00:04:46.650> of<00:04:46.740> variation<00:04:47.069> and<00:04:47.550> stuff<00:04:47.759> like

00:04:47.929 --> 00:04:47.939 
little bit of variation and stuff like

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:48.379 
little bit of variation and stuff like
that

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
that

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:52.010 
that
and<00:04:49.009> I<00:04:50.009> grew<00:04:50.400> a<00:04:50.430> bunch<00:04:50.669> of<00:04:50.789> shamans<00:04:51.180> blue<00:04:51.419> last

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
and I grew a bunch of shamans blue last

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.649 
and I grew a bunch of shamans blue last
year<00:04:52.289> and<00:04:52.409> I<00:04:52.439> didn't<00:04:52.650> get<00:04:52.710> no<00:04:52.860> red<00:04:53.129> and<00:04:53.310> black

00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:53.659

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:58.309 
year and I didn't get no red and black
popcorn<00:04:55.310> so<00:04:56.310> I<00:04:56.729> mean<00:04:57.029> I<00:04:57.240> did<00:04:57.569> grow<00:04:57.750> a<00:04:57.779> red<00:04:58.050> sweet

00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 
corn this year so that might have

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:00.830 
corn this year so that might have
something<00:04:59.879> to<00:05:00.000> do<00:05:00.090> with<00:05:00.120> him<00:05:00.360> sure<00:05:00.599> it<00:05:00.689> has<00:05:00.810> a

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
the red sweet corn that I grew was a

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.300 
the red sweet corn that I grew was a
cross<00:05:47.819> between<00:05:48.060> two<00:05:48.719> heirlooms<00:05:49.620> which<00:05:50.099> is

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
cross between two heirlooms which is

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.019 
cross between two heirlooms which is
Silver<00:05:50.969> Queen<00:05:51.120> and<00:05:51.509> Seneca<00:05:52.289> red<00:05:52.610> so<00:05:53.610> this<00:05:53.849> is

00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:54.029 
Silver Queen and Seneca red so this is

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:56.929 
Silver Queen and Seneca red so this is
actually<00:05:54.330> a<00:05:54.360> try<00:05:54.750> genic<00:05:55.520> popcorn<00:05:56.520> if<00:05:56.789> it

00:05:56.929 --> 00:05:56.939 
actually a try genic popcorn if it

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:59.779 
actually a try genic popcorn if it
actually<00:05:57.529> but<00:05:58.529> actually<00:05:58.800> is<00:05:58.919> the<00:05:59.069> test<00:05:59.310> is<00:05:59.490> if

00:05:59.779 --> 00:05:59.789 
actually but actually is the test is if

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:01.909 
actually but actually is the test is if
it<00:05:59.939> actually<00:06:00.210> pops<00:06:00.389> so<00:06:01.020> I'll<00:06:01.560> probably<00:06:01.680> do<00:06:01.889> a

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
it actually pops so I'll probably do a

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.760 
it actually pops so I'll probably do a
future<00:06:02.129> video<00:06:02.339> of<00:06:02.610> that<00:06:02.759> to<00:06:03.750> see<00:06:03.930> if<00:06:04.020> this<00:06:04.259> this

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
future video of that to see if this this

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.529 
future video of that to see if this this
popcorn<00:06:05.219> here<00:06:05.370> pops<00:06:05.580> guys<00:06:06.199> I'll<00:06:07.199> take<00:06:07.379> care
