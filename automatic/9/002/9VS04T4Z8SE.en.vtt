00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
deal at all

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.440 
deal at all
since<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.980> 24<00:02:17.400> pin<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.820> eight<00:02:18.030> pin<00:02:18.240> power

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
since the 24 pin and eight pin power

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.720 
since the 24 pin and eight pin power
connectors<00:02:18.960> are<00:02:19.170> obligatory<00:02:19.860> connectors

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730

anyways<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:22.080> modular<00:02:22.590> connections<00:02:23.190> are

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
anyways the modular connections are

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.370 
anyways the modular connections are
color-coordinated<00:02:23.910> so<00:02:24.690> there's<00:02:24.870> no<00:02:25.140> way<00:02:25.320> to

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
color-coordinated so there's no way to

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.560 
color-coordinated so there's no way to
plug<00:02:25.650> in<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.980> wrong<00:02:26.190> cables<00:02:26.670> besides<00:02:27.270> there's

cables<00:03:37.200> are<00:03:37.350> fairly<00:03:37.709> long<00:03:38.070> so<00:03:38.550> there

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
cables are fairly long so there

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.180 
cables are fairly long so there
shouldn't<00:03:38.970> be<00:03:39.060> any<00:03:39.120> problem<00:03:39.750> alright<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.770> PSU

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
shouldn't be any problem alright the PSU

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.940 
shouldn't be any problem alright the PSU
itself<00:03:41.640> is<00:03:41.940> fairly<00:03:42.450> heavy<00:03:42.780> which<00:03:43.350> often<00:03:43.769> means

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
itself is fairly heavy which often means

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.350 
itself is fairly heavy which often means
better<00:03:44.190> quality<00:03:44.310> when<00:03:44.910> it<00:03:45.030> comes<00:03:45.209> to

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
better quality when it comes to

better quality when it comes to
reputable<00:03:46.100> manufacturers<00:03:47.100> so<00:03:47.670> let's<00:03:47.880> take

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
reputable manufacturers so let's take
