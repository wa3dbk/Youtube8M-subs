I mean it's got a glass cover on it it's

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.130 
I mean it's got a glass cover on it it's
really<00:00:52.160> really<00:00:52.519> light<00:00:52.809> spec<00:00:53.809> sheet<00:00:53.989> it<00:00:54.110> says

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
really really light spec sheet it says

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.770 
really really light spec sheet it says
it's<00:00:54.530> only<00:00:54.710> 1.1<00:00:55.280> kilograms<00:00:55.879> and<00:00:56.210> that's<00:00:56.690> a

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
it's only 1.1 kilograms and that's a

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.889 
it's only 1.1 kilograms and that's a
13.3<00:00:57.410> inch<00:00:57.710> notebook<00:00:58.160> right<00:00:58.370> so<00:00:59.210> in<00:00:59.720> this

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
13.3 inch notebook right so in this

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.509 
13.3 inch notebook right so in this
there's<00:01:00.379> still<00:01:00.710> the<00:01:00.890> core<00:01:01.089> i5<00:01:02.089> or<00:01:02.540> i7<00:01:02.600> 35<00:01:03.559> 737

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
there's still the core i5 or i7 35 737

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.870 
there's still the core i5 or i7 35 737
you<00:01:04.729> from<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:05.509> last<00:01:05.690> generation<00:01:06.369> or

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
you from the last generation or

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.220 
you from the last generation or
or<00:01:08.880> ivy<00:01:09.210> bridge<00:01:09.450> cpu<00:01:11.180> series<00:01:12.180> and

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.230 
or ivy bridge cpu series and

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.140 
or ivy bridge cpu series and
a<00:01:14.290> lot<00:01:14.710> of<00:01:14.740> power<00:01:15.040> so<00:01:15.340> it's<00:01:15.430> basically<00:01:15.610> I<00:01:15.850> think

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
a lot of power so it's basically I think

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.760 
a lot of power so it's basically I think
I<00:01:16.420> think<00:01:16.720> that's<00:01:16.840> a<00:01:16.960> 2.1<00:01:17.560> or<00:01:17.590> 2.0<00:01:19.470> process<00:01:20.470> that

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
I think that's a 2.1 or 2.0 process that

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.520 
I think that's a 2.1 or 2.0 process that
goes<00:01:21.070> up<00:01:21.310> to<00:01:21.550> 3.1<00:01:22.330> gigahertz<00:01:22.720> on<00:01:23.020> turbo<00:01:23.350> boost

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
goes up to 3.1 gigahertz on turbo boost

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.920 
goes up to 3.1 gigahertz on turbo boost
they<00:01:24.190> have<00:01:24.340> a<00:01:24.370> better<00:01:24.520> keyboard<00:01:24.910> that<00:01:25.900> is

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
they have a better keyboard that is

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.390 
they have a better keyboard that is
decently<00:01:26.440> sized<00:01:26.770> so<00:01:27.250> if<00:01:27.400> you<00:01:27.550> want<00:01:27.760> to

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
decently sized so if you want to

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.130 
decently sized so if you want to
if<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.000> want<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.240> type<00:01:30.420> it's<00:01:30.750> basically

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
if you want to type it's basically

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.810 
if you want to type it's basically
there's<00:01:31.560> lots<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.890> room<00:01:32.070> between<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.520> keys

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
there's lots of room between the keys

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.000 
there's lots of room between the keys
but<00:01:33.030> they're<00:01:33.210> big<00:01:33.420> enough<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.990> it's<00:01:34.560> easy<00:01:34.770> to

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 
but they're big enough and it's easy to

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.800 
but they're big enough and it's easy to
type<00:01:35.250> on<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.610> mean<00:01:35.730> I<00:01:35.820> have<00:01:36.000> big<00:01:36.210> fingers<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.750> a

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
type on I mean I have big fingers of a

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.370 
type on I mean I have big fingers of a
big<00:01:36.990> hat<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.610> it's<00:01:38.610> really<00:01:38.910> good<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.810> talk<00:01:40.140> to

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
big hat so it's really good to talk to

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.580 
big hat so it's really good to talk to
type<00:01:40.680> on<00:01:41.000> its<00:01:42.000> beclin<00:01:42.390> decent-sized<00:01:43.290> shift

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
type on its beclin decent-sized shift

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.580 
type on its beclin decent-sized shift
key<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:43.980> the<00:01:44.130> left

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
key on the left

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.840 
key on the left
and<00:01:45.600> on<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:46.719> right<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:48.070> function<00:01:48.399> buttons

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
and on the right the function buttons

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.600 
and on the right the function buttons
are

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
are

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.649 
are
multi-functional<00:01:51.610> so<00:01:51.850> you<00:01:51.909> basically<00:01:52.119> have

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
multi-functional so you basically have

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:58.320 
multi-functional so you basically have
the<00:01:52.689> have<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:53.200> FN<00:01:53.950> key<00:01:53.979> to<00:01:54.520> XD<00:01:55.740> trying

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
the have the FN key to XD trying

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.660 
the have the FN key to XD trying
between<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.720> functions<00:01:59.110> of<00:01:59.230> it<00:01:59.670> there's

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
between the functions of it there's

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.780 
between the functions of it there's
programmed

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
programmed

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.760 
programmed
drag<00:02:03.480> that<00:02:03.510> down<00:02:03.660> here<00:02:04.050> so<00:02:04.230> this<00:02:04.350> it's

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
drag that down here so this it's

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.850 
drag that down here so this it's
basically<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.250> click<00:02:05.460> pads<00:02:05.700> i<00:02:05.880> click<00:02:06.090> on<00:02:06.240> the

basically a click pads i click on the

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.090 
basically a click pads i click on the
on<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.580> track<00:02:07.880> pad<00:02:08.060> itself<00:02:08.710> the<00:02:09.710> surface

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
on the track pad itself the surface

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.310 
on the track pad itself the surface
feels<00:02:10.430> pretty<00:02:10.670> good<00:02:10.759> as<00:02:11.270> that's<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:11.930> surface

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
feels pretty good as that's the surface

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
there's as i said the core i7 in there

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.180 
there's as i said the core i7 in there
got<00:03:25.440> 128<00:03:25.890> gigabytes<00:03:26.489> of<00:03:26.610> ram<00:03:26.879> and<00:03:27.319> 256gb<00:03:28.319> SSD
