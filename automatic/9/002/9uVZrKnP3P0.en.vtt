00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.340
 is where I hope you are doing well 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.980
 today we offer ourselves for a 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.680
 video makeup so it's going to be in 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.960
 made of a kind of crash test reviews 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.230
 a box that was kindly 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.059
 sent by a cosmetics brand that 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.469
 is called michael plane paris as his 

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:34.110
 name indicated is a mark of 

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:36.750
 French cosmetics so it's before 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.270
 all for that I wanted to do this 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.010
 video has accepted this collaboration 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.899
 with them and to put forward a 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.730
 little bit French pictures that are not 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.050
 necessarily known and that I do not 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.300
 did not know personally 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.760
 the make-up brand difference and 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.739
 of basic cosmetics actually but 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.469
 as the donkey parry to a new concept 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.350
 who is the coaching make up so in fact 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.629
 I received their livery with the concept 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.890
 explained in it you can also 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.629
 put in info bar if that you 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.790
 interests a little more but basically 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.800
 what they do is they do the 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.080
 home sales coaching can 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.729
 even trained free people 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.180
 who would like to work as 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.530
 coach my coach makeup coach make up 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.390
 in their company 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.940
 so I found it really cool and 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.500
 also their products are made in 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.720
 France and are not tested on 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.070
 animals so a good point even more 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.770
 once so today I'm coming back 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.660
 to make this look I do not know if you 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.580
 see where you should have seen 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.030
 some too what does it look like so it 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.950
 is actually a make up that has been 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.750
 explained in a delivered in a box 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.760
 for the cabinet is like those 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.980
 this is very small and in fact they have 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.200
 three to four products in for 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.900
 make a make-up so obviously the make 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.030
 up will not be complete but it will be 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.620
 necessarily at least the make up of the eyes 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.380
 so you'll have to have some make-up 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.510
 eyelids either mascara or stuff 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.580
 like that but you will not have what 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.800
 to make all the complexion and all face in 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.920
 did I get a brush for me 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.720
 an eye shadow duo and a gloss 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.869
 so I'm going to actually make this 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.739
 makeup right now there now 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.970
 I will tell you my first 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.500
 impressions right away about 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.390
 products so I leave you with the 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.430
 video so I'm already well 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.319
 to moisturize the skin is obviously before 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.209
 start any makeup and 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.370
 must obviously hydrate your skin 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.049
 so I'll put myself in info bar all 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.150
 what I used before makeup 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.590
 eyes so I changed nothing 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.590
 special I made the dowsers already 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.090
 I did the dark circles and I did not 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.980
 still put powder I would put it to the 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.290
 end or we'll start with the 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.510
 makeup that advises me so in this 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.989
 little book is I'm going to follow at the 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.280
 letter even though I'm not a fan of 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.920
 the whale effect they recommend but 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.120
 good since it's kind of the principle of 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.989
 Ben box I will still try 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.510
 follow 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.160
 I'm going to take the golden honey lighthouse with 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.920
 the foam tip so that's what 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.950
 recommend in the book is applied his 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.940
 on the entire mobile eyelid for 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.069
 actually use as a species of 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.420
 base is always applied first the 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.220
 the clearest colors then the 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.650
 darker colors so obviously 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.569
 you can use that with a base 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.390
 to make it better but here I have 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.060
 decided to allow because that's what 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.859
 here I do not feel like so I have a big 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.090
 problem with the foam tips I know 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:19.430
 not why I think it explains 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.500
 really not good at what I do not know I 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.000
 am a little mixed on his already the 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.680
 the other end looks really great 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.629
 soft but then tongue or foam 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.069
 frankly it's not practical I think 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:29.540
 I've never liked that nico I 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.489
 do not know too much it's still 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.720
 professionals whose like I do them 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.910
 trust and I'm calm 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.580
 that's what gives it so it's pretty 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.440
 light I finally feel the camera 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.340
 now I'm going to take the lighthouse that 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.590
 is coppered with the brush on the true side 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.560
 brush what and I'm going to have to do a 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.510
 banana effect what I recommend is 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.370
 to open wide eyes for really 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.360
 go into the hollow and create it a 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.730
 banana species so I'm going to increase 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.310
 a little bit of brightness so you have to 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.930
 do well bananas and they say in 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.230
 to take yet new ones 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:10.050
 the foam tip and stretch the banana 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.800
 to the outside I do not know what 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.209
 what is it going to give 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.230
 I feel like it's not a 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:19.590
 do not know what 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:23.910
 and also tell me to take copper 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:25.770
 and get started if there I did 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.360
 the other eye so frankly it seems 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.720
 a little bit catastrophic 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.700
 a genre is a little marked 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.070
 so I'm going to try to fade a little 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:38.580
 little color and I will also try 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.980
 to intensify a little bit of golden honey 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.840
 I think we do not see enough and I 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:48.440
 will apply over 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:50.720
 the gilded story of really marked in 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.729
 banana and not to the contrary 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.960
 a kind of leaves on the eye so 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:55.430
 we are the tips are really 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.530
 easy finally the free and it does not 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.050
 ten pages what not bad it's simple 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.699
 fast efficient so the advice is not 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.460
 badly but afterwards at the level of 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:07.610
 the application I find it's not too much 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.770
 I do not feel like it's 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.150
 how to say notebook everyday in 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.830
 so does I wonder what 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.389
 opportunity 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.740
 you can wear something like this in 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:17.780
 anyway the headlights are hyper 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.120
 pigmented that's for sure it's the good 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.930
 quality here is the result so we see 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:26.990
 well banana tail leu leu free and 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:29.180
 try to show us finally here I am 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.250
 will apply mascara but times 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.770
 it's the mask that I have is not a 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.470
 mascara that is included in the box 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.419
 so that's the benefit bo rires 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.460
 you know it's my mascara for 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:42.470
 scare you prefer I pray them in 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.210
 miniature format because it costs 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.169
 cheaper finally it's 10 euros the 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.520
 miniature format 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:48.470
 in fact I redeem them because I 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.389
 had it in a box and suddenly I 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.880
 the aï redeemed at saurat there exists 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:56.160
 now in miniature just like the 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.770
 the eye liner there the push up liner I know 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.310
 more what also to 10 euros in small 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.960
 format 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.540
 so I find it more practical when 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.890
 you do not want to shell out 25 balls all 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.740
 right away there for a mascara 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:10.080
 actually I calculated also with respect to 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.390
 the capacity in fact it's more gaining 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.990
 to buy saab twice 10 euros that 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:18.960
 once once 25 euros because in 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.640
 does yamaha - in the big only two 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.680
 like that I do not know if I did 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.660
 understand I will finish the make up 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.920
 with the application of the gloss but before 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.870
 I'm going to put a little bit of color 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.250
 with a lipstick because the 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.650
 basic youth gloss I'm not 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.610
 really fan but then if in addition he 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.860
 is transparent since it is 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.240
 transparent in this box ben I you 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.430
 brings nothing since I already have 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.580
 big lips in quotation marks 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.810
 frankly what we say it's here 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.400
 is useless to add volume in 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.590
 more so I prefer to at least put some 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.580
 the color a little bit i'm going to pat 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:54.540
 like those here the lipstick from 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:56.700
 the ch and that sticks I know more read 614 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:07:00.450
 I think that's what hassan announces is 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:03.639
 that of burgundy roses like that and I 

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:06.280
 I'm going to pat really really lightly 

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:09.479
 and I'm going to apply the gloss so like 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.479
 I wanted remote transparent gloss 

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:14.749
 and here is what it gives is 

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:16.729
 rather not bad 

00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:18.740
 after I must confess that I have 

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:20.119
 really bad with banana I 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.319
 really followed the advice because 

00:07:20.119 --> 00:07:23.389
 here I am not going to want to do my 

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:25.699
 thing to me rather follow the advice 

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:27.559
 so it's not bad for schemas of 

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:28.909
 shoots or some special stuff 

00:07:27.559 --> 00:07:30.559
 like that but then go out on the street 

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:32.449
 like that I do not know too much I think 

00:07:30.559 --> 00:07:34.219
 it's a little too makeup it's a good 

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:35.330
 combo and I think it's going pretty well 

00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:37.429
 with my skin tone 

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:42.669
 if what I was afraid of actually 

00:07:37.429 --> 00:07:42.669
 ordering this box and that's it
