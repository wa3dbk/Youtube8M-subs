didn't really care for the song much but

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.859 
didn't really care for the song much but
the<00:02:02.430> visuals<00:02:02.820> were<00:02:02.939> pretty<00:02:03.180> freakin<00:02:03.450> awesome

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
now the ending the visuals didn't really

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.660

necessarily<00:02:10.679> care<00:02:10.950> for<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.250> started<00:02:11.489> off<00:02:11.580> a

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
necessarily care for it started off a

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.890 
necessarily care for it started off a
little<00:02:11.700> bit<00:02:12.030> playful<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:13.080> cartoony

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
little bit playful and cartoony

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.080 
little bit playful and cartoony
and<00:02:13.989> the<00:02:14.590> actual<00:02:15.010> song<00:02:15.250> I<00:02:15.459> did<00:02:15.670> like<00:02:15.819> I<00:02:15.940> like

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
and the actual song I did like I like

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.580 
and the actual song I did like I like
when<00:02:16.269> he<00:02:16.299> blended<00:02:16.750> with<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:16.930> English<00:02:17.379> lyrics

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
when he blended with the English lyrics

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.680 
when he blended with the English lyrics
I<00:02:17.799> thought<00:02:17.980> it<00:02:18.099> was<00:02:18.190> a<00:02:18.459> nice<00:02:18.909> little<00:02:18.940> blend<00:02:19.480> the

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
I thought it was a nice little blend the

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.350 
I thought it was a nice little blend the
song<00:02:19.900> I<00:02:20.049> kind<00:02:20.500> of<00:02:20.560> really<00:02:21.040> enjoyed<00:02:21.370> definitely

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
song I kind of really enjoyed definitely

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.080 
song I kind of really enjoyed definitely
if<00:02:22.810> it<00:02:23.200> was<00:02:23.349> me<00:02:23.500> I<00:02:23.530> would<00:02:23.650> do<00:02:23.860> a<00:02:23.890> cross<00:02:24.220> mix<00:02:24.549> get

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
if it was me I would do a cross mix get

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.030 
if it was me I would do a cross mix get
rid<00:02:25.209> of<00:02:25.269> the<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:25.989> visuals<00:02:26.409> from<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.680> ending

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
rid of the the visuals from the ending

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.890 
rid of the the visuals from the ending
take<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.730> visuals<00:02:28.090> from<00:02:28.239> the<00:02:28.299> opening<00:02:28.720> and

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
take the visuals from the opening and

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.949 
take the visuals from the opening and
use<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.860> ending<00:02:30.430> song<00:02:30.730> for<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.180> opening<00:02:31.569> so

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
use the ending song for the opening so

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:32.910 
use the ending song for the opening so
that's<00:02:32.140> pretty<00:02:32.379> much<00:02:32.470> what<00:02:32.709> I<00:02:32.739> would<00:02:32.860> do

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
that's pretty much what I would do

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.319 
that's pretty much what I would do
because<00:02:33.040> I<00:02:33.220> liked<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.489> ending<00:02:33.519> song<00:02:33.940> didn't

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
because I liked the ending song didn't

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:35.610 
because I liked the ending song didn't
like<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.540> opening<00:02:34.930> song<00:02:35.110> but<00:02:35.349> I<00:02:35.379> liked<00:02:35.500> the

visuals<00:02:35.980> from<00:02:36.099> the<00:02:36.220> opening<00:02:36.549> didn't<00:02:37.090> like<00:02:37.180> the

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
visuals from the opening didn't like the

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.309 
visuals from the opening didn't like the
visuals<00:02:37.629> from<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.900> ending

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319

visuals I liked everything about it so

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.170 
visuals I liked everything about it so
when<00:02:57.040> they<00:02:57.160> change<00:02:57.430> it<00:02:57.670> now<00:02:57.819> I'm<00:02:57.970> a<00:02:58.060> little

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
when they change it now I'm a little

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.610 
when they change it now I'm a little
bummed<00:02:58.480> I'm<00:02:58.690> not<00:02:58.810> that<00:02:58.989> excited<00:02:59.349> about<00:02:59.470> the

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
bummed I'm not that excited about the

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.479 
bummed I'm not that excited about the
opening<00:02:59.950> anymore

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
opening anymore

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.069 
opening anymore
maybe<00:03:00.790> it'll<00:03:01.060> grow<00:03:01.299> on<00:03:01.420> me<00:03:01.540> over<00:03:01.750> time<00:03:01.900> the

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
maybe it'll grow on me over time the

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:03.300 
maybe it'll grow on me over time the
song<00:03:02.260> and<00:03:02.440> I'll<00:03:02.500> really<00:03:02.680> begin<00:03:02.980> to<00:03:03.010> like<00:03:03.280> it

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
song and I'll really begin to like it

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.819 
song and I'll really begin to like it
like<00:03:03.549> I<00:03:03.730> remember<00:03:04.659> told<00:03:04.870> spaghetti<00:03:05.200> rock<00:03:05.560> that

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
like I remember told spaghetti rock that

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.339 
like I remember told spaghetti rock that
was<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.519> previous<00:03:06.730> opening<00:03:07.269> prior<00:03:08.019> to<00:03:08.200> what

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
was the previous opening prior to what

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.130 
was the previous opening prior to what
we<00:03:08.440> just<00:03:08.650> had<00:03:08.879> so<00:03:09.879> you<00:03:10.480> know<00:03:10.599> it<00:03:10.720> kind<00:03:10.900> of<00:03:10.959> grew

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
we just had so you know it kind of grew

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.899 
we just had so you know it kind of grew
on<00:03:11.200> me<00:03:11.379> so<00:03:11.560> I<00:03:11.590> guess<00:03:11.769> maybe<00:03:11.950> it's<00:03:12.640> just<00:03:12.819> a

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:12.909 
on me so I guess maybe it's just a

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:15.149 
on me so I guess maybe it's just a
roller<00:03:13.209> so<00:03:13.569> that's<00:03:14.019> my<00:03:14.170> quick<00:03:14.739> thoughts<00:03:14.920> on

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 
roller so that's my quick thoughts on

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:16.530 
roller so that's my quick thoughts on
the<00:03:15.250> opening<00:03:15.579> and<00:03:15.700> endings<00:03:16.000> as<00:03:16.209> far<00:03:16.390> as<00:03:16.450> the

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
the opening and endings as far as the

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.170 
the opening and endings as far as the
episode<00:03:16.900> go<00:03:17.250> didn't<00:03:18.250> really<00:03:18.579> care<00:03:18.849> for<00:03:18.880> it<00:03:19.030> it

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
episode go didn't really care for it it

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.390 
episode go didn't really care for it it
felt<00:03:19.329> very<00:03:19.419> you<00:03:19.810> systems<00:03:20.380> most<00:03:20.889> of<00:03:21.099> it<00:03:21.220> was

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
felt very you systems most of it was

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.180 
felt very you systems most of it was
just<00:03:21.700> entire<00:03:22.299> almost<00:03:22.930> in<00:03:23.049> its<00:03:23.079> entirety<00:03:23.560> was<00:03:24.160> a

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
just entire almost in its entirety was a

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.180 
just entire almost in its entirety was a
flashback<00:03:24.579> of<00:03:25.030> gara<00:03:25.840> when<00:03:26.290> he<00:03:26.470> killed<00:03:26.980> one<00:03:27.160> of

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
flashback of gara when he killed one of

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.129 
flashback of gara when he killed one of
those<00:03:27.370> sound<00:03:27.669> then<00:03:27.910> Joe<00:03:28.090> back<00:03:28.329> in<00:03:28.510> part<00:03:28.750> one

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:29.139 
those sound then Joe back in part one

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:31.229 
those sound then Joe back in part one
it<00:03:29.349> was<00:03:29.530> nostalgic<00:03:30.129> to<00:03:30.250> hear<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.489> music<00:03:30.669> it

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
it was nostalgic to hear the music it

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.330 
it was nostalgic to hear the music it
was<00:03:31.389> cool<00:03:31.660> to<00:03:31.810> see<00:03:31.989> just<00:03:32.230> overall<00:03:32.650> nostalgia

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
was cool to see just overall nostalgia

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.059 
was cool to see just overall nostalgia
factor<00:03:33.489> but<00:03:33.819> as<00:03:34.000> a<00:03:34.060> whole<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:35.169> episode<00:03:35.739> was

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
factor but as a whole the episode was

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.520 
factor but as a whole the episode was
kind<00:03:36.400> of<00:03:36.489> pointless<00:03:36.849> and<00:03:37.180> I<00:03:37.569> guess<00:03:38.019> like<00:03:38.379> you

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
kind of pointless and I guess like you

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.379 
kind of pointless and I guess like you
can<00:03:38.680> pretty<00:03:38.950> much<00:03:39.040> watch<00:03:39.430> towards<00:03:39.879> the<00:03:40.000> ending

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
can pretty much watch towards the ending

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:41.849 
can pretty much watch towards the ending
and<00:03:40.599> get<00:03:40.870> all<00:03:41.019> you<00:03:41.139> need<00:03:41.319> out<00:03:41.470> of<00:03:41.620> this<00:03:41.709> episode

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
and get all you need out of this episode

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.979 
and get all you need out of this episode
as<00:03:42.250> far<00:03:42.430> as<00:03:42.519> Cavuto<00:03:43.150> bringing<00:03:43.449> back<00:03:43.599> that<00:03:43.780> one

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
as far as Cavuto bringing back that one

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.659 
as far as Cavuto bringing back that one
dancer<00:03:44.349> which<00:03:44.530> he<00:03:45.010> was<00:03:45.129> mostly<00:03:45.430> irrelevant

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:45.669 
dancer which he was mostly irrelevant

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:47.099 
dancer which he was mostly irrelevant
like<00:03:46.060> though<00:03:46.239> the<00:03:46.480> biggest<00:03:46.780> part<00:03:46.959> he<00:03:47.079> played

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
like though the biggest part he played

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.220 
like though the biggest part he played
was<00:03:47.919> when<00:03:48.099> he<00:03:48.250> was<00:03:48.400> tailing<00:03:48.780> cobble<00:03:49.780> totems

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
was when he was tailing cobble totems

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.960 
was when he was tailing cobble totems
and<00:03:50.410> villains<00:03:50.799> and<00:03:50.949> he<00:03:51.190> found<00:03:51.400> out<00:03:51.609> all<00:03:51.760> that

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
and villains and he found out all that

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.759 
and villains and he found out all that
but<00:03:52.120> for<00:03:52.269> the<00:03:52.329> most<00:03:52.449> part<00:03:52.569> like<00:03:52.720> what's<00:03:53.560> the

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
but for the most part like what's the

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.409 
but for the most part like what's the
last<00:03:53.980> five<00:03:54.220> minutes<00:03:54.340> of<00:03:54.549> this<00:03:54.699> episode<00:03:55.090> Iike

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
watch the next episode which doesn't

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.439 
watch the next episode which doesn't
seem<00:03:57.160> like<00:03:57.220> it's<00:03:57.459> gonna<00:03:57.579> be<00:03:57.760> repetitive<00:03:58.030> but

00:03:58.439 --> 00:03:58.449 
seem like it's gonna be repetitive but

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:01.500 
seem like it's gonna be repetitive but
this<00:03:59.319> episode<00:03:59.799> mainly<00:04:00.280> was<00:04:00.459> really<00:04:00.790> 3:07

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
pointless for the most part it was like

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.250 
pointless for the most part it was like
trying<00:04:03.790> to<00:04:03.879> add<00:04:04.000> a<00:04:04.030> nice<00:04:04.329> little<00:04:04.569> story<00:04:04.870> at<00:04:05.139> the

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
in this episode it was just like if I
