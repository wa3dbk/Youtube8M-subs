00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
that I didn't like so I just scraped

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.030 
that I didn't like so I just scraped
everything<00:00:39.450> out<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.870> washed<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.380> then<00:00:40.860> you'll

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
everything out and washed it then you'll

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.460 
everything out and washed it then you'll
need<00:00:41.220> a<00:00:41.280> heat<00:00:41.670> source<00:00:41.989> after<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.200> you'll

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
need a heat source after that you'll

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.770 
need a heat source after that you'll
need<00:00:43.650> to<00:00:43.710> take<00:00:43.980> some<00:00:44.250> soy<00:00:44.640> wax<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.270> got<00:00:45.570> this

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
need to take some soy wax I got this

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.630 
need to take some soy wax I got this
from<00:00:46.140> Hobby<00:00:46.559> Lobby<00:00:46.680> but<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.220> think<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.520> can

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
from Hobby Lobby but I think you can

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.760 
from Hobby Lobby but I think you can
also<00:00:47.760> find<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.239> elsewhere<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.870> take<00:00:49.440> one

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
also find it elsewhere and take one

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.580 
also find it elsewhere and take one
teaspoon<00:00:50.040> of<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:51.270> start<00:00:51.900> to<00:00:52.140> put<00:00:52.470> it

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
teaspoon of that and start to put it

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.830 
teaspoon of that and start to put it
over<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.190> candle<00:00:53.489> now<00:00:54.120> it's<00:00:54.420> probably<00:00:54.750> gonna

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
over the candle now it's probably gonna

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.370 
over the candle now it's probably gonna
take<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.440> would<00:00:55.739> say<00:00:56.450> about<00:00:57.450> less<00:00:58.110> than<00:00:58.140> a

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:58.380 
take I would say about less than a

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.290 
take I would say about less than a
minute<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.740> melt<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.460> doesn't<00:00:59.880> really<00:01:00.060> take

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
minute to melt it doesn't really take

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.240 
minute to melt it doesn't really take
long<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.780> once<00:01:01.080> it's<00:01:01.290> liquefied<00:01:01.770> it's<00:01:02.040> good

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
long and once it's liquefied it's good

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.370 
long and once it's liquefied it's good
to<00:01:02.370> go<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:03.210> next<00:01:03.390> thing<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.720> will<00:01:03.810> add<00:01:03.990> is

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
melted lipstick I got the one from my

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.100 
melted lipstick I got the one from my
Ipsy<00:01:28.500> bag<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:29.039> is<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.490> sample<00:01:29.940> version<00:01:30.149> and<00:01:30.600> it

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
Ipsy bag it is the sample version and it

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.499 
Ipsy bag it is the sample version and it
just<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:31.710> happens<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.310> all<00:01:32.789> of<00:01:32.940> it<00:01:33.090> came<00:01:33.300> out

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
just so happens that all of it came out

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.050 
just so happens that all of it came out
to<00:01:33.660> be<00:01:33.690> about<00:01:33.990> almost<00:01:34.740> one<00:01:35.039> teaspoon<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:36.030> I

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
to be about almost one teaspoon so I

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.270 
to be about almost one teaspoon so I
just<00:01:36.330> poured<00:01:36.569> everything<00:01:36.869> in<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.500> decided<00:01:38.250> to

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
just poured everything in and decided to

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.850 
just poured everything in and decided to
stir<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.850> over<00:01:39.300> the<00:01:39.630> heat<00:01:39.810> source<00:01:40.080> now<00:01:40.619> this

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
stir it over the heat source now this

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.020 
stir it over the heat source now this
stuff<00:01:41.100> isn't<00:01:41.280> going<00:01:41.580> to<00:01:41.670> melt<00:01:41.940> like

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
stuff isn't going to melt like

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.719 
stuff isn't going to melt like
immediately<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.319> it<00:01:43.800> probably<00:01:44.069> won't<00:01:44.399> melt

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
immediately and it probably won't melt

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.779 
immediately and it probably won't melt
to<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.000> liquid<00:01:45.330> form<00:01:45.840> because<00:01:46.709> it<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.429> already

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
to a liquid form because it is already

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.419 
to a liquid form because it is already
kind<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.119> like<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.300> creamy<00:01:48.690> texture<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:49.679> I<00:01:50.009> just

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
kind of like a creamy texture so I just

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:52.400 
kind of like a creamy texture so I just
try<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.640> melt<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.179> down<00:01:51.209> as<00:01:51.600> much<00:01:51.660> as<00:01:52.110> possible

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
try to melt it down as much as possible

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.070 
try to melt it down as much as possible
and<00:01:53.130> then<00:01:53.789> the<00:01:53.819> rest<00:01:54.179> of<00:01:54.300> the<00:01:54.390> work<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.840> going

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
and then the rest of the work is going

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.919 
and then the rest of the work is going
to<00:01:55.229> be<00:01:55.560> while<00:01:56.310> you're<00:01:56.520> stirring<00:01:56.940> it<00:01:57.270> into<00:01:57.750> the

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
to be while you're stirring it into the

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:59.900 
to be while you're stirring it into the
