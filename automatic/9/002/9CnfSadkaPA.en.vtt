00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.650
 no limit boxing still in the 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:10.719
 against how to counter the good hook 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.339
 ok the hook already we'll say the hook 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.900
 left 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:16.689
 good of course the best for me 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.300
 always that skips so we pass 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:23.169
 below the hook and then you put 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.359
 yours of hooks well the right so 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.679
 you are in the right distance so if 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.070
 you have a long long hook 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.800
 scope 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.880
 you go below and you can 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.580
 control your right 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.040
 if it's close you go below 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:39.970
 and you put your right rock to 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.830
 the face or as you want or 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.780
 so you can have it a little bit more 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.690
 advanced goes below 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.400
 will do you still misaligned you goes on to 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.680
 side but good that I have to show you 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.650
 with a partner and there are there are some 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.090
 combinations that are interesting 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.050
 so that's a way it's dodging 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.290
 another way 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.780
 it's blocking you so you block 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.239
 blow with the accompaniment of the 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.390
 violence as I showed you the paz 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.700
 so you do not worry it's necessary 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:14.440
 develop that trust in you in 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:16.540
 sparring and all that if it's fine 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.170
 cashed well done even if it's a big 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.659
 puncher 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.290
 it'll be stuck for a little stop 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:27.120
 unpleasant but that's boxing it's 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.409
 not a massage session in a sauna 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.900
 quiet what's not it's not that 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.750
 you are here for the pain and especially 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:39.940
 to inflict pain and canvases 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:43.420
 cash so short if not to 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.670
 block no problem boom you have 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.470
 blocked the hook there you hit with 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.630
 yours from hooks because 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.409
 logically therefore in the logic of 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.150
 costs after a circular hook is a 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.830
 another shot on the other side that will come 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:01.090
 so there you want to absorb the energy 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.380
 and from the other side 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.510
 like that if the shot the right she comes 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.149
 it's your neck already it's going to be first 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.460
 in its phase so that's okay once 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.900
 you touched the translate 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.250
 its cost is canceled there is not a 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.650
 opponent who gets hit on the face 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.040
 and who at the same time launched a blow and 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.920
 the 2 1 is very very rare these same 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.540
 it is the same if almost Hollywood 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.140
 you if you hit the jaw well 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.550
 the opponent he dislocates so everything 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.070
 what he was doing was 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:39.390
 disintegrates obviously you have to touch 1 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:42.150
 so there you block lady you put the 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.520
 hook so am here where I am there as 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.170
 what do you want 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.990
 if you touch well as it should 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.720
 the jaw is good even if you 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.970
 do not touch well hyper accurate if he has 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.640
 sent his special scholar hook to 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.180
 your shoulder either you leave from 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.600
 the other side 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.370
 so there is no problem so I 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.380
 will be safe but no problem so that 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.350
 this is the c for that you ask 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:11.040
 may have seen in my cat all this 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.990
 make blockages like that so could that 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:18.510
 it's blocking the left hooks 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:22.560
 ok so that's a second way so 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.300
 dodge blocking good if it's in mid 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.480
 distance you can do the withdrawal of the 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.140
 disk so you avoid the hook there 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.960
 misses 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.770
 boom you put the right that too 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:38.010
 it's a way of countering countered before 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:40.170
 the hook because in general the 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.930
 crochet that's after after two shots 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.410
 after a stroke or after the opponent 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.060
 are who come a lot so there you 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.190
 will not have the time to contract in the 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.970
 blow for that the hook is very 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:57.210
 vicious so I showed you if you 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.190
 get to block a hook it's good 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.630
 if you are if you pass below 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.660
 it's even better 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.370
 or you dodged it fees that's 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.080
 even better 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.820
 these are the two ways to counter and the 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.250
 thing is to strike right after what 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:15.210
 so you are you will count yourself with 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:18.150
 the left hook and then you can 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:20.489
 pass by and everything is ok after I 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.710
 will show you further how to generate 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.660
 the most power for the hook 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.700
 after a stopover 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.530
 but it's complicated that I have to 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.800
 shows with the legs because there is 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.960
 who believe that after a hook 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.060
 do it live after yes if you are everything 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.130
 close if you want to touch it's the 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.750
 better but you can even let the 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.950
 time to time as I say sometimes and 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.120
 generated a lot more power but 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.220
 that I will show you in another 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.290
 video and that if you get to touch 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.240
 you will put ko drom of one 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.140
 blow if you if you hit well if 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.660
 you are a good puncher 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.970
 that's good of my stuff i'll show you 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.580
 that later ok so that was it 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.260
 how to counter the hook to it's just 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.610
 basic things here at our channel 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.610
 video I will show you more
