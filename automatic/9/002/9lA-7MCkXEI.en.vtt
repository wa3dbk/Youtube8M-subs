pushes the i5 memory card which actually
went<00:03:02.190> dead<00:03:02.460> after<00:03:02.670> a<00:03:02.940> few<00:03:03.240> months<00:03:03.510> so<00:03:04.260> this<00:03:04.620> is

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
went dead after a few months so this is

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.200 
went dead after a few months so this is
something<00:03:05.100> which<00:03:05.190> I<00:03:05.310> would<00:03:05.490> always<00:03:05.670> love<00:03:06.030> to

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
use these love with Wi-Fi which would

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.580 
use these love with Wi-Fi which would
automatically<00:03:09.330> send<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:09.720> photos<00:03:10.050> to<00:03:10.080> my

screen what you get here is going to ask
you<00:04:45.270> to<00:04:45.390> set<00:04:45.600> up<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:45.990> language<00:04:46.290> so<00:04:47.250> here<00:04:47.430> we<00:04:47.550> go

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
you to set up the language so here we go

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.760 
you to set up the language so here we go
let's<00:04:47.910> push<00:04:48.390> it<00:04:48.419> with<00:04:48.810> the<00:04:49.050> language<00:04:49.560> letter

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
let's push it with the language letter

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:56.360 
let's push it with the language letter
and<00:04:50.190> then<00:04:51.120> here<00:04:51.570> is<00:04:51.750> the<00:04:51.870> time<00:04:52.080> we<00:04:52.200> will<00:04:52.290> set<00:04:52.500> up

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.280 

so<00:04:56.910> we<00:04:57.030> are<00:04:57.120> done<00:04:57.240> with<00:04:57.450> the<00:04:57.570> basic<00:04:57.840> time<00:04:58.020> and

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
so we are done with the basic time and

so we are done with the basic time and
date<00:04:58.740> set<00:04:58.920> up<00:04:59.040> and<00:04:59.250> then<00:04:59.370> you<00:04:59.490> can<00:04:59.640> see<00:04:59.910> that<00:05:00.060> we

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
date set up and then you can see that we

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.150 
date set up and then you can see that we
have<00:05:00.420> got<00:05:00.570> a<00:05:00.630> big<00:05:01.350> list<00:05:01.470> of<00:05:01.650> options<00:05:02.040> available
