00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.630 
you may remember or feel the ski
actually<00:01:22.049> coming<00:01:22.500> off<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.950> then<00:01:23.040> which<00:01:23.280> part

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
actually coming off and then which part

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.730 
actually coming off and then which part
of<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.909> turn<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.299> happened<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.380> looking

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
of the turn that happened so looking

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.710 
of the turn that happened so looking
back<00:01:25.770> I've<00:01:26.220> got<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.400> vague<00:01:26.790> memory<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.540> I

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
back I've got a vague memory that I

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.410 
back I've got a vague memory that I
remember<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.470> ski<00:01:28.710> coming<00:01:29.130> off<00:01:29.299> riding<00:01:30.299> that

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
remember that ski coming off riding that

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.560 
remember that ski coming off riding that
turn<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.140> think<00:01:31.549> it<00:01:32.549> came<00:01:32.790> off<00:01:32.939> about<00:01:33.240> there

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
turn and I think it came off about there

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.380 
turn and I think it came off about there
now<00:01:34.229> if<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.470> don't<00:01:34.710> have<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.950> probe<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:36.240> can

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
now if you don't have a probe you can

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.600 
now if you don't have a probe you can
use<00:01:36.570> your<00:01:36.659> ski<00:01:36.900> poles<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.470> start<00:01:38.280> with<00:01:38.430> just

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
use your ski poles and start with just

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.429 
use your ski poles and start with just
use<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.790> bit<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.119> visual<00:01:39.479> look<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.079> might<00:01:40.259> even

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
use a bit of visual look you might even

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.319 
use a bit of visual look you might even
see<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.710> little<00:01:40.770> bit<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.340> ski<00:01:41.610> poking<00:01:42.240> out

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
see a little bit of the ski poking out

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.300 
see a little bit of the ski poking out
of<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.509> snow<00:01:42.780> but<00:01:43.500> I've<00:01:43.590> got<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.829> probe<00:01:44.100> out

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310

going<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.390> start<00:01:57.600> probing<00:01:57.869> through<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.829> snow

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
going to start probing through the snow

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.139 
going to start probing through the snow
pack<00:01:59.810> like<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.350> that's<00:02:01.469> going<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.740> cover

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
pack like this and that's going to cover

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.870 
pack like this and that's going to cover
much<00:02:03.149> more<00:02:03.180> terrain<00:02:04.430> and<00:02:05.430> if<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.640> was<00:02:05.729> just

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
much more terrain and if I was just

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.029 
much more terrain and if I was just
probing<00:02:06.149> down<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:07.140> if<00:02:07.380> you've<00:02:07.530> got<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.740> few

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
probing down and if you've got a few

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.589 
probing down and if you've got a few
people<00:02:08.399> on<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.610> sides<00:02:08.849> they<00:02:09.119> can<00:02:09.330> start

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
people on the sides they can start

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.449 
people on the sides they can start
coming<00:02:09.840> up<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.289> if<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.470> haven't<00:02:10.709> disrupted

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
coming up and if you haven't disrupted

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.910 
coming up and if you haven't disrupted
that<00:02:11.580> snow<00:02:11.849> pack

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
that snow pack

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.510 
that snow pack
you<00:02:13.400> should<00:02:13.730> feel<00:02:14.090> anything<00:02:14.840> in<00:02:15.140> there

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
you should feel anything in there

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.260 
you should feel anything in there
there's<00:02:16.520> going<00:02:16.640> to<00:02:16.700> be<00:02:16.790> hard<00:02:17.090> like<00:02:17.510> a<00:02:17.570> ski<00:02:19.270> will

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
there's going to be hard like a ski will

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.850 
there's going to be hard like a ski will
lead<00:02:20.480> you<00:02:20.660> straight<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:21.470> that<00:02:21.500> without

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
lead you straight to that without

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
messing around for too long I think I

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.570 
messing around for too long I think I
felt<00:02:25.910> something<00:02:26.030> there<00:02:28.660> so<00:02:29.660> I'm<00:02:29.720> definitely

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.740 
definite difference when you're hitting
something<00:02:42.890> hard<00:02:43.040> like<00:02:43.310> a<00:02:43.460> ski<00:02:43.940> then<00:02:44.600> when

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
something hard like a ski then when

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.960 
something hard like a ski then when
you're<00:02:44.870> hitting<00:02:45.020> the<00:02:45.200> ground<00:02:45.460> yep<00:02:46.460> definitely

and<00:03:15.140> I'm<00:03:15.290> on<00:03:15.410> my<00:03:15.440> way<00:03:15.530> again<00:03:16.630> that<00:03:17.630> took<00:03:17.959> about

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
and I'm on my way again that took about

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.140 
and I'm on my way again that took about
five<00:03:18.470> minutes<00:03:18.739> rather<00:03:19.370> than<00:03:19.640> our<00:03:19.790> five

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
five minutes rather than our five

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:27.030 
five minutes rather than our five
minutes<00:03:23.440> now<00:03:24.440> if<00:03:24.680> you<00:03:24.830> follow<00:03:25.040> that<00:03:25.220> procedure

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
minutes now if you follow that procedure

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.000 
minutes now if you follow that procedure
only<00:03:28.040> will<00:03:28.160> it<00:03:28.190> save<00:03:28.459> you<00:03:28.489> some<00:03:28.760> time<00:03:30.010> but

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
only will it save you some time but

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.350 
only will it save you some time but
it'll<00:03:31.160> probably<00:03:31.370> save<00:03:31.610> you<00:03:31.760> a<00:03:31.790> very<00:03:32.030> expensive

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
it'll probably save you a very expensive
