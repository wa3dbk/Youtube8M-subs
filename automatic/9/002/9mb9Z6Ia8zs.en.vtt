00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.070
 channel that as you are today mimi and 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.890
 good today I bring you another because analysis 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:31.789
 of the pokemon rals of the new 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:36.350
 pokemon religions xy I will teach you where 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:38.420
 we can capture it and put in this poke 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.809
 analysis where we can find also 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:45.010
 the mega stone for viola agar and how 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.010
 evolves real 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:53.450
 ice is a psychic type PokÃ©mon that 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:58.840
 we can capture on route 4 and real 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.840
 Has the skills trace or synchrony 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.040
 this pokemon in new editions 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.780
 pokemon x if you have added a new 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.780
 type that would be the fairy type 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.110
 and to evolve flush we will have to 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:20.390
 level up flush to level 20 and 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.390
 then we will evolve acquire it 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.990
 and we actually evolve agar 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.990
 god when leveling up to level 30 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.150
 and for what kirlian you evolve the 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.820
 key we have to have a kiel ya macho 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:47.490
 and then if we remove kiel and the 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.490
 Albanian stone will evolve to gaya d 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.760
 the best nature for galla would be 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.130
 the firm that we climb the physical attack and 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.250
 we would lower the special attack since 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.509
 Gaya when I wanted to evolve there 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.939
 he raises a lot of attack 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.849
 and for the best nature for gardel 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:15.890
 I would put the modest that the modest 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.959
 that the special attack goes up a lot and 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.120
 the attack goes down because as a gardel 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.769
 your has a lot of special attack we 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.769
 would go very well this nature 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.280
 now I will show you where we can 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:37.329
 find the alba stone we will go to the 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:40.030
 route 3 and where is the first path 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:42.099
 this kayak and we will surf and just do 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.519
 surf we will find the stone 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.519
