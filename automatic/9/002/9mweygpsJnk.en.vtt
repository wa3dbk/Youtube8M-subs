with this palette and I only found like
two<00:02:02.200> and<00:02:02.619> I<00:02:02.649> didn't<00:02:03.060> really<00:02:04.060> like<00:02:04.299> them

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
two and I didn't really like them

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.529 
two and I didn't really like them
because<00:02:04.869> they<00:02:05.380> didn't<00:02:06.090> really<00:02:07.090> put<00:02:07.420> the

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
because they didn't really put the

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.949 
because they didn't really put the
product<00:02:07.960> on<00:02:08.110> and<00:02:08.349> show<00:02:09.390> someone<00:02:10.390> going<00:02:10.539> to<00:02:10.690> the

side

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.170
