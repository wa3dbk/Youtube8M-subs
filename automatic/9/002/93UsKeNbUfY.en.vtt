in<00:00:11.080> these<00:00:11.230> boxes<00:00:11.679> I<00:00:11.830> expect<00:00:12.219> to<00:00:12.339> find<00:00:12.549> some

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:12.849 
in these boxes I expect to find some

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:15.839 
in these boxes I expect to find some
Playmobil<00:00:13.509> stuff<00:00:14.049> this<00:00:14.830> one<00:00:15.099> on<00:00:15.249> the<00:00:15.370> right<00:00:15.610> is

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:15.849 
Playmobil stuff this one on the right is

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.040 
Playmobil stuff this one on the right is
an<00:00:16.480> order<00:00:16.689> I<00:00:16.720> placed<00:00:17.140> on<00:00:17.500> eBay<00:00:18.100> for<00:00:18.390> new<00:00:19.390> stuff

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 
an order I placed on eBay for new stuff

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.650 
an order I placed on eBay for new stuff
not<00:00:20.650> used<00:00:20.890> this<00:00:21.130> time<00:00:21.369> and<00:00:21.880> the<00:00:22.330> one<00:00:22.449> on<00:00:22.510> the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
not used this time and the one on the

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.019 
not used this time and the one on the
left<00:00:22.869> obviously<00:00:23.470> came<00:00:23.830> from<00:00:24.130> Amazon

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029 
left obviously came from Amazon

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.570 
left obviously came from Amazon
I<00:00:25.230> think<00:00:26.230> I<00:00:26.320> placed<00:00:26.590> both<00:00:26.830> of<00:00:27.039> these<00:00:27.160> orders<00:00:27.460> at

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
I think I placed both of these orders at

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.220 
I think I placed both of these orders at
about<00:00:27.820> the<00:00:27.970> same<00:00:28.119> time<00:00:28.480> and<00:00:30.810> they<00:00:31.810> have<00:00:31.960> very

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
about the same time and they have very

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.330 
about the same time and they have very
different<00:00:32.739> things

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
different things

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.119 
different things
within<00:00:34.030> them<00:00:34.210> so<00:00:34.750> this<00:00:34.960> one<00:00:35.230> is<00:00:35.469> fairly

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
within them so this one is fairly

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.510 
within them so this one is fairly
straight<00:00:36.640> forward<00:00:37.170> big<00:00:38.170> front<00:00:38.590> loader<00:00:38.860> to<00:00:39.399> add

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
straight forward big front loader to add

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.810 
straight forward big front loader to add
to<00:00:39.820> a<00:00:39.960> construction<00:00:40.960> site<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:42.370> obviously<00:00:42.700> I

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
to a construction site so obviously I

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.459 
to a construction site so obviously I
will<00:00:43.000> be<00:00:43.090> doing<00:00:43.270> a<00:00:43.390> review<00:00:43.420> of<00:00:43.899> that<00:00:43.930> this<00:00:44.260> one

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
will be doing a review of that this one

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:46.439 
will be doing a review of that this one
that<00:00:44.590> I've<00:00:44.680> been<00:00:44.710> looking<00:00:45.520> forward<00:00:45.789> to<00:00:45.879> for<00:00:46.210> a

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
that I've been looking forward to for a

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:49.580 
that I've been looking forward to for a
little<00:00:46.690> while<00:00:46.809> and<00:00:47.170> this<00:00:47.710> one<00:00:47.890> over<00:00:48.010> here<00:00:48.129> ah

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
little while and this one over here ah

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.479 
little while and this one over here ah
this<00:00:50.590> has<00:00:50.770> the<00:00:50.980> newer<00:00:51.190> small<00:00:52.649> pirate<00:00:53.649> boat<00:00:54.160> I

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
this has the newer small pirate boat I

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.290 
this has the newer small pirate boat I
think<00:00:54.579> it's<00:00:54.989> called<00:00:55.989> a<00:00:56.309> small<00:00:57.309> pirate<00:00:57.760> Corsair

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
think it's called a small pirate Corsair

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.970 
think it's called a small pirate Corsair
or<00:00:58.510> something<00:00:58.809> like<00:00:58.899> that<00:00:58.960> it's<00:00:59.649> just<00:00:59.859> the

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
or something like that it's just the

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.860 
or something like that it's just the
smaller<00:01:00.489> boat<00:01:00.820> I<00:01:01.059> thought<00:01:01.510> that<00:01:01.690> that<00:01:01.780> would

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
smaller boat I thought that that would

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.680 
smaller boat I thought that that would
be<00:01:01.930> a<00:01:02.079> good<00:01:02.559> good<00:01:03.190> idea<00:01:03.489> to<00:01:03.760> pick<00:01:04.090> this<00:01:04.270> up<00:01:04.330> to

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
be a good good idea to pick this up to

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.260 
be a good good idea to pick this up to
compare<00:01:04.990> it<00:01:05.170> to<00:01:05.200> the<00:01:05.350> small<00:01:06.310> soldiers<00:01:06.730> boat

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
compare it to the small soldiers boat

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.540 
compare it to the small soldiers boat
and<00:01:07.540> also<00:01:08.020> to<00:01:08.200> the<00:01:08.500> maybe<00:01:08.860> to<00:01:09.100> the<00:01:09.190> big<00:01:09.340> pirate

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
and also to the maybe to the big pirate

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.070 
and also to the maybe to the big pirate
but<00:01:09.790> I<00:01:09.820> don't<00:01:10.030> know<00:01:10.090> if<00:01:10.180> that<00:01:10.330> it<00:01:10.780> makes<00:01:10.930> sense

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
but I don't know if that it makes sense

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.560 
but I don't know if that it makes sense
to<00:01:11.260> compare<00:01:11.860> it<00:01:12.070> to<00:01:12.100> the<00:01:12.250> big<00:01:12.430> big<00:01:12.820> pirate<00:01:13.120> ship

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
to compare it to the big big pirate ship

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.100 
to compare it to the big big pirate ship
but<00:01:14.350> there's<00:01:14.770> more<00:01:15.040> in<00:01:15.250> this<00:01:15.880> other<00:01:16.300> box<00:01:16.660> here

but there's more in this other box here

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.560 
but there's more in this other box here
because<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.520> whole<00:01:18.640> reason<00:01:18.670> that<00:01:18.970> I<00:01:19.090> started

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
because the whole reason that I started

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.170 
because the whole reason that I started
placing<00:01:20.380> the<00:01:20.470> order<00:01:20.770> with<00:01:21.190> this<00:01:21.490> eBay<00:01:21.910> store
