00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.629
 hello very good here where I say of the 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.110
 channel fishing seabass alicante 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.840
 where do I say here how to spin fishing 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.450
 with float 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.030
 around here the area simply 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.240
 You can use a buoy from 40 to 60 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.610
 grams depends on the cane that ye may I 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.000
 I use these fish as all of 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:30.000
 potter to all these for the topic that 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.940
 they have more fight plus the sea bass is more 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.329
 difficult to scald feels more the 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.100
 fishing 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:40.989
 then there are people who use the thread 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.269
 monofilament a braided but I in 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.510
 this case only of you do with them for 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:50.160
 that you can see well how it is done because 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:53.340
 he appreciates a monofilament on the camera 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.110
 and a braid would be more or less what 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.700
 same 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.980
 well let's proceed to the knot 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.260
 how would this be the line of 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.920
 reel where would a direct come from 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:10.230
 direct rigging would be simply me 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.500
 I use this in knot 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:17.340
 which is very very easy for everyone 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.310
 brush and I was giving them just give 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.040
 about five laps 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.670
 about 5 orchards and is passed 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.040
 for the girlfriend that takes out that stays 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.420
 in front of 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.830
 she just stretches herself stretches and 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.640
 this has stayed here has already caught 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.640
 it is cut 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.900
 excess 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:49.380
 and proceed to the other end 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.140
 do the same you take another strip of 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.200
 nylon 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.810
 I usually put here on the 180 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.720
 centimeters of thread but not what in this 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.060
 case I do not put them to explain to 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.250
 you so you know it is usually 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.300
 put about 80 60 depends the depth 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.750
 from the beach where you go 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:13.950
 well be the same knot here 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:18.860
 always knot 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:23.890
 of fishing this very easy and very 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.890
 effective a very effective knot from 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.590
 it usually gives me good results 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.720
 the same way that has been done 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:42.260
 previously it is cut and then 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:46.040
 we proceed to hook the fish 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.950
 well here you have to have security a 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.680
 little security about this because it 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.569
 can nail a hook but good 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.990
 take out well we already have it 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.940
 and is going to proceed to the thread 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.630
 make the same knot 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.630
 It happens 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.680
 here 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.590
 they are given their corresponding gardens 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.849
 4 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.780
 puntita gets through the loop that remains 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.220
 until here everything is done 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.800
 already 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.800
 yields to cut 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.020
 put the fish in its place 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:10.350
 I leave you 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:14.520
 with the rigging of the I'm going to consume it 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:17.100
 your fish that you have good luck in 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.610
