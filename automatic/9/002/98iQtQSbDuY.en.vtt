giving<00:02:52.700> us<00:02:52.850> ammonia<00:02:53.240> ability<00:02:53.600> to<00:02:53.690> perform

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
giving us ammonia ability to perform

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.430 
giving us ammonia ability to perform
tasks<00:02:54.560> to<00:02:54.800> help<00:02:54.830> others<00:02:59.140> this<00:03:00.140> led<00:03:00.410> to

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
tasks to help others this led to

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.470 
tasks to help others this led to
significant<00:03:01.220> advances<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:01.880> technology

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
significant advances to the technology

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.840 
significant advances to the technology
and<00:03:02.690> also<00:03:02.930> most<00:03:03.170> Haynes<00:03:03.520> now<00:03:04.520> you're<00:03:04.640> going<00:03:04.790> to

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
and also most Haynes now you're going to

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.580 
and also most Haynes now you're going to
hear<00:03:04.940> me<00:03:05.120> use<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.630> term<00:03:05.810> degree<00:03:06.140> of<00:03:06.230> freedom

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
hear me use the term degree of freedom

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.380 
hear me use the term degree of freedom
which<00:03:06.830> means<00:03:06.860> a<00:03:07.280> single<00:03:07.490> physical<00:03:07.820> movement

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
which means a single physical movement

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.760 
which means a single physical movement
for<00:03:08.870> example<00:03:08.930> this<00:03:09.620> is<00:03:09.800> a<00:03:09.830> degree<00:03:10.160> of<00:03:10.190> freedom

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
for example this is a degree of freedom

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.020 
for example this is a degree of freedom
then<00:03:12.770> were<00:03:12.950> to<00:03:13.130> operate<00:03:13.250> five<00:03:13.670> fingers

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
then were to operate five fingers

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.060 
then were to operate five fingers
independently<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:15.110> degrees<00:03:15.410> of<00:03:15.530> freedom<00:03:15.590> in
