00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
everything's balanced next up is the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.180 
everything's balanced next up is the
Valor<00:01:47.900> I<00:01:48.050> only<00:01:48.290> play<00:01:48.560> as<00:01:48.680> a<00:01:48.710> dollar<00:01:48.950> because

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
Valor I only play as a dollar because

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.910 
Valor I only play as a dollar because
the<00:01:49.460> valor<00:01:49.700> has<00:01:50.120> a<00:01:50.630> lot<00:01:50.930> more<00:01:51.080> defending<00:01:51.650> and

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
the valor has a lot more defending and

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.660 
the valor has a lot more defending and
in<00:01:52.340> this<00:01:52.460> game<00:01:52.700> defending<00:01:53.300> is<00:01:53.510> really<00:01:53.870> easy<00:01:53.990> uh
