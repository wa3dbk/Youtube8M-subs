Mexico we woke up to a cloudy morning no

layer<00:00:10.800> of<00:00:11.040> clouds<00:00:11.400> I<00:00:11.809> thought<00:00:12.809> maybe<00:00:12.990> if<00:00:13.170> I

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
layer of clouds I thought maybe if I

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.660 
layer of clouds I thought maybe if I
could<00:00:13.440> punch<00:00:13.650> through<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:14.130> then<00:00:14.250> I<00:00:14.309> could<00:00:14.370> get

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
could punch through it then I could get

on top of him into the Sun it was just
too<00:00:18.240> tempting<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:22.939> think<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.029> was<00:00:24.150> about<00:00:24.269> 1,200

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
too tempting I think it was about 1,200

a<00:00:30.090> huge<00:00:30.480> valley<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:31.199> billowing<00:00:31.650> clouds

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
layer of clouds was much higher than I

thought<00:02:01.830> and<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.490> was<00:02:02.550> time<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.940> get<00:02:03.030> out<00:02:03.090> of
