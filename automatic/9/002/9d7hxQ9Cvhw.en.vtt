just switch my little rat tooth comb
around<00:01:09.479> here<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.079> I'm<00:01:10.799> going<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.040> do<00:01:11.159> kind<00:01:11.340> of

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
around here and I'm going to do kind of

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.749 
around here and I'm going to do kind of
a<00:01:11.549> secondary<00:01:12.030> part<00:01:13.850> like<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:16.040> and<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.579> can

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
a secondary part like so and you can

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.819 
a secondary part like so and you can
well<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.719> was<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.840> really<00:01:19.079> good<00:01:19.200> one<00:01:19.380> actually

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:19.829 
well that was a really good one actually

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:21.230 
well that was a really good one actually
that's<00:01:20.009> pretty<00:01:20.280> much<00:01:20.399> all<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.729> hair<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:20.939> needed

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
that's pretty much all the hair I needed

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.690 
that's pretty much all the hair I needed
so<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.200> don't<00:01:22.439> need<00:01:22.590> too<00:01:22.829> much<00:01:23.159> hair

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
so you don't need too much hair

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.120 
so you don't need too much hair
and<00:01:24.090> don't<00:01:24.780> worry<00:01:24.960> like<00:01:25.380> here<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.649> can<00:01:25.920> see<00:01:26.100> that

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
and don't worry like here I can see that

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.670 
and don't worry like here I can see that
it<00:01:26.430> doesn't<00:01:26.759> quite<00:01:27.000> match<00:01:27.390> up<00:01:27.420> perfectly<00:01:27.869> it

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
it doesn't quite match up perfectly it

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.399 
it doesn't quite match up perfectly it
doesn't<00:01:29.219> matter<00:01:29.399> because<00:01:29.700> ultimately<00:01:30.509> that

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
doesn't matter because ultimately that

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.749 
doesn't matter because ultimately that
hair<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:31.799> going<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.009> fall<00:01:32.159> forward<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.670> it's

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
hair is going to fall forward and it's

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.179 
hair is going to fall forward and it's
going<00:01:32.789> to<00:01:32.909> hide<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.240> part<00:01:33.479> anyway<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.469> I'm

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
going to hide the part anyway so I'm

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.830 
going to hide the part anyway so I'm
going<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.369> take<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:35.729> pull<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.600> out<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.780> the

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
here so I'm going to go through the loop

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.209 
here so I'm going to go through the loop
with<00:02:24.859> my<00:02:24.890> hairpin<00:02:26.530> now<00:02:27.530> what<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.799> section<00:02:28.129> of

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.539 
finger and I'm going to slide it through
the<00:02:37.099> hairpin<00:02:37.489> and<00:02:38.980> then<00:02:39.980> hang<00:02:40.159> on<00:02:40.310> to<00:02:40.459> that

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
the hairpin and then hang on to that

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:42.670 
the hairpin and then hang on to that
with<00:02:40.760> my<00:02:40.939> my<00:02:41.420> finger<00:02:41.780> here<00:02:41.959> so<00:02:42.319> I<00:02:42.349> have<00:02:42.530> that

with my my finger here so I have that

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.610 
with my my finger here so I have that
loop<00:02:42.889> and<00:02:43.159> just<00:02:43.299> pull<00:02:44.299> it<00:02:44.569> through<00:02:44.900> like<00:02:47.620> so

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
loop and just pull it through like so

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.530 
loop and just pull it through like so
and<00:02:49.989> we<00:02:50.989> have<00:02:51.169> our<00:02:51.290> first<00:02:51.500> little<00:02:52.069> bow<00:02:52.540> okay

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.890 
my head
so<00:04:03.799> I<00:04:03.829> could<00:04:04.040> see<00:04:04.160> what<00:04:04.250> I<00:04:04.340> was<00:04:04.370> doing<00:04:04.610> but<00:04:05.599> my

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
so I could see what I was doing but my

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.690 
so I could see what I was doing but my
hair<00:04:06.140> just<00:04:06.410> wasn't<00:04:06.739> quite<00:04:06.920> long<00:04:07.160> enough<00:04:07.430> to

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
hair just wasn't quite long enough to

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.120 
hair just wasn't quite long enough to
make<00:04:07.819> good<00:04:08.090> loops<00:04:08.390> once<00:04:09.290> I<00:04:09.440> pulled<00:04:09.769> it<00:04:09.890> all<00:04:10.099> the

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
make good loops once I pulled it all the

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.119 
make good loops once I pulled it all the
way<00:04:10.280> back<00:04:10.430> into<00:04:10.700> the<00:04:10.819> Katniss<00:04:11.299> braid<00:04:11.530> so<00:04:12.530> just

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:13.129 
way back into the Katniss braid so just

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:14.530 
way back into the Katniss braid so just
FYI<00:04:13.340> you're<00:04:13.970> going<00:04:14.090> to<00:04:14.150> need<00:04:14.299> a<00:04:14.329> little<00:04:14.420> bit

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
FYI you're going to need a little bit

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.170 
FYI you're going to need a little bit
longer<00:04:14.690> hair<00:04:15.049> than<00:04:15.200> I<00:04:15.410> have<00:04:15.940> to<00:04:16.940> do<00:04:17.060> the

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
longer hair than I have to do the

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.430 
longer hair than I have to do the
Katniss<00:04:17.600> one<00:04:19.329> okay<00:04:20.329> there's<00:04:20.930> another<00:04:21.019> loop

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
Katniss one okay there's another loop

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.469 
Katniss one okay there's another loop
and<00:04:21.680> I<00:04:22.039> think<00:04:22.280> I've<00:04:22.370> got<00:04:22.550> enough<00:04:22.850> hair<00:04:23.090> for<00:04:23.300> one

the<00:04:31.580> flyaways<00:04:31.789> a<00:04:32.060> tiny<00:04:32.450> bit<00:04:33.639> go<00:04:34.639> through<00:04:34.910> the

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
the flyaways a tiny bit go through the

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:43.470 
the flyaways a tiny bit go through the
loop<00:04:35.210> like<00:04:38.169> so

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:50.250 

time<00:04:44.080> you<00:04:44.200> tell<00:04:44.380> you<00:04:44.440> likey<00:04:46.770> okay<00:04:49.080> I'm<00:04:50.080> going
