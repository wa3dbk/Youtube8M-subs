you so what I'm gonna do is take a
little<00:00:48.149> bit<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.450> lash<00:00:49.170> glue<00:00:49.469> then<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.280> grab<00:00:50.520> the

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
glue you want to make sure to get the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.279 
glue you want to make sure to get the
entire<00:00:58.649> band<00:00:59.219> covered<00:00:59.760> in<00:00:59.879> glue<00:01:00.289> especially

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
entire band covered in glue especially

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.689 
entire band covered in glue especially
the<00:01:01.410> ends<00:01:01.770> because<00:01:02.010> they<00:01:02.160> tend<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.489> come<00:01:02.670> off

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
the ends because they tend to come off

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.109 
the ends because they tend to come off
sometimes<00:01:03.329> if<00:01:03.780> they're<00:01:03.989> not<00:01:04.170> fully<00:01:05.119> covered

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
sometimes if they're not fully covered

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.740 
sometimes if they're not fully covered
in<00:01:06.299> glue<00:01:07.010> then<00:01:08.010> what<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.250> want<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.430> do<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.850> kind

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
in glue then what you want to do is kind

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.450 
in glue then what you want to do is kind
of<00:01:09.869> gaze<00:01:10.110> down<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.830> if<00:01:10.890> you're<00:01:11.040> doing<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.310> at

of gaze down and if you're doing this at
home<00:01:11.580> instead<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.119> gazing<00:01:12.540> down<00:01:12.780> tip<00:01:13.439> your

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
home instead of gazing down tip your

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.200 
home instead of gazing down tip your
head<00:01:13.770> back<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.220> then<00:01:14.400> look<00:01:14.580> down<00:01:14.610> at<00:01:14.909> yourself

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
head back and then look down at yourself

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.370 
head back and then look down at yourself
in<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.360> mirror<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.810> way<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.020> can<00:01:16.200> see

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
in the mirror and that way you can see

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.109 
in the mirror and that way you can see
everything<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:17.159> want<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.369> put<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.670> middle<00:01:17.939> on

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
everything you want to put the middle on

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.090 
everything you want to put the middle on
first<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.840> get<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:18.990> placement<00:01:19.350> correct<00:01:19.830> and

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
first you get the placement correct and

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.300 
first you get the placement correct and
then<00:01:20.759> go<00:01:21.060> ahead<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.659> tuck<00:01:21.930> each<00:01:22.200> end<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.890> then

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
then go ahead and tuck each end and then

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.719 
then go ahead and tuck each end and then
let<00:01:23.520> go

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
let go

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.820 
let go
the<00:01:24.210> trick<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.600> letting<00:01:24.990> go<00:01:25.020> as<00:01:25.380> fast<00:01:25.560> as<00:01:25.740> you

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
the trick is letting go as fast as you

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.550 
the trick is letting go as fast as you
can<00:01:26.070> if<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.850> kind<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.479> hold<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.930> there<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.409> can

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
can if you kind of hold it there you can

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.969 
can if you kind of hold it there you can
lose<00:01:28.740> your<00:01:28.920> way<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.850> then<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.420> go<00:01:30.570> back<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:31.110> I

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
lose your way and then I go back and I

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.670 
lose your way and then I go back and I
kind<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.400> mush<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.759> around<00:01:33.290> because<00:01:34.290> right<00:01:34.500> now

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
kind of mush it around because right now

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.469 
kind of mush it around because right now
the<00:01:34.740> glue<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.189> already<00:01:35.610> starting<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.060> dry<00:01:36.240> so

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
the glue is already starting to dry so

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.600 
the glue is already starting to dry so
as<00:01:36.630> it's<00:01:36.840> drying<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.829> want<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.070> keep<00:01:38.220> pushing

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.640 
as it's drying you want to keep pushing
it<00:01:38.700> into<00:01:38.880> place<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.960> can<00:01:39.990> do<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.290> with<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
it into place you can do that with the

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.160 
it into place you can do that with the
with<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.280> tweezer<00:01:41.729> or<00:01:42.119> sometimes<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.869> go<00:01:42.990> back

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
with the tweezer or sometimes I go back

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.830 
with the tweezer or sometimes I go back
in<00:01:43.320> with<00:01:43.380> my<00:01:43.530> fingertip<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:45.360> just<00:01:45.570> kind<00:01:45.780> of

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
in with my fingertip and I just kind of

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.600
