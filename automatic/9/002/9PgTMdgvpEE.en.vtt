 and the case that is the main responsible for the formation of teeth and bones 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.920
 may be absent at the former president's table either as milk itself or 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.279
 milk derivatives 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.710
 here in the first leg in Russia they press sugar did they chose 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.669
 milk production and today we will show a little of the production chain 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:30.509
 of milk 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:35.120
 and speaking a little at that moment of the automatic order and that today uses more 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.039
 until some time ago it was not like this was made annual order and we are going to 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:42.039
 car proposition 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.030
 in the mato grosso 90% of milk production suspected of family farming 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.050
 positive factor in the economic growth of the state and city of 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.710
 lucas do rio verde 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.900
 a food important for the consumption of the whole family 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.500
 that besides being inserted 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.030
 It's made products like ricotta butter 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.650
 Dilma said the issue is a big day 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.950
 and different types of cheeses 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.490
 to facilitate and streamline the work 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.880
 many civilian functional producers 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.670
 use of the automatic order 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.680
 March some time ago was not the way to get elected 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.210
 yes, the manual milking 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.170
 still had been in small properties 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.520
 igor with milk management was required by law 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.310
 to ensure the health of consumers 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.850
 so working thinking the economics 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.280
 little satisfied with the bet 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.329
 I can work 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.219
 because a production refrain 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:49.060
 in yield 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.310
 but I do not 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.360
 not the best, but it's fine after you've removed the stored milk 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.600
 hour of transportation and then released food for milk industry 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.240
 It is in dairy that occur in the different technical processes that 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.399
 prepare the milk and derivatives which are then seized and checked after 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:10.959
 go through an internal process 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:11.839
 no heating 

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:16.889
 besides commercializing bakeries and supermarkets and grocery stores here 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:19.339
 consumer finds the product ready 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:22.359
 other side packed for better song 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:25.359

 for its effectiveness in preventing diseases such as rickets and being stopped 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:39.040
 a product that gains space in the supermarket shelves and is made 

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:42.039
 present at the table of Brazilians not so much 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:44.349
 is a law that contains 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.009
 still Saturday 

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:50.899
