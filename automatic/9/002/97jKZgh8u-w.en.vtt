careful what she does with that
knowledge<00:01:33.920> because<00:01:34.579> I<00:01:34.670> think<00:01:34.729> if<00:01:34.939> she<00:01:34.969> begins

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360

right and Carly thinks that Peter would
never<00:02:47.780> do<00:02:48.019> that<00:02:48.049> but<00:02:48.500> maybe<00:02:48.739> I<00:02:48.859> don't<00:02:48.950> think

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
never do that but maybe I don't think

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.710 
never do that but maybe I don't think
Peter<00:02:49.370> ever<00:02:49.519> would<00:02:49.700> do<00:02:49.819> he<00:02:50.090> wouldn't<00:02:50.600> do<00:02:50.690> that

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
he wouldn't do that but makes me think

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.750

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
for everything because there are

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:08.770 
for everything because there are
definitely<00:05:08.120> lot<00:05:08.240> of<00:05:08.330> villains<00:05:08.630> who<00:05:08.720> were

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:00.040 
said even even in that first issue where

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.950 
said even even in that first issue where
he<00:06:00.370> was<00:06:00.970> stopped<00:06:01.240> from<00:06:01.389> killing<00:06:01.750> the<00:06:01.840> new

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.300 
Sinister Six member he goes mom what it
stopped<00:06:04.270> me<00:06:04.480> so<00:06:04.960> I<00:06:04.990> think<00:06:05.110> like<00:06:05.980> a<00:06:06.040> whole

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
stopped me so I think like a whole

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.760 
stopped me so I think like a whole
nother<00:06:06.460> plot<00:06:06.790> line<00:06:06.970> is<00:06:07.090> going<00:06:07.240> to<00:06:07.300> be<00:06:07.530> Doc<00:06:08.530> Ock

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
nother plot line is going to be Doc Ock

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.560 
nother plot line is going to be Doc Ock
is<00:06:09.040> going<00:06:09.220> to<00:06:09.280> start<00:06:09.639> to<00:06:09.700> figure<00:06:10.030> out<00:06:10.210> that

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570 
is going to start to figure out that

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.659 
is going to start to figure out that
there's<00:06:10.930> a<00:06:10.990> no<00:06:11.560> Peter<00:06:11.770> Parker<00:06:12.130> inside<00:06:12.430> of<00:06:12.550> them

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:12.669 
there's a no Peter Parker inside of them

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:15.510 
there's a no Peter Parker inside of them
if<00:06:12.850> that<00:06:13.750> becomes<00:06:14.139> the<00:06:14.410> case<00:06:14.500> I<00:06:14.889> think<00:06:15.100> because

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
if that becomes the case I think because

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.190 
if that becomes the case I think because
that<00:06:15.850> person<00:06:16.060> will<00:06:16.270> want<00:06:16.480> to<00:06:16.540> just<00:06:16.720> expunge

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.200 
that person will want to just expunge

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.900 
that person will want to just expunge
any<00:06:17.410> sort<00:06:17.680> of<00:06:17.770> thing<00:06:17.889> that<00:06:18.010> isn't<00:06:18.190> him<00:06:18.490> inside

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:18.910 
any sort of thing that isn't him inside

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.879 
any sort of thing that isn't him inside
of<00:06:19.060> him<00:06:19.180> right<00:06:19.480> so<00:06:19.990> I<00:06:20.350> think<00:06:20.440> that's<00:06:20.650> going<00:06:20.830> to

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:20.889 
of him right so I think that's going to

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:22.200 
of him right so I think that's going to
be<00:06:21.040> where<00:06:21.220> there's<00:06:21.520> going<00:06:21.700> to<00:06:21.760> be<00:06:21.790> a<00:06:21.880> final

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
be where there's going to be a final

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.060 
be where there's going to be a final
confrontation<00:06:22.389> between<00:06:22.990> ghost<00:06:23.350> Peter<00:06:23.680> and

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.070 
confrontation between ghost Peter and

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.550 
confrontation between ghost Peter and
butt<00:06:24.790> haha<00:06:25.030> probably<00:06:25.360> in<00:06:25.510> his<00:06:25.600> mind<00:06:25.930> and<00:06:26.229> then

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 
butt haha probably in his mind and then

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.830 
butt haha probably in his mind and then
I<00:06:26.889> wonder<00:06:27.250> if<00:06:27.370> ghost<00:06:28.060> beaters<00:06:28.389> going<00:06:28.570> to<00:06:28.630> come

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
I wonder if ghost beaters going to come

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.570 
I wonder if ghost beaters going to come
out<00:06:28.990> and<00:06:29.139> become<00:06:29.470> a<00:06:29.500> realization<00:06:30.160> Peter<00:06:30.430> in

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
out and become a realization Peter in

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.820 
out and become a realization Peter in
some<00:06:30.760> way<00:06:30.910> and<00:06:31.350> then<00:06:32.350> it's<00:06:32.530> going<00:06:32.620> to<00:06:32.680> be<00:06:32.800> a

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
some way and then it's going to be a

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.280 
some way and then it's going to be a
slow<00:06:33.639> progression<00:06:33.790> towards<00:06:34.330> gaining<00:06:34.570> the

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:35.290 
slow progression towards gaining the

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.379 
slow progression towards gaining the
right<00:06:35.470> body<00:06:35.650> back<00:06:35.950> i<00:06:36.100> don't<00:06:36.280> know<00:06:36.370> i<00:06:36.550> think

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:37.389 
right body back i don't know i think

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:38.820 
right body back i don't know i think
that's<00:06:37.750> a<00:06:37.840> long<00:06:37.960> ways<00:06:38.139> down<00:06:38.169> the<00:06:38.350> road<00:06:38.440> it

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830 
that's a long ways down the road it

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.360 
that's a long ways down the road it
probably<00:06:39.460> is<00:06:39.550> it<00:06:39.970> probably<00:06:40.510> is<00:06:41.220> so<00:06:42.220> it's<00:06:42.310> a

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:42.370 
probably is it probably is so it's a

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.460 
probably is it probably is so it's a
great<00:06:42.490> for<00:06:42.850> this<00:06:42.940> issue<00:06:43.180> of<00:06:43.630> spirits<00:06:44.169> primary
