 sponsorship boots malacara and cabanha do 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.030
 Genetic testing proved the first 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.040
 thing to start making moves 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.800
 have to have a horse with the 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.930
 mouth with luca is not positioning and 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.329
 never with your foot under your belly because 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.430
 this is the right position that he 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.649
 He's going to have the strength to do that. 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.989
 movement is spread there that the 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.120
 You call that which has delayed and 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.280
 no he is not spread he has not 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.590
 There's a union, I can make a move. 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.920
 before circular movement always with 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.230
 calm assembled in shama met truck 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.150
 with horse already well positioned denit 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.770
 shows you how to start 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.870
 basically is to circle movement 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.380
 front always teaching horse in 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:15.020
 circles perfect circles well 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.730
 made and the horse the rotary movement 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.220
 forward always remembering that the 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.740
 time front and have to learn 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.830
 lengthen the forelimbs it has 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.670
 that elongates transpasses slowly and always 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.770
 slowly 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.320
 the slower but what I learned 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.229
 the faster you try - which 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.920
 I learned, learning has to be slow. 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.930
 is to pierce hand once after two 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.479
 times three times until a 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.970
 complete circle and then pass and two 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.850
 circles or three circles is not 33 turns 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.400
 in the red gyration indicates the muzzle whom 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.130
 commands the network outside not primarily 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.170
 for our proof that it is always is and is 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.880
 worked with one hand only then always the 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.690
 horse has to be oriented with the net 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.910
 out 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.360
 aft out that sends the command to 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.360
 inside the channel 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.250
 Marcelo says the secret is to transfer the 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:10.070
 weight of the animal back so far ahead 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.690
 of the horse is light which makes it easy to turn 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.390
 with speed 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.120
 other detail the very loose network must 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.400
 be avoided for example if the face arrives 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.890
 there and decided to summon the rookie rookie 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.560
 horses what happens to grandma and 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:28.250
 transfers weight forward it starts 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.930
 so it is all in the horse's hand and 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.610
 transfers weight forward it will 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.760
 spin slow 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.920
 the horse of São Paulo it turns fast the 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.560
 neck down but what they do 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.220
 transfers all that it requires the whole day with 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.550
 they collected just downloaded fifa 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.910
 even behind important weight that the 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.160
 protector appears picking up the third floor 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:03:01.340
 now that she lived in the teacher's peninsula 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:03:05.930
 it was there that she presented a new goal and 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:08.840
 personal clothing caused the weight up there 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.350
 behind her and she gets faster to 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.290
 front source 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.170
 between so many tips marcelo points out the 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.280
 more important is to respect the 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.350
 animal 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.470
 the new mofatto horse that is 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.480
 learning eliton web elimar eia 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.590
 when he is making a circle then it is 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.200
 Then you have to have time to ride him. 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.740
 will come without being prepared yet whole 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:38.250
 a nanny the ready basics he can take 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:41.180
 So many people see us demanding a 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.530
 too little of the horse and this causes 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.030
 trauma or of which there is more 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.030
 take time to turn
