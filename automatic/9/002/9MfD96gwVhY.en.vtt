00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
bars has been changed apples change the

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.740 
bars has been changed apples change the
algorithm<00:01:08.470> used<00:01:08.890> to<00:01:09.010> measure<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:10.090> bars<00:01:10.360> and

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
algorithm used to measure the bars and

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.270 
algorithm used to measure the bars and
apparently<00:01:11.140> for<00:01:11.290> the<00:01:11.350> past<00:01:11.590> three<00:01:11.830> years<00:01:11.860> and

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
apparently for the past three years and

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.149 
apparently for the past three years and
the<00:01:12.549> signal<00:01:13.150> readings<00:01:13.450> have<00:01:13.690> been<00:01:13.750> off<00:01:14.200> so

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
the signal readings have been off so

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:16.560 
the signal readings have been off so
we've<00:01:15.280> been<00:01:15.430> getting<00:01:15.549> the<00:01:15.790> wrong<00:01:15.970> signal<00:01:16.420> for

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
we've been getting the wrong signal for

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.810 
we've been getting the wrong signal for
the<00:01:16.630> past<00:01:16.840> three<00:01:17.080> years<00:01:17.290> so<00:01:17.979> Apple<00:01:18.310> fix<00:01:18.580> that

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
the past three years so Apple fix that

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.510 
the past three years so Apple fix that
of<00:01:19.060> course<00:01:19.659> the<00:01:19.869> signal<00:01:20.290> strength<00:01:20.440> the<00:01:21.280> death

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
of course the signal strength the death

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.730 
of course the signal strength the death
grip<00:01:21.729> was<00:01:21.970> not<00:01:22.150> fixed<00:01:22.600> which<00:01:22.780> is<00:01:22.990> kind<00:01:23.590> of

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
grip was not fixed which is kind of

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.620 
grip was not fixed which is kind of
obvious<00:01:23.920> none<00:01:24.580> of<00:01:24.610> us<00:01:24.790> really<00:01:25.060> expected<00:01:25.510> that

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
obvious none of us really expected that

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.820 
obvious none of us really expected that
to<00:01:25.659> happen<00:01:25.780> so<00:01:27.299> don't<00:01:28.299> update<00:01:28.780> all<00:01:29.260> that's<00:01:29.530> and

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
to happen so don't update all that's and

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.550 
to happen so don't update all that's and
by<00:01:30.729> the<00:01:30.760> way<00:01:30.880> there's<00:01:31.119> a<00:01:31.180> new<00:01:31.330> baseband<00:01:31.780> in<00:01:32.020> 4.1

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
by the way there's a new baseband in 4.1

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.450 
by the way there's a new baseband in 4.1
beta<00:01:32.920> it<00:01:33.189> is<00:01:33.400> 0<00:01:33.700> 2<00:01:33.760> point<00:01:34.330> 0<00:01:34.479> 7<00:01:34.900> point<00:01:35.200> 0<00:01:35.790> 1<00:01:37.380> yeah

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
beta it is 0 2 point 0 7 point 0 1 yeah

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.980 
beta it is 0 2 point 0 7 point 0 1 yeah
something<00:01:39.460> like<00:01:39.549> that<00:01:39.640> pretty<00:01:40.630> sure<00:01:40.780> it's<00:01:40.900> it

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
something like that pretty sure it's it

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.190 
something like that pretty sure it's it
but<00:01:41.619> uh<00:01:41.650> and<00:01:42.010> then<00:01:42.310> there<00:01:43.000> is<00:01:43.150> no<00:01:43.420> baseband

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
but uh and then there is no baseband

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.810 
but uh and then there is no baseband
update<00:01:44.500> in<00:01:44.680> the<00:01:44.710> four<00:01:45.070> point<00:01:45.310> no<00:01:45.400> point<00:01:45.430> 1

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.870 
make sense but what doesn't make sense
but<00:03:45.800> it's<00:03:46.010> not<00:03:46.100> something<00:03:46.280> Apple<00:03:46.550> to<00:03:46.610> do<00:03:46.760> we

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
but it's not something Apple to do we

possibly<00:03:51.050> free<00:03:51.380> bumper<00:03:51.740> cases<00:03:51.950> which<00:03:52.910> would

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
possibly free bumper cases which would

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:54.850 
possibly free bumper cases which would
be<00:03:53.750> a<00:03:53.780> lot<00:03:53.959> of<00:03:54.080> money<00:03:54.140> for<00:03:54.410> them<00:03:54.560> but<00:03:54.770> it's

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
be a lot of money for them but it's

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.070 
be a lot of money for them but it's
better<00:03:55.010> than<00:03:55.100> a<00:03:55.220> whole<00:03:55.400> recall<00:03:55.870> doesn't<00:03:56.870> seem

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
better than a whole recall doesn't seem

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.510 
better than a whole recall doesn't seem
like<00:03:57.230> something<00:03:57.500> Apple<00:03:58.070> would<00:03:58.190> do<00:03:58.370> but

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 
like something Apple would do but

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.820 
like something Apple would do but
they've<00:03:58.670> done<00:03:58.820> in<00:03:58.940> the<00:03:59.030> past<00:03:59.090> so<00:03:59.540> we'll<00:03:59.780> see<00:04:00.020> so

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
they've done in the past so we'll see so

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.060 
they've done in the past so we'll see so
possibly<00:04:01.310> free<00:04:01.580> bumpers<00:04:02.030> so<00:04:02.800> we'll<00:04:03.800> see<00:04:03.950> what

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
possibly free bumpers so we'll see what
